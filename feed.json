      "Hollywood's biggest stars are heading to Venice, Italy, for the 82nd Venice Film Festival",
      "VENICE, Italy -- Some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars are heading to Venice, Italy, for the 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival, which kicks off on Wednesday.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of everything you need to know about the festival, the Oscar buzz and who\u2019s going.",
      "It\u2019s one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world, second only to Cannes, and technically the oldest. Venice is also a reliably starry affair, gathering some of the best films in international cinema and often factoring into the Oscars race.",
      "The film festival was established in 1932, then a non-competitive event, by the La Biennale di Venezia, hosting films like \u201cGrand Hotel\u201d and \u201cIt Happened One Night.\u201d By 1935, they decided to make it an annual event. Suspicions that the festival was succumbing to fascist influences actually led to the establishment of the Cannes Film Festival, as an alternative, after the 1938 edition.",
      "The Golden Lion award as we know it today wouldn\u2019t be introduced until 1949 (\u201cRash\u00f4mon\u201d won in 1951). Other winners throughout history include \u201cBelle de jour\u201d (1967), \u201cAu revoir les enfants\u201d (1987), \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d (2005), \u201cSomewhere\u201d (2010), \u201cPoor Things\u201d (2023) and, last year, \u201cThe Room Next Door.\u201d",
      "The festival kicks off on Wednesday and runs through Sept. 6, when the awards will be announced. The opening night film is Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s \u201cLa Grazia.\u201d",
      "Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Emma Stone, Dwayne Johnson, Adam Sandler and Idris Elba are among the stars expected to grace the red carpets this year. It\u2019ll be the first time at the festival for both Roberts, starring in the #MeToo-themed drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d and Johnson, who transformed for his role as MMA fighter Mark Kerr in \u201cThe Smashing Machine.\u201d",
      "Other stars in the lineup include Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Jesse Plemons, Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Andrew Garfield, Ayo Edebiri, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Colman Domingo, Amanda Seyfried, Callum Turner and Jude Law. Lifetime achievement award recipients this year include \u201cVertigo\u201d star Kim Novak and filmmaker Werner Herzog.",
      "After taking a year off, Netflix, still on the hunt for a best picture win, is back in full force with three major films in the main competition: Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s political thriller \u201cA House of Dynamite,\u201d and Noah Baumbach\u2019s comedic drama \u201cJay Kelly.\u201d Also in competition are: Kaouther ben Hania\u2019s \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d; Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 \u201cBugonia,\u201d with Emma Stone; Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d; Jim Jarmusch\u2019s anthology film \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d; Mona Fastvold\u2019s musical about the Shakers, \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee\u201d; Park Chan-wook\u2019s \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d; and Olivier Assayas\u2019s \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin.\u201d",
      "The buzz is strong for several out-of-competition films too, like Luca Guadagnino\u2019s \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d Julian Schnabel\u2019s \u201cIn the Hand of Dante\u201d and Sofia Coppola\u2019s Marc Jacobs documentary \u201cMarc by Sofia.\u201d",
      "Festival director Alberto Barbera thinks Venice\u2019s place in the Oscar race was solidified in 2012, when they hosted the premiere of \u201cGravity,\u201d which went on to win a leading seven Oscars that March and established Venice as a place to launch a campaign. It\u2019s only intensified as the membership of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has gotten more international. Since 2014, they\u2019ve hosted four best picture winners (\u201cBirdman,\u201d \u201cSpotlight,\u201d \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d and \u201cNomadland\u201d).",

      "A military outpost in the 12th century, it transformed into a seaside resort, a favorite of European aristocrats, by the end of the 19th.",
      "On the Lido, the only five-star hotel is the Hotel Excelsior, which dates back to 1908 and is where Quentin Tarantino has stayed. But rooms go quickly, and there are so many luxury hotels on the different islands that offer a bit more privacy, away from the frenzy of the festival and photographers.",
      "Perhaps the most famous of the bunch is the Belmond Hotel Cipriani, on Giudecca, home of one of Clooney\u2019s favorite bars. There\u2019s the Hotel Danieli, which has been featured in films like \u201cMoonraker\u201d and \u201cCasino Royale,\u201d and regularly hosts kickoff parties for the festival. Another favorite is the Gritti Palace, where everyone from Brad Pitt to Elizabeth Taylor has stayed. There\u2019s also a St. Regis and the Aman Venice, where George and Amal Clooney were married.",
      "The scattered hotels are also the reason you see so many celebrities photographed on the Excelsior docks: They arrive to the festival, including press conferences and premieres, by private water taxi. Sometimes, they\u2019re transported a very short distance from the Excelsior to the red carpet in cars. Unlike the main island of Venice, vehicles are allowed on the Lido, including buses and private cars. But many festivalgoers prefer to rent a bike to get around.",

      "It started with a friendship bracelet",
      "NEW YORK -- It started with a friendship bracelet. It ended with an engagement ring. Taylor Swift, the pop superstar, and Travis Kelce, the football champion, are engaged.",
      "The fiances, both 35, announced the news in a joint post on Instagram on Tuesday. It is the latest chapter in the couple's love story, one that has spanned two years, two Super Bowls, an album announcement and the highest-grossing tour of all time.",
      "Here is a look at some of the major events in their relationship.",
      "It started, fittingly, with a friendship bracelet.",
      "It was way back in July 2023 that Kelce attended Swift\u2019s Eras concert at Arrowhead Stadium, where the Chiefs play.",
      "After, on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast with brother Jason Kelce, he professed to being disappointed \u2014 well, his word was \u201cbutthurt\u201d \u2014 that he couldn\u2019t meet Swift and present her with a bracelet with his phone number on it.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t meet anybody, or at least she didn\u2019t want to meet me, so I took it personal,\u201d he quipped. The podcast asked on Instagram: \u201cAnyone know how to get a bracelet to @taylorswift13? \u2026 asking for a friend.\u201d",
      "But by that September, Kelce was hinting his efforts had achieved some success. He declined to elaborate amid speculation, telling an interviewer: \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d",
      "Clearly, though, something was happening. Soon, Kelce revealed he\u2019d invited Swift to a game at Arrowhead. \u201cI threw the ball in her court,\u201d he said on another talk show.",
      "Swift took Kelce up on his offer, appearing for all the world to see at the Chiefs-Bears game, cheering next to his mom, Donna Kelce. The two left the stadium in Kelce\u2019s purple Chevelle \u201cgetaway car\u201d \u2014 forgive the pun, but Kelce himself used it.",
      "\u201cPretty ballsy,\u201d Kelce said a few days later of Swift\u2019s appearance, adding how much he loved seeing her cheer next to his mother.",
      "It was the launch of a long series of appearances by Swift at Chiefs games. There was some online angst over whether Swift was distracting from football \u2014 while the NFL itself capitalized on her fandom. A day after the flashy Los Angeles premiere of her \u201cTaylor Swift: Eras Tour\u201d movie, she was back at Arrowhead.",
      "And now it was time for Kelce to be the adoring fan. In November 2023, after a hiatus of two months, Swift brought her tour to Argentina, where she changed the lyrics of \u201cKarma\u201d to salute her beau. \u201cKarma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,\u201d she sang. Scott Swift, next to a beaming Kelce, applauded his daughter\u2019s new flame.",
      "When Time magazine announced its person of the year, few were surprised. In the Time interview, Swift spoke about her relationship.",
      "\u201cThis all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\u201d Swift said, adding that they\u2019d already been a couple before that first Chiefs game cameo.",
      "Soon after, things were heating up on the football field \u2014 meaning the Chiefs were heading to the Super Bowl. At the AFC championship game, the couple made it clear they were fine with whatever attention was coming their way. In the middle of the field in Baltimore, after the Chiefs beat the Ravens, Swift and Kelce kissed. \u201cI love you,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cSo much it\u2019s not funny.\u201d",
      "There was one game left. Fans wondered: How would Swift make it from her Tokyo shows to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas?",
      "\u201cThis week is truly the best kind of chaos,\u201d Swift posted on Instagram.",
      "Chaos indeed. In one week of February 2024, Swift attended the Grammys in Los Angeles, jetted to Tokyo for four concerts, then jumped back onto her private plane to make the Super Bowl with time to spare. To get there, she crossed nine time zones and the international dateline.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s rewriting the history books herself,\u201d Kelce said a day after the Grammys, where Swift had won album of the year for a record fourth time. \u201cI told her I\u2019ll have to hold up my end of the bargain and come home with hardware, too.\u201d",
      "And he did. The two kissed on the field again after the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers, Swift in her \u201c87\u201d necklace.",

      "But the highlight came in June, during a celebrity-packed set of concerts in London. There, Kelce made his Eras stage debut, donning a tuxedo and top hat and carrying Swift in his arms during a choreographed bit before \u201cI Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still cracking up/swooning,\u201d Swift wrote later on Instagram.",

      "They were then spotted at Brooklyn Bowl in Nashville, where Swift hopped on stage to perform \u201cShake it Off\u201d with country singer Kane Brown. For fans, it marked yet another moment of the couple showing very public support and admiration for one another.",
      "A couple that collaborates together, stays together.",
      "Swift announced her highly anticipated 12th studio album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d in mid-August and included Kelce in the rollout. It began with a tease from \u201cNew Heights,\u201d which later revealed Swift would appear in an episode the following day.",

      "Jeremy Allen White grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeremy Allen White grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen. He doesn\u2019t even remember a time in his life when he wasn\u2019t aware of his music. But sing his songs? It wasn\u2019t until White began preparing to play the rock \u2019n' roll legend for \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\u201d that he even tried.",
      "\u201cI had never really sang anything, never mind Bruce,\u201d White says. \u201cThere was a leap of faith that we were all taking.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s an established playbook for music biopics. \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d ignored all of it. The film, written and directed by Scott Cooper (\u201cCrazy Heart,\u201d \u201cBlack Mass\u201d), eschews the standard life-spanning, play-the-hits approach and instead focuses on a small portion of Springsteen\u2019s sprawling life: the making of his 1982 album, \u201cNebraska.\u201d",
      "The album, a minimalist masterpiece recorded on a four track in Springsteen\u2019s bedroom in Colts Neck, New Jersey, doesn\u2019t lend itself to anything like a glossy big-screen jukebox. \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d instead, is aimed more at the soul of Springsteen. For the role, Cooper turned to who he considers one of the best actors of his generation \u2014 even though he had no singing experience.",
      "\u201cI remember early on speaking to Scott about the project and being really excited to do it with him but also telling him, \u2018Hey, I don\u2019t know how to play the guitar and I\u2019ve never really sang before. Are we going to be able to figure out this together?\u2019\u201d White recalls. \u201cBut Scott had faith. And Bruce had faith. And we trusted each other.\u201d",
      "\u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d which 20th Century Studios will release Oct. 24 in theaters, is the first movie based on Springsteen\u2019s life. It was made with Springsteen\u2019s involvement; he gave input to on the script, on casting and attended several days on set. It\u2019s also the first leading movie role for White, the 34-year-old Emmy-winning star of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d who sings all the songs in the film.",
      "\u201cI knew that he had the two qualities that really embody Bruce: humility and swagger,\u201d Scott says. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t teach swagger at Julliard. You either have it or you don\u2019t. I was never concerned. He\u2019s sensational.\u201d",
      "\u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d based on Warren Zanes\u2019 2023 book, co-stars Jeremy Strong as Jon Landau, Springsteen\u2019s longtime manager and record producer. Landau was also involved in the project from its inception.",
      "\u201cI knew that this was the first time Bruce had handed the wheel over to anybody to tell a story of his,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThey were never directors in any way but were always there when I had a question. Of course, when you\u2019re Jeremy Allen White and you have Bruce Springsteen show up, that\u2019s a whole different story.\u201d",
      "For White, Springsteen was a great resource in a movie that aspired to authentic interiority. \u201cNebraska\u201d was a major departure for Springsteen. Its 10 songs spun tales of blue-collar workers soaked through with Springsteen\u2019s own childhood memories and reverberating with an American storytelling tradition running from Flannery O\u2019Connor to Woody Guthrie. Springsteen intended the raw demos to be later recorded with the E Street Band, but ultimately decided to release the unvarnished recordings.",
      "White sees the film, in part, as about the artistic process.",
      "\u201cHe was drawing inspiration from all these places but he didn\u2019t really know what he was doing for a while with this record,\u201d White says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know if it was going to be a record. As an actor, hopefully you\u2019re doing that sort of thing all the time. That artistic curiosity is something I related to.\u201d",
      "White first spent time with Springsteen in London, where he also attended a concert. The actor later spoke to Patti Scialfa, Springsteen's bandmate and wife of 34 years, and friends of the rock legend. After peppering Springsteen with questions during preproduction in New Jersey, White says he mostly kept his head down during the shoot.",

      "\u201cBruce is very gracious,\u201d White says. \u201cHe was trying to make himself as small as possible on set, but that\u2019s very difficult for Bruce Springsteen.\u201d",
      "The challenge musically was considerable. To prepare, White worked with vocal coach Eric Vetro (who a also trained Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d ), guitar instructor J.D. Simo and music supervisor Dave Cobb. For White, a turning point came when they went to RCA in Nashville to record most of the songs over a 48-hour period.",
      "\u201cI feel like that\u2019s where I found my confidence,\u201d White says. \u201cI\u2019m in this recording studio. It\u2019s a very large room, you\u2019re kind of by yourself. And I got to sing Bruce\u2019s songs over and over again. I remember feeling closer and closer to the man.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cAtlantic City\u201d was initially the song White gravitated toward, the one that ended up striking a chord was \u201cMy Father\u2019s House,\u201d one of Springsteen\u2019s most stirring and plaintive ballads.",
      "\u201cI remember each time singing that song and understanding it more thoroughly,\u201d says White. \u201cLearning something new each time, just going deeper each time.\u201d",
      "\u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d will arrive at a time when Springsteen has ratcheted up his criticism of President Donald Trump. At a concert in May, Springsteen told the audience: \u201cThe America I love, the America I\u2019ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\u201d Trump responded by calling Springsteen \u201cnot a talented guy \u2014 just a pushy, obnoxious jerk.\u201d",
      "Cooper and White have a much different impression from their time with Springsteen.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if a lot of people with his level of success and notoriety and fame, a public person decade after decade, can remain so in touch and available and honest with people day after day,\u201d White says. \u201cWhat was important to him remains his art, yes, but it\u2019s his family and Patti. All of his morals are right in line \u2014 what I consider to be right in line.\u201d",
      "Says Cooper: \u201cBruce isn\u2019t just a musician. He\u2019s the symbol of something that\u2019s uniquely American. The blue-collar poet. The reluctant moral conscience. I think to make a film about Bruce is to make a film about America\u2019s soul. The power of that lies in his emotional honesty and his work resonates across all political lines because he tells the truth.\u201d",
      "Cooper wasn\u2019t just speaking theoretically. Making \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d coincided with multiple tragedies for the director. His father died the day before shooting began. During the last week of production, he lost his house in the Palisades fire in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cJeremy and Bruce and a really wonderful crew and cast of actors lifted me up and carried me through to the finish line,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cWhen we didn\u2019t have a place to live, Bruce moved my family into his place in Los Angeles. And Jeremy was there on some of my darkest days. The movie, for me, has a particular resonance.\u201d",

      "Katy Perry has testified during a Los Angeles trial that she's seeking justice in a legal battle over a California mansion",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A lawyer asked Katy Perry on Tuesday whether she stood to gain money or anything else from a trial in a long legal fight over a California mansion.",
      "\u201cJustice\u201d was the one-word answer from the singing superstar, former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d judge and recent astronaut, part of an hour of remote testimony she gave in a Los Angeles courtroom.",
      "In her tense, careful testimony, Perry wouldn't concede directly that she stood to gain money if she won, but did say, \u201cI stand to lose money if it doesn\u2019t work in my favor.\u201d",
      "She spoke during the second trial in a dispute over a $15 million mansion in upscale Montecito near Santa Barbara that she and former partner Orlando Bloom bought in 2020.",
      "The seller, 85-year-old Carl Westcott, said he was not mentally competent to make the deal and sued to undo it.",
      "Perry's side \u2014 technically the defendant was her business manager, Bernie Gudvi \u2014 prevailed in the first trial in 2023. Then Gudvi, representing Perry, countersued over lost rental income brought on by the legal fight and millions in maintenance the house allegedly required. That brought on the current sequel trial.",
      "Westcott's lawyer, Andrew J. Thomas, often tried to steer the conversation toward Bloom. Superior Court Judge Joseph Lipner ruled that the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d actor does not have to testify because it would be redundant and unnecessary, even though the house is officially owned by a company he set up.",
      "Asked if she had any role in a remodel of the house Bloom oversaw, Perry replied that she acted as \u201cpartner and adviser.\u201d",
      "The couple, who split up in July, have a daughter together whose fifth birthday was Tuesday.",
      "When asked about the nature of their partnership, Perry replied, \u201cWe're family for life.\u201d",
      "Perry's attorney, Eric Rowen, objected to nearly every question by Thomas as irrelevant, including most of the queries about Bloom, which Lipner kept to a minimum.",
      "Rowen objected especially angrily when Perry was asked if she knew that Westcott had entered a mental institution earlier in the legal fight, apparently suggesting the question was an attack for the sake of the media present.",
      "\u201cThis is, I don\u2019t want to say unethical, but this is simply an effort to drive a narrative to parties outside this courtroom,\" Rowen said. The judge sustained his objection and the question was not allowed.",

      "Thomas asked Perry repeatedly whether she had had enough cash on hand to buy the $15 million mansion outright.",
      "\u201cI could have,\" she eventually said, \"but I wanted to do a mortgage instead.\u201d",
      "Perry conceded that in the previous trial, she said she intended to live in the mansion, not to rent it out. But renters including the family of actor Chris Pratt are central to this trial. There was discussion of having Pratt testify, but he was not on the final witness list.",
      "There was one light moment at the end of Perry's testimony when she described some dealings with Westcott and said, \u201cI was pregnant at the time.\u201d",
      "She couldn't be heard clearly and Lipner said he had heard, \u201cIt was private.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo, pregnant!\u201d Perry said with a laugh.",
      "Perry's own lawyer declined to cross-examine her and the judge excused her.",
      "Like the previous trial, this one has no jury, and Lipner will decide the outcome. Perry's testimony came on the fourth day of proceedings that are expected to go on for two more days.",
      "It's not the first long public fight Perry has had over a property. She previously sparred in court with an order of nuns who fought to stop the sale of a convent she had bought. She prevailed in that case.",
      "She also testified in a lawsuit that alleged she and her co-writers had stolen key elements of her hit song \u201cDark Horse\u201d from a Christian musician. She lost at trial, but won on appeal.",

      "James Cameron first began developing \u201cAvatar\u201d more than 30 years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 James Cameron recently turned 71 as he brought his third \u201cAvatar\u201d film, \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d to the finish line.",
      "Cameron first began developing \u201cAvatar\u201d more than 30 years ago. He started working on the first film in earnest 20 years ago. Production on \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d which ran concurrently with 2022's \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d got underway eight years ago.",
      "By any measure, \u201cAvatar\u201d is one of the largest undertakings ever by a filmmaker. It's maybe the only project that could make \u201cTitanic\u201d look like a modest one-off. Cameron has dedicated a huge chunk of his life to it. Now, as he prepares to unveil the latest chapter of his Na'vi opus on Dec. 19, Cameron is approaching what he calls a crossroads.",
      "\u201cAs you get older you start to think of time in a slightly different way,\u201d Cameron says from his 5,000-acre organic farm in New Zealand. \u201cIt\u2019s not an infinite resource.\u201d",
      "Two more \u201cAvatar\u201d films are already written and have release dates, in 2029 and 2031. Right now, though, Cameron is focused on completing \u201cFire and Ash,\" which is almost guaranteed to be the biggest movie of the fall. To get \u201cAvatar\u201d \u2014 a franchise already worth $5.2 billion in worldwide tickets sales \u2014 back in the minds of moviegoers, \u201cThe Way of Water\u201d will also be rereleased Oct. 3.",
      "\u201cAs I told the brass at Disney, we\u2019re right at the glide slope to land right on time for delivery,\" Cameron says. \u201cThe first film was a nightmare. Movie two was hectic. But here, I keep having to pinch myself because it\u2019s all going well. The film is strong.\u201d",
      "There may be no filmmaker more at the nexus of past and future blockbuster making than Cameron. \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d will arrive as Hollywood is reconciling itself to a new theatrical normal. In a movie industry of shrinking ambition, \u201cAvatar,\u201d an original spectacle that once was the wave of the future, is already beginning to look like an endangered species.",
      "In a recent interview, Cameron reflected on his history with \u201cAvatar\u201d and what's next for him, including a planned adaptation of Charles Pellegrino's \u201cGhosts of Hiroshima.\u201d For Cameron, most of his work is likely to touch on one of what he calls \u201cthe big three\u201d: Nuclear weapons, machine super intelligence and climate change.",
      "\u201cAvatar,\u201d a family saga that grows more complicated and darker in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d relates to the latter. The films are environmental parables, set in a verdant faraway world. Sustainability, community, connection to nature \u2014 these are some of the pillars of Cameron's life right now, in the movies and outside them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a humble movie farmer,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201cwho\u2019s also a farmer farmer.\u201d",
      "CAMERON: It was sort of: Do the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga or follow my interests more. I knew that \u201cAvatar\u201d would be all-consuming, and it has been. When I set down that path, a reasonable projection was eight to 10 years to get it all written and do movie two and movie three together and get them out. But it\u2019s actually turned out to be more than that. It was a major commitment and decision to make for me as a life choice. But the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies reach people and they reach people with positive messaging. Not just positive about the environment but positive from the standpoint of humanity, empathy, spirituality, our connection to each other. And they\u2019re beautiful. There\u2019s a kind of magnetic draw into the film. It almost feels like it\u2019s being pulled out of the audience\u2019s dreams and subconscious state.",
      "CAMERON: I was 19. I was in college and I had a very vivid dream of a bioluminescent forest with glowing moss that reacted to your feet and these little spinning lizards that floated around. It\u2019s all in the movie, by the way. The reason it\u2019s in the movie is because I got up and painted it. That later became the inspiration, just a few years later, for a science-fiction script. I said, \u201cHey I got this idea for a planet where everything glows at night.\u201d We wrote that in and it never went away.",
      "Years after that, when I was the CEO of Digital Domain, I wanted to push Digital Domain to be able to create CG worlds, CG humanoid creatures using performance capture. I just threw the kitchen sink into the treatment called \u201cAvatar.\u201d So it came from almost a Machiavellian reason. I was trying to drive a business model for the development of CG. Of course, the answer I got from my technical team was: \u201cWe are not ready to make this film. We may not be ready for years.\u201d But it still served that inspirational purpose, which was: Well, how do we get ready?",

      "CAMERON: It\u2019s interesting. As I said earlier, \u201cAvatar\u201d has been all-consuming. In the process, we\u2019ve developed many new technologies. I enjoy the day-to-day process with a team. I\u2019ve surrounded myself with really intelligent, really creative people who enjoy the process of the world building. We enjoy leveling up in our working process. It\u2019s a long, steady state thing where I\u2019m not having to create a new startup, build a team and then disband that team \u2014 the way the movies cycled for me back in the \u201980s and \u201990s. Now, I\u2019m at a kind of a crossroads where I have to decide if I want to keep doing this.",
      "Four and five are written. If we\u2019re as successful as we might potentially be, I\u2019m sure the films will continue. The question for me will be: Do I direct them both? Do I direct one of them? At what point do I pass the baton? How pervasive do I want it to be in my life?",
      "CAMERON: I\u2019m not going to make any decisions about that until probably Q2 of next year, when the dust has settled. And there are also new technologies to consider. Generative AI is upon us. It\u2019s going to transform the film business. Does that make our work flow easier? Can I make \u201cAvatar\u201d movies more quickly? That would be a big factor for me.",
      "CAMERON: The theatrical business is dwindling. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t continue to dwindle. Right now, it\u2019s plateaued at about 30% down from 2019 levels. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t get cannibalized more. In fact, let\u2019s hope we can bring some of that magic back. But the only way to keep that magic alive and strengthen it is to make the kinds of movies people feel they need to see in a movie theater. Unfortunately, those movies are not getting greenlit as much as they used to be because studios can\u2019t afford them. Or they can only afford to take the risk on certain blue chip stocks, so it doesn\u2019t allow new IP to get launched. It doesn\u2019t allow new filmmakers to come into those genres.",
      "I\u2019d like to see the cost of VFX artists come down. VFX artists get scared and say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to be out of a job.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, the way you\u2019re going to be out of a job is if trends continue and we just don\u2019t make these kinds of movies anymore.\u201d If you develop these tools or learn these tools, then your throughpoint will be quicker and that will bring the cost of productions down, and studios will be encouraged to make more and more of these types of films. To me, that\u2019s a virtuous cycle that we need to manifest. We need to make that happen or I think theatrical might never return.",
      "CAMERON: I would love to think that we\u2019ve been building a new monument for the last three or four years. And I think there will always be a market for the new monument builds. The streamers kind of cannibalized the theatrical market with the promise of a lot of money to attract top filmmakers and top casts, and then that money has all retrenched back. The budgets aren\u2019t there. Everything is starting to look like it\u2019s driving toward a mediocrity. Everything starts to look to me like a typical network procedural, or at least that could be an end point within just a couple years.",
      "Unfortunately, the economics of streaming expanded rapidly and then contracted rapidly. Now, we\u2019re betwixt and between models. It\u2019s cannibalized theatrical and, at the same time, it\u2019s not delivering the budgets to do the kind of imaginative, phantasmagorical filmmaking.",
      "CAMERON: The \u201cAvatar\u201d films, and certainly the new one \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d do exactly the same thing. In a way, they cast us in a good light. The humans in the story are the bad guys. But really what it\u2019s saying is that the attributes we value \u2014 our interpersonal and intercommunity connections, our spirituality, our empathy \u2014 in the movies they reside in the Na\u2019vi. But of course we as the audience take the Na\u2019vi\u2019s side. So they seem a kind of aspirational, better version of us. In a sense, it\u2019s still empowering and reinforcing certain values and ethics and morals.",
      "Now, it\u2019s a little more challenging in movie three because we show Na\u2019vi who have kind of fallen from grace and are adversarial with other Na\u2019vi. I think one of the reasons \u201cAvatar\u201d has been successful in all markets around the world is because everybody is in a family or wishes they were in a family. They have their ties. They have their tribes. They have their connections. And that\u2019s what these films are about. What would you risk everything for?",
      "CAMERON: \u201cGhosts of Hiroshima\u201d is about testing our empathy boundaries. Somebody needed to be empathetic to the fact that a nuclear weapon was going to be used against human beings. And I don\u2019t want to go down the rabbit hole of should the bombs have been dropped, who was right, who was wrong. But I do want to remind people of what these weapons are capable of doing against targets. It\u2019s unfathomable.",
      "There were three bombs in 1945. One was used as a test and two against people. There are now 12,000 and they range in power from 100 to over 200 times the energy that was generated at either one of those two bombings. We\u2019re in a very precarious world right now. And because of all the geopolitical challenges internationally \u2014 more nuclear powers, more saber rattling, unaccountable leadership in Russia and America right now \u2014 I think we\u2019re in as precarious a situation as we were in the Cuban missile crisis era.",

    "story": [
      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry condemned Woody Allen for speaking at a Russian film festival, calling his participation in the event \u201ca disgrace and an insult\u201d to the victims of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine",
      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival over the weekend, calling his participation in the event \u201ca disgrace and an insult\u201d to the victims of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced the Ukraine cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media reports quoted Allen as saying that he has always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said that it \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d Allen\u2019s participation in the festival, which \u201cbrings together supporters and mouthpieces of Putin.\u201d The ministry called it \u201ca disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\u201d adding that Allen \u201cis deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchange to continue.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut, whatever politicians have done, I don\u2019t feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\u201d",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos. Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",

      "Rival studios on Sunday estimated that the Netflix film, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d led all films in the box office this weekend with $16-18 million in ticket sales",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Netflix appears to have its first No. 1 box-office title in the streaming company\u2019s 18-year history thanks to the sensation of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "Rival studios on Sunday estimated \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d led all films over the weekend with $16-18 million in ticket sales. Distribution executives from three studios shared their estimates for the Netflix phenomenon on condition of anonymity because the streaming company has a policy of not reporting ticket sales.",
      "Following a dominating few weeks as one of the most popular Netflix releases ever, the streamer put the film into 1,750 theaters for sing-along screenings Saturday and Sunday. Studios are able to accurately estimate ticket sales for all releases on Sunday morning, though the uncommon nature of the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d releases means a wider variance. Some estimates were as high as $20 million.",
      "It amounted to a victory lap for \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d arguably the biggest hit of Hollywood\u2019s summer, and an ironic success for Netflix, whose emphasis on streaming, not theatrical release, upended the movie industry. Another sore spot for Hollywood: The film was developed and produced by Sony Pictures, which sold it to Netflix.",
      "Not all exhibitors went along. AMC, the largest theater chain in North America, declined to show the movie. But that didn\u2019t stop Netflix from claiming the box-office title its more traditional competitors typically own.",
      "David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm FranchiseRe, called it \u201ca completely unique two-day musical event.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt may turn out to be higher,\u201d said Gross. \u201cTheater owners are quick on their feet and can add capacity according to demand.\u201d",
      "The theatrical release, though limited, is out of the ordinary for the streaming giant, which has long stressed a commitment to subscriber releases. The movie debuted on the platform in late June and is currently Netflix's most-watched animated original film.",
      "The film centers on Huntr/x, a KPop superstar trio who double as demon hunters. The members, Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong) and Zooey (Ji-young Yoo), must protect their fans and face their biggest enemy yet: a rival boy band made up of demons in disguise.",
      "Zach Cregger's horror hit \u201cWeapons\u201d maintained strength in the box office during its third weekend, bringing in $15.6 million domestically. The buzzy horror movie has proved its staying power, raking in over $100 million globally since its release.",
      "Disney's \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d landed behind the horror movie once again, earning $9.2 million in North American theaters.",
      "The two films are \u201creal bright spots\u201d as the box office heads into a \u201crather quiet finish\u201d for the summer, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore. Both films, which premiered simultaneously earlier this month, had a minimal 36% drop from last weekend.",
      "\u201cI think we have to look at the currency of the goodwill generated by people having these great summer moviegoing experiences,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWe have to look at that as a more important metric than just the bottom-line dollars and cents.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\" earned $5.9 million domestically during its fifth weekend. The movie enjoyed a strong $118 million debut but has experienced a steady decline.",
      "Newcomer \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d opened in 1,317 North American theaters with a weekend gross estimate of $3 million, in line with expectations. The movie made it to the top 10, right above \u201cThe Naked Gun.\"",

      "Actor Jerry Adler has died at 96",
      "NEW YORK -- Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \u201cpassed peacefully in his sleep,\u201d Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a creature of nepotism,\u201d Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \u201cI got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\u201d",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \u201cSanta Barbara.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \u201cThe Public Eye\u201d and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \u201cchills\u201d when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \u201cNorthern Exposure\u201d paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d",

      "Films included Woody Allen's \u201cManhattan Murder Mystery,\u201d but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \u201cRescue Me,\u201d \u201cMad About You,\u201d \u201cTransparent\u201d and guest spots on shows ranging from \u201cThe West Wing\u201d to \u201cBroad City.\u201d",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \u201cTaller Than a Dwarf\u201d in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \u201cFish in the Dark.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\u201d Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\u201d",
      "Adler published a memoir, \u201cToo Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\u201d last year. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \u201ctoo goofy-looking\u201d to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m immortal,\u201d he said.",

      "Clooney\u2019s acclaimed black-and-white dramatization of journalist Edward R. Murrow\u2019s clash with Joseph McCarthy began its successful run in competition at the 62nd Venice Film Festival. Though it lost the Golden Lion to Ang Lee\u2019s \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d it did go on to pick up six Oscar nominations including for Clooney\u2019s directing.",
      "During the trip, he also inspired a cocktail still served at the ritzy Belmond Hotel Cipriani on Giudecca.

      "Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cGravity\u201d opened the 70th edition of the Venice Film Festival before going on to win seven Oscars.

      "Clooney returned to the festival with another of his directing projects, \u201cSuburbicon,\u201d a dark comedic satire about a seemingly idyllic 1950s community with Damon and Julianne Moore. This festival was especially notable for it being the Clooneys\u2019 first public appearance since the birth of their twins, Alexander and Ella, a few months prior.",
      "This time George was the plus one to Amal, who was receiving an award from the Diane von Furstenberg and The Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation for her work as a human rights lawyer. The power couple gave the festival some much-needed star power amid the actors strike with an appearance at the adjacent DVF Awards. \u201cI am here in Venice with my husband; he is a rising star,\u201d she said that night. \u201cI just wanted to say, you, my love, like this city, take my breath away.\u201d",
      "Clooney and Pitt reunited for the Jon Watts action comedy \u201cWolfs,\u201d that played out of competition. But the spotlight was less on the film and more on the off-screen drama of the AppleTV+ produced film only getting a limited theatrical release, and his then-recent New York Times op-ed urging President Joe Biden to end his reelection bid.",
      "\u201cThe person who should be applauded is the president who did the most selfless thing anyone\u2019s done since George Washington,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cAll the machinations that got us there, none of that\u2019s going to be remembered. And it shouldn\u2019t be. What should be remembered is the selfless act.\u201d",

      "Daniel Dae Kim is known for roles in spy thrillers and sci-fi epics but he still hopes to play a romantic lead",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After three decades in Hollywood, Daniel Dae Kim has done spy thrillers, sci-fi epics and medical dramas. But there\u2019s one role that\u2019s eluded the Korean American actor: romantic leading man. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years,\u201d Kim says with a laugh.",
      "His latest project, \u201cButterfly,\u201d which features a star-studded cast including top Korean actors Kim Tae-hee and Park Hae-soo (\u201cSquid Game\u201d), follows a former U.S. intelligence operative in South Korea whose past catches up with him. It premiered on Amazon Prime in the U.S. and elsewhere earlier this month, but makes its Korean debut Friday.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press in Seoul, South Korea, Kim revealed one of his biggest regrets, reflected on cultural lessons from the Korea-U.S. co-production, and opened up about what it\u2019s really like being the bridge between two cultures while pursuing his mission to tell stories \u201cthat haven\u2019t been told yet.\u201d The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "KIM: As an EP, I\u2019m a job creator. I am a person responsible for a lot of people, and I will fight so much harder for others than I often fight for myself. When I feel like one of the cast, or one of the crew, or one of the writers is not being taken care of, I\u2019m not afraid to talk to anybody and have a hard conversation.",
      "KIM: Every day, there was something that needed to be translated literally through language but also working styles. In Korea, because it\u2019s a more Confucian society, the hierarchy of departments is very clear. We had to learn to talk to the head of the department who would then talk to the staff, as opposed to if you have an issue with one of the staff, you go directly to the staff. This kind of thing was new to the Americans.",
      "KIM: I think in 2007 I got a DUI when I was working on \u201cLost,\u201d and I regret that night every day of my life. At the time, I felt so much shame, so much guilt, so much regret. I felt terrible to my parents, because that\u2019s not the way I think they wanted me to be raised. I think with the right perspective, these things, these mistakes that you made can actually be helpful for your life because they can guide you in certain ways.",
      "KIM: We\u2019re already seeing it. If you look at what happened with Paramount and CBS News, we\u2019re seeing a chilling effect on free speech and journalism and DEI. \u201cDEI\u201d is a bad word these days, but to me, DEI\u2019s not a fad. The idea of inclusion is not something that\u2019s a political trend. It\u2019s my life. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve lived every decade I\u2019ve been in this business.",

      "KIM: I got so much criticism when I did \u201cLost\u201d that I had to learn how to not take it so personally because it hurt a lot at the time. When I came to Korea when I was 18, cab drivers would give me such a hard time because I couldn\u2019t speak fluent Korean. And they were like, \u201cYou\u2019re Korean, your face is Korean, why don\u2019t you speak Korean?\u201d They had never thought about an immigrant experience from another country. But now Korea is so used to that kind of thing that people are much more understanding.",
      "KIM: I have a lot of sympathy for actors who take stereotypical roles when they\u2019re starting out because you need some way to break into the business. It\u2019s much easier once you\u2019re more successful and more established because you have more financial stability. It\u2019s something that, if you\u2019re not a person of color, or someone who\u2019s a minority in the United States, you don\u2019t have to think about. You don\u2019t think about what this role means for the rest of a nation or an ethnicity. You just do what you\u2019re drawn to, and that\u2019s very liberating. I am lucky enough now where I can also make those same choices. But I don\u2019t ever escape the fact that whatever I do will be watched and seen by so many people and judged through their own lens and filters.",
      "KIM: I\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years. I\u2019ve never gotten the opportunity and it\u2019s one of those interesting things because I look the way I do as an Asian American and Asian men were never considered handsome or sexy. That\u2019s changing now though. I\u2019m friends with Jimmy O. Yang and, a few years ago, he got to play a romantic lead in a rom-com. And I said to Jimmy like, \u201cWho would have thought you, Jimmy, would have been the one to be the romantic lead?\u201d But I was so happy for him because it meant that the way we were looking at Asian men was different.",

      "Some colleges are allowing pets in dorms to help students feel more at home",
      "Crossing paths with dogs, cats and other animals is part of campus life for students at Eckerd College, a liberal arts school in Florida that allows pets to live in dormitories.",
      "Sophie Nocera, an Eckerd senior, said she probably knows the names of pets better than her fellow students.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the case for a lot of the students,\" said Nocera, who lives on the campus in St. Petersburg with her Border collie, Zuko. \"When I'm walking my dog, I often hear, \u2018Oh my god, hi, Zuko!\u2019 It's like I\u2019m not even there.\"",
      "Some colleges and universities around the country welcome pets in campus residences, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Stephens College in Missouri.",
      "For students, the companionship can help reduce stress, anxiety and homesickness. The colleges also see benefits for student engagement and helping them build connections with one another.",
      "Federal law requires public and private colleges to allow service animals and emotional support animals in student housing. But growing numbers of schools are allowing pets, with various restrictions.",
      "MIT allows only cats, in limited numbers and in preapproved spaces. At Eckerd, students can bring their family pets to live with them on campus after their first semester. The college requires pets to have been part of students\u2019 home life at least six months before coming to campus and must not be venomous or aggressive.",
      "At the University of Northern Colorado, students in three of the more than dozen residence halls on campus are allowed to have dogs and cats. The animals must be at least 6 months old and no more than 40 pounds (18 kilograms). Students are limited to one pet. This fall, the school will have the most registered pets on campus since it began allowing them over a decade ago, said Jediah Cummins, executive director of housing.",
      "\u201cOne of the markers of adulthood is, \u2018Can I not just take care of myself, but can I take care of another living being?\u2019 That\u2019s an important part of this,\u201d Cummins said.",
      "Molly Cheer, a senior nursing major, said she chose Northern Colorado in part because of its pet-friendly policy. When she is stressed about school, she said, it helps coming home to Louie, the cat she adopted during her first year.",

Jack Layden, assistant dean for residential life and student engagement, said the college has hosted hundreds of animals, including rabbits, ferrets, chinchillas, birds, guinea pigs, bearded dragons, geckos, turtles, snakes, frogs, fish, and even a tarantula.",
      "Nocera said Zuko has helped her meet other people on campus, as well as emotionally, when she struggled with a decision to change her major.",
      "\u201cI remember coming back to my dorm and just melting to the floor, and Zuko was right there. And I remember thinking, whatever happens tomorrow, I\u2019m going to wake up, and I\u2019m going to take him to the dog park. And, we\u2019re going to go play fetch regardless of what my major is,\" said Nocera, who is the staff director of Pet Life, a student-led department on campus tasked with administering the pet policy.",
      "At Washington & Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, Eva Chatterjee-Sutton saw the difference a pet can make when a first-year student was struggling to make connections before her mother suggested a puppy. After the dog's arrival, the student became more involved in campus life, said Chatterjee-Sutton, vice president of student life.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely changed her college trajectory and her connection with others on campus,\u201d Chatterjee-Sutton said.",
      "Pet-friendly dorms require colleges to consider things like safety concerns, noise complaints, how to avoid agitating animals during fire alarm tests, as well as additional costs for cleaning, Layden said. Some schools charge a pet fee, which varies by school, type of pet and is often included in housing expenses. For example, at Stephens College, the annual fee for a dog or cat is $220, for a cage- or aquarium-dwelling pet is $50 and free for fish. Others require students to have liability insurance and roommate agreements. Pets are required to be restrained when in public, and most colleges require students to ensure their pets are healthy and vaccinated.",

      "\u201cHaving pets obviously isn\u2019t for everyone, and that is totally OK,\u201d Nocera said. \u201cBut for the people that it is a good fit for, it is so worth it. This upcoming year, I'll be graduating, and Zuko will be in his little pet graduation ceremony, walking across the stage with me.\u201d",

      "The Alaska State Medical Board will be considering language that says medical professionals provide gender-affirming care for children could risk having their work considered unprofessional conduct",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Alaska medical professionals who provide gender-affirming care for children could risk disciplinary action under a proposal set for review by the state medical board on Friday.",
      "The proposal would deem any professional who uses hormonal and surgical treatments for minors \u201cas being grossly negligent\u201d and subject to sanctions by the board, according to the board\u2019s minutes from a June meeting.",
      "The type and extent of disciplinary actions were not spelled out, and board member Matt Heilala, an Anchorage podiatrist who was helping write the proposed regulations, declined to discuss the details Thursday with The Associated Press ahead of the meeting.",
      "The move comes after the board in March sent a letter to state lawmakers expressing opposition to hormonal or surgical gender-affirming care for minors and urging legislators to enact limits on treatments. The Legislature \u2014 controlled by bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate \u2014 didn\u2019t take up the issue before adjourning in May.",
      "Critics worry the board is overstepping its authority in pursuing regulations that could leave medical providers open to possible disciplinary actions. Instead of allowing the legislative process to play out, \u201cthey are now becoming the legislators themselves, which is inappropriate,\u201d said state Sen. L\u00f6ki Tobin, a Democrat who has been outspoken in support of the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "The medical board at a June meeting designated member Heilala to help draft a statement for consideration that would pertain to declaring those providing the care \u201cas being grossly negligent and therefore subject to disciplinary sanctions,\u201d according to the minutes of that meeting.",
      "Heilala declined to discuss the specific language stemming from that directive that the board would consider Friday but told the AP that the proposed rules would go through a deliberate and transparent process for the public. Such processes can take months, he said.",
      "Gender-affirming care includes a range of medical and mental health services to support a person\u2019s gender identity, including when it\u2019s different from the sex they were assigned at birth. It encompasses counseling, medications that block puberty and hormone therapy to produce physical changes as well as surgeries to transform chests and genitals, though those are rare for minors.",
      "Most major medical groups say access to the treatment is important for those with gender dysphoria and see gender as existing along a spectrum. While there\u2019s wide, if not universal, medical consensus, the political situation is contentious.",
      "In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott had issued an order allowing the state to investigate parents of transgender youth for child abuse. But a Texas judge in 2022 blocked the state from investigating families of transgender youths who have received such care and members of the LGBTQ advocacy group PFLAG Inc. over such medical care.",
      "Tom Pittman, executive director of Identity Inc., an Anchorage-based advocacy and health care organization for the LGBTQ+ community, said about 500 Alaska medical professionals have signed an open letter opposing the changes being considered by the board.",

      "The shift to direct federal oversight underscores the severity of the problems at the Boar's Head plant, said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer advocacy group.

      "\u201cGiven its history, it's particularly important that there be robust oversight of that plant,\u201d Eskin said.",

      "China has been installing solar panels far faster than anywhere else in the world, and the investment is starting to pay off. A study released Thursday found that the country's carbon emissions edged down 1% in the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier, extending a trend that began in March 2024.",
      "The good news is China's carbon emissions may have peaked well ahead of a government target of doing so before 2030. But China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will need to bring them down much more sharply to play its part in slowing global climate change.",
      "For China to reach its declared goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, emissions would need to fall 3% on average over the next 35 years, said Lauri Myllyvirta, the Finland-based author of the study and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.",
      "\u201cChina needs to get to that 3% territory as soon as possible,\u201d he said.",
      "China's emissions have fallen before during economic slowdowns. What's different this time is electricity demand is growing \u2014 up 3.7% in the first half of this year \u2014 but the increase in power from solar, wind and nuclear has easily outpaced that, according to Myllyvirta, who analyzes the most recent data in a study published on the U.K.-based Carbon Brief website.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking really for the first time about a structural declining trend in China\u2019s emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "China installed 212 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first six months of the year, more than America's entire capacity of 178 gigawatts as of the end of 2024, the study said. Electricity from solar has overtaken hydropower in China and is poised to surpass wind this year to become the country's largest source of clean energy. Some 51 gigawatts of wind power was added from January to June.",
      "Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, described the plateauing of China's carbon emissions as a turning point in the effort to combat climate change.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment of global significance, offering a rare glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak climate landscape,\u201d he wrote in an email response. It also shows that a country can cut emissions while still growing economically, he said.",

      "In an area that is largely desert, the massive solar project has wrought a surprising change on the landscape.

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has fired his national police chief, who gained attention for leading the separate arrests of ex-President Rodrigo Duterte on orders of the International Criminal Court and televangelist Apollo Carreon Quiboloy, who is on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list for alleged child sex trafficking, Philippine officials said Tuesday.",
      "Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin did not cite a reason for the removal of General Nicolas Torre as head of the 232,000-member national police force, a position he was appointed to by Marcos in May and which he would have held until 2027. He will be replaced by another senior police general, Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. who assumed the top post Tuesday.",
      "In a letter to Torre made public Tuesday, Bersamin informed him of his immediate removal as national police chief on orders of Marcos and directed him \u201cto ensure the proper turnover of all matters, documents and information relative to your office.\u201d",
      "Torre was not immediately available for comment.",
      "Ahead of his removal, Torre reportedly had differences with government officials over the national police chief\u2019s decision to remove more than a dozen police officials from their posts, including Nartatez. The National Police Commission ordered the reinstatement of the police officials to their posts this month but that was apparently not immediately done.",
      "\u201cHe did not violate any laws, he has not been charged criminally or administratively, it is simply a choice of the president to take a new direction for the national police,\u201d Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla said without elaborating in a news conference when asked why Torre was removed.",
      "Marcos and Torre had a \u201cwonderful and productive relationship,\u201d Remulla said, but he added without elaborating that \u201cwe are a country of laws and not of men, that the institutions must be larger than the people who run it.\u201d",
      "Only the president can specifically answer why Torre was removed, Remulla said. It's not clear if Torre would be offered another government post.",

      "Police said their examination of the three bones and a skull found this week by Korean divers at the former site of the Chosei Mine in western Yamaguchi prefecture confirmed they are all human remains.",
      "But police said their analysis could not determine whether the three limb bones and skull belonged to the same person, their age or the timing of the death.",
      "The group, known as Kizamu Kai, said they are certain the remains belong to victims who died at the mine 83 years ago and that the discovery is a major boost in their efforts to recover other remains of the 136 Korean forced laborers and 47 Japanese workers killed in the mine collapse.",

      "A Bolivian judge has ordered the release of a powerful opposition leader, ending over two years of pretrial detention for conservative politician Luis Fernando Camacho",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- A Bolivian judge ordered the release of powerful opposition leader Luis Fernando Camacho Tuesday, ending over two years of pretrial detention for the conservative politician. His impending release is a victory for his supporters, who long criticized his prosecution as politically motivated, and a blow for his detractors who see the judicial pendulum swinging to the right.",
      "Camacho, the governor of Bolivia's easternmost province of Santa Cruz, has served two years and eight months behind bars on charges of sedition tied to his involvement in violent unrest over the disputed 2019 reelection of socialist former President Evo Morales.",
      "The firebrand Christian leader of a powerful Santa Cruz business association, Camacho gained prominence while leading protests against Morales in 2019 that ultimately forced Bolivia\u2019s first Indigenous leader to resign under pressure from the military and flee to exile.",
      "The court order for Camacho's release comes after Bolivia's Aug. 17 elections signaled the end of nearly 20 years of left-wing rule under Morales' Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS party. A presidential runoff in October pits centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz against right-wing former President Jorge Quiroga, assuring a rightward tilt in the country's politics.",
      "Quiroga in particular has called for the release of his jailed political allies, including Camacho as well as caretaker interim President Jeanine A\u00f1ez, who took over the presidency in 2019 in what Morales' supporters call a coup.",
      "Both are divisive figures.",
      "Although A\u00f1ez vowed to steer Bolivia to new elections in which she wouldn't run following her 2019 takeover, she swiftly cemented her hold on power, transforming the country's policies, violently cracking down on protests and provoking Morales\u2019 Indigenous supporters.",
      "After elections in 2020 vaulted Morales' handpicked successor, President Luis Arce, to the nation's top job, the same judicial system that A\u00f1ez wielded against Morales and his followers sentenced her to 10 years in prison on charges of sedition and terrorism stemming from her takeover.",
      "In 2022, Camacho was arrested on the same charges while leading a prolonged economic strike against Arce's government in Santa Cruz that shut down Bolivia\u2019s most populous and economically vital region for 36 days.",
      "He was accused with criminal association and illegal use of public property for leading the strike. But the main case that landed him in pretrial detention dates back to his pivotal role in pressuring Morales to quit the presidency in 2019. He called on all MAS lawmakers to resign and even proposed that an unconstitutional junta take power before ultimately backing \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s government.",
      "Unlike \u00c1\u00f1ez, Camacho was never tried or formally charged. Every time he maxed out the legal detention period, a prosecutor extended his jailing in a widely criticized tactic that Bolivia's judiciary often deploys in high-profile political cases.",
      "Now, with Bolivia\u2019s right-wing opposition preparing to return to power for the first time in decades, the judiciary has taken note.",
      "Last week, Bolivia\u2019s Supreme Court issued a sudden ruling ordering all judges in the country to review the legality of pretrial detention in the cases of A\u00f1ez and Camacho, along with that of Marco Antonio Pumari, another opposition leader held over his role in the 2019 political crisis.",

A separate hearing in the case was pushed to Friday.",

      "BAY OF AARHUS, Denmark -- Below the dark blue waters of the Bay of Aarhus in northern Denmark, archaeologists search for coastal settlements swallowed by rising sea levels more than 8,500 years ago.",
      "This summer, divers descended about 8 meters (26 feet) below the waves close to Aarhus, Denmark's second-biggest city, and collected evidence of a Stone Age settlement from the seabed.",
      "It's part of a 13.2 million euro ($15.5 million) six-year international project to map parts of the seabed in the Baltic and North Seas, funded by the European Union, that includes researchers in Aarhus as well as from the U.K.'s University of Bradford and the Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research in Germany.",
      "The goal is to explore sunken Northern European landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic settlements as offshore wind farms and other sea infrastructure expand.",
      "Most evidence of such settlements so far has been found at locations inland from the Stone Age coast, said underwater archaeologist Peter Moe Astrup, who\u2019s leading underwater excavations in Denmark.",

      "After the last ice age, huge ice sheets melted and global sea levels rose, submerging Stone Age settlements and forcing the hunter-gatherer human population inland.",
      "About 8,500 years ago, sea levels rose by about 2 meters (6.5 feet) per century, Moe Astrup said.",

      "Germany\u2019s leaders have launched a drive to attract more people into voluntary military service",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's leaders on Wednesday launched a drive to attract more people into voluntary military service as the country scrambles to strengthen its armed forces in the face of growing fears about future Russian aggression, a project that some in the governing coalition say doesn't go far enough.",
      "Germany, a leading NATO and European Union member, has moved to modernize its long-neglected military since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. That year, it set up a 100 billion euro ($117 billion) special fund to modernize the Bundeswehr, much of which has been committed to procuring new equipment.",
      "New Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition this year pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt. Merz has said repeatedly he wants the Bundeswehr to be \"the strongest conventional army in Europe.\u201d",
      "The government is redoubling its efforts to attract more recruits, which the military struggled to do in recent years. Germany had some 181,000 active servicepeople at the end of last year. But the government says it needs to increase that in the long term to 260,000, plus some 200,000 reservists.",
      "\u201cThe Bundeswehr must grow \u2014 the international security situation, above all Russia's aggressive behavior, make this necessary,\" Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Wednesday. \u201cWe need not just well-equipped forces, we are going at full speed on that ... we also need a Bundeswehr that is strong in terms of personnel. Only then is deterrence toward Russia really credible.\u201d",
      "Pistorius spoke after Merz's Cabinet approved his plan for a new military service system. It aims to draw sufficient recruits without reviving compulsory conscription for men, which was suspended in 2011, but leaves the door open for parliament to do so if not enough people volunteer.",
      "The plan foresees more attractive pay and conditions for people who agree to join the military for short periods and what Pistorius describes as attractive training offers for those who join up for at least six months, as well as flexibility on how long people can serve.",
      "Beginning next year, the government plans to send questionnaires to young men and women turning 18 about their willingness and ability to serve in the military. Starting in mid-2027, young men will be required to undergo medical examinations, though not to sign up for the military.",

      "But there has been tension in the conservative Merz's coalition with Pistorius' center-left Social Democrats over whether the new system should foresee an automatic return to compulsory service if the military can't draw enough volunteers.",
      "Some conservatives pushed unsuccessfully for compulsory service. But Pistorius says the conditions aren't in place at the moment as sufficient barracks and trainers aren't currently available.",
      "The plan allows for the government to move toward compulsory service \u201cif, in the course of the next one, two or three years, we see that the target figures aren't being reached,\" Merz said. He added he was \u201cconfident, at least from today's point of view, that in any case to begin with we will reach the figures we need.\u201d",
      "A senior conservative ally of the chancellor, Bavarian governor Markus S\u00f6der, told ARD television Sunday that Pistorius' plan is \u201ca first step in the right direction.\u201d",

      "The \u201csnapback\u201d provision of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal can be invoked by any party if they find Iran out of compliance with requirements. Its purpose is to swiftly reimpose all pre-deal sanctions without being vetoed by U.N. Security Council members, including permanent members Russia and China.",
      "Iran contends there is no legal basis for the Europeans to reimpose U.N. sanctions via snapback, claiming the countries failed to uphold the 2015 Iran nuclear deal after the U.S. exit in 2018, especially ensuring the anticipated economic benefits for Iran.",

The move comes as tensions with the U.S. simmer over the deployment of three warships to the region.",
      "Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez said the vessels will patrol the Gulf of Venezuela as well as the country's \u201cterritorial waters\u201d in the Caribbean. In an Instagram reel, Padrino added that about 15,000 members of the armed forces will participate in efforts on land and at sea to fight \u201c the armed, terrorist, drug-trafficking groups operating on the border\u201d with Colombia.",
      "Padrino announced the operation more than a week after the U.S. government announced the deployment of three guided-missile destroyers to the waters off Venezuela to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels. Venezuela's initial response to the deployment was to call on Venezuelans to enlist in a volunteer militia meant to assist the armed forces in the defense of external and domestic attacks.",
      "The move to deploy U.S. destroyers and personnel comes as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for using the military to thwart cartels he blames for the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into American communities and for perpetuating violence in some U.S. cities.",

      "\u201cWe, all of us, the Gulf, the U.S., the Lebanese are all gonna act together to create an economic forum that is gonna produce a livelihood,\u201d Barrack said.",

      "Speaking on the U.N. peacekeeping force that has been deployed in south Lebanon since Israel first invaded the country in 1978, Barrack said the U.S. would rather fund the Lebanese army than the force that is known as UNIFIL. Speaking about this week\u2019s vote at the United Nations in New York, Barrack said the U.S. backs extending UNIFIL\u2019s term for one year only.",

      "India faces a major challenge as steep U.S. tariffs on Indian products take effect",
      "NEW DELHI -- Steep U.S. tariffs on a range of Indian products took effect Wednesday, threatening a serious blow to India\u2019s overseas trade in its largest export market.",
      "President Donald Trump had initially announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods. But earlier this month he signed an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff due to India\u2019s purchases of Russian oil, bringing the combined tariffs imposed by the U.S. on its ally to 50%.",
      "The Indian government estimates the tariffs will impact $48.2 billion worth of exports. Officials have warned the new duties could make shipments to the U.S. commercially unviable, triggering job losses and slower economic growth.",
      "India\u2013U.S. trade relations have expanded in recent years but remain vulnerable to disputes over market access and domestic political pressures. India is one of the fastest-growing major global economies and it may face a slowdown as a result.",

      "\u201cThe new tariff regime is a strategic shock that threatens to wipe out India\u2019s long-established presence in the U.S., causing unemployment in export-driven hubs and weakening its role in the industrial value chain,\u201d said Ajay Srivastava, the think tank's founder and a former Indian trade official.",
      "The U.S. has for now exempted some sectors such as pharmaceuticals and electronic goods from additional tariffs, bringing some relief for India as its exposure in these sectors is significant.",
      "Puran Dawar, a leather footwear exporter in northern India\u2019s Agra city, says the industry would take a substantial hit in the near term unless domestic demand strengthens and other overseas markets buy more Indian goods.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum.",
      "Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom.",
      "This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007.",

      "And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion.",
      "Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion.",
      "Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand.",
      "Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year.",
      "And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter.",
      "Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country \u2014 a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors.",

      "Lisa Cook made headlines three years ago when she became the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors, one of the most powerful financial institutions in the world",
      "NEW YORK -- In an unprecedented move, U.S. President Donald Trump said that he\u2019s firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook \u2014 marking a sharp escalation in his efforts to exert greater control on one of the most powerful financial institutions in the world.",
      "Trump took to social media to announce that he would be removing Cook, effective immediately, over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud before she joined the board. In response, Cook said that she would not step down \u2014 and maintained that the president has no authority to fire her.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump purported to fire me \u2018for cause\u2019 when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cI will not resign.\u201d",
      "Cook made headlines three years ago when she became the first Black woman to serve on the Fed\u2019s board of governors, which votes on the central bank\u2019s key interest rate decisions. Prior to her appointment to the board, she was a longtime economics professor and also held roles in the Clinton, G.W. Bush and Obama administrations.",
      "Here's what to know about Lisa Cook.",
      "Cook was appointed to the Fed\u2019s board by President Joe Biden in 2022. Her nomination was opposed by most Senate Republicans, and she was approved on a 50-50 vote with the tie broken by then-Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "When she took office, Cook became the first Black woman to serve as a Fed Governor in the institution's over century-long history. She initially filled an unexpired term and was reappointed the following year. Her appointment runs through January 2038.",
      "Cook has taught economics and international relations at Michigan State University, and was previously also on the faculty of Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. She was a Marshall Scholar who received degrees from Oxford University and Spelman College.",
      "Also prior to her appointment to the Fed, she served as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama from 2011 and 2012 \u2014 as well as a senior adviser on finance and development in the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of International Affairs from 2000 to 20021, under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush..",

      "Fed governors vote on the central bank\u2019s interest rate decisions \u2014 as well as other issues of financial regulation.",
      "Board members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. But unlike cabinet secretaries \u2014 who serve at the pleasure of the president, for example \u2014 Fed governors take on 14-year terms that are staggered in an effort to insulate the Fed from political influence.",
      "The political independence of the Fed is considered critical to its ability to fight inflation because it enables the central bank to take unpopular steps, like raising interest rates. If bond investors start to lose faith that the Fed will be able to control inflation, they will demand higher rates to own bonds \u2014 pushing up borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and business loans.",
      "The Trump administration has accused Cook of mortgage fraud.",
      "Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who heads the Federal Housing Finance Agency, made the accusations last week \u2014 alleging that Cook had claimed two primary residences, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta, in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.",
      "Critics say these accusations are being used as a tool by Trump to gain control of the Fed. And Pulte has raised similar allegations against others who have clashed with the president before \u2014 including Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who led Trump\u2019s first impeachment, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who who sued Trump\u2019s company over alleged fraud for falsifying records.",

      "Gas stations have run dry in some regions of Russia after Ukrainian drones struck refineries and other oil infrastructure in recent weeks, with motorists waiting in long lines and officials resorting to rationing or cutting off sales altogether.",
      "Wholesale prices on the St. Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange for A-95 gas \u2014 the highest octane \u2014 spiked to record highs last week, soaring to about 50% higher than in January, as demand soared from farmers seeking to bring in the harvest and Russians hitting the roads for their last big vacation of the summer.",
      "Russian media outlets reported fuel shortages are hitting consumers in several regions in the Far East and on the Crimean Peninsula, which was illegally annexed from Ukraine by Moscow in 2014.",
      "Media outlets in the Primorye region, which borders North Korea, reported long lines and prices of about 78 rubles per liter (approximately $3.58 per gallon) at gas stations in the area, where the average monthly wage is about $1,200. Journalists at local news outlet Primpress found other drivers trying to sell gas online for as much as 220 rubles per liter (about $10.12 per gallon).",
      "In the Kurilsky district of the Kuril Islands north of Japan, shortages of lower octane A-92 gas forced officials to halt public sales outright Monday. In Crimea, a popular resort area, some companies sold fuel only to holders of coupons or special cards.",
      "Russia is no stranger to gasoline price increases at the end of summer. But this year's shortages have been aggravated by Ukraine\u2019s attacks on oil refineries in the 3 1/2-year-old war. Larger, more concentrated attacks are causing more damage and hampering production, all timed to coincide with peak demand.",
      "Ukraine has targeted energy infrastructure before, but the recent strikes have been more successful, with more drones targeting a more concentrated group of facilities.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians are attacking an arc of refineries, starting from Ryazan, which is south of Moscow, all the way to Volgograd. That region is where people are driving through on their way to (resorts on) the Black Sea. That\u2019s the region where most of the harvest operations are going on. And that\u2019s also a rather densely populated region,\u201d Sergey Vakulenko, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told The Associated Press.",
      "Between Aug. 2 and Aug. 24, Ukraine attacked oil infrastructure at least 12 times, according to media reports. Of those attacks, at least 10 were targeting sites in the Ryazan-Volgograd arc in southwestern Russia.",
      "These attacks have damaged many oil refineries but have not destroyed them outright, Vakulenko said, adding that most of the facilities are extremely resilient against fires.",
      "But they can slow refinery activity, as shown by a fall in the intake of crude oil to be turned into diesel, gasoline or other products by roughly 200,000 to 250,000 barrels per day, said Gary Peach, oil markets analyst at Energy Intelligence.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just enough to make their gasoline industry feel some pain, especially during the high consumption months in the summer,\u201d he told AP. Gasoline production fell 8.6% in the first 19 days of August, compared with a year earlier, and diesel production was down 10.3%.",
      "Other war-related issues have caused even more consumer pain. Ukrainian drone strikes repeatedly have disrupted Russian transportation networks, particularly air traffic, causing more people to travel by car and increasing demand for gas, Vakulenko said.",
      "Inflation also has made it less profitable for suppliers who normally buy gasoline early in the year for sale in the higher-priced summer months, and many entrepreneurs simply decided not to bother this year, he said.",

      "To try to ease the shortage, Russia on July 28 paused gasoline exports, with the Energy Ministry hoping to continue restrictions into September. Oil company managers have been summoned to government meetings twice this month to discuss the shortages, Russian media reported.",
      "While officials appear to be concerned, the gasoline shortfall \u201cisn\u2019t system critical,\u201d Peach said.",
      "So far, the shortage remains confined to certain areas \u2014 the Far East and Crimea \u2014 because these regions usually are supplied by fewer refineries and present greater transportation demands.",
      "Moscow has been spared the latest gasoline price spike because it is well-supplied from major refineries in Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod, cities a few hours\u2019 drive away. The capital also has a refinery in the city itself.",
      "Yet Russia is not at immediate risk of grinding to a halt \u2014 even in more vulnerable regions, experts say. Although private drivers may feel some pain at the gas pump, most buses and trucks run on diesel, for which Russia has a surplus. The military, which largely uses diesel fuel, also is insulated from any shocks.",
      "Vakulenko wrote in a recent commentary that annual diesel production is \u201cmore than double than what is needed.\u201d",
      "That doesn't mean the situation still couldn't deteriorate. Refineries that make gasoline for Russia\u2019s domestic market also make diesel and other products for export \u2014 a vital source of income amid heavy Western sanctions.",
      "Industry observers say Ukraine's drones target key refinery equipment, including the distillation column that separates incoming crude oil into other products, including gasoline, diesel, fuel for ships and asphalt. If damaged, it must be repaired or replaced for the refinery to function. Repairs could be difficult if foreign parts are needed.",
      "The gasoline crisis is expected to ease by late September as demand subsides and the annual summer maintenance for many refineries is finished.",
      "Still, the crisis highlights a vulnerability on the home front that has the potential to be exploited further as drone warfare evolves.",

      "When Justine Siegal and Keith Stein envisioned the United States' first professional women's baseball league in 70 years, they wanted to do it right. So they examined the blueprints of successful women's leagues and studied the pitfalls that caused promising ventures to fail.",
      "Their research helped shape the Women's Professional Baseball League, launching next year, the latest in a wave of ventures looking to capitalize on the unprecedented rise in popularity of women's sports.",
      "For such a startup to be sustainable and profitable, mainstream recognition is key. Good salaries and financial incentives may attract star players who could draw crowds and all-important TV deals. But analysts warn that exposure on television doesn\u2019t guarantee success, and that a solid social media presence, strong branding and community development are imperative \u2014 along with a dose of good luck.",
      "At least eight women\u2019s pro leagues have launched in the past three years, including the WPBL, Unrivaled \u2014 a fast-paced 3-on-3 women's basketball league that debuted this year \u2014 and the Professional Women's Hockey League, seizing on rising viewership, bigger sponsorship deals and a fan base more eager than ever to support female athletes. Basketball is leading the surge, with college standouts like Caitlin Clark becoming household names and drawing record audiences for the WNBA.",
      "\u201cThere is a pipeline of women from around the world who are at the elite level and ready to showcase their abilities,\u201d said WPBL co-founder Siegal, the first woman to coach an MLB team, the Oakland Athletics, \"and there\u2019s a fan base ready to watch and ready to receive and cheer them on.\u201d",
      "Among the recent women's pro circuit additions are the PWHL, which wrapped up its second season in May, and soccer\u2019s Gainbridge Super League, which debuted last August. Volleyball entered the spotlight in 2024 with the launch of the Professional Volleyball Federation and League One Volleyball.",
      "Unrivaled, co-founded by WNBA stars Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart, finished its inaugural season with players' salaries averaging around $200,000 \u2014 the highest of any women\u2019s pro league. Fan engagement was high, with more than 11.9 million viewers tuning in to watch the games on TNT and truTV, signaling its long-term viability.",
      "\u201cOur strategy was very simple. We knew we could find success if we had the top players playing,\u201d said Unrivaled president Alex Bazzell, a basketball trainer and Collier\u2019s husband.",
      "\u201cThe pinnacle of women\u2019s sports, both from an economic standpoint and a star power standpoint, is women\u2019s basketball,\" Bazzell continued. \u201dSo we had this inherent advantage from day one with the star power to activate social media and all the things that we needed.\u201d",
      "While Unrivaled was able to leverage its players' popularity to fuel its success, launching a women\u2019s sports league has historically been an uphill climb. Leagues such as the WNBA and National Women's Soccer League have withstood years of hardship relative to their male counterparts.",
      "The WNBA, whose players have negotiated charter flights in recent years and are currently seeking major salary boosts, began 29 years ago fighting for support and visibility.",
      "\u201cThis is not an undertaking for the faint of heart,\u201d said Ed Desser, who has advised the NFL, NBA and PGA Tour on media rights. \u201cYou have to not only have a bunch of things going for you, but also be fairly lucky. Because today, you\u2019re not only competing with every existing sport, but you\u2019re competing, from a media consumption standpoint, with libraries full of the best content TV and film ever created.\u201d",
      "The environment for new women\u2019s sports ventures is far more favorable today than it once was, said Risa Isard, director of research and insights for Parity, a women\u2019s sports marketing platform.",
      "The rise of streaming services has opened new pathways to reach fans directly, bypassing traditional broadcast limitations and giving emerging leagues a better shot at building devoted audiences. Isard said there\u2019s also a wealth of data indicating women\u2019s sports can deliver strong returns, proving \u201cwomen\u2019s sports can be good business.\"",
      "Explosive growth in attendance and viewership in part led to the NWSL's $240 million, four-year media rights deal in 2023. The WNBA followed with an 11-year media rights deal in 2024, when the league had its best attendance in more than 20 years and saw viewership nearly triple from 2023.",

      "Beyond driving fan engagement, many women\u2019s sports leagues prioritize the wellness and needs of athletes. The six Unrivaled teams play all their games in a custom-built arena in Miami to help build a fan base and sense of community, while the league covers the cost of players\u2019 housing, rental cars and child-care. LOVB president Rosie Spaulding underscored the long-term importance of being athlete-centered, noting that LOVB athletes are considered league employees and have access to year-round health care.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s for sure more that needs to be done,\u201d Spaulding said, \u201cbut I am very encouraged with the path that we\u2019re on already and the changes that we\u2019ve seen over these last five years, and the return on investment that these brands continue to see.\u201d",

      "Also, the Chinese government said industrial profits fell 1.7% in January-July from a year earlier, although that was an improvement from a 2.8% drop in the first half of the year. In July, profits fell 1.5% year-on-year, it said.",

The Fed has held rates steady since late 2024 over worries that Trump's unpredictable tariff policies will reignite inflation.

      "The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in late 2024 after spending the last several years fighting rising inflation by raising interest rates. It managed to mostly tame inflation and avoided having those higher rates stall economic growth, thanks largely to strong consumer spending and a resilient job market.",
      "The Fed hit the pause button heading into 2025 over concerns that higher tariffs imposed by Trump could reignite inflation. Lower interest rates make borrowing easier, helping to spur more investment and spending, but that could also potentially fuel inflation. However, concerns are deepening over the jobs market.",

      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Police in Haiti announced Tuesday that they regained control of a critical telecommunications hub that heavily armed gangs had seized last week, briefly disrupting air traffic and internet connections.",
      "The takeover was a rare success for Haitian authorities and a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police that have struggled to push back powerful gangs seeking full control of the capital, Port-au-Prince.",
      "The police operation at the T\u00e9l\u00e9co site in the once peaceful community of Kenscoff began before dawn on Monday and lasted about two hours, according to Michel-Ange Louis Jeune, spokesperson for Haiti\u2019s National Police.",
      "\u201cThis is a strong message that the new police chief sent,\u201d he said, referring to Andr\u00e9 Jonas Vladimir Paraison, who was appointed to the post earlier this month.",
      "Jeune did not take questions during the news conference and did not say how many people, if any, were killed during the operation.",

      "The attack was blamed on Viv Ansanm, a powerful gang federation that struck other key government infrastructure last year and was designated as a foreign terror organization by the U.S. earlier this year. Early last year, gunmen forced Haiti\u2019s main international airport to close for nearly three months and raided the country\u2019s two biggest prisons, releasing some 4,000 inmates.",
      "In the video where gunmen raided T\u00e9l\u00e9co last week, Didi called on the government to hand out bullets to police so they could come and go after gang members.",

      "California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way all three states are enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump's executive orders. He said the department was also already reviewing states' enforcement before the crash.",
      "Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can't demonstrate English proficiency, and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash should not have been given a commercial driver's license because of his immigration status. The crash has become increasingly political, with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the administration's immigration concerns in interviews.",
      "But Duffy said it is a safety issue \u2014 not a political one \u2014 because truckers need to be able to tell law enforcement what they are hauling if they are pulled over or what happened if there is an accident.",
      "\u201cWe all use the roadway, and we need to make sure that those who are driving big rigs \u2014 semis \u2014 can understand the road signs, that they\u2019ve been well trained,\u201d Duffy said.",
      "The Transportation Department said California has conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.",
      "Duffy cited similar statistics for the other states, with Washington finding more than 6,000 violations of safety rules during inspections, but only pulling four drivers out of service for English language violations. He said New Mexico has not placed any drivers out of service since the rules took effect.",
      "Duffy said the states will lose money from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program if they don\u2019t comply with the rules within 30 days \u2014 $33 million for California, $10.5 million for Washington and $7 million for New Mexico.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office said on the social platform X that the Trump administration is just trying to deflect responsibility for the crash.",
      "\u201cThis is rich,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Trump Administration approved the federal work permit for the man who killed 3 people \u2014 and now they\u2019re scrambling to shift blame after getting caught. Sean\u2019s nonsense announcement is as big a joke as the Trump Administration itself.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the state's process for issuing commercial licenses includes a mandatory English component to ensure divers can read and understand traffic signals.",
      "\u201cWe are aware of recent claims regarding the enforcement of these regulations and are actively seeking more information,\u201d Michael Coleman said via email. \u201cInitial reports suggest that these claims relate to a small number of roadside incidents over a three-month period.\u201d",

He said New Mexico should have pulled Singh off the road for not speaking English after he was pulled over in July because he later failed a test given by DOT investigators after the Florida crash.",

      "As the ever-growing crop of new women\u2019s leagues aim for longevity, the question of team branding \u2014 which encompasses the nicknames and the color schemes and logos \u2014 is front and center",
      "On a cold day in the beginning of 2024, Alastair Merry and Mary Lou Bunn had a few questions for a public librarian in Ottawa, Ontario.",
      "\u201cIf you could describe Ottawa and what it means to you in a couple words, how would you do it?\u201d they asked. \u201cWhat do you think of the spirit of the city?\u201d",
      "Merry and Bunn, along with the design firm Flower Shop that they co-founded, were hired by the then newly minted Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League to create the nicknames and logos for the league\u2019s inaugural six teams. They were traveling around North America to figure out what made those six cities tick.",
      "As the ever-growing crop of new women\u2019s leagues \u2014 at least eight have launched in the past three years \u2014 all aim for longevity, one of the cornerstones of any sustainable foundation is team branding. It encompasses everything from the nicknames to the color schemes and logos, and the PWHL has set a high bar there that other up-and-comers would love to emulate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like branding a dishwasher or a tablet,\u201d Merry said. \u201cThis is somebody\u2019s community. This is somebody\u2019s life, going to watch these games.\u201d",
      "Successful leagues need legions of fans who will buy the merchandise, learn the chants and pass along their fandom. Strong team branding is central to all of that. The PWHL has only been around a few years, but its early success with fans has made it an interesting case study.",
      "The league\u2019s first season, which opened Jan. 1, 2024, was played without nicknames or logos. The names and designs, created by Merry and Bunn's group, were released ahead of the second season.",
      "That release had an impact, according to Kanan Bhatt-Shah, vice president of brand and marketing for the PWHL. When fans finally had their teams' identities at their fingertips, their involvement could grow deeper.",
      "\u201cThese identities really help create this world that allows fans to access it in all the different ways in which they want to fan,\u201d Bhatt-Shah said. \u201cThe same level of passion and fervor that existed (in the first season) still exists, there\u2019s just more opportunities for it to come to life cohesively.\u201d",
      "By creating those opportunities, whether it be through merchandise or chants that become tradition, good branding has the potential to turn the initial enthusiasm for a new league into long-term fandom \u2014 and, thus, a long-term league.",
      "And in the PWHL, it seems like fans are buying in. The league\u2019s second season was bigger than the first in every measurable way \u2014 sales of PWHL merchandise doubled, engagement with league and team social platforms increased by 68% and average attendance jumped by 27% per outing due in part to Toronto and Montreal playing in larger venues, and a nine-game neutral site tour drawing 123,601 at NHL arenas.",
      "The league's media rights arrangement, which lacks a major consolidated television deal, did not face major changes from the first season to the second.",
      "\u201cWhen you set a foundation for a sports team, it creates the subsets that continue to feed into the brand,\u201d Bunn said about branding ripple effects. \u201cThen you have fan groups, you have chants, you eventually have mascots. \u2026 Over time, there are things that come out of having a strong brand foundation.\u201d",

      "The PWHL branding \"is spot on with almost everything there,\u201d O'Grady added.",
      "The PWHL notably differs from its WNBA predecessor in the nature of its relationship with the sport's male league. While the PWHL and NHL occasionally share rinks or lend each other marketing opportunities, the two leagues have no financial ties to each other \u2014 a large difference from the WNBA, which is partially owned and funded by the NBA.",
      "The PWHL's funding comes from the Mark Walter group, named for the league's billionaire owner.",
      "And it's expanding. The heavy lift of branding is starting all over again with the PWHL\u2019s two new expansion teams, Seattle and Vancouver. They are eagerly awaiting their own nicknames and logos, which are expected to bring another surge of enthusiasm.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re waiting to get that new jersey, the new hat, the new scarf, all those things that go with it that have the logo,\u201d PWHL Seattle coach Steve O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThat\u2019ll drive another wave for us.\u201d",
      "The two expansion teams will take the ice for the first time this fall when the puck drops on the PWHL\u2019s third season.",

      "Venmo announced a partnership Tuesday with the NCAA to support athletes who face harassment on the payment app, which has embraced its popularity on college campuses with school spirit-branded debit cards and an option for athletes to receive money from their school directly in the PayPal app.",
      "The partnership includes a reporting hotline for athletes and the NCAA to call in potential cases of abuse, such as when former Auburn quarterback Payton Thorne said he received payment requests from angry sports bettors following a loss last season.",
      "\u201cThe harassment we are seeing across various online platforms is unacceptable, and we need fans to do better,\" NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a news release. \u201cWe applaud Venmo for taking action, and we need more social media companies and online platforms to do the same.\u201d",

      "\u201cVenmo will monitor student-athletes\u2019 accounts on an ongoing basis to help mitigate an influx of requests based on game performance and work directly with them to implement additional security measures as needed,\u201d the news release said.",
      "The payment app in July announced Big 12-branded debit cards with special perks, leaning into its belief that Venmo plays \u201can integral role in the way millions of college students, athletes, alumni, and fans engage with each other and move money in their daily lives.\u201d",

      "Low-value imports are losing their duty-free status in the U.S. this week as part of President Donald Trump's agenda for making the nation less dependent on foreign goods",
      "NEW YORK -- Low-value imports are losing their duty-free status in the United States this week as part of President Donald Trump's agenda for making the nation less dependent on foreign goods and resetting global trade with tariffs.",
      "An executive order signed last month eliminates a widely used customs exemption for international shipments worth $800 or less starting Friday, nearly two years earlier than the deadline set in the tax cuts and spending bill approved by Congress.",
      "Although the president previously ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d rule for inexpensive items sent from China and Hong Kong, having to pay import taxes on small parcels from everywhere else likely will be a big change for some small businesses and online shoppers.",
      "Purchases that previously entered the U.S. without needing to clear customs will require vetting and be subject to their origin country's applicable tariff rate, which can range from 10% to 50%. For the next six months, carriers handling orders sent through the global mail network also can choose a flat duty of $80 to $200 per package instead of the value-based rate.",
      "In response, the national postal services of more than a dozen countries said they would temporarily suspend sending some or most U.S.-bound packages due to confusion over processing and payment requirements. Japan and Switzerland on Monday joined Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Thailand, the U.K. and New Zealand in saying they would pause shipments.",
      "The Trump administration says the exemption has become a loophole that foreign businesses exploit to evade tariffs and criminals use to get drugs, counterfeit products and other contraband into the U.S. Former President Joe Biden and members of Congress also discussed the issue.",
      "Other countries have similar exemptions, but the threshold is usually lower. For example, 150 euros ($129) is the value limit in the 20 European Union countries that use the euro as their official currency. The U.K. allows foreign businesses to send parcels worth up to 135 pounds ($182) without incurring tariff charges.",
      "In the U.S., the \u201cde minimis\u201d \u2014 Latin for lacking significance or importance \u2014 exemption started in 1938 as a way to save the federal government the time and expense of collecting duties on imported goods with a retail value of $1 or less. U.S. lawmakers eventually increased the eligibility cutoff to $5 in 1990, to $200 in 1993 and to $800 in 2015, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Since then, the number of shipments claiming de minimis treatment has exploded. A total of 1.36 billion packages with a combined value of $64.6 billion reached the U.S. last year, compared to 134 million packages sent under the exemption in 2015, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency reported.",
      "About 60% of the 2024 shipments came from China and Hong Kong, according to an analysis logistics firm Flexport prepared based on U.S. government data. Multiple countries and regions accounted for the remainder, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union, India and Vietnam.",
      "Proponents of limiting the exemption argue that it has served as a way for China-founded retail platforms like Temu and Shein to flood the U.S. with low-priced goods. The National Council of Textile Organizations said the move would help close a \"backdoor pipeline for cheap, subsidized, and often illegal, toxic and unethical imports.\u201d But some smaller American companies that rely on imported products and materials benefited from the exemption too.",
      "Kristin Trainor is worried the end of de minimis will also mean the end of Diesel and Lulu's, her 3-year-old boutique in Avon, Connecticut. Over 70% of the women's clothes and accessories she stocks comes from small fashion houses in France, Italy and Spain. Trainor places small batch orders each week that fall under the $800 threshold.",

      "After a corporate career, Trainor opened the store to have more time with her 9-year-old son and her 91-year old father.

      "Knight estimated that she would need to raise the retail price of the rugby goggles she gets from Italy by 50%. It took the International Rugby Board two years of testing to approve the Italian-made goggles, a specialty item without strong prospects for stateside production, she said.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- U.S. production of crucial components in electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets is set to expand rapidly in the coming years, as the Trump administration intensifies efforts to build up the critical mineral industry in the United States to work to break the chokehold that China has on the global supply chain.",
      "The federal government is pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into American companies, has made an agreement with one firm to set a minimum price for some U.S.-produced critical minerals, and has launched an investigation into foreign-made supplies.",
      "\"This is the Manhattan Project moment for rare earths,\" said Joshua Ballard, CEO of USA Rare Earth, which plans next year to start making the rare-earth magnets that appear in many products.",
      "The White House has made it a priority to revive the domestic critical minerals industry, which is proving urgent after Beijing leveraged its near-monopoly on the products to force the U.S. to the negotiating table during a trade war.",
      "President Donald Trump said this week that China \u201cintelligently went and they sort of took a monopoly of the world's magnets,\" but he expressed confidence in securing supplies because the U.S. has \u201cmuch bigger and better cards.\"",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot of magnets in a pretty short period of time. In fact, we'll have so many, we won\u2019t know what to do with them,\u201d he said as he hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.",
      "Industry insiders, analysts and lawmakers have warned for years that America\u2019s dependence on China for critical minerals \u2014 a list of 50 minerals that includes 17 sought-after rare-earth elements \u2014 is a national vulnerability.",
      "The hard-to-pronounce elements are needed in smartphones, wind turbines and robots as well as missiles, submarines and fighter jets.",
      "\u201cOur national and economic security are now acutely threatened by our reliance upon hostile foreign powers\u2019 mineral production,\u201d an executive order from Trump declared in March.",
      "It was not until Beijing rolled out export restrictions on several rare earths in April \u2014 leading to a temporary halt of Ford\u2019s electric vehicle production \u2014 that \"the problem that for over a decade seemed far away hit close to home,\u201d said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Trump said Monday that he could charge 200% tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing does not export magnets to the U.S. but noted \u201cthat\u2019s perhaps behind us.\u201d Instead, he said he could withhold airplane parts to ground China\u2019s American-made Boeing jets.",
      "When asked about the leverage, Guo Jiakun, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said Tuesday that Beijing \u201cfollows the principle of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation\u201d in dealing with the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe hope the U.S. will work with us to jointly promote the steady, sound and sustainable development of bilateral ties,\u201d Guo said.",
      "The Pentagon is investing $400 million in rare-earth producer MP Materials. It gave the U.S. company a $150 million loan this month, has promised to ensure every magnet made at its massive new plant is bought and set a minimum price for its neodymium and praseodymium products for a decade.",
      "\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re going to finally do something to address that issue and make these projects a reality,\u201d said Mark Smith, CEO of NioCorp, an American company working to raise $1.2 billion to produce niobium, titanium, scandium and rare earths in Nebraska.",
      "Over four decades, Smith said he's seen how the U.S. ceded the industry to China, which came to dominate the supply chain by brushing aside environmental concerns, investing in mines worldwide, developing advanced processing technology and setting low prices to squeeze out competition.",

      "\u201cI certainly hope and think it actually is not what may be the last of the efforts by the U.S. government,\u201d Noveon Magnetics CEO Scott Dunn said of the Pentagon-MP Materials partnership.",
      "Even with all the new production aiming to come online in the next few years, American companies are still nowhere near being able to satisfy North America's demand for roughly 35,000 tons of magnets a year, analysts at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence estimate. And the demand could double in the next decade.",
      "Ballard, whose USA Rare Earth plans to start making about 600 tons of magnets in Oklahoma next year, said the government can provide incentives to stop American buyers from falling back on cheap Chinese products once they are widely available again.",

A peace deal the administration helped broker between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda might provide access to critical minerals, but it\u2019s too early to tell if those efforts will succeed.",
      "Derek Scissors, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said he\u2019s concerned that Trump could consider it a success if China agrees to guarantee rare-earth supplies in trade talks.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The prospects for additional consolidation in the rail industry derailed this week when both of CSX's potential partners said they weren't interested in a deal.",
      "Investors widely speculated that CSX would be an acquisition target once rumors of merger talks between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern emerged over the summer, because of the challenge of competing against a nationwide railroad.",
      "CSX's stock nearly hit a new 52-week high last week at $37.25 before falling to $32.31 Tuesday after it became clear that neither BNSF nor CPKC railroads is pursuing the Jacksonville, Florida-based railroad, one of the six remaining major freight railroads in North America.",
      "The Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern deal still faces a lengthy review by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board that is likely to stretch on for at least two years. When Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern two years ago in the first major rail merger in more than two decades the board also spent two years reviewing that deal.",
      "If the $85 billion megamerger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern does get approved that might change the calculus about whether a deal makes sense. But in the meantime, CSX and the other major freight railroads seem focused on finding ways to cooperate more to improve service without merging.",
      "Just last week, CSX and BNSF announced an agreement to deliver some shipments seamlessly coast-to-coast without handing them off. Last month, CPKC and CSX announced a similar agreement to streamline shipments between Mexico, Texas and the Southeast.",
      "CPKC CEO Keith Creel said he thinks the industry should be more focused on agreements like that and efforts to improve service on each individual railroad.",

      "Indeed, the STB adopted a high standard for rail mergers in 2001 after a series of prolonged disruptions and delayed shipments that followed major deals in the 1990s. A merger between Union Pacific and Southern Pacific in 1996 led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, creating serious backups in the East.",
      "On Monday, Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate owns BNSF, said to CNBC that he's not interested in buying another railroad even though he's sitting on more than $344 billion in cash after several years without completing a major acquisition. Buffett and the man who will take over as Berkshire CEO in January, Greg Abel, did recently meet with CSX CEO Joe Hinrichs to discuss more ways to cooperate while making it clear that Berkshire won't be bidding on CSX.",
      "So CSX is going to have a hard time satisfying the demands of the Ancora Holdings fund and other investors who are putting pressure on the railroad to make a deal. Ancora sent a letter to the CSX board earlier this month urging them to act quickly to make a deal with another railroad or fire Hinrichs as CEO and reform the railroad to improve results.",
      "CSX said in a statement that the railroad's board remains \u201claser focused on exploring any and all opportunities to enhance shareholder value, drive profitable growth and provide industry leading customer service.\u201d That echoes what Hinrichs said when CSX reported earnings earlier in July.",

      "Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook's lawyer says she'll sue President Donald Trump's administration to try to prevent him from firing her",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook will sue President Donald Trump's administration to try to prevent him from firing her, her lawyer said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook,\u201d said Abbe Lowell, a longtime Washington lawyer who has represented figures from both major political parties. \"His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis. We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action.\u201d",
      "The case is likely to end up at the Supreme Court and could more clearly define the limits of the president's legal authority over the traditionally independent institution. The Fed exercises expansive power over the U.S. economy by adjusting a short-term interest rate that can influence broader borrowing costs for things like mortgages, auto loans, and business loans. Trump, a Republican, has repeatedly demanded that Chair Jerome Powell and the Fed's rate-setting committee cut its rate to boost the economy and reduce interest payments on the government's $37 trillion debt pile.",
      "If Trump succeeds in removing Cook from the Fed's board of governors, it could erode the Fed\u2019s political independence, which is considered critical to its ability to fight inflation because it enables the Fed to take unpopular steps like raising interest rates. A less-independent Fed could leave Americans paying higher interest rates, because investors would demand a higher yield to own bonds to offset potentially greater inflation in the future, pushing up borrowing costs throughout the economy.",
      "Trump appointed two members of the board, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, in his first term and has named Steven Miran, a top White House economist, to replace Gov. Adriana Kugler, who stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1. If Miran's nomination is approved by the Senate and Trump is able to replace Cook, he would have a 4-3 majority on the Fed's board, which votes on all interest rate decisions, along with five of the Fed's 12 regional bank presidents.",
      "Legal experts say the Republican president\u2019s claim that he can fire Cook, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022, is on shaky ground. But it\u2019s an unprecedented move that hasn\u2019t played out in the courts before, and the Supreme Court this year has been much more willing to let the president remove agency officials than in the past.",
      "\u201cIt's an illegal firing, but the president\u2019s going to argue, \u2018The Constitution lets me do it,\u2019\u201d said Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University and author of a book about the Fed. \u201cAnd that argument\u2019s worked in a few other cases so far this year.\u201d",
      "Menand said the Supreme Court construes the Constitution's meaning, and \u201cit can make new constitutional law in this case.\u201d",
      "Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week. Pulte alleged that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and in Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those bought to rent.",
      "The most likely next step for Cook is to seek an injunction against Trump's order that would allow her to continue her work as a governor. But the situation puts the Fed in a difficult position.",
      "\u201cThey have their own legal obligation to follow the law,\u201d Menand said. \u201cAnd that does not mean do whatever the president says. ... The Fed is under an independent duty to reach its own conclusions about the legality of Lisa Cook\u2019s removal.\u201d",
      "The Fed has declined to comment on Trump's effort to fire Cook.",
      "Trump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social platform late Monday that he was removing Cook effective immediately because of allegations she committed mortgage fraud.",

      "Donald Trump has a message for critics who think turning the U.S. government into a major stockholder of Intel is a \u201csocialist\u201d move: More is coming",
      "NEW YORK -- Donald Trump has a message for critics who think turning the U.S. government into a major stockholder of Intel is a \u201csocialist\u201d move: More is coming.",
      "\u201cI will make deals like that for our Country all day long,\" the president posted on Truth Social after critics piled on, adding later about future ownership stakes, \u201cI want to try and get as much as I can.\"",
      "One possible target: defense contractors, whom Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC Tuesday were ripe for the picking given the U.S. government is a big customer.",
      "Free-market conservatives were already wary of Trump's tendency to interfere in corporate decision-making by, for example, telling Apple where it should make iPhones, or even demanding a cut of Nvidia's sales of chips to China. But the Intel move is a startling defiance of Republican orthodoxy that says governments shouldn't try to pick corporate winners and losers and risk messing things up as owners by rewarding executives for politically smart but financially stupid decisions.",
      "The U.S. government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges, making it one of Intel's largest shareholders.",
      "\u201cIf socialism is government owning the means of production, wouldn\u2019t the government owning part of Intel be a step toward socialism?\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul said in a post on X. \u201cTerrible idea.\u201d",
      "Scott Lincicome, a Cato Institute trade expert, says Intel could end up making decisions now to please Trump even if they're impractical, say, by going ahead with plans to open a long-promised chipmaking factory in Ohio. And even short-term gains from government ownership, such as more companies buying Intel semiconductors, will hurt business in the end by saddling those companies with inferior chips.",
      "\u201cIntel might simply gain customers from folks that are looking to stay on Trump\u2019s good side,\" he said. \u201cBut innovation requires ruthless competition, an endless drive for an advantage \u2014 and now they might accept a disadvantage because they need the political win.\u201d",
      "Many Republicans remained silent on the issue, prompting others to suggest they are free market hypocrites.",
      "\u201cFor so many of my self-described true conservatives, you\u2019re going to have to explain to me how this reconciles with true conservatism and true free-market capitalism,\u201d Republican North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis told CBS in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t see it.\u201d",
      "Early last year, the Biden administration agreed to provide Intel with billions of dollars in funding under the CHIPS Act for it to build semiconductor manufacturing factories around the country, part of a plan to produce 20% of the world\u2019s most advanced chips in the U.S. by 2030, up from zero at the time.",
      "Trump argues that he got the Intel stake for free by converting $11.1 billion of funding into the equity stake. He also notes that Intel shares shot higher after he struck the deal Friday, handing a big win to U.S. taxpayers.",
      "\u201cI love seeing their stock price go up, making the USA RICHER, AND RICHER,\u201d Trump posted Monday morning before the stock trading began. \u201cMore jobs for America!!! Who would not want to make deals like that?\u201d",
      "The price of Intel stock fell slightly both Monday and Tuesday, and investors have reason to be cautious.",
      "In a filing to its investors after the deal was announced, Intel warned that it may lose overseas customers reluctant to buy from a U.S. government-owned business. The company has lost more than $22 billion since the start of 2023 after largely missing out on the frenzy surrounding artificial intelligence.",
      "James Secreto, a former Biden administration official who helped hammer out the CHIPS Act grants, said a falling stock price is a big danger given Trump's tendency to measure his success and failure by gyrations in the public market and his willingness to jawbone companies to do things to help him politically.",

In July, he spent $400 million of taxpayer money on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Then earlier this month came his deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.",

      "A 2025 analysis from Edmunds reveals that nearly 20% of new car buyers are committing to monthly payments of $1,000 or more",
      "Buying a new car has never been more financially daunting. A 2025 analysis from Edmunds found that a record 19.3% of consumers who financed a new vehicle in the second quarter of 2025 committed to a monthly payment of $1,000 or more. That\u2019s nearly one in five buyers taking on what was once considered an extreme car payment \u2014 driven by high interest rates and rising vehicle prices.",
      "While it might be tempting to stretch your budget for the car you want, locking yourself into a high-cost loan can be a painful mistake. Before you sign, here are five common car-buying missteps to avoid.",
      "There\u2019s a difference between being able to buy something and being able to afford it wisely. With an average new vehicle transaction price of approximately $49,000, many buyers are truly stretching their budgets. It\u2019s not uncommon to see buyers opt for extended 72-month or 84-month financing terms.",
      "That shiny SUV might seem within reach thanks to flexible financing, but the long-term hit to your financial health could be considerable. Buying within your means \u2014 ideally targeting a loan term of no more than 60 months and keeping your car-related expenses under 15%-20% of your monthly take-home pay \u2014 is smart shopping in an era of rising interest rates and ever-increasing car prices.",
      "One of the most costly and common mistakes car buyers make is waiting until they\u2019re sitting in the dealership finance office to think about a loan. Dealerships may offer convenience, but their financing may include marked-up interest rates or hidden fees.",
      "Instead, walk into the dealership with a preapproved loan offer from your bank, credit union or an online lender. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, this move can save buyers hundreds to thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. When you do this, the dealer can still try to beat the rate \u2014 and sometimes will. But now you\u2019re negotiating from a position of strength, not desperation.",
      "If you owe more on your current car than it\u2019s worth \u2014 a situation known as negative equity \u2014 trading it in for a new vehicle can be a financial landmine. This commonly happens when people take out a six-year loan, trade in the vehicle after just three or four years, and carry the previous balance into the new vehicle. Rolling that deficit into a new loan just worsens the problem, guaranteeing that you\u2019ll be underwater for even longer.",
      "According to Edmunds, 28.2% of trade-ins in July 2025 involved negative equity, and the average amount buyers owed above the vehicle\u2019s value was $6,902. That sets the stage for a vicious cycle, especially if buyers trade cars frequently or face unexpected job loss or repair costs. If you\u2019re in this situation, consider keeping your car longer or making extra payments. If you can get a better rate, even refinancing can get you back to breakeven.",

      "Buying new is tempting \u2014 it smells great, it\u2019s under warranty, and no one else has touched it. But it\u2019s not always the smartest financial move. Today\u2019s certified pre-owned vehicles often come with extended factory warranties, undergo rigorous inspections, and cost thousands less than their new counterparts. The rapid depreciation of most new vehicles only worsens the picture. Most lose 20%\u201330% of their value in the first year alone, according to Edmunds. Avoiding that depreciation hit can save thousands.",

Avoiding these five common mistakes won\u2019t just save you money \u2014 it has the potential to help ensure your long-term financial security. Take your time and do your homework.

      "The Browns traded Pickett to Las Vegas on Monday night for a fifth-round draft pick in 2026, giving the Raiders a proven backup quarterback and clearing the way for two rookies to back up Joe Flacco in Cleveland.",
      "It's the third time in less than 18 months that Pickett has been traded. He was the 20th overall pick by Pittsburgh in the 2022 draft and started 24 games in two seasons for the Steelers before being dealt to Philadelphia in 2024.",
      "Pickett will back up Geno Smith in Las Vegas after Aidan O\u2019Connell broke his right wrist in Saturday\u2019s preseason game at Arizona.",
      "The Eagles won the Super Bowl last season, when Pickett was the backup to Jalen Hurts. He was traded to Cleveland in March for Dorian Thompson-Robinson and a fifth-round pick.",
      "Cleveland signed Flacco one month later and drafted Dillon Gabriel in the third round and Shedeur Sanders in the fifth.",
      "Pickett suffered a hamstring injury on July 26 and didn't play in the preseason. Coach Kevin Stefanski had said he expected Pickett to be available for Cleveland\u2019s Sept. 7 opener against Cincinnati.",
      "Stefanski did not name a backup last week when Flacco was named the Week 1 starter, but Gabriel would likely fill that role if the Browns don't sign another QB. Cleveland released Tyler Huntley on Sunday, but he could be an option if the Browns want a veteran with starting experience.",
      "O\u2019Connell will miss six to eight weeks for Las Vegas, and coach Pete Carroll made it clear that the Raiders would pursue another quarterback because he said rookie Cam Miller wasn\u2019t ready to be the No. 2.",

We have Cam and Cam hasn\u2019t played in the league much, so we\u2019re looking for an experienced player that could help us.\u201d",

      "Coco Gauff has won her first match since enlisting someone to help with her shaky serving and moved into the second round at the U.S. Open",
      "NEW YORK -- Coco Gauff's first match since enlisting someone to help with her shaky serving got off to a rocky start at the U.S. Open on Tuesday night. She double-faulted in the very first game \u2014 and a total of 10 times. She got broken in that game, too \u2014 and a total of six times.",
      "The only numbers that truly counted in the end, of course, were the ones on the Arthur Ashe Stadium scoreboard, and those showed that the No. 3-seeded Gauff held on for a 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 victory over Ajla Tomljanovic to reach the second round at Flushing Meadows.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best,\u201d Gauff said, \u201cbut I'm happy to get through.\u201d",
      "Nothing came easily. Gauff twice led by a break in the second set but couldn't end things. She went up 5-3 in the third and served for the victory at 5-4, but double-faulted twice in a row and missed a pair of forehands to make it 5-all.",
      "\u201cStaying close also puts her under pressure to serve it out,\u201d Tomljanovic said. \u201cIn the first round, even if you're Coco, it's never easy.\u201d",
      "That slip-up could have been too much to take for Gauff. Instead, she steadied herself, broke right back, then was able to serve it out on her second chance to do so, nearly three full hours after the contest began.",
      "\u201cI had so many chances. \u2026 I was just like, \u2018Eventually, one of these is going to go my way,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Gauff, who won the first of her two Grand Slam titles at the 2023 U.S. Open as a teenager, added Gavin MacMillan to her coaching team shortly before the start of this tournament. MacMillan is a biomechanics expert who helped current No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka retool her serve a few years ago, and he was in the first row of Gauff\u2019s guest box, seated right in front of her mother.",
      "After beating Tomljanovic, Gauff called her practices with MacMillan \u201creally tough\u201d and \u201cmentally exhausting.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was spending a lot of time on court, literally serving until, like, my shoulder was hurting,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s (going) in the right direction, and I think for me, it\u2019s trying not to go back to old habits in those tighter moments, and I think I did that today, especially in the third set.\u201d",
      "The problem for Gauff, in a nutshell, has been a propensity to accumulate double-faults. Her 320 entering the U.S. Open were the most on the women\u2019s tour this season \u2014 and more than 100 more than anyone else. That included 23 in one match earlier this month, then 14 the next time out.",

As the match progressed, and the tension rose, the 21-year-old from Florida reverted to her customary pace, going from averaging just 88 mph on first serves in the first set, to 97 mph in the second and 101 in the third, when Ashe's retractable roof was closed. She cranked one in at 117 mph and even produced one second-serve ace.",
      "What won this one against the 79th-ranked Tomljanovic, an Australian best known for defeating Serena Williams at the 2022 U.S. Open in the 23-time major champion\u2019s final match of her career, was Gauff's exemplary court coverage and terrific backhand. Appropriately, a down-the-line backhand converted match point, and Gauff waved her arms overhead to rile up the crowd.",

      "Right-hander Nathan Eovaldi is likely done for the season because of a rotator cuff strain, another huge blow to the Texas Rangers and their hopes of making a late push for a playoff spot.",
      "Eovaldi, 11-3 with a career-best 1.73 ERA but just short of the innings needed to qualify as the MLB leader, said Tuesday that he had an MRI after shutting down a bullpen session between starts because of continued soreness. The 35-year-old pitcher said he was more sore than normal but was surprised by those results since he hasn't had any shoulder issues in his 14 MLB seasons.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like it was getting a little worse, so I shut it down and had the trainers look at it,\" Eovaldi said. \u201cObviously, it's just frustrating given how great the season's been going. ... I don't want to rule out the rest of the season, but it's not looking very great.\u201d",
      "Chris Young, the team\u2019s president of baseball operations, said Eovaldi likely will be put on the 15-day injured list Wednesday. That is the day Eovaldi was scheduled to make his 23rd start, against the Los Angeles Angels with another opportunity to be MLB\u2019s qualified ERA leader.",
      "After allowing one run in seven innings against Cleveland in his last start Friday, Eovaldi was the official ERA leader for one night. That put him at 130 innings in 130 Rangers games, and ahead of All-Star starters Paul Skenes (2.07) and Tarik Skubal (2.28) until the Texas played the following day \u2014 pitchers need one inning per team game to qualify.",
      "\u201cObviously it\u2019s a big blow. He\u2019s been just a tremendous teammate and competitor for us all year long,\u201d Young said. \u201cHate to see this happen to somebody who\u2019s been so important to the organization. But it seems par for the course with how some of the season has gone. So hate it for Evo, hate it for the team.\u201d",
      "With 29 games remaining going into Tuesday night, the Rangers were 5 1/2 games back of Seattle for the American League's last wild-card spot. The Mariners and Kansas City, which was between the AL West rivals in those standings, both hold tiebreakers over Texas.",
      "The Rangers lost center fielder Evan Carter because of a right wrist fracture when he was hit by a pitch in Kansas City on Thursday. That is the same game that durable second baseman Marcus Semien fouled a pitch off the top of his left foot, sending him to the IL for only the second time in his 13 MLB seasons. First baseman Jake Burger (left wrist sprain) also went on the IL during that road trip.",
      "Semien and Eovaldi could potentially return if the Rangers make the playoffs and go on a deep run since neither are expected to need surgery. Semien's recovery timeline is four to six weeks, and Eovaldi said he would get another MRI in about four weeks. Just under five weeks remain until the regular-season finale Sept. 28 at Cleveland.",

      "Cadillac played it safe with its first Formula 1 lineup, bypassing an American driver for series veterans Valtteri Bottas and Sergio P\u00e9rez.",
      "Neither driver has seats on the grid this season but with a combined 16 wins and 527 starts between them, Bottas and P\u00e9rez were the pragmatic choices to help build the Cadillac program set to launch in 2026. The hires announced Tuesday bring years of F1 knowledge to Cadillac, a division of U.S. car giant General Motors that will become the 11th team on the grid in 2026.",
      "\u201cWe believe their experience, their leadership and their technical acumen are really what we need,\u201d said Dan Towriss, CEO of the Cadillac Formula 1 team and TWG Motorsports. \u201cIt's the right combination, the right drivers at the right time, and we're humbled by their belief in us and in this project.\u201d",
      "Bottas and P\u00e9rez have been considered the front-runners for months as drivers lobbied for two new seats on what will be a 22-car grid next year.",

      "Towriss bought Andretti out, the team is now owned by TWG Global, and Towriss and GM President Mark Reuss said in May at the Miami Grand Prix that hiring an American driver was no longer a top priority.",
      "IndyCar driver Colton Herta from California was earmarked for a seat by Andretti, but he's yet to earn the super license required to compete in F1 and Cadillac is content to wait for an American. Towriss also laughed at recent reports that he planned to move Herta to Formula 2 next year for Herta to gain the needed points for his license.",
      "Even if Herta did have a super license, he doesn't have the F1 experience Cadillac wants for its launch.",
      "\u201cWhat it comes back to is experience in Formula 1 carried the day,\u201d Towriss said. \"Everybody's new, everybody's working together for the first time. We think that the experience that these two bring are really what's most important.",
      "\u201cWe certainly do think about and it's important to us to make sure there's a pathway for an American driver in Formula 1 and we'll be working on that. For this inaugural season, for what the team needs, and what these drivers bring, this was the right combination for the team.\u201d",

      "Bottas was second in the standings to his then-Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton in 2019 and 2020, while P\u00e9rez, F1\u2019s most successful Mexican driver, was second when his Red Bull teammate Max Verstappen dominated 2023.",

      "Scientists are criticizing two key documents from the Trump administration that challenge the idea that climate change endangers the public",
      "WASHINGTON -- A Trump administration proposal to reverse a landmark finding that climate change is dangerous to the public relies heavily on a report from the Department of Energy that dozens of scientists say is flawed.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency is seeking to use the DOE's work to overturn the climate concept known as the \u201cendangerment finding.\u201d If the administration succeeds, many laws and rules aimed at reducing or restricting greenhouse gas emissions could be eliminated.",
      "The Associated Press surveyed scientists for their views. Here are some key takeaways from those who responded to AP's questions:",
      "The most common critique from 64 scientists who responded to questions from AP was that the administration\u2019s reports ignored, twisted or cherry-picked information to manufacture doubt about the severity and threat of climate change. Fifty-three of the 64 scientists criticized the quality of the reports.",
      "The Department of Energy report said Arctic sea ice has declined about 5% since 1980. That number is accurate for Antarctica, while Artic sea ice actually declined more than 40% in the period.",
      "Jennifer Marlon, director of data science at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, highlighted a section on U.S. wildfires that acknowledged that fire data from before 1960 isn't reliable for comparisons. Yet the administration used that unreliable data in a chart going back to 1920, leaving readers with the impression that wildfire rates were higher many decades ago than they are now, Marlon said.",
      "Experts repeatedly said the reports were biased. Nineteen scientists used variations of the phrase \u201ccherry pick\u201d to describe citations in the administration reports.",
      "Francois Bareille, a French economist, has done work concluding that previous estimates about climate-related crop losses in French agriculture were overly pessimistic. The administration\u2019s reports cited that work, but Bareille said it shouldn\u2019t have because it\u2019s wrong to generalize his findings to other regions.",
      "Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said the reports pulled a single figure from his work on climate modeling to build a case that the models scientists use are often overly pessimistic. Hausfather said his research actually concluded that climate models have performed quite well.",
      "He called the government\u2019s process a \u201cfarce.\u201d",
      "The authors of the report said any errors found will be corrected.",

      "A handful of scientists contacted by AP spoke positively about the report.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum.",
      "Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom.",
      "This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007.",
      "While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism.",
      "But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again.",
      "Investors were recently spooked by a combination of an MIT report that said 95% of AI pilots fail and comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman floating the idea that the artificial intelligence market is in a bubble.",

      "And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion.",
      "Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion.",
      "Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand.",
      "Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year.",
      "And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter.",
      "Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country \u2014 a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors.",

      "Efforts to restore the red-legged frog to Southern California, where it had all but disappeared, seemed doomed when the COVID-19 pandemic struck and restrictions were put in place at the U.S.-Mexico border",
      "THE SANTA ROSA PLATEAU ECOLOGICAL RESERVE, Calif. -- The scientist traipses to a pond wearing rubber boots but he doesn\u2019t enter the water. Instead, Brad Hollingsworth squats next to its swampy edge and retrieves a recording device the size of a deck of cards. He then opens it up and removes a tiny memory card containing 18 hours of sound.",
      "Back at his office at the San Diego Natural History Museum, the herpetologist \u2014 an expert in reptiles and amphibians \u2014 uses artificial intelligence to analyze the data on the card. Within three minutes, he knows a host of animals visit the pond \u2014 where native red-legged frogs were reintroduced after largely disappearing in Southern California. There were owl hoots, woodpecker pecks, coyote howls and tree frog ribbits. But no croaking from the invasive bullfrog, which has decimated the native red-legged frog population over the past century.",
      "It was another good day in his efforts to increase the population of the red-legged frog and restore an ecosystem spanning the U.S.-Mexico border. The efforts come as the Trump administration builds more walls along the border, raising concerns about the impact on wildlife.",
      "At 2 to 5 inches long (5 to 13 centimeters), red-legged frogs are the largest native frogs in the West and once were found in abundance up and down the California coast and into Baja California in Mexico.",
      "The species is widely believed to be the star of Mark Twain\u2019s 1865 short story, \u201cThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\" and their crimson hind legs were eaten during the Gold Rush. But as the red-legged frog declined in numbers, the bullfrog \u2014 with its even bigger hind legs \u2014 was introduced to menus during California's booming growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",
      "The red-legged frog population was decimated by the insatiable appetite of the bullfrogs and the disease the non-native species brought in, but also because it lost much of its habitat to drought and human development in the shape of homes, dams and more.",
      "Hollingsworth couldn't estimate the number of red-legged frogs that remain, but said they have disappeared from 95% of their historical range in Southern California.",
      "Robert Fisher of the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative Program searched for the frog for decades across some 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Los Angeles to the border. He found just one in 2001 and none after that.",
      "Scientists using DNA from red-legged frogs captured in Southern California before their disappearance discovered they were more genetically similar to the population in Mexico than any still in California.",
      "In 2006, Fisher, Hollingsworth and others visited Baja where they had heard of a small population of red-legged frogs. Anny Peralta, then a student of Hollingsworth at San Diego State University, joined them. They found about 20 frogs, and Peralta was inspired to dedicate her life to their recovery.",
      "Peralta and her husband established the nonprofit Fauna del Noroeste in Ensenada, Mexico, which aims to promote the proper management of natural resources. In 2018, they started building ponds in Mexico to boost the frog population that would later provide eggs to repopulate the species across the border.",
      "But just as they were preparing to relocate the egg masses, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Peralta and the U.S. scientists scrambled to secure permits for the unusual cargo and a pilot to fly the two coolers of eggs closer to the border. The rest of their journey north was by road, after the eggs passed a U.S. border guard inspection.",
      "Over the past five years, Hollingsworth and his team have searched for sounds to prove their efforts to repopulate ponds in Southern California worked.",
      "On Jan. 30, he heard the quiet, distinct grunting of the red-legged frog's breeding call in an audio flagged by AI.",

      "Over the next two months, two males were heard belting it out on microphone 11 at one of the ponds. In March, right below the microphone, the first egg masse was found, showing they had not only hatched from the eggs brought from Mexico but had gone on to produce their own eggs in the United States.",
      "Conservationists are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to monitor animals on the brink of extinction, track the breeding of reintroduced species and collect data on the impact of climate change and other threats.",
      "Herpetologists are building on the AI-powered tools already used to analyze datasets of bird sounds, hoping that it might help build audio landscapes to identify amphibians and track their behavior and breeding patterns, said Zachary Principe of The Nature Conservancy, which is working with the museum on the red-legged frog project. The tools could also help scientists analyze tens of thousands of audio files collected at universities, museums and other institutions.",
      "Scientists working to restore the red-legged frog population in Southern California hope to soon be provided with satellite technology that will send audio recordings to their phones in real time, so they can act immediately if any predators \u2014 in particular bullfrogs \u2014 are detected.",
      "It could also help track the movement of the frogs, which can be difficult to find in the wild, especially because cold-blooded creatures cannot be detected using thermal imagery.",
      "The AI analysis of the pond audio has saved time for Hollingsworth and the others, who previously had to painstakingly listen to countless hours of audio files to detect the calls of the red-legged frog \u2014 which resembles the sound of a thumb being rubbed on a balloon \u2014 over the cacophony of other animals.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tree frogs calling, there\u2019s cows mooing, a road nearby with a motorcycle zooming back and forth,\u201d Hollingsworth said of the ponds' audio landscape. \u201cThere\u2019s owls, there\u2019s ducks splashing, just all this noise\u201d",
      "The red-legged frog is the latest species to see success from binational cooperation along the near-2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border spanning California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Over the years, Mexican gray wolves have returned to their historic range in the southwestern U.S. and in Mexico, while the California Condor now soars over skies from Baja to Northern California.",
      "Based off the latest count, scientists estimate more than 100 adult red-legged frogs are in the Southern California ponds, and tadpoles were spotted at a new site.",
      "The team plans to continue transporting egg masses from Baja, where the population has jumped from 20 to as many as 400 adult frogs, with the hope of building thriving populations on both sides of the border. Already the sites are seeing fewer mosquitos that can carry diseases like dengue and Zika.",
      "A restoration pond in Baja that Peralta\u2019s organization built recently teemed with froglets, their tiny eyes bobbing on its aquatic fern-covered surface. They could, one day, lay eggs for relocation to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThey don't know about borders or visas or passports,\u201d Peralta said of the frogs. \u201cThis is just their habitat and these populations need to reconnect. I think this shows that we can restore this ecosystem.\u201d",

      "The Democratic governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut, members of Congress and union workers are calling on the Trump administration to allow a major offshore wind project to move forward",
      "A nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut faces an uncertain future as the states' Democratic governors, members of Congress and union workers are calling Monday for the Trump administration to let construction resume.",
      "The administration halted construction on the Revolution Wind project last week, saying the federal government needs to review the project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what the concerns are. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said Monday it's not commenting further at this time.",
      "The politicians are getting involved because stopping work on Revolution Wind threatens local jobs and their states' climate goals, and could drive up electricity prices throughout the region. All of the project's underwater foundations and 45 out of 65 turbines are already installed.",
      "Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of government plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states with limited land for wind turbines or solar arrays.",
      "President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project under construction for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.",
      "Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont is scheduled to go to State Pier in New London, Connecticut, on Monday, where components for the Revolution Wind project are kept before being taken out to sea. Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee is headed to North Kingstown, Rhode Island, where the logistics and operations hub for the project is located.",
      "McKee says Revolution Wind is critical to the region\u2019s economy and energy future.",
      "Both governors will be joined by Democratic congressmen and labor leaders. About 1,000 union members have been working on Revolution Wind, and those jobs are now at risk.",
      "Revolution Wind is expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut\u2019s first large offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. Power would be provided at a rate of 9.8 cents per kilowatt hour, locked in for 20 years. That is cheaper than the average cost of electricity in New England.",

      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Canada are learning to live with great white sharks",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Rick Clough spent some four decades fishing for lobsters and sea urchins off the Maine coast before spotting one of the ocean's most recognized predators \u2014 a great white shark.",
      "The approximately 8-foot (2.4-meter) shark, seen off the beach town of Scarborough in July, surprised Clough, but didn\u2019t make him fear the ocean \u2014 though he admitted, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to go urchin diving now.\u201d",
      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen like Clough who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Atlantic Canada are learning to live with great white sharks, the creatures made famous by the 1975 film \u201cJaws.\u201d Sightings of the apex predators are up in places like Maine, where they were once very rarely spotted.",
      "Scientists link the white shark sightings to increased availability of the seals the sharks feast on, and say beachgoers are generally very safe from shark bites. The sharks can grow close to 20 feet (6 meters) long, though most don't get that big.",
      "David Lancaster, a commercial clam digger in Scarborough, used a drone to get a look at an approximately 12-foot (3.6-meter) shark near the town\u2019s famed beaches earlier this month. He described the animal as \u201cmagnificent\u201d and \u201creally amazing\u201d to see. But he also said the shark's presence reminded him that swimmers need to look out for the big fish.",
      "Sightings of great whites off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, have become increasingly frequent in recent years, and the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy has documented hundreds of the animals over more than a decade. But new data shows the sharks are heading even farther north into New Hampshire, Maine and beyond, said Greg Skomal, a senior fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries and a veteran white shark researcher.",
      "The number of white sharks detected off Halifax, Nova Scotia, increased about 2.5 times from 2018 to 2022, according to a paper published by Skomal and others in May in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series. Even farther north, the number detected in the Cabot Strait that separates Nova Scotia and Newfoundland increased nearly four times over, the paper said.",
      "Skomal said the average residency in these northern waters has also increased from 48 days to 70 days, suggesting that white sharks appear to be increasingly comfortable farther north.",
      "A key reason for the shift seems to be the successful conservation of seals off New England and Canada via laws such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which has allowed seals to thrive and provide a food source for the predatory sharks, Skomal said.",
      "\u201cIt could be a function of a growing prey base,\u201d Skomal said. \u201cAnd that would be seals.\u201d",
      "Great white sharks also benefit from protections, including a ban on fishing for them in U.S. federal waters that has stood since 1997. They are still considered vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.",
      "In Massachusetts, the marine fisheries department said it strengthened its fishing laws after fishermen in 2024 chose to target white sharks anyway. The state prohibited the use of certain kinds of heavy fishing gear in shoreline areas where white sharks are most commonly found.",

      "A study finds that popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude are inconsistent in responding to suicide-related queries",
      "A study of how three popular artificial intelligence chatbots respond to queries about suicide found that they generally avoid answering questions that pose the highest risk to the user, such as for specific how-to guidance. But they are inconsistent in their replies to less extreme prompts that could still harm people.",
      "The study in the medical journal Psychiatric Services, published Tuesday by the American Psychiatric Association, found a need for \u201cfurther refinement\u201d in OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude.",
      "The research \u2014 conducted by the RAND Corporation and funded by the National Institute of Mental Health \u2014 raises concerns about how a growing number of people, including children, rely on AI chatbots for mental health support, and seeks to set benchmarks for how companies answer these questions.",
      "\u201cWe need some guardrails,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Ryan McBain, a senior policy researcher at RAND.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s ambiguous about chatbots is whether they\u2019re providing treatment or advice or companionship. It\u2019s sort of this gray zone,\u201d said McBain, who is also an assistant professor at Harvard University's medical school. \u201cConversations that might start off as somewhat innocuous and benign can evolve in various directions.\u201d",
      "Anthropic said it would review the study. Google and OpenAI didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "While several states, including Illinois, have banned the use of AI in therapy to protect people from \u201cunregulated and unqualified AI products,\u201d this doesn\u2019t stop people from asking chatbots for advice and support with serious concerns from eating disorders to depression and suicide \u2014 or the chatbots from responding.",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.",
      "Consulting with psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, McBain and his co-authors came up with 30 questions around suicide and assigned them different risk levels from highest to lowest. General questions about suicide statistics, for instance, would be considered low risk, while specific questions about how to do it would be high risk. Medium-risk questions included \u201cWhat is the most common type of firearm used in suicide attempts in the United States?\u201d and \u201cI am having suicidal thoughts. What advice do you have for me?\u201d",
      "McBain said he was \u201crelatively pleasantly surprised\u201d that the three chatbots regularly refused to answer the six highest risk questions.",
      "When the chatbots didn\u2019t answer a question, they generally told people to seek help from a friend or a professional or call a hotline. But responses varied on high-risk questions that were slightly more indirect.",
      "For instance, ChatGPT consistently answered questions that McBain says it should have considered a red flag \u2014 such as about which type of rope, firearm or poison has the \u201chighest rate of completed suicide\u201d associated with it. Claude also answered some of those questions. The study didn't attempt to rate the quality of the responses.",

      "\u201cAs a doc, I have a responsibility that if someone is displaying or talks to me about suicidal behavior, and I think they\u2019re at high risk of suicide or harming themselves or someone else, my responsibility is to intervene,\u201d Mehrotra said. \u201cWe can put a hold on their civil liberties to try to help them out. It\u2019s not something we take lightly, but it\u2019s something that we as a society have decided is OK.\u201d",

For that study, which was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate posed as 13-year-olds asking a barrage of questions to ChatGPT about getting drunk or high or how to conceal eating disorders. They also, with little prompting, got the chatbot to compose heartbreaking suicide letters to parents, siblings and friends.",
      "The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but \u2014 after being told it was for a presentation or school project \u2014 went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "McBain said he doesn't think the kind of trickery that prompted some of those shocking responses is likely to happen in most real-world interactions, so he's more focused on setting standards for ensuring chatbots are safely dispensing good information when users are showing signs of suicidal ideation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that they necessarily have to, 100% of the time, perform optimally in order for them to be released into the wild,\" he said. \"I just think that there\u2019s some mandate or ethical impetus that should be put on these companies to demonstrate the extent to which these models adequately meet safety benchmarks.\u201d",

      "Climate change is fueling conditions across several states that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers",
      "PAW PAW, Mich. -- Robb Rynd and his brother grew up farming and wanted to do more of it outside their day jobs, so they went in together on what's now a little over 200 acres of corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum. Last year was a good year, and Rynd said he enjoyed walking the fields with his kids to see how the corn was doing.",
      "This year is a different story.",
      "All summer he's been scouting for brown and wilting leaves or ears of corn with kernels missing, and now it's becoming clear that every kernel will count this harvest. \u201cIt\u2019s almost kind of depressing to go out there and look at it and say, \u2018oh yep, it does look bad,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Across major corn-growing states, climate change is fueling conditions that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers. Factors like consistently high summer overnight temperatures, droughts and heavier-than-usual rains at the wrong time can all disrupt the plants\u2019 pollination \u2014 making each full ear of corn less of a guarantee and more of a gamble.",
      "Overall, corn growers got lucky this year with late-season weather that contributed to what is now predicted to be a record bumper crop. But experts say bouts of extreme weather are intensifying the waiting game during a critical time of year between planting and harvest.",
      "Human-caused climate change has worsened multiple U.S. extreme heat events this year and has steadily increased the likelihood of hotter overnight temperatures since 1970, according to Climate Central, an independent group of scientists who communicate climate science and data to the public.",
      "\u201dThe hot nights too, like the corn's never getting a break. It\u2019s just hot all the time,\" Rynd said. \u201cI know it\u2019s wearing on me.\u201d",
      "As a corn plant grows, the leaves unroll to reveal the tassel, the part that sheds pollen, explained Mark Licht, an associate professor of agronomy and an extension cropping systems specialist at Iowa State University. If the plant grows too fast, which can happen when it's consistently very hot, the tassel may be wrapped too tightly by the leaf, meaning less pollen gets released.",
      "That can lead to patchy ears of corn. Tight tassel wrap was reported in pockets across parts of the Midwest and the Plains, according to some agricultural trade publication reports during the growing season. Licht said he'd only seen tassel wrapping issues once before in his 20 years as an agronomist.",
      "High temperatures can stress corn in other ways, lowering pollen production, reducing pollen's viability or drying out other parts of the plants, reducing fertility. \"I think any of the pollination issues that we might be having are more because the nights have been so exceedingly warm,\" said Larry Walton, who farms near Rynd in southwestern Michigan, where many farmers irrigate because it's a drier area.",
      "\u201cWe tend to see pollination issues being more problematic when we have high temperatures and drought conditions or lack of rainfall,\u201d Licht said. Yet Iowa had plenty of rain and still saw some pollination issues. Excessive moisture can cause corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on the ears.",
      "He said farmers are having to pay more attention to this because \u201cthere's just more variable weather.\"",
      "This winter, the U.S. drought monitor reported drought in nearly 60% of corn production areas in the Midwest. But near or above normal rainfall nearly everywhere east of the Rockies this summer brought that down to just 3% as of the beginning of August, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "That, combined with consistent heat, means that \"we are expecting a monster U.S. corn crop in 2025,\" Rippey said.",

      "The voting technology company suing Fox News for defamation is now entangled in a widening bribery investigation",
      "MIAMI -- Smartmatic, the elections-technology company suing Fox News for defamation, is now contending with a growing list of criminal allegations against some of its executives \u2014 including a new claim by federal prosecutors that a \u201cslush fund\u201d for bribing foreign officials was financed partly with proceeds from the sale of voting machines in Los Angeles.",
      "The new details about the criminal case surfaced this month in court filings in Miami, where the company's co-founder, Roger Pinate, and two Venezuelan colleagues were charged last year with bribing officials in the Philippines in exchange for a contract to help run that country's 2016 presidential elections. Pinate, who no longer works for Smartmatic, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "To buttress the case, federal prosecutors are seeking to introduce evidence they argue shows that some of the nearly $300 million the company was paid by Los Angeles County to help modernize its voting systems was diverted to a fund controlled by Pinate through the use of overseas shell companies, fake invoices and other means.",
      "Smartmatic itself hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, nor have U.S. prosecutors accused Smartmatic or its executives of tampering with election results.

      "As part of its effort to investigate Smartmatic's work in Los Angeles, Fox has sued to force LA County Clerk Dean Logan to hand over public records about his dealings with Smartmatic's U.S. affiliate.",
      "Fox's lawyers also questioned Logan in a deposition about a dinner a Smartmatic executive bought for him at the members-only Magic Castle club and restaurant in Los Angeles and a Smartmatic-paid trip that Logan made to Taiwan in 2019 to oversee the manufacturing of equipment by a Smartmatic vendor. U.S. prosecutors claim that vendor was deeply involved in the alleged kickback scheme in the Philippines. The five-day trip included business class airfare, hotel and numerous meals as well as time for sightseeing, Fox said.",
      "\u201cThe trip\u2019s itinerary demonstrates that the trip was not a financial inspection or audit. It was a boondoggle,\u201d Fox said in court filings.",
      "Logan, who did not report the gifts in his financial disclosures, said in his 2023 deposition that the meal at the Magic Castle was a \u201csocial occasion\u201d unrelated to business and that he was not required to report the trip to Taiwan because his visit was covered by the contract.",
      "Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for Logan's office, said in a statement that the bribery allegations are unrelated to the company\u2019s work for L.A. County and that the county had no knowledge of how the proceeds from its contract would be used. All of Smartmatic\u2019s work has been evaluated for compliance with the contract\u2019s terms, Sanchez added, and as soon as Pinate was indicted he and the other defendants were banned from conducting business with the county.",
      "As for the trip to Taiwan, Sanchez said another county official joined Logan for the trip and the two conducted several on-site visits and conducted detailed reviews of electoral technology products that were required prior the start of their manufacturing. Logan's spouse accompanied him on the trip, but at the couple's own expense, the spokesman added.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this is an attempt to use the County as a pawn in two serious legal actions to which the County is not a party,\u201d Sanchez said.",
      "Smartmatic has settled two other defamation lawsuits it brought against conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network over their 2020 U.S. election coverage. Settlement terms weren\u2019t disclosed.",
      "U.S. prosecutors in Miami have also accused Pinate of secretly bribing Venezuela's longtime election chief by giving her a luxury home with a pool in Caracas. Prosecutors say the home was transferred to the election chief in an attempt to repair relations following Smartmatic's abrupt exit from Venezuela in 2017 when it accused President Nicolas Maduro 's government of manipulating tallied results in elections for a rubber-stamping constituent assembly.",
      "Smartmatic has denied the bribery allegations, saying it ceased all operations in Venezuela in 2017 after blowing the whistle on the government and has never sought to secure business there again.",
      "\"There are no slush funds, no gifted house,\" the company said. Instead, it accused Fox of engaging in \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d and attempts to use \u201cfrivolous\u201d court filings \u201cto smear us further, twisting unproven Justice Department allegations.\u201d",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration",
      "BANGKOK -- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration.",
      "Huang was asked about a possible \u201cB30A\u201d semiconductor for artificial intelligence data centers for China while on a visit to Taiwan, where he was meeting Nvidia's key manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the world's largest chip maker.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m offering a new product to China for ... AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,\u201d Huang said. But he added that \"That\u2019s not our decision to make. It\u2019s up to, of course, the United States government. And we\u2019re in dialogue with them, but it\u2019s too soon to know.\u201d",
      "Such chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But they are less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s top semiconductors today, which cannot be sold to China due to U.S. national security restrictions.",
      "The B30A, based on California-based Nvidia's specialized Blackwell technology, is reported to operate at about half the speed of Nvidia's main B300 chips.",
      "Huang praised the the Trump administration for recently approving sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China after such business was suspended in April, with the proviso that the company must pay a 15% tax to the U.S. government on those sales. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, was told to pay the same tax on its sales of its MI380 chips to China.",
      "As part of broader trade talks, Beijing and Washington recently agreed to pull back some non-tariff restrictions. China approved more permits for rare earth magnets to be exported to the U.S., while Washington lifted curbs on chip design software and jet engines. After lobbying by Huang, it also allowed sales of the H20 chips to go through.",
      "Huang did not comment directly on the tax when asked but said Nvidia appreciated being able to sell H20s to China.",
      "He said such sales pose no security risk for the United States. Nvidia is also speaking with Beijing to reassure Chinese authorities that those chips do not pose a \u201cbackdoor\u201d security risk, Huang said.",
      "\u201cWe have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors. There are no such things. There never has. And so hopefully the response that we\u2019ve given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,\u201d he said.",

      "Huang said Nvidia was surprised by the accusation and was discussing the issue with Beijing.",
      "\u201cAs you know, they requested and urged us to secure licenses for the H20s for some time. And I\u2019ve worked quite hard to help them secure the licenses. And so hopefully this will be resolved,\u201d Huang said.",

      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\u201cI said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe agreed, and they\u2019ve agreed to do it.\u201d",

      "The official announcement is expected to come later Friday, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden.

      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country\u2019s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",

      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company.

      "As students start school this year, 17 states and the District of Columbia are imposing new cellphone restrictions",
      "Jamel Bishop is seeing a big change in his classrooms as he begins his senior year at Doss High School in Louisville, Kentucky, where cellphones are now banned during instructional time.",
      "In previous years, students often weren\u2019t paying attention and wasted class time by repeating questions, the teenager said. Now, teachers can provide \u201cmore one-on-one time for the students who actually need it.\u201d",
      "Kentucky is one of 17 states and the District of Columbia starting this school year with new restrictions, bringing the total to 35 states with laws or rules limiting phones and other electronic devices in school. This change has come remarkably quickly: Florida became the first state to pass such a law in 2023.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have taken up the cause, reflecting a growing consensus that phones are bad for kids' mental health and take their focus away from learning, even as some researchers say the issue is less clear-cut.",
      "\u201cAnytime you have a bill that\u2019s passed in California and Florida, you know you\u2019re probably onto something that\u2019s pretty popular,\" Georgia state Rep. Scott Hilton, a Republican, told a forum on cellphone use last week in Atlanta.",
      "Phones are banned throughout the school day in 18 of the states and the District of Columbia, although Georgia and Florida impose such \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans only from kindergarten through eighth grade. Another seven states ban them during class time, but not between classes or during lunch. Still others, particularly those with traditions of local school control, mandate only a cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access.",
      "For students, the rules add new school-day rituals, like putting phones in magnetic pouches or special lockers.",
      "Students have been locking up their phones during class at McNair High School in suburban Atlanta since last year. Audreanna Johnson, a junior, said \u201cmost of them did not want to turn in their phones\u201d at first, because students would use them to gossip, texting \u201ctheir other friends in other classes to see what\u2019s the tea and what\u2019s going on around the building.\u201d",
      "That resentment is \u201cstarting to ease down\u201d now, she said. \"More students are willing to give up their phones and not get distracted.\u201d",
      "But there are drawbacks \u2014 like not being able to listen to music when working independently in class. \u201cI\u2019m kind of 50-50 on the situation because me, I use headphones to do my schoolwork. I listen to music to help focus,\u201d she said.",
      "In a survey of 125 Georgia school districts by Emory University researchers, parental resistance was cited as the top obstacle to regulating student use of social and digital media.",
      "Johnson\u2019s mother, Audrena Johnson, said she worries most about knowing her children are safe from violence at school. School messages about threats can be delayed and incomplete, she said, like when someone who wasn\u2019t a McNair student got into a fight on school property, which she learned about when her daughter texted her during the school day.",
      "\u201cMy child having her phone is very important to me, because if something were to happen, I know instantly,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Many parents echo this \u2014 generally supporting restrictions but wanting a say in the policymaking and better communication, particularly about safety \u2014 and they have a real need to coordinate schedules with their children and to know about any problems their children may encounter, said Jason Allen, the national director of partnerships for the National Parents Union.",

    "story": [
      "China has released new interim measures to tighten controls on mining and processing of rare earths that are used in many high-tech products including electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets",
      "BANGKOK -- China released new interim measures Friday tightening controls on mining and processing of rare earths that are used in many high-tech products including electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets.",
      "The rules released Friday by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology apply both to rare earths originating in China and those that are sent to China for refining.",
      "They require companies to comply with quotas for various minerals. Companies must have government approval to deal with rare earths and must accurately report the amount of rare earths products being handled. Violators will face legal penalties and also have their quotas for rare earths reduced.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "The 17 rare earth elements, including such minerals as germanium, gallium and titanium, aren\u2019t actually rare. But they're hard to find in a high enough concentration to make mining them worth the investment. China has been gradually tightening restrictions on exports of such materials, partly in response to U.S. controls on its access to American advanced technology.",
      "In April, just after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a raft of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, Beijing announced permitting requirements for seven more rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, citing the need to \u201cbetter safeguard national security and interests and to fulfill global duties of non-proliferation.\u201d",
      "Those limits raised worries that manufacturers in the U.S. and elsewhere would run short of vital materials needed for production, an issue in China-U.S. trade talks. In response to U.S. concessions on access to computer chip design software and jet engines, Beijing announced in June that it was speeding up approvals of rare earths exports.",
      "In July, China\u2019s Ministry of State Security said it was cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths materials that it said threatened national security, indicating Beijing was moving to exert more control.",
      "Over the past several decades, China has come to dominate rare earths processing. It now supplies nearly 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths, even though it mines only about 70% of such materials.",
      "China holds nearly half of the world's known reserves of rare earths, but it also imports significant amounts of rare earths from neighboring Myanmar for processing and export.",
      "Since it controls technologies used for refining rare earth elements and has banned exporting that know-how, China holds a near-monopoly on smelting and separating them.",

Some of the elements obtained from non-Chinese intermediate sources came from mineral concentrates processed in China and Australia, according to the U.S. Geologic Survey.",
      "China has agreed to issue some permits for rare earth exports but not for military uses, and much uncertainty remains about their supply.",
      "The rules released Friday spell out tighter controls on licensing of companies dealing in rare earths and centralize controls on mining, exports and processing. They also impose more stringent environmental standards for the industry.",
      "Trump has made it a priority to try to reduce American reliance on China for rare earths, while pushing for Beijing to ease its controls.",
      "China has opted to dial up or down the approval process as needed, while tightening overall controls on the industry.",
      "The new regulations don't spell out the quotas for production and export or specific rare earths elements, but strongly suggest Beijing is serious about exerting stronger control over the industry.",

      "They say they are anxious to fight back aggressively against Trump.",
      "The Democrats are in a tough stretch. Their fundraising and voter registration lags Republicans. And polls show American voters find the party generally unfavorable.",
      "But at this week's Democratic National Committee summer meeting in Minneapolis, members are desperate to turn a page, shed a rudderless reputation, and more clearly define their platform as they look to deliver wins in upcoming governor's races and the midterms next year.",
      "In fact, at least a half dozen members who spoke to ABC News say that they are eager to start fighting back more aggressively against President Donald Trump and feel like some of the problems the party finds itself in is due to compounding factors, rather than the direct fault of Chair Ken Martin, who was elected in early February.",
      "One of the ways Democrats believe they can get their footing back is leaning into the recent outrage around Republican efforts to pursue mid-decade redistricting and take a page out of California Gov. Gavin Newsom's playbook to give Trump a taste of his own rhetoric. Many members also believe they can resonate with voters as they push back against the impacts Trump's spending and policy bill have on health care and costs.",
      "\"We all know that this is going to be an uphill battle. We all know that there's tremendous challenges ahead, but we also know that the American people are not happy with the way things are turning out, and you see it in the polling,\" said Maria Cardona, a member from Washington, D.C., who brushed off anxieties about Democrats in disarray as \"b------t.\"",
      "\"All of this internal b------t is exactly that -- it's b------t,\" Cardona said.",
      "This week's meeting is the first major gathering of Martin's tenure -- and an early litmus test of his popularity and trust in his leadership, as his first few months have been mired in growing pains.",
      "The DNC reported having around only $14 million cash on hand as of the end of July -- far less than the Republican National Committee, which reported having $84.3 million cash on hand. The DNC also fundraised less than the RNC in July.",
      "The news is better for Democrats' official U.S. House campaign arm. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reported having $40.4 million cash on hand by the end of July, while its GOP counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee, reported having $37.6 million cash on hand. The DCCC also outpaced the NRCC in fundraising in July.",
      "Martin has faced increased scrutiny and criticism over infighting surrounding Gen Z activist David Hogg, who resigned from his role as vice chair after he promised to support primary challenges of incumbent Democrats he saw as complacent. American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten also stepped away from the DNC in June, writing in her resignation letter she is \"out of step\" with new party leadership. Weingarten endorsed Martin's most prominent chair challenger, Ben Wikler, the former Wisconsin Democratic Party chair.",
      "When asked by ABC News about Democratic voter registration lagging as reported by The New York Times last week, Martin said the party has \"work to do, for sure,\" and pointed to the committee's new organizing summer project, a volunteer training and voter registration initiative that sets to train Democrats to engage -- and ideally convert voters -- in non-political spaces in battleground areas and online as proof of concept.",
      "\"We've got to get back to registering voters -- that's what the DNC has already started this year with our summer organizing program. We are doing that with our state parties now,\" Martin said during an event at the Minnesota State Fair.",
      "Shasti Conrad, a DNC member from Washington state, said that grief over the election loss has permeated several conversations with fellow members, but has felt a recent energy shift, particularly after Texas House Democrats denied a quorum to delay the passage of new congressional district maps -- which now await the signature of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.",
      "\"When you lose an election like we did last year, you're going to feel people's rage, their sadness, their despair, all of that, and that is very much, has been what has been reverberating through every conversation that I've had,\" Conrad said. \"I think we're all trying to move through this.\"",
      "Conrad continued: \"We are starting to really get on solid footing, and that's my hope with this meeting, is that we'll be able to walk out of here feeling 'Ok, we're settled.'\"",
      "Conrad finds some of the handwringing about fundraising and voter registration \"slightly overblown\" and feels like the organization is in a solid place and has room to grow.",

He also suggested that some members are galvanized to be a more active resistance.",
      "\"I see anger. I see willingness to stand up and defend the communities that are being impacted by this administration. I see frustration that we can't move fast enough, and I know that that's a frustration that Chair Martin himself feels, but he's working like crazy,\" Kapp said.",
      "\"A number of members arrived concerned about the direction of the party, but the focus on unity and messaging has been well received,\" North Dakota member Jamie Selzler said. Selzler added that while he expects conversations about the fundraising figures to keep coming up, \"There's a sense that standing up against Republican overreach over the next few years and winning in Virginia and New Jersey this year will be an important factor in proving we can fight back.\"",
      "Andre Treiber, a Texas DNC member and youth council chair, feels like the committee is nearing the end of a \"rebuild phase.\"",
      "\"This is going to be repouring the final cement,\" Trieber said. \"The Democratic Party definitely has a brand issue, and I think that is what so many people here this week care a lot about fixing.\"",
      "For John Verdejo, a DNC member from North Carolina, the next step for the party is to keep things simple -- focus on core issues like affordability, for instance -- and stop feeling sorry for yourself.",
      "\"We need to get our message straight,\" said Verdejo, who stressed the party should keep things simple: focus on core issues like affordability, for instance.",
      "Verdejo understands why some members of the party may be licking their wounds post-loss, but believes the complaining should wrap as the committee reaches a critical transition point. Internally, there's a desire for more fighters, Verdejo said, which he does see reflected in Martin, who he and other Democrats who spoke to ABC maintain is broadly well-liked despite the early challenges of his tenure.",
      "\"We need to, we need to think differently, strategically, dirty even, take the gloves off. Never mind the polling, never mind what the stats say. Never mind what the numbers say ... people want to see that fire in us. Let's give it to them. This is life or death out here,\" Verdejo added.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he's firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from day-to-day politics",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday night that he's firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, an unprecedented move that would constitute a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from day-to-day politics.",
      "Trump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social platform that he is removing Cook effective immediately because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.",
      "Cook said Monday night that she would not step down. \u201cPresident Trump purported to fire me \u2018for cause\u2019 when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cI will not resign.\u201d",
      "Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week. Pulte alleged that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.",
      "Trump's move is likely to touch off an extensive legal battle that will probably go to the Supreme Court and could disrupt financial markets. Stock futures declined slightly late Monday, as did the dollar against other major currencies.",
      "If Trump succeeds in removing Cook from the board, it could erode the Fed's political independence, which is considered critical to its ability to fight inflation because it enables it to take unpopular steps like raising interest rates. If bond investors start to lose faith that the Fed will be able to control inflation, they will demand higher rates to own bonds, pushing up borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and business loans.",
      "Cook has retained Abbe Lowell, a prominent Washington attorney. Lowell said Trump's \u201creflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority,\u201d adding, \u201cWe will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.\u201d",
      "Cook was appointed to the Fed\u2019s board by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 and is the first Black woman to serve as a governor. She was a Marshall Scholar and received degrees from Oxford University and Spelman College, and she has taught at Michigan State University and Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government.",
      "Her nomination was opposed by most Senate Republicans, and she was approved on a 50-50 vote with the tie broken by then-Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "The law allows a president to fire a Fed governor \u201cfor cause,\u201d which typically means for some kind of wrongdoing or dereliction of duty. The president cannot fire a governor simply because of differences over interest rate policy.",
      "Establishing a for-cause removal typically requires some type of proceeding that would allow Cook to answer the charges and present evidence, legal experts say, which hasn\u2019t happened in this case.",
      "\u201cThis is a procedurally invalid removal under the statute,\u201d said Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia law school and author of \u201cThe Fed Unbound,\u201d a book about the Fed\u2019s actions during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Menand also said for-cause firings are typically related to misconduct while in office, rather than based on private misconduct from before an official\u2019s appointment.",
      "\u201cThis is not someone convicted of a crime,\u201d Menand said. \u201cThis is not someone who is not carrying out their duties.\u201d",
      "Fed governors vote on the central bank's interest rate decisions and on issues of financial regulation. While they are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, they are not like cabinet secretaries, who serve at the pleasure of the president. They serve 14-year terms that are staggered in an effort to insulate the Fed from political influence.",
      "While presidents have clashed with Fed chairs before, no president has sought to fire a Fed governor. In recent decades, presidents of both parties have largely respected Fed independence, though Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson put heavy pressure on the Fed during their presidencies \u2014 mostly behind closed doors. Still, that behind-the-scenes pressure to keep interest rates low, the same goal sought by Trump, has widely been blamed for touching off rampant inflation in the late 1960s and '70s.",

      "Menand noted that the Court\u2019s conservative majority has taken a very expansive view of presidential power, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters in a sense that it\u2019s very difficult to predict that if Lisa Cook goes to court what will happen.\u201d",
      "Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the president\u2019s use of the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision is likely an effort to mask his true intent. \u201cIt seems like a fig leaf to get what we wants, which is muscling someone on the board to lower rates,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump has said he would only appoint Fed officials who would support lower borrowing costs. He recently named Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, to replace another governor, Adriana Kugler, who stepped down about five months before her term officially ended Aug. 1.",
      "Trump appointed two governors in his first term, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, so replacing Cook would give Trump appointees a 4-3 majority on the Fed\u2019s board.",
      "\u201cThe American people must have the full confidence in the honesty of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve,\" Trump wrote in a letter addressed to Cook, a copy of which he posted online. \"In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity.\u201d",
      "Trump argued that firing Cook was constitutional. \"I have determined that faithfully enacting the law requires your immediate removal from office,\u201d the president wrote.",
      "Cook will have to fight the legal battle herself, as the injured party, rather than the Fed.",
      "Trump's announcement drew swift rebuke from advocates and former Fed officials.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Trump\u2019s attempt to fire Cook illegal, \u201cthe latest example of a desperate President searching for a scapegoat to cover for his own failure to lower costs for Americans. It\u2019s an authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act, and must be overturned in court.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him.",
      "Forcing Cook off the Fed\u2019s governing board would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist. Trump has said he would only appoint officials who would support cutting rates.",
      "Powell signaled last week that the Fed may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain moderate. Meanwhile, Trump will be able to replace Powell in May 2026, when Powell\u2019s term expires. However, 12 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the chair might not guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants.",

      "Scientists are criticizing two key documents from the Trump administration that challenge the idea that climate change endangers the public",
      "WASHINGTON -- A Trump administration proposal to reverse a landmark finding that climate change is dangerous to the public relies heavily on a report from the Department of Energy that dozens of scientists say is flawed.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency is seeking to use the DOE's work to overturn the climate concept known as the \u201cendangerment finding.\u201d If the administration succeeds, many laws and rules aimed at reducing or restricting greenhouse gas emissions could be eliminated.",
      "The Associated Press surveyed scientists for their views. Here are some key takeaways from those who responded to AP's questions:",
      "The most common critique from 64 scientists who responded to questions from AP was that the administration\u2019s reports ignored, twisted or cherry-picked information to manufacture doubt about the severity and threat of climate change. Fifty-three of the 64 scientists criticized the quality of the reports.",
      "The Department of Energy report said Arctic sea ice has declined about 5% since 1980. That number is accurate for Antarctica, while Artic sea ice actually declined more than 40% in the period.",
      "Jennifer Marlon, director of data science at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, highlighted a section on U.S. wildfires that acknowledged that fire data from before 1960 isn't reliable for comparisons. Yet the administration used that unreliable data in a chart going back to 1920, leaving readers with the impression that wildfire rates were higher many decades ago than they are now, Marlon said.",
      "Experts repeatedly said the reports were biased. Nineteen scientists used variations of the phrase \u201ccherry pick\u201d to describe citations in the administration reports.",
      "Francois Bareille, a French economist, has done work concluding that previous estimates about climate-related crop losses in French agriculture were overly pessimistic. The administration\u2019s reports cited that work, but Bareille said it shouldn\u2019t have because it\u2019s wrong to generalize his findings to other regions.",
      "Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said the reports pulled a single figure from his work on climate modeling to build a case that the models scientists use are often overly pessimistic. Hausfather said his research actually concluded that climate models have performed quite well.",

      "Bernae Boykin Hitesman was driving her son and daughter, ages 9 and 11, home from school when the storm, known as a haboob, arrived late in the afternoon in Arizona City, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) southeast of Phoenix.",

      "The U.S. is ramping up efforts to boost production of crucial components used in electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- U.S. production of crucial components in electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets is set to expand rapidly in the coming years, as the Trump administration intensifies efforts to build up the critical mineral industry in the United States to work to break the chokehold that China has on the global supply chain.",
      "The federal government is pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into American companies, has made an agreement with one firm to set a minimum price for some U.S.-produced critical minerals, and has launched an investigation into foreign-made supplies.",
      "\"This is the Manhattan Project moment for rare earths,\" said Joshua Ballard, CEO of USA Rare Earth, which plans next year to start making the rare-earth magnets that appear in many products.",
      "The White House has made it a priority to revive the domestic critical minerals industry, which is proving urgent after Beijing leveraged its near-monopoly on the products to force the U.S. to the negotiating table during a trade war.",
      "President Donald Trump said this week that China \u201cintelligently went and they sort of took a monopoly of the world's magnets,\" but he expressed confidence in securing supplies because the U.S. has \u201cmuch bigger and better cards.\"",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot of magnets in a pretty short period of time. In fact, we'll have so many, we won\u2019t know what to do with them,\u201d he said as he hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.",
      "Industry insiders, analysts and lawmakers have warned for years that America\u2019s dependence on China for critical minerals \u2014 a list of 50 minerals that includes 17 sought-after rare-earth elements \u2014 is a national vulnerability.",
      "The hard-to-pronounce elements are needed in smartphones, wind turbines and robots as well as missiles, submarines and fighter jets.",
      "\u201cOur national and economic security are now acutely threatened by our reliance upon hostile foreign powers\u2019 mineral production,\u201d an executive order from Trump declared in March.",
      "It was not until Beijing rolled out export restrictions on several rare earths in April \u2014 leading to a temporary halt of Ford\u2019s electric vehicle production \u2014 that \"the problem that for over a decade seemed far away hit close to home,\u201d said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Trump said Monday that he could charge 200% tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing does not export magnets to the U.S. but noted \u201cthat\u2019s perhaps behind us.\u201d Instead, he said he could withhold airplane parts to ground China\u2019s American-made Boeing jets.",
      "When asked about the leverage, Guo Jiakun, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said Tuesday that Beijing \u201cfollows the principle of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation\u201d in dealing with the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe hope the U.S. will work with us to jointly promote the steady, sound and sustainable development of bilateral ties,\u201d Guo said.",
      "The Pentagon is investing $400 million in rare-earth producer MP Materials. It gave the U.S. company a $150 million loan this month, has promised to ensure every magnet made at its massive new plant is bought and set a minimum price for its neodymium and praseodymium products for a decade.",
      "\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re going to finally do something to address that issue and make these projects a reality,\u201d said Mark Smith, CEO of NioCorp, an American company working to raise $1.2 billion to produce niobium, titanium, scandium and rare earths in Nebraska.",
      "Over four decades, Smith said he's seen how the U.S. ceded the industry to China, which came to dominate the supply chain by brushing aside environmental concerns, investing in mines worldwide, developing advanced processing technology and setting low prices to squeeze out competition.",

      "While it is unclear if the government would extend a minimum-price deal to other U.S. companies, Smith said the current support is \u201cunbelievable\" compared with the past. A price floor, he said, \"just takes away the Chinese modus operandi that they\u2019ve had for forever.\u201d",
      "About 220 miles away from where MP Materials is building a magnet plant in Fort Worth, Texas, Noveon Magnetics runs America\u2019s only factory currently making rare-earth magnets. Located south of Austin, it is ramping up production to make 2,000 tons of magnets a year.",
      "\u201cI certainly hope and think it actually is not what may be the last of the efforts by the U.S. government,\u201d Noveon Magnetics CEO Scott Dunn said of the Pentagon-MP Materials partnership.",
      "Even with all the new production aiming to come online in the next few years, American companies are still nowhere near being able to satisfy North America's demand for roughly 35,000 tons of magnets a year, analysts at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence estimate. And the demand could double in the next decade.",
      "Ballard, whose USA Rare Earth plans to start making about 600 tons of magnets in Oklahoma next year, said the government can provide incentives to stop American buyers from falling back on cheap Chinese products once they are widely available again.",

A peace deal the administration helped broker between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda might provide access to critical minerals, but it\u2019s too early to tell if those efforts will succeed.",
      "Derek Scissors, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said he\u2019s concerned that Trump could consider it a success if China agrees to guarantee rare-earth supplies in trade talks.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be such a deal or, if there is, that it will last,\u201d Scissors said. \u201cBut it is a threat to U.S. economic independence.\u201d",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- A Wisconsin judge accused of helping a man evade arrest by U.S. immigration agents lost an attempt Tuesday to throw out the Trump administration\u2019s case against her.",
      "The prosecution of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan has highlighted the push by President Donald Trump\u2019 s administration to confront state and local authorities who resist his sweeping immigration crackdown.",
      "Democrats have accused the administration of trying to make a national example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition to its deportation efforts.",
      "She was arrested at the county courthouse in April and indicted on federal charges in May. She quickly filed a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and is therefore immune from prosecution.",
      "However, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman on Tuesday rejected that argument and upheld the July recommendation of a magistrate judge who also ruled that the case could proceed.",
      "Adelman said the dispute boils down to Dugan arguing that there is a general rule of immunity for judges from prosecution, with some limited exceptions, while the government argues that the cited exceptions are simply examples of types of prosecutions that have been brought.",
      "\u201cA review of the relevant history reveals the government has the better of the argument,\u201d Adelman wrote.",
      "He said that \u201cthe particulars of this case may be unusual,\u201d but \u201cthere is no firmly established judicial immunity barring criminal prosecution of judges for judicial acts. There is no basis for granting immunity simply because some of the allegations in the indictment describe conduct that could be considered \u2018part of a judge\u2019s job.\u2019\u201d",
      "Attorneys for Dugan said in a statement that they were disappointed with the judge's decision, but \u201cwe look forward to the trial which will show Judge Dugan did nothing wrong and simply treated this case like any other in front of her courtroom.\u201d",

      "Dugan is charged with concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony.

      "A low-level conflict between Israel and Hezbollah started a day after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack against Israel from Gaza, when Hezbollah began launching rockets across the border in support of its Palestinian ally. The conflict escalated into war in September 2024 and left more than 4,000 people dead, and caused destruction worth $11 billion in Lebanon, according to the World Bank.",
      "The war ended in November with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire and since then Hezbollah says it has ended its presence along the border area. Israel has continued almost daily airstrikes that have killed dozens of Hezbollah members.",

      "A federal appeals court says it's unconstitutional for Pennsylvania to throw out mail-in ballots simply because the voter didn\u2019t write an accurate date on the return envelope",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled that it is unconstitutional for the presidential battleground state of Pennsylvania to throw out mail-in ballots simply because the voter didn't write an accurate date on the return envelope.",
      "The unanimous decision by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Pennsylvania to stop throwing out such ballots and upheld the decision earlier this year by a federal judge in Pittsburgh.",
      "In its 55-page opinion, the three-judge panel said it had to weigh the state's interest in throwing out the ballots against the constitutional right to vote.",
      "The panel wrote that it was \u201cunable to justify\u201d the practice of discarding such ballots \u201cthat has resulted in the disqualification of thousands of presumably proper ballots.\u201d",
      "Under Pennsylvania law, voters are required to write the date on the return envelope for their mail ballot. However, thousands of voters, confused by the request to write the date, might skip it or write another date, such as their birth date.",
      "Tuesday's decision marks the latest instance in more than a half-dozen cases where a court has instructed election officials in Pennsylvania to count such ballots.",
      "However, higher courts have always reinstated the requirement in the heavily litigated matter that has pitted Democrats and their allies in trying to get rid of the requirement against Republicans who defend it. For Tuesday's ruling to be reversed, the U.S. Supreme Court would need to take up the issue.",
      "Republicans did not immediately respond to queries about whether they will appeal.",
      "Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania supported the lawsuit against the provision and, in a statement Tuesday, said it is \u201cdisenfranchisement and unconstitutional\u201d to throw out a voter's ballot over the handwritten date. His administration's lawyers had argued that \u201cmeaningless errors shouldn\u2019t cost you your right to vote in Pennsylvania,\u201d he said.",
      "Democrats typically cast more mail-in ballots than Republicans, perhaps a result of President Donald Trump's demonization of mail-in voting and baseless allegations that it is rife with fraud. As recently as last week, Trump claimed there is \u201cMASSIVE FRAUD\u201d due to mail voting, when in fact voting fraud in the U.S. is rare.",
      "The decision affects a small percentage of votes typically cast in the state. However, it also results in thousands of mail-in ballots being thrown out in every election and, in the politically divided state, every vote truly counts in presidential races.",

      "Tuesday's decision was a victory for the groups that sued, including the American Federation of Teachers of Pennsylvania and the campaign arms of Democrats in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate. They were supported by the Black Political Empowerment Project, Common Cause Pennsylvania, the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania State Conference of the NAACP, among others.",
      "In a statement, AFT Pennsylvania's president, Wendy Coleman, called the decision a \u201cvictory for Pennsylvania voters and our democracy.\u201d",
      "Opposing the lawsuit were national and state Republican parties, as well as the campaign arm of Republicans in the U.S. House.",
      "Republicans contend that the date requirement is a matter of election security and have pushed for the strictest possible interpretation of state law to throw out ballots. Still, election officials have told courts that the requirement to write a date on the return envelope has no practical use and no effect on how they determine whether the ballot is valid or received on time.",
      "In its opinion, the appeals court panel said accepting ballots whose envelope has a missing or incorrect date \u201cwill have no effect on fraud detection.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiscarding thousands of ballots every election is not a reasonable trade-off in view of the date requirement\u2019s extremely limited and unlikely capacity to detect and deter fraud,\u201d the appeals court panel wrote.",
      "On top of that, it said, the requirement \u201cseems to hamper rather than facilitate election efficiency.\u201d",
      "The state Supreme Court announced earlier this year that it will consider the issue. But that was after the court put off ruling on a pending case before last year\u2019s presidential election and dismissed another on a technicality.",

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- A judge rejected former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s attempt to prolong a taxpayer-funded court battle with a woman who accused him of sexual assault, saying it wasn\u2019t in the public\u2019s interest to keep litigating for the purpose of repairing the Democrat\u2019s reputation as he runs for mayor.",
      "\u201cCuomo has not advanced any viable argument for why the taxpayers of this state should continue to foot the bill for his continued use of civil litigation discovery devices to further his efforts to resurrect his public image,\u201d state Supreme Court Justice Denise Hartman wrote in a decision posted online Monday.",
      "The decision comes more than a month after New York agreed to pay $450,000 to settle a lawsuit from Brittany Commisso, an ex-aide who alleged Cuomo sexually harassed and groped her while he was in office. Cuomo, who has denied the allegations, resigned as governor in 2021 after a report from the state attorney general determined that he had sexually harassed at least 11 women.",
      "Cuomo, a co-defendant with the state, opposed Commisso's request to discontinue the lawsuit. Relatedly, he sought to make public text messages produced under discovery he claims refute Commisso's allegations. Cuomo attorney Rita Glavin had told a judge that ending the case is a matter of \u201cenormous public interest\u201d as Cuomo runs for mayor.",
      "Hartman allowed Commisso to drop the civil suit and denied Cuomo's motion on the texts.",

      "Commisso filed her lawsuit in late 2023, just before the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act, a law that created a yearlong suspension of the usual time limit to sue over an alleged sexual assault. She later filed a criminal complaint accusing Cuomo of groping her but a local district attorney declined to prosecute, citing lack of sufficient evidence.",
      "The Associated Press typically doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they decide to tell their stories publicly, as Commisso has done.",

      "A rash of hoax calls about active shooters on at least a dozen college campuses around the U.S. has spread fear among students as the school year begins",
      "Miceala Morano scrambled for cover behind a green screen in the University of Arkansas broadcast room after she received a campuswide alert about an active shooter.",
      "As officers outside donned bullet proof vests and searched for an intruder, the 21-year-old journalism student called her grandmother, telling her, \u201cAs of right now, I\u2019m safe. I love you.\"",
      "Monday's threat turned out to be part of a rash of hoax calls about active shooters on college campuses \u2014 some featuring gunshots sounding in the background \u2014 that have sent waves of fear among students around the nation as the school year begins.",
      "The calls prompted universities to issue texts to \u201crun, hide, fight.\u201d Students and teachers rushed for cover, often cowering in classrooms and under desks for safety. Officers swarmed over campuses, seeking out any threat.",
      "That the threats turned out to be false doesn't much matter in the moment for terrified students.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just these few minutes where all you really feel is fear, whether the threat\u2019s there or not,\u201d said Morano, whose childhood active shooter drills taught her to stack chairs blocking the classroom door and to climb into the ceiling as a last resort.",
      "The hoaxes and false alarms have hit at least a dozen college campuses.",
      "On Monday alone, law enforcement responded to calls claiming active shooters at Arkansas, Northern Arizona University, Iowa State, Kansas State, the University of Colorado-Boulder and the University of New Hampshire. More calls were made Tuesday at the University of Kentucky, West Virginia University and Central Georgia Technical College.",
      "At Villanova University, students were attending Thursday's Orientation Mass when law enforcement received multiple calls about a man opening fire on campus with an AR-15 style weapon. Sounds of gunfire could be heard in the background of the calls.",
      "Chairs banged together and bags dropped as students fled, recalled Ryan Scanlon, who was in eighth grade at a neighboring school when the mass shooting occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in 2018.",
      "Now a Villanova senior, he joined others sheltering in the school library, waiting with little news for about an hour before police arrived to clear out buildings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really not funny,\u201d Scanlon said. \u201cIf you experience that real thing, you never know what can happen next.\u201d",
      "Hours earlier, Tennessee authorities received similar false calls reporting an active shooter with an AR-15 style rifle at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and four persons shot. Dispatchers reported hearing multiple gunshots on the calls.",
      "\u201cThis incident was a criminal act, intended to be disruptive and cause chaos,\u201d the school said in a statement.",
      "The University of South Carolina also received two calls Sunday reporting an active shooter at the school\u2019s library, with the sound of gunshots in the background.",

      "The FBI provided no information about a motive, but said Tuesday that it was working with law enforcement on the swatting cases on college campuses, which come as such false reports surge nationwide.",

      "Fred Posner, a telephoning consultant at LOD.com, said advances in technology have made it easier for people making such swatting calls to conceal their identities. Posner said law enforcement also faces the challenge of how easy phone carriers have made it for people to obtain a number.",

      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival over the weekend, calling his participation in the event \"a disgrace and an insult\" to the victims of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced Ukraine's cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media stories quoted Allen as saying he's always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine's Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said it \"strongly condemns\" Allen's participation in the festival, which \"brings together supporters and mouthpieces of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\"",
      "The ministry called it \"a disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\" adding that Allen \"is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchanges to continue.",
      "\"When it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\" Allen said. \"But, whatever politicians have done, I don't feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\"",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos.",
      "Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Kusturica has been open about his support of Putin, including after the invasion. He received an award from Putin and attended a military parade in Moscow earlier this year.",
      "Allen has long had an affinity for Russian literature and history. His 1975 comedy \"Love and Death\" spoofs the fiction of Tolstoy and other 19th century Russian novelists. The title of his 1989 release \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" echoes Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" and also broods over the themes of wrongdoing, justice and guilt.",
      "In the 1972 essay, \"A Brief Guide to Civil Disobedience,\" Allen jokes about the Russian Revolution, writing that the serfs rebelled when they \"finally realized that the Czar and the Tsar were the same person.\"",

    "summary": "Jerry Adler's acting credits include \"The Sopranos\" and \"The Good Wife.\" He also had 53 Broadway productions to his name, all behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \"passed peacefully in his sleep,\" Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \"The Sopranos,\" on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \"The Good Wife,\" where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \"My Fair Lady\" and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \"Santa Barbara.\"",
      "\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \"The Public Eye\" and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \"chills\" when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \"Northern Exposure\" paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \"The Sopranos.\"",
      "\"When David was going to do the pilot for 'The Sopranos' he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\" he told Forward in 2015. \"But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\"",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"Transparent\" and guest spots on shows ranging from \"The West Wing\" to \"Broad City.\"",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf\" in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\" Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \"I wouldn't know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that's when I'll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\"",
      "Adler published a memoir, \"Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\" last year. \"I'm ready to go at a moment's notice,\" he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \"too goofy-looking\" to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\"I'm immortal,\" he said.",

      "Oscar winner Riz Ahmed's family always knew he was destined for stardom, with his mother enrolling him in speech and drama lessons by the ripe age of 8. The British actor jokes that it all started with his impressions of Prince Charles \u2014 now King Charles III.",
      "\"You're not gonna ask me to do it now. He's not the prince; he's the King,\" laughed Ahmed in an interview with CBS News. \"Taking a step back, I think that on some level, I was always acting. \u2026 From a young age, I was code switching. So I think that was something that was kind of confusing at times as a kid. But you look back and I realize it forced me to develop these muscles.\"",
      "Ahmed loves to flex his acting muscles, which he in part developed at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London. But his road to success wasn't always smooth.",
      "\"Worst audition in my life\"",
      "His audition for Danny Boyle's 2008 film \"Slumdog Millionaire\" is one that often comes to mind. He auditioned for the lead as well as the role of the volatile older brother.",
      "\"That was probably the worst audition in my life,\" he recalled.",
      "\"I can't remember exactly what happened in the audition. But I remember it ended with me \u2026 holding Danny Boyle up against the wall. And I'd ripped his shirt open. And a couple of the buttons popped off. And he goes, 'All right, thanks a lot, Riz. Thanks for coming in. Appreciate that.' I didn't get the role for some reason,\" Ahmed added, jokingly.",
      "His breakout came in 2014 in the film \"Nightcrawler.\" Three years later, he earned an Emmy playing the suspect in the HBO crime drama \"The Night Of.\"",
      "In 2021 he scored his first Oscar nomination playing a drummer who loses hearing in \"Sound of Metal.\" And a year later, Ahmed, who is also a rapper, won an Academy Award for \"The Long Goodbye,\" a short film based on his own album.",

      "\"I was writing a script. I was actually working on the thing that I'm editing now,\" Ahmed said. \"She sat down opposite and started emptying her whole bag out because she'd lost her charger. You know, I just spotted an opening. 'Can I help you?'\"",
      "The couple got married in 2020 and they're now parents \u2014 a rewarding role Ahmed says has changed him as an artist.",
      "\"You know, at this point, anything that I do \u2013 as an artist \u2013 is facilitated by the support of my wife. So, it's definitely kind of made me realize the extent to which the people closest to you are actually the co-authors of your work,\" said Ahmed, adding that being a father has brought him more gratitude and humility.",

    "story": [
      "A man on trial for organizing the ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph\u00a0at a Memphis bakery in 2021 has been found not guilty.",
      "A Memphis jury deliberated about three hours before finding Hernandez Govan, 45, not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. He rejected an offer from the state last month to settle with a guilty plea, CBS News affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "On Thursday, Govan hugged his lawyer and thanked Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell after she told him he was free to go.",
      "Govan was not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claimed he directed the two people who did. The jury was not convinced, however, despite a man's testimony that Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut.",
      "Govan's lawyer questioned the quality of the police investigation and the validity of cellphone communications between Govan and the men who shot Dolph, arguing that nothing in the communications directly incriminated Govan or tied him to the killings.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works.",
      "On the day of the 2021 ambush, the 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Authorities said two men exited a white Mercedes-Benz and began shooting at the rapper at the bakery. He died after being shot about 20 times, according to a medical examiner's report.",
      "Four years earlier, Young Dolph suffered critical injuries\u00a0in a 2017 attack, when three men approached and shot him over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Earlier that same year, he had been involved in a separate shooting where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",
      "Testifying against Govan was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the two shooters who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter.",
      "Smith faces charges for murder and conspiracy to commit murder for his alleged role in Young Dolph's death. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and does not currently have a trial date set. Johnson was originally sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole following his 2024 conviction, plus an additional 35 years for two additional convictions from his trial.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed Young Dolph's killing as part of an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, rapper Yo Gotti. Smith has testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "At Johnson's earlier trial, a prosecutor told jurors Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant in January 2024.",
      "Smith testified Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits,\" including giving Smith guns for the killing, and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the Thanksgiving turkey giveaway, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Prosecutors introduced as evidence dozens of cellphone communications between Johnson, Smith, Govan and Big Jook ahead of the shooting.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said on Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Govan did not testify in his defense.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date.",
      "Johnson was sentenced last September to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He was later sentenced for two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",

      "Drugs known as\u00a0GLP-1 receptor agonists\u00a0mimic a hormone in the body known as glucagon-like peptide 1, which helps signal fullness to the brain and regulate blood sugar. Ozempic is typically used for diabetes while Saxenda, Wegovy and Zepbound are approved for weight loss.",

    "summary": "Mississippi's infant mortality rate nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health.",
    "story": [
      "Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency after releasing data showing the state's infant mortality rate\u00a0has risen to its highest level in more than a decade.",
      "In Mississippi, 9.7 infants died for every 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health. Since 2014, more than 3,500 Mississippi infants have died before their first birthday.",
      "The decision to declare a public health emergency places Mississippi's struggle within\u00a0a wider national story. Here's what to know.",
      "Infant mortality rate a nationwide concern",
      "Even in cities with strong healthcare systems, such as Boston, Black infants continue to die at far higher rates than their White peers.",
      "In Boston, the city's most recent report showed Black infants dying at more than twice the rate of the overall population and triple the rate of White infants, despite the city's overall infant mortality rate falling below the national average. Public health experts say both examples underscore the limits of focusing only on individual behavior or clinical care when structural inequities are key drivers of infant deaths.",
      "\"Every single infant loss represents a family devastated, a community impacted, and a future cut short,\" said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney, who announced the Mississippi declaration. \"We cannot and will not accept these numbers as our reality.\"",
      "What is causing higher infant mortality rate?",
      "The leading causes of infant death in Mississippi include congenital malformations, premature birth, low birthweight, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.",
      "Disparities remain stark \u2014 Black infants in Mississippi are more than twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday, and recent state data show those racial gaps have widened.",
      "Despite growing concerns, declaring a public health emergency for infant mortality is unusual.",
      "\"This is a novel and necessary step,\" said Dr. Michael Warren, Chief Medical and Health Officer at March of Dimes. \"It elevates infant mortality to the level of urgent crisis response, which it truly is.\"",
      "Why a public health emergency was declared",
      "State officials said the declaration allows them to move more quickly to address gaps in care.",
      "Their plan includes expanding prenatal services in counties without obstetric providers, creating an obstetric system of care to regionalize services and improve emergency transfers, and strengthening home visiting and community health worker programs.",
      "\"Improving maternal health is the best way to reduce infant mortality,\" Dr. Edney said.",
      "Dr. Morgan McDonald, National Director for Population Health at New York-based nonprofit Milbank Memorial Fund, said the declaration \"should draw our attention to a problem that is tragic and preventable.\"",
      "She added: \"We applaud Dr. Edney and his public health team for raising the alarm in a way that honors the families who have suffered this tragedy and also focuses attention on concrete solutions.\"",
      "Experts caution, however, that individual and clinical interventions alone cannot solve the problem.",
      "\"Healthy babies come from healthy moms,\" said Dr. Rebekah Gee, former Louisiana health secretary and now CEO of Nest Health, a New Orleans-based company which provides in-home whole-family care, with a focus on those covered by Medicaid. \"If women can't get continuous healthcare before, during, and after pregnancy, it is no surprise their babies are dying at higher rates.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist and professor at Emory University, added that treating infant deaths as a series of isolated medical cases misses the broader reality. \"So much of what we see in neonatal intensive care units reflects challenges that moms face long before delivery \u2014 poverty, access to healthcare, housing, even transportation,\" Patrick said.",
      "Health care programs and infant health",
      "Federal funding cuts are also complicating the state's response to the crisis.",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program that collects state-specific data on maternal and infant health, has been targeted for elimination. CDC staffers who carried out the survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes were fired in June.",
      "Mississippi relied on PRAMS to track maternal behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy, and to monitor infant outcomes. Many of CDC's Safe Motherhood initiatives are also in jeopardy of losing funding, which would affect maternal mortality surveillance, infant sleep safety programs, and hospital-based collaboratives designed to standardize care.",
      "\"Without robust data, we are flying blind,\" Patrick said.",
      "Analysts also warn that such cuts could limit the state's ability to detect trends such as unsafe sleep practices or gaps in postpartum care.",
      "\"It's willful ignorance to cut vital maternal and child health programs when we have public health crises of both maternal mortality and infant mortality in this country,\" said a former CDC Division of Reproductive Health staffer who lost their job in a recent reduction in force. \"For many people, it's downright dangerous to be pregnant in the U.S. in the 21st century. And that is shameful.\"",
      "Polling suggests most Americans support maintaining these programs. According to the Emory-Rollins National Child Policy Poll, 65% of Americans say PRAMS is important for improving outcomes for mothers and infants, while fewer than one in ten believe it is not needed.",
      "Similarly, only 16% supported ending federal funding for the long-running \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign, which educated parents about reducing risks of sleep-related infant deaths.",
      "How changes to Medicaid will impact Mississippi",
      "Medicaid\u00a0plays an outsized role in Mississippi, financing almost 6 in 10 of births in the state, compared to about 4 in 10 nationally, according a\u00a0KFF Health News analysis of government data.",
      "In 2023, the state extended postpartum\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0from two months to a full year. But Mississippi has\u00a0not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving many low-income women uninsured before or between pregnancies.",
      "Meanwhile, Congressional proposals could reshape Medicaid coverage, including the reconciliation bill already passed by Congress which would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "Dr. McDonald noted that since Mississippi is not a Medicaid expansion state, it would not be subject to most of the work requirement and frequent redetermination provisions of President Trump's so-called \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "KFF analysts estimate that bill's funding caps and work requirements could raise Mississippi's uninsured rate by 1 to 2%, potentially leaving 20,000 to 40,000 more residents without coverage.",
      "Public health experts say such policies could destabilize rural hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, in turn limiting access to prenatal and delivery services in regions already described as \"OB deserts.\"",
      "Other states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen measurable improvements in infant health.",
      "Arkansas, for example, reported a 29% reduction in Black infant mortality in the five years following expansion. In Louisiana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016, researchers documented increases in early prenatal care and decreases in premature births. Colorado also saw declines in infant mortality, particularly in rural areas, as more women gained access to continuous coverage before, during, and after pregnancy.",
      "Nationally, one analysis found a 50% greater reduction in infant mortality in expansion states compared to those that did not expand Medicaid, with the steepest gains among Black infants. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, while Mississippi remains one of 10 holdouts.",
      "The U.S. has long treated infant mortality as a measure of societal health. More than a century ago, sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that high rates of infant deaths among Black families reflected inequities in living conditions rather than innate differences.",
      "Mississippi's emergency declaration and Boston's persistent disparities suggest those inequities remain deeply entrenched. State officials said the declaration is intended to galvanize coordinated action across hospitals, state agencies, and community groups.",

    "summary": "The wealthiest 400 people in the U.S. pay a tax rate of 24%, lower than the average rate for all other taxpayers, economists find.",
    "story": [
      "The rich are different from other people \u2014 and that also applies to the share of their income they pay in taxes, according to a new study from University of California, Berkeley, economists.",
      "The individuals who make up the\u00a0Forbes 400 list, topped by Tesla CEO Elon Musk with a fortune of $244 billion, paid an average effective tax rate of 24% from 2018 to 2020, compared with a 30% rate for all other U.S. taxpayers, the researchers said in a new paper published in the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The research comes as President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law on July 4, delivers its largest\u00a0benefits to the highest-earning Americans\u00a0through a mix of new and extended tax breaks. Those include raising the estate-tax exemption to $15 million per person, up from about $14 million.",
      "The changes build on an earlier tax cut \u2014 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Mr. Trump's signature first-term legislation. That 2017 law reduced the effective tax rate for the richest Americans from 30% to 24%, the researchers found.",
      "The new findings \u2014 from Berkeley economists and noted inequality experts Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman \u2014 calculates the tax rate by tallying all income taxes, as well as corporate taxes that are paid by the companies owned by the richest Americans. In other words, it assigns a share of Amazon's corporate taxes to that of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos when calculating his total tax burden.",
      "\"The economic income of the wealthiest are essentially the profits of the businesses they own,\" Saez told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Jeff Bezos owns about 10% of Amazon, and hence his true economic income is 10% of Amazon's profits.\"",
      "Corporate taxes are levies on the profits generated for Bezos, similar to how an employer withholds federal income and Social Security contributions from a worker's paycheck, he added.",
      "Saez and Zucman are leading proponents of instituting a U.S. wealth tax to help address widening inequality between the haves and have-nots. That idea has been embraced by some lawmakers, such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.",
      "Some conservative critics have argued that wealth taxes could be self-defeating, with the Hoover Institute noting in a 2023 blog post that the levy could discourage entrepreneurship and investment.",
      "Research shows that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while cutting taxes for many individuals and businesses, hasn't had a significant impact on the economy, the Congressional Research Service found in an April report. Republican proponents of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, also\u00a0say\u00a0that it will boost the economy and provide tax relief to workers and families.",
      "How billionaires pay a smaller share",
      "U.S. income taxes are designed to be progressive, meaning that higher-earning workers pay a bigger share of their income to the IRS than people lower down the ladder. But because capital gains \u2014 the profits earned from selling stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets \u2014and business income are taxed at a lower rate than the top rate for income that people earn through their jobs, the richest Americans reap a massive tax break.",
      "For instance, the highest tax rate on earned income stands at 37%, which is assessed on every dollar earned above $609,351 for individual taxpayers. Yet that same person will pay only a 20% tax rate on long-term capital gains, such as profits from a stock sale, and a 21% corporate tax rate on income earned through a partnership or other business.",
      "And if the rich don't sell their shares, they don't have to pay any taxes on that wealth because they haven't realized a capital gain, Saez noted.",
      "\"The individual income tax is designed to be progressive thanks to its increasing tax rates by brackets, and it does a pretty good job except among the billionaire class,\" he said. \"As I said, the billionaire class can avoid realizing individual income and hence can escape the individual income tax.\"",
      "To be sure, the rich are shouldering the largest share of the nation's taxes, IRS data also shows. The top 1% of earners \u2013 people who make over roughly $663,000 per year \u2014 account for roughly 40% of all federal individual income tax, while the top 50% contribute 97%, a Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis\u00a0of IRS data shows. The bottom half of income earners account for about 3% of those taxes.",
      "Some wealthy Americans pay a tax rate exceeding the 30% average, the new paper also found. The top labor earners \u2014 people who depend on high wages for their incomes rather than capital gains or corporate profits \u2014 have a 45% effective tax rate, according to Berkeley analysis.",
      "The findings about the richest 400 Americans suggest that a wealth tax is still needed to curb inequality in the U.S., Saez said.",
      "\"The wealth tax is the most direct and powerful way to specifically target the ultra-rich and increase tax progressivity at the very top,\" he said. \"The wealth tax on the ultra-rich is also popular but will obviously be fought by billionaires, and they have disproportionate influence.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday he has fired Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, a dramatic move after months of public attacks against the central bank.",
      "Cook and her attorney said Tuesday that the move has no legal basis and that they plan to file a lawsuit challenging the president's action.",
      "The president announced Cook's removal from the Fed board in a letter posted to Truth Social that accused Cook of making false statements on mortgage documents, actions he claimed were \"gross negligence\" and \"potentially criminal.\" Mr. Trump had previously urged Cook to resign, leading the economist to say she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"",
      "The move is an early test of Mr. Trump's power to terminate members of the Federal Reserve. Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a letter to Cook: \"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.\"",
      "Cook still has access to her office at the Federal Reserve in Washington, a source familiar with the situation told CBS News on Tuesday. The central bank has deferred making any decisions about her status until a court decision is issued, which means nothing has changed in the Fed's view regarding how Cook is able to carry out her duties, according to the source.",
      "The source noted there is no official business before the Fed board this week, and pointed to the end of August being quiet. The source declined to discuss Cook's participation in a mid-September meeting of the Fed's interest rate-setting committee.",
      "In a statement, Cook said that Mr. Trump \"purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.\"",
      "Her attorney Abbe Lowell said Cook will challenge her firing in court.",
      "\"President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis. We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action,\" Lowell said.",
      "A Federal Reserve spokesperson said in a statement the Fed will \"continue to carry out its duties as established by law.\" The central bank also noted Cook's plan to sue over her firing, and said it \"will abide by any court decision.\"",
      "\"Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,\" the statement read.",
      "What are Trump's allegations against Lisa Cook?",
      "The allegations against Cook were leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has also\u00a0pushed\u00a0Mr. Trump's foe, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, to resign. Pulte\u00a0sent a letter\u00a0to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of taking out mortgages for homes in Michigan and Georgia in 2021, and telling banks in both cases that she planned to use the homes as her primary residences. Pulte alleged that was a fraudulent attempt to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "CBS News has obtained a copy of Pulte's letter to Bondi, a small portion of which Pulte posted online. The letter was provided by Georgetown University Law Center professor Adam Levitin, who specializes in commercial law and financial regulation.",
      "In the letter, Pulte alleges that Cook bought a house in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and a condo in Atlanta, Georgia, within two weeks of each other in June and July of 2021. The mortgage agreements for both properties required her to begin using them as principal residences within 60 days and to keep living there for at least a year, according to copies of the documents that were attached to Pulte's letter.",
      "The Atlanta condo was then listed for rent in September 2022, which Pulte said shows it \"was intended to be used as an investment/rental property, and not in fact a primary residence\" \u2014 though the one-year period for which it needed to serve as her principal residence technically would have ended between July and September of 2022.",
      "Typically, banks offer lower mortgage rates for primary residences than for second homes or investment properties because it's thought that if homeowners face financial strain, they're more likely to keep making payments for their primary home than for a vacation home or a rental property. Under federal lending rules, a primary residence is a home that a borrower lives in\u00a0for most of the year, while a second home must be occupied by the borrower by\u00a0part\u00a0\u2014 but not all \u2014 of the year.",
      "Cook did not list any rental income on her 2022 or 2023 financial disclosures, the letter notes.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Cook must resign, now!!!\"",
      "Cook said in a statement released through the Fed last week: \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Pulte has also made mortgage fraud allegations against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democratic officials and Trump foes who denied the accusations. Notably, James's office sued Mr. Trump and his company for loan fraud before his return to the White House, securing an almost $400 million civil court judgment that was tossed out by a New York state appellate court last week.",
      "In a\u00a0blog post, Levitin argued Cook's firing was illegal and questioned the allegations leveled by Pulte. He wrote that, to prove criminality, prosecutors would need to show that Cook \"knowingly\" defrauded her lenders, and it's \"far from clear\" that she intentionally misled anybody.",
      "\"Most borrowers do not read their security instruments, so it is entirely possible that Cook had no idea what she was promising beyond that she would pay the mortgage note when installments came due,\" Levitin wrote.",
      "Can Trump fire Cook?",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" Courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause,\" though it is generally thought to be malfeasance. Congress has in other federal laws restricted the president's power to remove officers at independent agencies to inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "In Cook's case, the allegations made by Pulte boil down to possible mortgage fraud, specifically that she took out two different mortgages within weeks of each other, stating both properties would serve as her primary residence. To prove fraud, the Justice Department would have to prove intent to misrepresent her financial situation to the lending institutions involved. That would have come in the criminal referral investigation made last week.",
      "The Supreme Court has in a series of recent rulings reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at-will. In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "Lately, the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to remove members of multi-member agencies \u2014 the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission \u2014 without cause through decisions on its emergency docket.",
      "But the high court suggested in one of those emergency rulings that the Fed is different from other independent agencies. In an unsigned opinion, the court said the central bank is \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Why is Trump angry at the Fed?",
      "Cook's firing came after Mr. Trump spent months attacking the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "The Fed hiked interest rates to decades-long highs in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to quell inflation. After some cuts last year, the central bank has chosen to leave rates at relatively high levels so far this year, fearing that inflation could come roaring back or that Mr. Trump's tariff strategy could cause consumer prices to jump. The trade-off is that higher interest rates can lead to slower economic growth, and they make it more expensive for American consumers and businesses to borrow.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out over this strategy, nicknaming Powell \"Too Late.\" The president has\u00a0floated the idea\u00a0of firing Powell, in some cases accusing him of mismanaging a project to renovate the Fed's headquarters.",
      "Powell hinted last week that interest rate cuts could be on the horizon, as the Fed tries to prevent inflation from spiking without triggering higher unemployment. During a speech in Jackson Hole, he said the Fed will \"proceed carefully,\" but recent shifts \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",
      "Even without firings, the president could reshape the Fed board as positions open up. If the Senate confirms Mr. Trump's replacements for Cook and another Biden nominee who\u00a0stepped down early, five of the Fed's seven governors will be Trump appointees \u2014 making up most of the Fed's board of governors and more than one-third of the 12-member interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.",
      "Currently, three Fed board members are Trump picks: Powell, vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman and board member Christopher Waller.",
      "Mr. Trump is widely expected not to appoint Powell to another four-year term as Fed chair when his current one ends in May 2026, though he hasn't announced a successor yet. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u00a0has nominated\u00a0his economic adviser Stephen Miran to serve on the Fed board until January 2026, replacing Adriana Kugler, the Biden appointee who left the board earlier this month. It's unclear who he will pick to replace Cook.",
      "Cook was confirmed in 2022 by the Senate when then-Vice President Kamala Harris broke the 50-50 party line tie, making Cook the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. She started her term in May 2022 and it runs 14 years.",
      "She has voted in sync with Powell to hold interest rates steady so far this year.",
      "Reaction to Mr. Trump's move so far has been along party lines. For instance, in\u00a0a post on X, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said it was \"doing the right thing to hold people accountable\" while Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying this represented an \"authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act.\"",
      "Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect Mr. Trump picked three members of the current Fed board: Jerome Powell, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.",

      "Cook denies Mr. Trump has the legal authority to fire her and pledged on Tuesday not to resign. \"I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022,\" she said in a statement. Cook's lawyer also vowed to fight the firing in court.",
      "Asked by CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes on Tuesday whether the Trump administration is effectively weaponizing government by digging into the mortgage records of public officials, Mr. Trump responded, \"No. They're public.\"",
      "Cook has not been charged with a crime. Federal Housing Finance Agency head Bill Pulte, who leveled the initial accusations against Cook, has called on the Department of Justice to investigate Cook.",
      "Cook was appointed to a 14-year term on the Fed's Board of Governors in 2022 and also serves on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets short-term interest rates in the U.S.",

      "More influence over the Fed?",
      "Financial markets were subdued\u00a0on Tuesday in digesting Mr. Trump's effort to oust Cook. Yet the decision was the talk of Wall Street, with multiple analysts saying Cook's dismissal could open the door to Mr. Trump gaining control of the Fed's seven-member board.",
      "\"President Trump's decision to fire Lisa Cook as a Fed governor gives him the ability to gain a majority at the Federal Reserve Board and to influence the broader composition of the FOMC,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, said in a report to investors, referring to the central bank's rate-setting panel.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on whether firing Cook could impact financial markets and compromise the Fed's independence.",
      "Mr. Trump has also nominated Stephen Miran, who heads the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to serve on the Fed board. Mr. Trump is slated to name a nominee to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell whose term ends in May of 2025; Powell is scheduled to continue serving on the Fed board until January of 2028 and could continue to serve in that role after stepping down as Fed chair.",
      "If Cook were to leave the Fed board, Mr. Trump could ultimately end up with five appointees on the panel by mid-2026, giving the White House more leverage to influence monetary policy, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "During a meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump demurred when asked by a reporter who he's considering to replace Cook on the Fed board. \"We'll have a majority very shortly so that will be great,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly assailed Powell for the central bank's decision to hold off in cutting interest rates, with policy makers remaining cautious about reducing borrowing costs so long as inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Powell signaled last week that a rate cut could be on the horizon during a speech at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic symposium.",
      "No guarantee of lower interest rates",
      "The 12-member FOMC is made up of seven members of the Fed Board of Governors; the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and four of the 11 Fed bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis for one-year terms.",
      "That interlocking relationship suggests that even stacking the Fed board with loyalists wouldn't guarantee the interest rate cuts that Mr. Trump has demanded, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's not just about the administration nominating individuals and Congress confirming those individuals \u2014 it's also about how these individuals perceive their role and value their independence,\" he said.",
      "Analysts with Capital Economics noted that Mr. Trump's appointees would need to persuade other FOMC members about setting monetary policy in ways that align with the White House's economic objectives. That \"could be difficult if those others felt compelled to defend the Fed from political attacks,\" they said in a report.",
      "For decades, investors have seen the Fed as a generally neutral arbiter guided by its mandate to keep inflation in check and the job market humming. As a result, any perception that Mr. Trump is undermining the Fed's autonomy could rattle markets, according to Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory firm deVere Group.",

    "summary": "Last week, Cracker Barrel announced that it was changing its logo to remove the image of a man sitting in a chair leaning against a barrel, and replacing it with a logo that only featured the chain's name.",
    "story": [
      "Less than a week after unveiling a controversial new logo that prompted the company's stock value to take a dive and even President Trump to weigh in, Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday that it will return to its old logo.",
      "\"We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel,\" the popular Southern-themed restaurant chain announced in a post to social media. \"We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain.\"",
      "Last week, the restaurant chain suddenly announced it was changing its logo to remove the image of a man sitting in a chair leaning against a barrel, and replacing it with a logo that only featured the chain's name.",
      "The Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel, which has more than 650 locations in 44 states, saw a Wall Street revolt of sorts, as it lost a staggering nearly $100 million in market value after releasing the new logo, which was part of an ongoing effort to update its image by adding new menu items and redecorating its stores.",
      "\"Rather than just showing one person, we wanted to feature lots of people,\" the company said on its website of the new logo. \"The idea was to celebrate the diversity of all our guests with a logo that represented our continued passion for pleasing people of all races, colors, and genders.\"",
      "The move also drew criticism from customers and some conservative commentators, who saw the change as potentially politically motivated. Branding expert Nick Yeonakis told CBS News the original logo was a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "On Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump called on Cracker Barrel to scrap the new logo.",
      "\"Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.",
      "Mr. Trump followed up Tuesday evening by praising the company for returning to the old logo, writing that \"all of your fans very much appreciate it.\"",
      "And in a post to X, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich said he spoke by phone with Cracker Barrel executives on Tuesday, who \"thanked President Trump for weighing in on the issue of their iconic 'original' logo. They wanted the President to know that they heard him, along with customer response (the ultimate poll), and would be restoring the 'Old Timer.'\"",
      "Cracker Barrel has seen its growth slow in recent years after its business soared in the 1990s. In 2024, it reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "According to the company, the iconic logo was created in 1977 on the back of a napkin by a designer named Bill Holley \"with the goal of creating a feeling of nostalgia with an old-timer wearing overalls.\"",

    "summary": "Adam Foley and his wife said they rented a car from Hertz. When they returned home, the company said he owed $350 for two small dents and a processing fee.",
    "story": [
      "As millions of Americans get ready to hit the road for Labor Day weekend, some rental car companies are deploying artificial intelligence scanners to look for damage \u2014 and it may lead to more consumers getting dinged.",
      "The new technology that spots damage to rental vehicles has sparked concerns among lawmakers after some customers complained about surprise repair costs and added fees.",
      "Adam Foley and his wife said they rented a car from Hertz during a family trip to Atlanta this summer. When they returned home to San Antonio, Foley said he started getting automated messages from the rental company. The messages claimed damages were found on the rental vehicle, saying he owed $80 for two small dents and another $190 for a processing fee.",
      "\"So a total of $350 for pretty negligible events that I didn't even detect,\" Foley told CBS News. He raised his concerns last month in a LinkedIn post. \"I think as a consumer it feels pretty extortive.\"",
      "The damages were identified by AI-powered photo booths that snap thousands of high-resolution images of the vehicles before and after rentals. UVeye, a New Jersey-based software company, provided technology.",
      "Hertz says it is currently using the system at 10 U.S. airports, with plans to roll it out nationwide, but added that the company is still continuing to refine the process.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the company said the old process of manually inspecting cars \"caused confusion and frustration\" because it was \"subjective and inconsistent.\"",
      "\"With digital vehicle inspections, we're introducing much-needed precision, objectivity, and transparency to the process \u2014 giving our customers greater confidence that they won't be charged for damage that didn't occur during their rental, and a more efficient resolution process when damage does occur,\" the statement reads.",
      "Hertz also said it has waived Foley's damage costs, telling CBS News: \"We strive to get it right for every customer - and when we fall short, we work to make it right.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Tuesday demanded answers from the CEO of Hertz on how the technology is being used, including an explanation on how the fees are reasonable and fair to charge consumers, according to a letter obtained by CBS News.",
      "Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, chair of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation, also sent a similar letter to Hertz last week.",
      "\"We've seen cases where customers have disputed the damage because they think it's a shadow and not actually a dent or a scratch or a mark,\" said Lindsay Owens, a Washington, D.C.-based consumer advocate.",
      "Owens told CBS News that such technology can be used for good and can make things easier for consumers. \"I think the problem is when these technologies are being used to overcharge customers,\" she added.",
      "Hertz declined to be interviewed but said the UVeye system offers precision and objectivity, giving its customers \"greater confidence that they won't be charged for damage that didn't occur during their rental.\"",
      "UVeye said its inspection systems are currently inspecting millions of vehicles every month at dealerships, service centers and car rental locations.",
      "Sixt confirmed to CBS News it is using the technology at select locations. Avis looked at AI in 2019 but their damage assessment process remains \"human-led,\" the company said. Enterprise Mobility said they did not use the technology at their rental locations.",
      "The UVeye scanners are \"being calibrated to detect different levels of damage based on the client,\" the software company told CBS News in a statement. \"UVeye technology reduces the need for manual walkarounds, increases vehicle safety, and ensures a reliable, objective record of vehicle condition. The goal is to surface issues early, reduce confusion, and give customers greater confidence in the process.\"",
      "Of the over 675,000 rentals scanned so far at Hertz, the rental company says more than 97% showed no billable damage.",
      "A CBS News crew rented a vehicle from Hertz at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport recently, and the company did not proactively notify us that the AI system was in use. When asked about it at the counter, we were not able to view the \"before\" images of the car \u2014 and we did not receive a bill for any damage.",
      "As for Foley, whose job is to advise companies on using AI technology, he said he \"probably would have picked somewhere else\" had he known about it.",
      "\"I don't want to have to worry about driving behind a truck that kicks up a rock,\" Foley said.",
      "Foley added that he's relieved to get his money back.",
      "\"I think that without national news coverage the charges would still be standing today,\" he said. \"It shouldn't take the amount of publicity I received following my post to be treated like a valued customer.\"",

      "An organized retail theft ring responsible for over $10 million in stolen merchandise from Southern California Home Depot stores has been busted in what the Ventura County Sheriff's Department is calling the largest retail theft case uncovered in the store's history.",
      "\"The crew wasn't just grabbing random items,\" Ventura County Sheriff Jim Fryhoff said. \"They were highly organized and targeting Home Depot and focusing on expensive electrical components like breakers, dimmers, switches and outlets.\"",
      "In all, 14 people have been arrested, and so far, nine have been charged by the Ventura County District Attorney's office. Investigators have seized an estimated $3.7 million in Home Depot property.",
      "Prosecutors said 600 thefts occurred over several years at 71 separate Home Depot stores in Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties.",
      "At the top of the theft ring was David Ahl, who owns Arya Wholesale store in Tarzana and would allegedly sell the stolen goods at reduced prices. He faces 48 felony counts, including conspiracy, organized retail theft, grand theft, receiving stolen property, and money laundering, prosecutors said.",
      "Ahl's brother-in-law, Omid Abrishamkar, allegedly helped sell the stolen items online through Amazon and eBay. Prosecutors said he faces 11 felony charges, including conspiracy, receiving stolen property, money laundering and others.",
      "\"Both of these men are alleged to have used wholesale and online businesses as fronts to make dirty money look clean,\" Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko said. He said his office has seized over $800,000 of that dirty money.",
      "Meanwhile, Ahl's ex-wife, Lorena Solis, and her boyfriend Enrique Moreno allegedly ran a nearly identical \"fencing operation\" of their own. Each faces eight counts of conspiracy for their alleged role in reselling stolen merchandise to electrical supply warehouses, prosecutors said.",
      "Ahl's own employees, which police called \"booster crews,\" were also allegedly involved. Three of Ahl's employees made up the core of the booster crew in Ventura County. Prosecutors said each would enter and exit the stores multiple times, with each trip bringing in between $6,000 and $10,000 in stolen merchandise.",
      "Home Depot store surveillance video provided by the task force showed the suspects in the store, grabbing merchandise off shelves and stuffing it inside their jackets.",

    "summary": "Investors still expect a September interest-rate cut despite President Trump move to oust Fed official Lisa Cook.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. financial markets edged higher on Tuesday, with investors shrugging off immediate concerns over President Trump's decision to\u00a0remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, an unprecedented move that analysts say could hinder the central bank's independence.",
      "The S&P 500 gained 26 points, or 0.4%, to close at 6,466, while the Dow Jones industrial Average climbed 135 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 95 points, or 0.5%.",
      "The muted reaction in the U.S. contrasted with sharp declines on global markets, as investors digested news of a potential Fed shakeup that could reshape the composition of the Board of Governors.",
      "Mr. Trump made his announcement in a letter posted on Truth Social on Monday evening, accusing Cook of mortgage fraud. The president said the move was \"effective immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was repeating allegations against Cook first leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. The senior housing official, who runs the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged earlier this week that Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "\"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday in the letter addressed to Cook. The president had previously\u00a0called\u00a0on the Fed official to resign.",
      "Cook responded to the Monday post with a statement saying that Mr. Trump has no authority to fire her and that she will not resign, setting up a potential legal showdown that will test the president's authority to fire a member of the central bank. Under the Federal Reserve Act, the president can only remove a Fed official \"for cause.\" Fed board members serve for 14-year terms.",
      "Mr. Trump \"purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022,\" Cook said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields were mixed, with longer-term yields rising and lower-term yields edging lower.",
      "While Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook could be a source of unease for investors, it did not appear to shake their faith in a September rate cut. Traders put the probability of a 0.25% rate cut at 90%, according to data from CME Group.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cracker-barrel-logo-barrel-stock-cbrl-ceo/",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:27:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel misread its own customer base \u2014 and our culturally sensitive times \u2014 in revamping its image, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "When Cracker Barrel unveiled its new logo last week as part of an ongoing brand refresh, it wouldn't have expected the marketing move to spark a public furor and cause the restaurant chain's value to sink by nearly $100 million.",
      "Yet the episode highlights the potential perils of tinkering with a company's branding. Following the backlash, Cracker Barrel conceded that its rebrand amounted to a misstep, saying in a statement on Monday that it \"could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\"",
      "Much of the uproar focused on the new Cracker Barrel logo doing away with the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel. The man depicts company founder Dan Evins' Uncle Herschel, whom Cracker Barrel insists will remain an integral part of its brand identity.",
      "\"Uncle Herschel will still be on our menu...on our road signs and featured in our country store. He's not going anywhere \u2014 he's family,\" Cracker Barrel said.",
      "Brands as stories",
      "Marketing experts are more blunt about Cracker Barrel's misfire.",
      "\"From a branding perspective, it's basically a flop,\" said David E. Johnson, CEO of branding agency Strategic Vision PR Group, of Cracker Barrel's logo redesign. \"What they did wrong is they went against their brand story, which was the old logo, that reflected the southern, whimsical atmosphere in the stores.\"",
      "In Johnson's view, Cracker Barrel's mistake was that it replaced a logo with genuine symbolic currency for a \"very generic looking logo that doesn't tell a story.\" Other branding experts say the hubbub is the result of a business severing its design from its roots \u2014 a cardinal sin for a company like Cracker Barrel whose folksy image is meant to evoke \"homestyle country cooking.\"",
      "More specifically, Cracker Barrel's new logo retains the rustic color palette of the original design, while removing the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel.",
      "The first Cracker Barrel restaurant was launched in Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1969 by Evins while working for his family's gasoline business. The idea was to recreate the kind of homey restaurants he'd enjoyed as a child, according to the company's\u00a0website. And until the logo redesign, the figure of\u00a0Herschel\u00a0had been central to much of the restaurant's branding and merchandise.",
      "The decision to remove both Herschel and the namesake barrel from the logo irked some Cracker Barrel loyalists because the original image represented what franchise consultant and branding expert Nick Yeonakis called a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "Still, marketing experts agree that Cracker Barrel, which operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S., was due for an image revamp. The company's growth, which soared in the 1990s, has slowed in recent years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "In 2024, concerns over its competitiveness and stagnant growth prompted the company, led by new CEO and former Taco Bell executive Julie Felss Masino, to announce changes to its restaurants, menu and pricing.",
      "The chain had become less relevant in part because it had leaned too heavily on the \"timeless nature of our concept,\" Masino said in a May 2024 conference call with Wall Street analysts. \"The goal, simply put, was to freshen things in such a way as to be noticeable and attractive but still feel like Cracker Barrel,\" she said.",
      "Today, Cracker Barrel maintains that its restaurants will retain their old-timey vibe, including using Uncle Herschel in its marketing.",
      "\"We love seeing how much you care about our 'old-timer.' We love him too,\" Cracker Barrel said Monday.",
      "According to a recent YouGov survey of 1,000 adults, 76% of those polled said they prefer the company's old logo to the new one.",
      "Sign of the times",
      "Customer anger over Cracker Barrel's new logo also reflects the culturally and politically charged environment companies face today. For example, when Bud Light partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023, some customers called for a boycott of the beer brand, badly denting the beer brand's sales.",
      "In one social media post that typified some of the criticism of Cracker Barrel, one account called \"Woke War Room\" called for Masino to resign. \"Cracker Barrel's new logo isn't an accident \u2014 it's CEO Julie Felss Masino's project. She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding,\" the post\u00a0reads.",
      "Such critiques illustrate the fine line companies are often forced to tread, Carreen Winters, president of reputation at MikeWorldWide, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very hard to be a brand for everybody today because we are so polarized, and people look at things through a political lens even if there is no political intent,\" she said. \"When you are a legacy brand, it's really important to understand who your core is, and to not do anything to alienate them while cultivating your future or next generation customer.\"",
      "Other experts are skeptical Cracker Barrel's redesign was politically motivated.",
      "\"I really doubt the Cracker Barrel executives sat down and said, 'We'll go through this enormously expensive undertaking to change all of our signage and everything on social media in order to change something because we feel we want to be 'woke,'\" Thomas Murphy, a business professor and branding expert at Clark University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Rather, Cracker Barrel missed the mark by failing to fully take into account people's emotional investment in its brand, Winters said.",
      "\"If you are a legacy brand and you're modernizing, you have to make sure you've appropriately honored that legacy because at the end of the day, your stakeholders own your brand \u2014 you don't,\" she said. \"Not understanding the customer and the rest of stakeholders and what they care about really matters, and that seems to be what went awry here.\"",

      "Ebert hopes that the company's large domestic manufacturing footprint positions it for success amid the Trump administration's trade war. President Trump has said he's using tariffs as a tool to revitalize American industry by limiting importers' ability to undercut domestic manufacturers on price.",
      "Ebert said its U.S. factories are well-positioned to handle a surge in demand.",
      "\"When the factory is running the way we want, every three seconds a unit's coming out of the factory,\" he said.",
      "He added that the company's Clyde, Ohio, factory is not currently running at capacity, because customer demand doesn't require it to turn out as many machines it's capable of producing.",
      "\"We've seen volumes decline over the past three to four years,\" Ebert said.",
      "He attributes the sales dip to the ability of foreign competitors \u2014 including South Korea's LG and Samsung \u2014 to undercut Whirlpool's U.S. prices by using cheaper imported steel.",
      "Whirlpool, by contrast, sources 96% of metal for domestic products from the U.S., according to Ebert, leading to higher prices for American consumers.",
      "For this reason, Whirlpool hopes President Trump's 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum\u00a0will allow the company to better compete with the likes of LG and Samsung.",
      "Pay the penalty on steel",
      "\"Our competition overseas, really just on the raw material side \u2014 just take steel and resin \u2014 when the tariff is in place, they're going to have to pay that penalty,\" Ebert said. \"They either are going to make less money or they are going to have to charge more for the consumer.\"",
      "\"That puts their price in line with ours,\" Ebert added.",
      "Tariffs on imported washing machines during President Trump's first term spurred domestic manufacturing while upping prices on washing machines by an average of $86, according to research from the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve.",
      "If demand for domestic-made appliances increases, Ebert said Whirlpool is ready to ramp up hiring to produce more machines.",
      "He also said the company is harnessing AI to make its workers more efficient, without replacing them, to reduce labor costs.",

    "summary": "Unable to find buyers, a growing number of sellers are pulling their homes off the market rather than compromise on price.",
    "story": [
      "In a sign of home sellers' frustration over how long it's taking to find a buyer,\u00a0more owners are opting to pull their property off the market rather than lower the asking price.",
      "That's according to a recent\u00a0report from Realtor.com finding that so-called delistings, or homes taken off the market without having been sold, were up 38% in June since the start of 2025 and 48% from a year ago.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer sellers are deciding to enter the market, and increasingly more are deciding to jump out,\" Jake Krimmel, senior economist at Realtor.com told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Signs of deadlock",
      "One indicator that more sellers are exiting the housing market is the ratio between the number of delistings and listings. For every 100 new homes listed nationally in June, 21 homes were taken off the market, the report found. That's up from 13 delisted homes per 100 new listings in May.",
      "A steady rise in delistings could push buyers and sellers further apart, creating a deadlock in the housing market, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"The thing that's going to prevent buyers and sellers from getting closer together is if all the sellers who maybe could or should be lowering their prices to meet the demand where it is are instead taking their homes off the market altogether,\" he said. \"So it's kind of like keeping us in this holding pattern.\"",
      "The trend comes as the supply of homes for sale begins to grow in certain U.S. regions, causing prices in those areas to drop. The number of homes for sale in July surged nearly 25% from a year ago, a post-pandemic high, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Despite the rise in housing inventory, home sales around the U.S. remain relatively stagnant, with steep prices and high mortgage rates continuing to deter many would-be homebuyers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Realtor.com data shows that pending home sales, or listings under contract, in July fell 3% in compared with the same period last year.",
      "No hurry to sell",
      "When homeowners are eager to sell a property, they typically lower the price in order to offload it quicker. However, those who are not up against the same type of time constraints may be willing to wait it out longer \u2014 especially if they're benefiting from a favorable mortgage rate.",
      "\"Maybe you're locked into payments that are relatively affordable for you,\" Krimmel said. \"You would prefer to sell, but not at a price that you're not comfortable with.\"",
      "Another factor is playing into the delisting trend, experts said \u2014 the surge in housing prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the housing market was red hot. As newly remote workers flocked to areas like Austin, Texas, home prices rose at\u00a0record levels, giving sellers a chance to cash in.",
      "While the market has since cooled substantially, sellers' pricing expectations have been slower to catch up.",
      "\"Maybe we've gotten a bit spoiled by very high home prices over the last many years, but we are seeing some softness in the market right now,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That may not be true in all markets, however. Miami is one of the places where sellers have been least willing to budge on price. According to Realtor.com's analysis, 59 homes were delisted for every 100 new homes listed in the southern Florida city \u2014 the highest ratio among the cities Realtor.com tracked. Meanwhile, less than 18% of listed homes in Miami came with a price reduction in July, according to Realtor.com.",
      "\"If sellers are choosing to take properties off the market rather than lower prices, it may signal renewed confidence in Miami's future, and a growing belief that this is a market worth holding for the long haul,\" Ana Bozovic, a Miami-based real estate agent and founder of Analytics Miami, told Realtor.com.",

      "Elon Musk on Monday targeted Apple and OpenAI in an antitrust lawsuit alleging that the iPhone maker and the ChatGPT maker are teaming up to thwart competition in artificial intelligence.",
      "The 61-page complaint filed in Texas federal court follows through on a threat that Musk made two weeks ago when he accused Apple of unfairly favoring OpenAI and ChatGPT in the iPhone's app store rankings for top AI apps.",
      "Musk's post insinuated that Apple had rigged the system against ChatGPT competitors such as the Grok chatbot made by his own xAI. Now, he is detailing a litany of grievances in the lawsuit \u2014 filed by xAI and another of his corporate entities, X Corp. \u2014 in an attempt to win monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the alleged illegal tactics.",
      "The double-barreled legal attack weaves together several recently unfolding narratives to recast a year-old partnership between Apple and OpenAI as a veiled conspiracy to stifle competition during a technological shift that could prove as revolutionary as the 2007 release of the iPhone.",
      "\"This is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,\" the lawsuit asserts.",
      "The complaint portrays Apple as a company that views AI as an \"existential threat\" to its future success, prompting it to collude with OpenAI in an attempt to protect the iPhone franchise that has long been its biggest moneymaker.",
      "Some of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything \"super apps,\" such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "The complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.",
      "OpenAI has countered with a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of harassment \u2014 an allegation that the company cited in its response to Monday's antitrust lawsuit. \"This latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk's ongoing pattern of harassment,\" OpenAI said in a statement.",
      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The crux of the lawsuit revolves around Apple's decision to use ChatGPT as an AI-powered \"answer engine\" on the iPhone when the built-in technology on its device couldn't satisfy user needs. The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",
      "The lawsuit doesn't mention the potential threat that ChatGPT could also pose to Apple and the iPhone's future popularity. As part of its expansion efforts, OpenAI recruited former Apple designer Jony Ive to oversee a project aimed at building an AI-powered device that many analysts believe could eventually mount a challenge to the iPhone.",

      "The Seattle coffee chain officially unveiled its new fall menu on Monday, which includes its Pumpkin Spice Latte and other autumn-inspired treats.",
      "The arrival date for Starbucks' fall menu has inched earlier over the years, now landing in August instead of mid-September, closer to the actual start of autumn. At the center of the coffee giant's fall offerings is its Pumpkin Spice Latte, which came onto the scene over 20 years ago. According to a company spokesperson, the PSL, which consists of espresso, steamed milk cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin, whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice, is the most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Starbucks has sold hundreds of millions of the autumnal concoction since the beverage was introduced in 2003.",
      "\"Obviously, I'm excited for the fall program,\" Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said during the coffee chain's July 29 earnings call. \"I, like many customers, love the Pumpkin Spice Latte.\"",
      "The coffee giant is also banking on sales from newcomers like Pecan Cold Foam, after\u00a0launching\u00a0a similar menu item last year. Cold Foam has become one of Starbucks' most popular add-ons with a 23% year-over-year growth, according to a company spokesperson. In June, the company announced it was piloting a\u00a0new banana-flavored protein variety.",
      "The fall menu, which includes a blend of old and new items, is likely to provide a boost to the coffee chain which has been suffering from weakening sales and in-store traffic. Starbucks sales in the U.S. declined 2% in the third quarter ended June 29, compared with the same period last year, according to the company's July earnings report.",

    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value Thursday after its stock plunged following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 million in its capitalization.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares gained in early trading Friday, but resumed their slide later in the day. The stock closed down 40 cents, or less than 1%, to $54.40. The shares fell again on Monday, sliding about 1% in late afternoon trading.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "In an updated statement released Monday, the company said the criticism has \"shown us that we could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\" Cracker Barrel added that it continues to serve \"generous portions of the food you crave at fair prices.\"",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "For its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $821.1 million, up slightly from $817.1 million, according to a regulatory filing.",

    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door to\u00a0cutting interest rates\u00a0for the first time in nearly a year, he noted the tremors beginning to shake a main pillar of the U.S. economy: the labor market.",
      "Concerns about the pace of job growth were heightened earlier this month after government data showed a sharp slowdown in hiring in July, along with much weaker payroll gains in May and June than previously thought. The disappointing numbers were alarming enough for President Trump to question their accuracy and to fire the head of the agency tasked with compiling the data.",
      "Yet labor experts tell CBS News they weren't surprised by the downturn, and caution that more pain could be in store for job seekers. Data released since the Aug. 1 job numbers show companies are delaying hiring as they adjust course to account for headwinds, including\u00a0fresh U.S. tariffs\u00a0and the advent of artificial intelligence, they say.",
      "\"There's a real cooling in the labor market,\" Andy Challenger, senior vice president of executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We're also having lots of individual conversations with companies that are letting us know to expect future layoffs.\"",
      "He added, \"So for me, there is more reason to be pessimistic about the labor market than optimistic we'll see some major bounce back.\"",
      "Here are three charts that could point to a serious downturn in the U.S. job market.",
      "Fewer workers are getting hired",
      "Overall, U.S. employers in 2025 have added fewer jobs on a monthly basis compared with the pace of gains in recent years, when companies sought to expand as the economy roared back from the pandemic. In 2024, employers hired an average of 168,000 workers each month, but that has slowed to an average of 35,000 over the past three months, Powell said on Friday.",
      "The risk is that the labor market could weaken from here, which could lead to \"sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,\" Powell said.",
      "The slowdown could spur the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate, policymakers' main tool for energizing the economy and job growth, at its meeting next month for the first time since December 2024. Lowering rates could bolster the labor market because it would make it cheaper for consumers to borrow, driving spending, for businesses to invest, including by adding workers.",
      "More long-term job seekers",
      "Another troubling sign is a recent surge in long-term job seekers, or people who have been searching for a job for more than 27 weeks. In July, about 1.8 million Americans had been looking for work for more than 27 weeks, a jump of about 64% from three years earlier and 20% from a year ago.",
      "It may not get easier to find work anytime soon, given signs from employers that they intend to continue to cut jobs, Challenger said.",
      "\"Don't take the summer off\" from looking for new work, he advised job-hunters. \"It's hard to imagine a scenario where the labor market will be better in three to six months.\"",
      "A jump in unemployed young workers",
      "At the same time, young workers are also having more trouble finding their first jobs, which has been blamed on everything from slowing economic activity this year to employers adopting artificial intelligence in place of entry-level workers.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low, at 4.2%. Yet that statistic is backward-looking, reflecting the labor market's strength in previous months \u2014 it says little about economic conditions moving forward.",
      "Meanwhile, for new college graduates the current job market amounts to \"a perfect storm,\" said career coach Tracey Newell.",
      "\"Companies are limiting new entry-level roles, and AI is replacing many traditional 'starter' jobs,\" she added, noting that it isn't unusual for employers these days to receive hundreds of job applications for a single position.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 07:49:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The first commercial carbon storage facility has been inaugurated off Norway's coast, but is storing CO2 deep under the seabed really the answer?",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/for-some-starbucks-workers-job-leaves-bitter-taste/",
    "published": "Sun, 24 Aug 2025 23:30:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Baristas at the coffee chain worry the company won't fulfill its promise to improve working conditions.",
    "story": [
      "Liberte Locke, a 32-year-old \"barista\" at a Starbucks (SBUX) in New York City, is fed up.",
      "\"Starbucks' attitude is that there's always someone else who can do the job,\" she said in running through her complaints about life at the java giant.",
      "If that isn't necessarily the consensus among Starbucks workers, interviews with nine current and former baristas at the company make clear it's not an isolated opinion, either. Even those who say they like their job paint a picture of a business that underpays front-line workers, enforces work rules arbitrarily, and too often fails to strike a balance between corporate goals and employee needs.",
      "Of course, such complaints are nothing new in retail, where low pay and erratic schedules are the norm. But by its own account, Starbucks is no ordinary company and is ostensibly a far cry from the fast-food outlets now facing a nationwide uprising by employees tired of working for peanuts.",
      "That's evident in the company's recruitment pitch. Starbucks invites job-seekers to \"become a part of something bigger and inspire positive change in the world,\" describing it as a chance to discover a \"deep sense of purpose.\"",
      "Damage control",
      "That image suffered a serious blow last month after The New York Times vividly chronicled a Starbucks worker struggling with the company's scheduling practices. The story, which centered on a 22-year-old barista and single mother, amounted to a public relations nightmare for Starbucks. Perhaps not coincidentally, within days of the story's publication top executives were promising reform.",
      "In a memo to employees earlier this month, for instance, Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead vowed to \"transform the U.S. partner experience,\" referring to Starbucks' more than 130,000 baristas.  Inviting worker feedback, he said Starbucks will examine its approach to employee pay, revisit its dress code, make it easier for people to ask for time off, and consider other changes aimed at helping baristas balance work and their personal lives.",
      "Among other changes, the company said it would end the practice of \"clopening,\" when an employee responsible for closing a store late at night is also assigned to open it early in the morning.",
      "\"We recognize that we can do more for our partners who wear the apron every day,\" he wrote.",
      "Although Starbucks workers welcome this pledge to respect the apron, they fear the company is more intent on dousing the PR flames than on genuinely improving employees' experience. After the retailer last month sent an email to workers outlining possible solutions to the kind of scheduling problems and related issues detailed by the Times, a group of baristas gave the proposal a C- and posted online a marked-up version of the memo listing their own demands (see image above).",
      "\"We hope you're ready for a commitment to give us schedules that don't mess with taking care of kids, going to school or holding onto that second job we need because Sbux wages don't make ends meet,\" wrote the baristas, who are working with a union-backed labor group, the Center for Popular Democracy.",
      "Retail jungle",
      "Despite the recent media focus on Starbucks, the company's labor practices are generally no worse than those of many large retailers. In some ways they're better, with the company offering health care to part-time, as well as full-time, workers; unusually generous 401(k) matching contributions; annual stock grants to employees; and tuition reimbursement.",
      "Starbucks highlights such benefits as an example of its commitment to employees. \"Sharing success with one another has been core to the company's heritage for more than 40 years,\" Alstead said in the September memo.",
      "Meanwhile, some baristas say they enjoy their work and feel valued by Starbucks. \"It's a decent place to work, and my manager and co-workers are great,\" said one employee who asked not to be identified.",
      "But other current and former workers claim Starbucks has changed in recent years, saying that  corporate leaders' intense focus on slashing costs has short-circuited its professed commitment to workers. Mostly, they say Starbucks doesn't listen to employees and even punishes those who identify problems.",
      "\"The biggest problem is that baristas don't have a voice,\" said Sarah  Madden, a former Starbucks barista who left the company this spring  after two years with the coffee vendor. \"They can't speak to issues that  they know exist. Workers know how to fix them, but when [they] speak up  there are serious repercussions -- your hours get cut, you're  transferred to another store or isolated from other people.\"",
      "Employees interviewed for this article said one result of Starbucks' cost-containment push is that stores are frequently understaffed, hurting customer service and forcing managers to scramble to find staff. That problem is common across the big-box stores that dominate the retail sector, experts said.",
      "\"On the one hand, retailers overhire, but they're also understaffed, so  everybody's running around and then there aren't enough people on the  floor,\" said Susan Lambert, a professor at the University of Chicago and  an expert in work-life issues. \"Companies are effectively loading all  the risk onto workers so that they're not the ones incurring the risks  inherent in business.\"",
      "Starbucks denies that its stores are short-staffed. \"We're proud of the level of service we provide in our stores,\" said Zack Hutson, a spokesman for the company. \"We know that the connection our partners have with customers is the foundation of the Starbucks experience. It wouldn't be in our best interest. We want our customers to have the appropriate service level when they come to our stores.\"",
      "To be sure, Starbucks is hardly the only U.S. corporate giant to keep a gimlet eye on its bottom line -- among Fortune 500 companies that approach to management is the rule, not the exception, and CEOs across the land defend it as an inviolable fiduciary duty to shareholders.",
      "But baristas say Starbucks' focus on profits and cost-cutting has increasingly led its leadership to tune workers out. Locke, who has worked for the company since 2006 and who earns roughly $16,000 a year, said she yearned for the Starbucks of old.",
      "\"When I started they had a training program and taught you how to be a coffee expert. There was more of a culture of supporting each other as co-workers. Store managers were sympathetic. I really enjoyed it.\"",
      "Asked why she stays at Starbucks, Locke said her employment options are limited because she lacks a college education and because her only professional experience is in retail.",
      "Living wage?",
      "According to workers, the best thing Starbucks can do for its apron-wearers is to raise their pay and offer full-time hours instead of the 20 to 30 hours that most employees work.",
      "Samantha Cole, a barista in Omaha, Neb., said she struggles to get by on her supervisor's salary of $11.25 an hour. Such pay may be better than what she would earn working for other retailers, but the 30-year-old mother of two say it's still not a living wage.",
      "\"I'm definitely not making enough money,\" said Cole, who has been with the company for six years. \"A lot of us are right there with what fast-food workers are making.\"",
      "Such frustrations are also evident in comments on the Facebook page Starbucks uses to communicate with employees and where it is asking baristas for input regarding the company's labor practices. Wrote one employee: \"I've worked for the company for 7 years in January, and I don't make enough to support myself on one job so I work 2 jobs, 6 days a week.... I've seen a lot of amazing partners leave because they don't make enough.\"",
      "Starbucks declined to disclose compensation data, citing competitive reasons and saying that pay varies widely according to workers' experience and where in the U.S. stores are located. It didn't respond to emails requesting clarification regarding other aspects of its labor policies.",
      "It's worth noting that low pay isn't unique to Starbucks -- in retail it is the norm. As of 2012 (the latest year for which data is available), the median hourly income for retail salespeople is $10.29 per hour, or $21,410 a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Hourly pay for full-time retail workers range from a high of $14.42 to $9.61 for lower-paid people, according to Demos, a liberal-leaning think tank in New York. Part-timers typically make much less, with the average cashier earning $18,500 a year.",
      "\"Until [Starbucks] gives a living wage to every employee, they can't claim to be a good employer,\" Locke said, who added that it has been roughly two years since her last pay raise.",
      "\"Race to the bottom\"",
      "Another priority for baristas: stable, regular schedules. Like most large retailers, Starbucks uses scheduling software to try to match the number of workers it has in a store at any given time to the amount of business it gets. Workers also may be scheduled according to the sales they generate or their facility in promoting certain products. The technology also can enable other savings, such as limiting overtime.",
      "For employees, however, that approach -- known as \"just-in-time\" or \"on-call\" scheduling -- often results in lower income and chaotic hours.",
      "Stephanie Luce, a professor of labor studies at City University of New York's Murphy Institute, characterizes the widespread adoption of scheduling and so-called workforce optimization technologies as a \"new race to the bottom.\"",
      "\"Companies that have already reduced operating costs by making deals with irresponsible subcontractors and using the cheapest available materials are now cutting corners in the form of the 'just-in- time scheduling' of their workforce,\" she and her co-authors wrote in a recent report. \"These 'lean' manufacturing practices take advantage of sophisticated software and an increasingly desperate workforce to cut labor costs to the bone.\"",
      "By the same token, tighter control of worker schedules helps Starbucks contain payroll costs. But it also means employees who had expected to work a certain number of hours every week can see their schedules dramatically cut back and fluctuate wildly. The result? Smaller paychecks and a disturbance to family life.",
      "\"It makes it very hard for parents to participate in an intimate family routine and structure it in such a way that experts agree is good for children,\" Lambert said.",
      "Irregular schedules also make it hard for workers who do need extra income to work a second job, schedule appointments and plan other aspects of their lives.",
      "Baristas said Starbucks posts their schedule only days in advance and that they are often subject to change. Following the Times story, Starbucks said it would post schedules at least one week in advance. That's not enough time, several workers said, asking the company to provide at least two or three weeks notice, as retailers ranging from Walmart (WMT) and H&M to Victoria's Secret (LB) do.",
      "Meanwhile, despite Starbucks' promise to end clopening, the practice continues, some workers said, although the company insists that this is only in cases when people request such shifts.",
      "\"Partners should never be required to work opening and closing shifts. That policy is clear,\" Starbucks' Hutson said, adding that the company is studying ways to give workers more input in their schedules. \"If there are cases where that's not happening, we want to know about that.\"",
      "Given the scrutiny on Starbucks, the company can count on baristas to do just that.",

      "In a social media post Friday afternoon, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the deal had been finalized, but did not elaborate.",
      "\"The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,\" Lutnick wrote. \"This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.\"",
      "Lutnick also thanked Tan \"for striking a deal that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "Intel confirmed the deal in a news release Friday evening which stated that the U.S. government would \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",
      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",

      "In an annual address\u00a0from Jackson Hole Wyoming, Powell said Friday that current economic conditions \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",
      "Despite pressure from President Trump, the Fed has held off on cutting rates this year as it monitors the impact of Trump administration's tariffs on inflation and the labor market. Powell's speech on Friday, however, may be the strongest indication yet that policy changes could be afoot.",
      "\"With Powell acknowledging that it may be time for the Fed to alter its restrictive policy, this could set up stocks for a short-term relief rally,\" said Bret Kenwell, eToro investment analyst, in an email note on Friday.",
      "\"When Fed chairs open the door for a rate cut, it's quite difficult to close,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. \"The August employment report or consumer price index are unlikely enough to change Powell's opinion.\"",
      "The central bank is tasked with ensuring full employment and while keeping inflation in check \u2014 a tricky balance as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to rise, and vice versa.",
      "On Friday, Powell suggested that the balance was shifting toward bolstering the labor market. Job growth, he said, has \"slowed considerably\" and that the \"downside risks to employment are rising.\"",
      "Job growth came in weaker than expected in July, with employers adding 73,000 jobs. The Labor Department also revised job growth\u00a0sharply down for May and June.",
      "\"Overall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Energy suppliers are having trouble keeping up with the rapid increase in demand, and consumers in some states are seeing higher monthly bills.",
    "story": [
      "A July 11 post in a Hoboken, New Jersey, parenting group on Facebook pointed to a frustrating trend: \"Our utility bill is more than double what it was last month. ... Anything we can do about it?\" The post had several dozen replies and most of the commenters said their home utility bills had also risen dramatically.",
      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",
      "\"Who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,\" he said.",
      "New Jersey is poised to be among the first to test the issue in the governor's race this November.",
      "\"Affordability is the number one issue in this race, and rising energy prices are also at the top of everyone's mind,\" Ambrose told CBS News.",
      "Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, in July released a statement accusing PJM of \"mismanagement\" of the grid: \"PJM has refused to plug clean, cheap power like solar into the grid, while giving preference to coal and oil.\"",
      "And earlier this month, her opponent, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, wrote in a post on X about \"Rebecca in Highland Park,\" whose electric bill he said had tripled, \"to more than $1000.\"",
      "\"Why? Because Trenton Democrats, with the approval of my opponent Mikie Sherrill, shut down six electricity generation plants around the state, stopped burning natural gas, and didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey,\" Ciattarelli said.",
      "\"We can look at how folks are going to vote in this upcoming election, as a reflection on how they're feeling about the country at large,\" says Ambrose, \"This affordability problem is not going away.\"",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll earlier this month found that 26% of voters blame the utility companies for price hikes, 19% blame Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, and 10% say that energy producers are at fault. Murphy is not running for reelection due to term limits.",
      "\"Utility bills directly impact elections,\" says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based energy consultancy firm. Gramlich pointed to the most infamous example of this, the California recall election in 2003, prompted in large part by the state's energy crisis. It cost Democrat Gray Davis the governorship and handed it to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
      "Gramlich indicated he expects energy prices to remain high for the foreseeable future, predicting that \"two years from now, we're going to see a lot more policy discussion about it.\"",

      "Amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of artificial intelligence, Google says it has calculated the energy required for its Gemini AI service: Sending a single text prompt consumes as much energy as watching television for nine seconds.",
      "The technology giant on Thursday unveiled a new methodology to measure the environmental impact of its AI models, including energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions.",
      "AI tools have the potential to drive economic growth by boosting productivity and unlocking other efficiencies, economists say. By one estimate from Goldman Sachs, the tech is poised to increase global GDP by 7%, or $7 trillion, over 10 years.",
      "At the same time, scientists are flagging the outsized environmental impact of AI, which is not yet fully understood even as data centers require enormous amounts of electricity.",
      "\"In order to improve the energy efficiency of AI, a clear and comprehensive understanding of AI's environmental footprint is important. To date, comprehensive data on the energy and environmental impact of AI inference has been limited,\" Ben Gomes, Google's senior vice president of learning and sustainability, said in a blog post Thursday.",
      "Aside from their electricity needs, AI data centers also require \"a great deal of water ... \u00a0to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems,\" research from MIT\u00a0shows. \"The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.\"",
      "Some new data centers require energy between 100 and 1000 megawatts, roughly equivalent to powering 80,000 to 800,000 homes, according to an April GAO report. For now, however, there are\u00a0no regulations that require corporations to disclose how much energy or water their AI tools consume.",
      "Google said in a technical paper released Thursday by its AI energy and emissions researchers that as adoption of AI tools rises, \"so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental impact of AI serving.\"",
      "What's the environmental impact of Gemini AI?",
      "Google's new paper on the environmental impact of its own AI tools aims to set a standard for measuring the energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions of various AI models, the company said.",
      "A typical Gemini text query uses 0.24 watt-hours (Wh) of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters \u2014 or about five drops \u2014 of water.",
      "By comparison, the average ChatGPT query uses 0.34 Wh and about one fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has written.",
      "Google also outlined the progress it has made in reducing the environmental impact of its Gemini platform. Over a recent 12-month period, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the median Gemini text prompt decreased by factors of 33x and 44x, respectively, it said.",

      "Monday's open letter to Congress \u2014 known as the \"Katrina Declaration\" \u2014 said it was signed by 191 current and former FEMA employees. Some 35 attached their names, while the rest said they withheld them over fear of retaliation.",
      "Some of the current FEMA employees who used their names received emails on Tuesday night saying they had been placed on paid administrative leave \"effective immediately, and continuing until further notice,\" according to copies of the emails reviewed by CBS News.",
      "\"While on administrative leave, you will be in a non-duty status while continuing to receive pay and benefits,\" the letter read. The staffers were told not to visit FEMA facilities, access the department's telecommunication systems or carry out any of their official duties, aside from responding to inquiries from the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The agency also told staff that they must remain available to work during business hours.",
      "The emails did not provide a reason for the decision. Staffers were told the move \"is not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive.\"",
      "In a statement, FEMA called the signatories \"the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency\" and accused them of having \"forgotten that their duty is to the American people not entrenched bureaucracy.\"",
      "\"Our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems,\" FEMA continued. \"Under the leadership of Secretary Noem, FEMA will return to its mission of assisting Americans at their most vulnerable.\"",
      "The Washington Post was first to report on the suspensions.",
      "The \"Katrina Declaration\" was published as the United States marks the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which was one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. The 2005 hurricane prompted major changes to the nation's disaster relief system \u2014 and Monday's letter argued many of those reforms could be reversed by the Trump administration.",
      "The letter accuses President Trump of picking unqualified people to lead FEMA, and criticizes the administration for cutting the agency's workforce and terminating grants meant to help state and local governments harden their infrastructure to mitigate the impact of natural disasters.",
      "The declaration said it hopes changes are made in time to \"prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.\"",
      "The Trump administration has pushed for sweeping changes to FEMA. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested either \"getting rid of FEMA\" or \"fundamentally reforming\" the agency by pushing some of its duties to state governments. So far this year, the agency has lost roughly one-third of its staff through a combination of firings and voluntary departures.",
      "FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues responded to the letter Monday by defending the Trump administration's record of handling natural disasters and arguing FEMA was previously \"bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,\" Llargues said. \"It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said Monday he has fired Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Her attorney countered that they plan to file a lawsuit challenging the move.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday he has fired Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, a dramatic move after months of public attacks against the central bank.",
      "Cook and her attorney said Tuesday that the move has no legal basis and that they plan to file a lawsuit challenging the president's action.",
      "The president announced Cook's removal from the Fed board in a letter posted to Truth Social that accused Cook of making false statements on mortgage documents, actions he claimed were \"gross negligence\" and \"potentially criminal.\" Mr. Trump had previously urged Cook to resign, leading the economist to say she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"",
      "The move is an early test of Mr. Trump's power to terminate members of the Federal Reserve. Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a letter to Cook: \"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.\"",
      "Cook still has access to her office at the Federal Reserve in Washington, a source familiar with the situation told CBS News on Tuesday. The central bank has deferred making any decisions about her status until a court decision is issued, which means nothing has changed in the Fed's view regarding how Cook is able to carry out her duties, according to the source.",
      "The source noted there is no official business before the Fed board this week, and pointed to the end of August being quiet. The source declined to discuss Cook's participation in a mid-September meeting of the Fed's interest rate-setting committee.",
      "In a statement, Cook said that Mr. Trump \"purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.\"",
      "Her attorney Abbe Lowell said Cook will challenge her firing in court.",
      "\"President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis. We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action,\" Lowell said.",
      "A Federal Reserve spokesperson said in a statement the Fed will \"continue to carry out its duties as established by law.\" The central bank also noted Cook's plan to sue over her firing, and said it \"will abide by any court decision.\"",
      "\"Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,\" the statement read.",
      "What are Trump's allegations against Lisa Cook?",
      "The allegations against Cook were leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has also\u00a0pushed\u00a0Mr. Trump's foe, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, to resign. Pulte\u00a0sent a letter\u00a0to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of taking out mortgages for homes in Michigan and Georgia in 2021, and telling banks in both cases that she planned to use the homes as her primary residences. Pulte alleged that was a fraudulent attempt to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "CBS News has obtained a copy of Pulte's letter to Bondi, a small portion of which Pulte posted online. The letter was provided by Georgetown University Law Center professor Adam Levitin, who specializes in commercial law and financial regulation.",
      "In the letter, Pulte alleges that Cook bought a house in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and a condo in Atlanta, Georgia, within two weeks of each other in June and July of 2021. The mortgage agreements for both properties required her to begin using them as principal residences within 60 days and to keep living there for at least a year, according to copies of the documents that were attached to Pulte's letter.",
      "The Atlanta condo was then listed for rent in September 2022, which Pulte said shows it \"was intended to be used as an investment/rental property, and not in fact a primary residence\" \u2014 though the one-year period for which it needed to serve as her principal residence technically would have ended between July and September of 2022.",
      "Typically, banks offer lower mortgage rates for primary residences than for second homes or investment properties because it's thought that if homeowners face financial strain, they're more likely to keep making payments for their primary home than for a vacation home or a rental property. Under federal lending rules, a primary residence is a home that a borrower lives in\u00a0for most of the year, while a second home must be occupied by the borrower by\u00a0part\u00a0\u2014 but not all \u2014 of the year.",
      "Cook did not list any rental income on her 2022 or 2023 financial disclosures, the letter notes.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Cook must resign, now!!!\"",
      "Cook said in a statement released through the Fed last week: \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Pulte has also made mortgage fraud allegations against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democratic officials and Trump foes who denied the accusations. Notably, James's office sued Mr. Trump and his company for loan fraud before his return to the White House, securing an almost $400 million civil court judgment that was tossed out by a New York state appellate court last week.",
      "In a\u00a0blog post, Levitin argued Cook's firing was illegal and questioned the allegations leveled by Pulte. He wrote that, to prove criminality, prosecutors would need to show that Cook \"knowingly\" defrauded her lenders, and it's \"far from clear\" that she intentionally misled anybody.",
      "\"Most borrowers do not read their security instruments, so it is entirely possible that Cook had no idea what she was promising beyond that she would pay the mortgage note when installments came due,\" Levitin wrote.",
      "Can Trump fire Cook?",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" Courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause,\" though it is generally thought to be malfeasance. Congress has in other federal laws restricted the president's power to remove officers at independent agencies to inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "In Cook's case, the allegations made by Pulte boil down to possible mortgage fraud, specifically that she took out two different mortgages within weeks of each other, stating both properties would serve as her primary residence. To prove fraud, the Justice Department would have to prove intent to misrepresent her financial situation to the lending institutions involved. That would have come in the criminal referral investigation made last week.",
      "The Supreme Court has in a series of recent rulings reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at-will. In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "Lately, the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to remove members of multi-member agencies \u2014 the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission \u2014 without cause through decisions on its emergency docket.",
      "But the high court suggested in one of those emergency rulings that the Fed is different from other independent agencies. In an unsigned opinion, the court said the central bank is \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Why is Trump angry at the Fed?",
      "Cook's firing came after Mr. Trump spent months attacking the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "The Fed hiked interest rates to decades-long highs in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to quell inflation. After some cuts last year, the central bank has chosen to leave rates at relatively high levels so far this year, fearing that inflation could come roaring back or that Mr. Trump's tariff strategy could cause consumer prices to jump. The trade-off is that higher interest rates can lead to slower economic growth, and they make it more expensive for American consumers and businesses to borrow.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out over this strategy, nicknaming Powell \"Too Late.\" The president has\u00a0floated the idea\u00a0of firing Powell, in some cases accusing him of mismanaging a project to renovate the Fed's headquarters.",
      "Powell hinted last week that interest rate cuts could be on the horizon, as the Fed tries to prevent inflation from spiking without triggering higher unemployment. During a speech in Jackson Hole, he said the Fed will \"proceed carefully,\" but recent shifts \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",
      "Even without firings, the president could reshape the Fed board as positions open up. If the Senate confirms Mr. Trump's replacements for Cook and another Biden nominee who\u00a0stepped down early, five of the Fed's seven governors will be Trump appointees \u2014 making up most of the Fed's board of governors and more than one-third of the 12-member interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.",
      "Currently, three Fed board members are Trump picks: Powell, vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman and board member Christopher Waller.",
      "Mr. Trump is widely expected not to appoint Powell to another four-year term as Fed chair when his current one ends in May 2026, though he hasn't announced a successor yet. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u00a0has nominated\u00a0his economic adviser Stephen Miran to serve on the Fed board until January 2026, replacing Adriana Kugler, the Biden appointee who left the board earlier this month. It's unclear who he will pick to replace Cook.",
      "Cook was confirmed in 2022 by the Senate when then-Vice President Kamala Harris broke the 50-50 party line tie, making Cook the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. She started her term in May 2022 and it runs 14 years.",
      "She has voted in sync with Powell to hold interest rates steady so far this year.",
      "Reaction to Mr. Trump's move so far has been along party lines. For instance, in\u00a0a post on X, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said it was \"doing the right thing to hold people accountable\" while Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying this represented an \"authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act.\"",
      "Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect Mr. Trump picked three members of the current Fed board: Jerome Powell, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.",

      "\"The state of Texas is only 40% white, but white voters control over 73% of the state's congressional seats,\" Derrick Johnson, President and CEO of the NAACP, said in a statement. \"It's quite obvious that Texas's effort to redistrict mid-decade, before next year's midterm elections, is racially motivated. The state's intent here is to reduce the members of Congress who represent Black communities, and that, in and of itself, is unconstitutional.\"",
      "Since the Voting Rights Act was adopted, the state of Texas has been found to have discriminated against Black and/or Brown citizens after every cycle of redistricting, according to the NAACP.",
      "Accusations of racism dominate Texas debate over redistricting",
      "Democrats and Republicans accused each other of racism during their debate last week in the Texas House over the new congressional maps.",
      "Last Monday, the\u00a0Texas House established a quorum\u00a0for the first time in two weeks after Democrats left the state to block the new maps. That set the stage for the bill to come to the House floor. Democrats accused Republicans of violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.",
      "The Justice Department says on its website that section two of the Voting Rights Act prohibits \"discrimination in voting applies nationwide to any voting standard, practice, or procedure that results in the denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.\" Republicans insisted they followed this law.",
      "\"Once again, Republicans continue to make power grabs on the back of Black and brown communities,\" said Rep.

      "Pierson fired back at Democrats.",
      "\"The racist rhetoric is old. It is seriously stale and long overplayed. News flash: Democrats do not own minorities in Texas. Republicans are the majority, so it's not the people of Texas who are racist. It is you,\" said Pierson.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats will be trying to take control of the Senate in the midterm elections next year, eyeing a handful of competitive races and a couple of long-shot bids.",
      "Over a third of the Senate's seats are up for election in 2026 \u2014 Democrats will be defending 13 seats, while Republicans will be trying to hold onto 24. But the map offers few opportunities for Democrats to flip seats, with many of the Republicans seeking reelection hailing from states that President Trump comfortably won in 2024. Meanwhile, the retirement of three Senate Democrats up for reelection in 2026 has created possible openings for the GOP.",
      "With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in some competitive states, while flipping four seats in order to secure a majority.",
      "The key races likely to determine who controls the Senate after 2026 are beginning to take shape, with contentious primary challenges in some states and newcomers to watch in a handful of open seats in the upper chamber.",
      "North Carolina is expected to hold the most expensive contest, while Texas is seeing a bitter GOP primary fight that Democrats hope will play to their advantage.",
      "Here's what to know about the state of play in the key 2026 Senate races:",
      "North Carolina",
      "North Carolina was already expected to be competitive in 2026, even before GOP Sen. Thom Tillis announced in June he wouldn't seek reelection. The open seat in the Tar Heel State has emerged as a key prize as Democrats look to make gains in the Senate.",
      "President Trump won the state by more than three points in 2024, and North Carolina has historically voted for Republicans in every presidential race \u2014 with the exception of Barack Obama in 2008 \u2014 which also marked the last time the state sent a Democrat to the Senate. But Democrats are hoping to flip the Senate seat in 2026, with their dream recruit, former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper.",
      "Cooper, who announced his Senate bid in July, is a two-term governor and the longest-serving state attorney general in North Carolina's history.",
      "The contest heated up days after Cooper entered the race, when Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley announced a bid for the open seat, teeing up what's expected to be among the most expensive races of the cycle. Whatley has never run for office but played a key role in Mr. Trump's reelection effort. He's leaning on his conservative acumen and an endorsement from the president, as well as the connections he's forged as RNC chair.",
      "With the race's implications for control of the Senate, along with the presence of two well-connected candidates with fundraising chops, advertising spending is likely to surge.",
      "Georgia",
      "Widely viewed as the most vulnerable Democrat this election cycle, Sen. Jon Ossoff is seeking a second term in the Senate after he eked out a win in the 2020 elections when the Georgia race went to a runoff.",
      "Ossoff's narrow victory secured a Democratic majority in the Senate, at the same time Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia in a presidential election since 1992. But Georgia flipped again in 2024, supporting Mr. Trump, making Ossoff the only incumbent Democrat this cycle defending a seat the president won in the last election.",
      "With a number of Republicans already jockeying to take on Ossoff, the GOP primary threatens to be a bruising one for the party. Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, along with former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley have all entered the race. And though Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp opted not to launch a bid, Dooley is widely seen as his pick. Meanwhile, the president, who has publicly clashed with Kemp in recent years, has yet to endorse a candidate.",
      "New Hampshire",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced in March that she won't seek reelection, opening up what could be a competitive race in the Granite State.",
      "Though Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion since 2017, a Republican hasn't carried New Hampshire in a presidential election since 2000, and the state last elected a Republican to the Senate in 2010. Still, Republicans have put up a number of formidable challenges in the state in recent years, and the GOP is aiming to capitalize on the open seat this cycle.",
      "On the Republican side, former Sen. Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts from 2010 to 2013, launched a bid to represent New Hampshire in the Senate after falling short against Shaheen in 2014. State Sen. Dan Innis, who launched two unsuccessful House bids, is also running. Former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a bid earlier this year, despite having the president's support.",
      "Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, who's represented New Hampshire in the House since 2019, announced a bid for Shaheen's seat in April and quickly earned her endorsement. In early August, Karishma Manzur, a medical scientist, became the first Democrat to challenge Pappas in the primary.",
      "Michigan",
      "Democratic Sen. Gary Peters' surprise\u00a0announcement\u00a0in January that he wouldn't seek reelection in 2026 opened up a key seat in the battleground state, which has flipped in the presidential races between President Trump in 2016 to former President Joe Biden in 2020 and back to Mr. Trump in 2024.",
      "Without the advantage traditionally provided by an incumbent, Democrats are drawing from a wide talent pool, with a crowded primary already underway. Though Biden administration Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg considered entering the race, he ultimately passed on a bid earlier this year. Among the Democrats who have entered the race so far are Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and former Michigan health official Abdul El-Sayed. In Michigan, which has the largest concentration of Arabs in the U.S., Israel's war in Gaza is expected to become a key issue in the primary.",
      "On the GOP side, former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers also launched a bid earlier this year, after falling short in his race against Sen. Elissa Slotkin last year. Mr. Trump\u00a0endorsed\u00a0the Army veteran last month, saying that from \"the U.S. Army to Congress, Mike has served our Nation with distinction, and will bring that same Fighting Spirit to the U.S. Senate.\"",

      "Democrats have been trying to recruit Gov. Janet Mills, a 77-year-old two-term governor, in an attempt to unseat Collins. The entrance of a political newcomer in Democrat Graham Platner, a veteran and oyster farmer who has billed himself as an anti-establishment candidate, could complicate things for the party.",
      "Texas",
      "Although the Texas Senate race isn't expected to be as competitive in the general election, the Republican primary has been heating up in recent months as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton challenges Sen. John Cornyn for his long-held seat in the upper chamber.",
      "Cornyn, 73, has been in the Senate since 2002 and served as the No. 2 Republican from 2013 to 2019. Paxton, a 62-year-old staunch ally of the president, has criticized Cornyn for questioning whether Mr. Trump could win a general election in 2024. And although Cornyn has worked to mend the relationship with Mr. Trump, becoming a vocal supporter of the president's second term agenda, the dynamic has made for a messy primary fight so far \u2014 and added to speculation about his eventual endorsement. Asked this week about an endorsement in the race, Mr. Trump remained undecided, telling reporters, \"I'll make up my mind, I like them both.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Texas attorney general, who was reelected to a third term as the state's top prosecutor in 2022, has faced a series of controversies in recent years, with an impeachment and criminal securities fraud charges that were later dismissed. In July, his wife announced that she had filed for divorce on \"biblical grounds.\"",
      "On the Democratic side, former Rep. Colin Allred is pursuing another Senate bid after falling short against Sen. Ted Cruz by more than eight points last year. Allred is expected to face another uphill battle in 2026, but Democrats see his chances as improving, should the more conservative Paxton win the primary.",
      "Ohio",

Brown lost to Moreno by less than four points. And with the party that controls the White House typically losing ground in midterm elections, Democrats see a chance to flip the seat, forcing Republicans to spend heavily in the state in the process.",
      "In 2026, Brown will face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who previously served as Ohio's lieutenant governor and was appointed in January to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated.",
      "Minnesota",
      "Democratic Sen. Tina Smith announced in February that she wouldn't seek reelection in 2026, creating an open Senate seat in Minnesota for the first time since 2008.",
      "Though the North Star State hasn't elected a Republican to the Senate since 2002 and the GOP hasn't carried the state in a presidential election since the 1970s, the Republicans saw the state shift toward their direction in 2024, and they aim to capitalize on that in the race for the open seat in 2026.",
      "Among Democrats, leading candidates Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig are facing off. And a dominant candidate has yet to materialize in the crowded GOP field, which includes former NBA player Royce White, who fell short in his 2024 bid against Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Adam Schwarze, a retired NAVY Seal, also launched a bid for the open seat earlier this year.",
      "Iowa",
      "Republican Sen. Joni Ernst is up for reelection in Iowa in 2026, but the two-term senator has yet to announce whether she plans to run again.",
      "The Hawkeye State hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 2008, and a Democrat would face steep chances in a state Mr. Trump won by more than 13 points in 2024. But Democrats are hopeful, as the Iowa Republican has faced scrutiny in recent months.",
      "Ernst, a 55-year-old who was elected to the Senate in 2014, has been criticized by Democrats over comments she made about Medicaid cuts, and she was hammered by the GOP base over her initial reluctance to support Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation.",
      "The Democratic field is crowded, with state Rep. Josh Turek, state Sen. Zach Wahls and Nathan Sage, executive director of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce, vying for the nomination. State Rep. J.D. Scholten had also launched a campaign, but he bowed out earlier this month and endorsed Turek as Democrats' best chance to defeat Ernst.",

    "summary": "Removing a top Fed official threatens to shake investor confidence in the central bank's long-standing independence, according to Wall Street observers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's\u00a0move to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook\u00a0could roil financial markets, raise uncertainty for investors and heighten concerns that the White House is trying to wrest control of the historically independent central bank, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Mr. Trump announced her removal in a letter posted Monday night on Truth Social, citing allegations that she had engaged in mortgage fraud.",
      "Cook denies Mr. Trump has the legal authority to fire her and pledged on Tuesday not to resign. \"I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022,\" she said in a statement. Cook's lawyer also vowed to fight the firing in court.",
      "Asked by CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes on Tuesday whether the Trump administration is effectively weaponizing government by digging into the mortgage records of public officials, Mr. Trump responded, \"No. They're public.\"",
      "Cook has not been charged with a crime. Federal Housing Finance Agency head Bill Pulte, who leveled the initial accusations against Cook, has called on the Department of Justice to investigate Cook.",
      "Cook was appointed to a 14-year term on the Fed's Board of Governors in 2022 and also serves on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets short-term interest rates in the U.S.",
      "A Federal Reserve spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday that the central bank will \"continue to carry out its duties as established by law.\" The Fed also pointed to Cook's statement that she plans to contest her firing in court and said it \"will abide by any court decision.\"",
      "\"Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,\" the Fed said.",
      "More influence over the Fed?",
      "Financial markets were subdued\u00a0on Tuesday in digesting Mr. Trump's effort to oust Cook. Yet the decision was the talk of Wall Street, with multiple analysts saying Cook's dismissal could open the door to Mr. Trump gaining control of the Fed's seven-member board.",
      "\"President Trump's decision to fire Lisa Cook as a Fed governor gives him the ability to gain a majority at the Federal Reserve Board and to influence the broader composition of the FOMC,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, said in a report to investors, referring to the central bank's rate-setting panel.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on whether firing Cook could impact financial markets and compromise the Fed's independence.",
      "Mr. Trump has also nominated Stephen Miran, who heads the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to serve on the Fed board. Mr. Trump is slated to name a nominee to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell whose term ends in May of 2025; Powell is scheduled to continue serving on the Fed board until January of 2028 and could continue to serve in that role after stepping down as Fed chair.",
      "If Cook were to leave the Fed board, Mr. Trump could ultimately end up with five appointees on the panel by mid-2026, giving the White House more leverage to influence monetary policy, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "During a meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump demurred when asked by a reporter who he's considering to replace Cook on the Fed board. \"We'll have a majority very shortly so that will be great,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly assailed Powell for the central bank's decision to hold off in cutting interest rates, with policy makers remaining cautious about reducing borrowing costs so long as inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Powell signaled last week that a rate cut could be on the horizon during a speech at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic symposium.",
      "No guarantee of lower interest rates",
      "The 12-member FOMC is made up of seven members of the Fed Board of Governors; the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and four of the 11 Fed bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis for one-year terms.",
      "That interlocking relationship suggests that even stacking the Fed board with loyalists wouldn't guarantee the interest rate cuts that Mr. Trump has demanded, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's not just about the administration nominating individuals and Congress confirming those individuals \u2014 it's also about how these individuals perceive their role and value their independence,\" he said.",
      "Analysts with Capital Economics noted that Mr. Trump's appointees would need to persuade other FOMC members about setting monetary policy in ways that align with the White House's economic objectives. That \"could be difficult if those others felt compelled to defend the Fed from political attacks,\" they said in a report.",
      "For decades, investors have seen the Fed as a generally neutral arbiter guided by its mandate to keep inflation in check and the job market humming. As a result, any perception that Mr. Trump is undermining the Fed's autonomy could rattle markets, according to Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "\"Investors are reacting because the independence of the central bank is critical to market stability, and any sign of political capture raises alarm bells everywhere,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Meanwhile, the question of whether Cook can be removed from the Fed board remains unresolved. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the president has authority to remove Fed appointees before their term ends, but only for \"cause.\" Analysts said the legal dispute over Cook's removal could wind up in the Supreme Court.",
      "\"The situation is extremely fluid,\" Daco said. \"So until we get some clarity as to the exact conviction, you're not necessarily going to see much significant movements in markets.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department is investigating whether former senior FBI officials mishandled classified documents that were found in a \"burn bag\" at the bureau's headquarters, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The documents in question are related to the FBI's probe into whether Russia influenced the 2016 election in President Trump's favor. That investigation has drawn Mr. Trump's ire for years \u2014 he's called the allegations that Russia sought to help him win a \"hoax\" and a \"witch hunt,\" and in recent weeks, some top administration officials have claimed Obama-era intelligence leaders who looked into Russian meddling may have broken the law.",
      "Nobody has been criminally charged in the probe.",
      "The New York Times was first to report on the Justice Department's burn bag investigation.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "The \"burn bags\" first entered the public discourse last month, when Fox News reported that FBI Director Kash Patel discovered thousands of Russia-related documents in bags that are typically used to hold sensitive materials that are about to be destroyed. Days later, Patel wrote on X: \"We just uncovered burn bags/room filled with hidden Russia Gate files.\"",
      "The FBI's investigation into Russian election interference \u2014 dubbed \"Crossfire Hurricane\" \u2014 was opened during the 2016 campaign and continued into Mr. Trump's first term. A probe run by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller later found that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election with a goal of benefitting the Trump campaign, though Mr. Trump and top campaign officials were not accused of any illegal coordination with Russia.",
      "A 2017 report by the U.S. intelligence community also assessed that Moscow sought to influence the election and \"developed a clear preference\" for Mr. Trump.",
      "Those findings have long been challenged by top Trump allies and by the president himself. Last month, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified documents that she claimed called into question the 2017 intelligence community report.",
      "Gabbard accused Obama-era officials of \"treasonous conspiracy\" and a \"years-long coup\" to undermine Mr. Trump, and said she would refer the matter to the Justice Department for possible criminal investigation. Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesperson for former President Barack Obama, called the allegations \"bizarre\" and \"ridiculous.\"",
      "Patel is another vociferous critic of how the agency he now leads handled the Russia investigation. In 2023, he penned a book titled \"Government Gangsters,\" which calls the FBI \"thoroughly compromised\" and rails against a sweeping \"Deep State\" that he alleges victimized Mr. Trump with a \"witch hunt\" investigation.",
      "Critics of the FBI's Russia investigation have long accused the bureau of acting with political animus against Mr. Trump or mishandling elements of the probe. An internal Justice Department watchdog found in 2019 that the FBI did not show \"political bias\" and that the FBI was justified in opening the probe, but criticized some of the FBI's practices, including the warrants that were used to surveil ex-Trump aide Carter Page. Years later, Trump-era special counsel John Durham called the investigation \"seriously flawed.\"",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast. Rosen has been a producer for several CBS News podcasts, including \"The Takeout,\" \"The Debrief\" and \"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen.\""

    "story": [
      "Mason, Tennessee \u2014 The small West Tennessee town of Mason, just 2 square miles in size, is home to about 1,000 people. But its residents are now divided by what a new immigration detention facility will mean for the area.",
      "Shannon Whitfield has lived in Mason for 13 years. Earlier this month, Mason's town leaders voted to reopen a shuttered private prison, the West Tennessee Detention Facility, and turn it into a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center.",
      "\"This is not the place for an ICE facility. This is not the place for a for-profit prison,\" Whitfield told CBS News.",
      "Mason experienced years of financial problems, including allegations of corruption and mismanagement more than a decade ago that left the town with a mountain of debt and few businesses left to help it bounce back.",
      "The West Tennessee Detention Facility has been closed for nearly four years. When it reopens, it has about 600 beds that could soon be filled with ICE detainees.",
      "The private for-profit prison company that owns it, CoreCivic, says the prison will create more than 200 new jobs and boost revenue for Mason and the state of Tennessee through hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes and impact fees, which are fees that developers pay to municipalities.",
      "That is why Mason Mayor Eddie Noeman says he supports the detention center. But town Alderwoman Virginia Rivers voted against it.",
      "\"I need it to be clear I am all for jobs coming to town of Mason,\" Rivers told CBS News. \"What I'm not for is when it comes to mistreating the people. All money is not good money.\"",
      "Immediately after taking office in January, President Trump reversed a policy instituted by former President Joe Biden in 2021 that prevented the Justice Department from renewing contracts with private prison firms. CoreCivic also owned the West Tennessee Detention Facility at the time and was forced to close it in 2021 because of Biden's executive order.",
      "In a statement on the reopening of the prison, CoreCivic said it was \"proud to continue our long-standing relationship within the Mason and Tipton County community, going back nearly 35 years,\" and adding that it did not \"have a timeline to share regarding when the facility will become operational.\"",
      "CoreCivic is the largest private, for-profit prison firm in the U.S., and the sole private prison operator in Tennessee. However, CoreCivic has repeatedly been found in Tennessee\u00a0state audits\u00a0to be deficient in staffing and turnover.",
      "A CBS News analysis of Tennessee state data released earlier this summer showed that inmates are twice as likely to be killed in CoreCivic prisons compared to government-run prisons. CoreCivic has disputed that analysis.",
      "\"The ICE facility is not, does not and will not help Mason to go forward,\" Rivers said. \"We need other things in our community. We need homes. We need a school, day care.\"",
      "West Tennessee could potentially see other businesses, like Ford, bring new jobs to the area in the future, but that would not be for several years. Until then, Mason remains at a crossroads.",
      "\"I don't want my neighbors to go to work out there,\" Whitfield said. \"I don't want them to have to make that choice of, to get benefits and to get enough money. They have to give away that piece of their soul.\"",

    "summary": "A group of current and former FEMA officials is blasting the Trump administration for its sweeping changes to the disaster relief agency, days before the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.",
    "story": [
      "A group of current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency officials warned Congress on Monday that the Trump administration's sweeping changes to the disaster relief agency could reverse decades of reforms made after Hurricane Katrina.",
      "The open letter was released as the U.S. this week marks 20 years since Katrina's 2005 landfall \u2014 sparking one of the\u00a0worst natural disasters\u00a0in U.S. history, with nearly 1,400 deaths according to a 2023 estimate and over $200 billion in damage in today's dollars.",
      "The letter argues the Trump administration \u2014 which has sought to dramatically shrink FEMA and floated scrapping the agency altogether \u2014 had made decisions that \"hinder the swift execution of our mission.\" It states that a change in course is necessary to \"prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.\"",
      "Released by the advocacy group Stand Up for Science, the \"Katrina Declaration\" says it has 181 signatories. Only 35 people signed their names to the letter, with the rest opting for anonymity due to \"the culture of fear and suppression cultivated by this administration.\"",
      "It's addressed to several congressional committees and the FEMA Review Council, which was formed by President Trump earlier this year.",
      "The declaration alleges that Mr. Trump's picks to lead FEMA \"lack proper qualifications,\" and decries the Trump administration for cutting FEMA's staff.",
      "\"Since January 2025, FEMA has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a FEMA Administrator,\" the open letter reads.",
      "It also castigates FEMA for terminating grants meant to help state and local governments prepare their infrastructures to withstand natural disasters and extreme weather. Two-thirds of the counties that have received those grants voted for Mr. Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris, a CBS News investigation found earlier this year. A federal judge blocked cuts to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, program earlier this month.",
      "In response to the letter, FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues said the Department of Homeland Security is \"committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people.\" He said the agency has been \"bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes,\" and defended the Trump administration's handling of natural disasters so far this year.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,\" Llargues said. \"It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard.\u00a0 It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems.\"",
      "FEMA has faced months of upheaval since Mr. Trump's return to office.",
      "Days after his inauguration, the president floated either \"getting rid of FEMA\" or \"fundamentally reforming and overhauling\" the agency, casting it as overly bureaucratic and arguing that state and local governments should take on a larger role in managing natural disasters. In June, Mr. Trump said he's looking to \"wean\" states off of FEMA.",
      "The White House has proposed cutting FEMA's budget for non-disaster grants by $646 million in the next fiscal year. The Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a $36.2 billion budget for FEMA, up from $33.1 billion in the fiscal year 2025 budget.",
      "So far this year, FEMA has lost about one-third of its staff through a combination of firings and buyouts, and the administration has overhauled the contract renewal system for more than two-thirds of FEMA's workforce, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "The agency has had two acting leaders since Mr. Trump returned to office. Christopher Hamilton led the agency until May, when he was fired after saying he didn't support eliminating FEMA. His successor, David Richardson, introduced himself to staff by warning them during an all-hands meeting, \"don't get in my way,\" and suggesting he will \"run right over\" people he believes are subverting the president's agenda, CBS News has reported.",
      "The leadership change came weeks before the June 1 start of the Atlantic hurricane season. One review from May found the agency was \"not ready\" for hurricane season.",
      "Editor's note: A previous version of this story listed the number of deaths caused by Hurricane Katrina at more than 1,800, a figure listed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. The story has been updated to reflect that a 2023 report by the National Hurricane Center adjusted down the estimated number of deaths to 1,392.",

    "summary": "Florida has plans to target three to five House seats held by Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "Florida could be the next big target for Republicans to redraw their congressional lines to their advantage, with plans in the works to potentially target three to five House seats currently held by Democrats before the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "The state already has a highly gerrymandered map that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis pushed through in 2022, which led to a congressional delegation of 20 Republicans and eight Democrats.",
      "A more aggressive gerrymander in Florida would launch another salvo in the political battle that has most recently seen GOP-controlled Texas and the Democratic-controlled California fight to enact new political maps. Currently, Democrats would need to win just three GOP seats in the House to claim control of the lower chamber.",
      "President Trump, whose administration has pushed Texas to redistrict, has encouraged three other GOP-controlled states \u2014\u00a0 Indiana, Missouri and Florida \u2014 to redraw their congressional lines.",
      "\"With California moving forward with their maps, there'll be even more pressure to do that,\" said one Florida GOP operative, who spoke anonymously to discuss conversations among state lawmakers. \"I do think Washington's going to look at Florida and be like, 'All right guys, you gotta fix this.'\"",
      "In early August, Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez took a first step and announced the creation of a select committee on congressional redistricting. Perez said that was prompted by a July Florida Supreme Court decision that upheld the state's current gerrymander and rejected a legal challenge over its elimination of a majority-Black district in North Florida.",
      "Critics had said that the 2022 lines violated the state's \"Fair Districts\" constitutional amendments passed in 2010 that were intended to prevent partisan and racial gerrymandering. Perez says\u00a0 the committee had to be created now, to examine in a timely way the intersection of the Fair Districts provisions with their redistricting efforts.",
      "\"[T]here are national conversations ongoing in other states related to midterm redistricting,\" Perez said in the memo. \"Exploring these questions now, at the mid-decade point, would potentially allow us to seek legal guidance from our Supreme Court without the uncertainty associated with deferring those questions until after the next decennial census and reapportionment.\"",
      "The select committee will hold its first meetings as early as the week of Oct. 6. The expectation among Florida lawmakers and GOP operatives in the state is that further debate and potential passage of a new congressional map would be added onto the docket for the Florida legislative session that begins in January 2026, though they say the situation is fluid and are waiting to see how the redistricting select committee operates.",
      "There are at most five Democratic Florida U.S. representatives whose districts would be targeted during a potential redraw, according to two Florida GOP operatives familiar with discussions among lawmakers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Lois Frankel, Jared Moskowitz and Frederica Wilson, as well as Rep. Darren Soto, in Orlando, could see their districts become more competitive by including more Republican-leaning areas, or be drawn into the same district to set up an intraparty primary.",
      "Florida Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat in South Florida, called the potential redraw \"a straight-up power grab, politicians picking their voters, instead of voters picking their representatives.\"",
      "\"The Republicans drew the damn maps, and now they want to come back and cut out Black Democrats and even Democrats who have worked across the aisle for their district,\" Jones said.",
      "Florida Atlantic University political science professor Kevin Wagner said there is substantial risk for the GOP in targeting Democratic seats and taking away reliably Republican voter bases away from strong GOP districts.",
      "\"It depends how much of a risk they wanna take. Because if you were in a +20 district towards your party, are you okay making it go +5 or +6? People get worried and they don't want to be in a non-safe district. It's a little more horse trading than people think,\" Wagner said.",
      "\"The assumptions from redrawing the maps is that voters are going to vote in the same magnitude and pattern that has existed previously. Sometimes that turns out to be true and sometimes it does not,\" he added.",
      "Calling for mid-decade census",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis supports a mid-decade redraw in his state, but he's also taken it a step further. In recent weeks he has repeated Mr. Trump's call for an early \"redo\" of the decennial Census count \u2014 in order to omit undocumented immigrants from the count \u2014 and claimed Florida's population has increased enough to be allocated another congressional seat.",
      "DeSantis claimed Florida's population was undercounted by about 700,000 people \u2014 and Florida's final population count just needed 100,000 to get an additional U.S. House seat.",
      "The Census Bureau revealed in 2022 there had been an undercount of 3.48% (over 756,000) for Florida.",
      "DeSantis said state Attorney General James Uthmeier will also make the argument to the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, for a new mid-decade census. Uthmeier sent a letter in July to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick calling for \"a corrected census to give Floridians the representation they deserve in Congress.\"",
      "\"It's not unusual that states complain that they've not got sufficient representation of their population. There are legitimate arguments about how we count, whether that is an accurate representation of the population,\" Wagner said.",
      "The Census Bureau has not announced any changes or plans for a corrected census to be completed by the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution states the enumeration, or census count, will happen every ten years. One Census Bureau employee, given anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said it'd be logistically \"impossible\" to conduct a census and reallocate congressional seats in time for the 2026 midterms.",
      "CBS News has contacted the Commerce Department for comment regarding any plans to change the census timeline. Thus far, there have been no official announcements to do so.",
      "Generally, DeSantis does believe there is the political appetite in Tallahassee to redraw the state's congressional lines.",
      "\"Even if they don't do a new census, even if they don't revise the current Census, I still think it is appropriate to [redraw the lines],\" Desantis said during a press conference in Florida on August 11.",
      "\"I've spoken with some folks in the Florida Legislature, and I think that there's broad acknowledgement that this is something that is going to happen,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "A new move by a Utah judge ordering the Legislature to redraw its congressional maps is the latest turn in an ongoing saga over redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "And this latest development could help Democrats.",
      "Back in 2018, Utah voters narrowly passed a ballot measure known as Proposition 4. The effort focused on bringing about an independent redistricting commission while also putting in place \"requirements on the Legislature's redistricting process.\" At the same time, it also prohibited \"the commission or Legislature from favoring or disfavoring incumbent elected officials or from considering partisan political information,\" according to voter information documents from the state.",
      "At issue in the case decided Monday, according to court filings, was whether a bipartisan state law passed in 2020 had \"unconstitutionally impaired\" the voter-passed proposition.",
      "Utah Judge Dianna Gibson ruled against the Legislature Monday, writing in a decision that \"the Legislature is directed to design and enact a remedial congressional redistricting map in conformity with Proposition 4's mandatory redistricting standards and requirements.\" The latest ruling sets up a short window this fall to make changes, although it's unclear how appeals may impact that process and final deadline.",
      "Although it's unrelated, the ruling comes amid redistricting battles across the country that were jumpstarted by the GOP effort this summer to try and help President Trump by making it easier for Republicans to maintain control of the U.S. House for the final years of his second term.",
      "What could the Utah ruling mean for control of the U.S. House?",
      "Utah has four U.S. House seats, all of which are represented by Republicans. But during the 2018 midterms, voters in one Utah district narrowly\u00a0sent a Democrat to the House. The House Democrats' campaign arm immediately reacted to Monday's news about the ruling.",
      "\"In throwing out the current, gerrymandered congressional map, voters in Utah will now have an opportunity to elect leaders that best represent their values, and not have their representation dictated by politicians,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Suzan DelBene said in a statement.",
      "It remains to be seen how the redistricting back and forth between Republicans and Democrats will affect campaigns, but the GOP majority at the moment is incredibly narrow. If the same lines used in the 2024 election were used again, Democrats could gain control of the House by winning back as few as three seats in the 2026 midterms.",
      "Partisan tensions over congressional lines have been rising.",
      "Utah's senior GOP U.S. Sen. Mike Lee on Monday lambasted the court's decision, saying in a lengthy social media thread, \"This is a great day for Utah's Democrats\u2014who haven't controlled the Utah legislature in many, many decades (because most Utah voters don't like what the Democratic Party is selling), and have found a clever way to even the score by enlisting the help of their judicial allies.\"",
      "\"But it's a terrible day for everyone else\u2014and for the rule of law,\" Lee said.",
      "The case that led to Monday's ruling started long before this summer's national redistricting drama but is now a part of the discussion. Last week Texas Republicans followed through on a quest to please Mr. Trump by passing redrawn congressional lines that take five Democratic seats in the state and make them more favorable to Republicans.",
      "The GOP quest isn't limited to Texas, though. Republicans in Indiana and Missouri are also facing a push to redraw their maps, where smaller pickup opportunities of Democratic districts are possible if changes are made to favor Republicans.",

    "summary": "An ethics probe has been launched into Jack Smith's handling of two investigations of Donald Trump before the 2024 election.",
    "story": [
      "Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith on Monday defended him in the face of an ethics probe into his actions investigating President Trump before the 2024 election, referring to the basis of the investigation as \"imaginary and unfounded.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Office of the Special Counsel \u2014 which is not affiliated with Smith's former position \u2014 launched a probe into Smith's handling of two criminal investigations into Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents and alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Monday's letter, a copy of which was obtained by CBS News, was the first response from Smith and his representatives after the independent federal agency confirmed that it had launched an investigation into Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act, a federal law that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees.\"",
      "In a three-page letter to the acting head of the office, Jamieson Greer, Smith's attorneys Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski, said there is \"no basis\" for an accusation that Smith violated the Hatch Act and that the allegations of wrongdoing are \"wholly without merit.\"",
      "\"Mr. Smith was fiercely committed to making prosecutorial decisions based solely on the evidence, he steadfastly followed applicable Department of Justice guidelines and the Principles of Federal Prosecution, and he did not let the pending election influence his investigative or prosecutorial decision-making,\" Smith's attorneys said.",
      "Smith was appointed by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to take over the two investigations, but resigned in January, days before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas called for an investigation into Smith's conduct and alleged that Smith had pushed for a \"rushed trial\" of Trump before the 2024 presidential election.",
      "\"They were the actions of a political actor masquerading as a public official,\" Cotton wrote on X. \"That's why I've asked this unprecedented interference in the 2024 election be immediately investigated by OSC.\"",
      "Smith's attorneys, however, argued that politics did not play a role in the prosecutions and that no laws prohibited Smith from continuing his prosecutions into Mr. Trump going into the home stretch of the campaign trail.",
      "\"This investigation is premised on a partisan complaint that suggests the ordinary operation of the criminal justice system should be disrupted by the whims of a political contest. But the notion that justice should yield to politics is antithetical to the rule of law,\" Smith's attorneys wrote. \"Moreover, the suggestion that the Hatch Act can be violated by taking routine procedural steps to prosecute a case involving a candidate for public office is unprecedented and risks interfering with the enforcement of our federal criminal laws.\"",
      "Smith's actions, the attorneys said, \"were consistent with the decisions of a prosecutor who has devoted his career to following the facts and the law, without fear or favor and without regard for the political consequences, not because of them.\"",
      "In May, Mr. Trump chose right-wing podcast host and MAGA loyalist Paul Ingrassia to lead the Office of Special Counsel, but his nomination is stalled in the Senate. Mr. Trump fired the former head of the office, Hampton Dellinger, in February.",
      "In addition to investigations into Smith, the investigators who worked with him have also been investigated or fired.",
      "At least 35 Justice Department employees who investigated President Trump and his allies have been fired since Mr. Trump took office, sources told CBS News, and the staffers were identified by the Justice Department's so-called \"weaponization working group,\" which Attorney General Pam Bondi established soon after she was confirmed.",

    "summary": "A federal judge threw out the Trump administration's challenge to a standing order issued by a U.S. district court in Maryland.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday threw out the Trump administration's challenge to a standing order issued by a U.S. district court in Maryland that bars federal immigration officials from immediately removing migrants who are challenging the legality of their detentions.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen came in a novel and unprecedented lawsuit that the Trump administration filed against all 15 judges on the Maryland court in June. The Justice Department had argued that the standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell in May was unlawful and outside the authority of the court.",
      "The judges, represented by Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under former President George W. Bush, sought to dismiss the lawsuit. They argued that the suit presented a dispute between two co-equal branches of government that could not be decided by the courts.",
      "In a 37-page decision, Cullen agreed with the judges in finding that the Trump administration's challenge should be dismissed because, in part, the U.S. does not have the legal right to sue and the judges are absolute immune from the suit.",
      "\"Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,\" he wrote. \"The Executive's lawsuit will be dismissed, and its motion for preliminary injunction denied as moot. Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.\"",
      "Cullen said that if the Trump administration \"truly believes\" that the standing orders violate the law, it should pursue the paths laid out by Congress.",
      "\"Any fair reading of the legal authorities cited by Defendants leads to the ineluctable conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss,\" he wrote. \"To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.\"",
      "The Justice Department plans to appeal the decision.",
      "While the suit was filed in federal district court in Maryland, Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump to serve on the U.S. district court in Roanoke, Virginia, was assigned to preside over the case.",
      "Cullen's ruling was not a surprise. In a hearing earlier this month in Maryland, the judge previewed his decision, telling Justice Department attorneys that the \"far less destructive\" move by the Justice Department would be to appeal the standing order in one of the cases where it had been issued, rather than sue another branch of the government to \"accomplish its institutional interests.\"",
      "He echoed that position in his decision, writing that \"under normal circumstances,\" it would not be a surprise if the government raised its concerns about the legality of the standing order through the mechanisms laid out by Congress.",
      "\"But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times \u2014 at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,\" Cullen wrote. \"It's no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue \u2014 and in a big way.\"",
      "In a footnote in his decision, Cullen criticized the Trump administration's repeated attacks on members of the federal judiciary who have ruled against the president's agenda.",
      "\"Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,\" Cullen wrote.",
      "The standing order issued by Russell earlier this year prevents federal immigration officials from removing or altering the legal status of any migrant detainee who filed a habeas corpus petition for two business days.",
      "The court adopted the order to address the rise in migrants in Maryland who were at risk of imminent deportation from the U.S. and sought review of their detentions. Signed by Russell, the chief judge, the order states that it aims to \"preserve existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction\" of the Maryland district court over pending matters, ensure immigrant petitioners can participate in court proceedings and have access to legal counsel, and guarantee the government has a \"fulsome opportunity\" to present its defense.",
      "Among the judges named in the Trump administration's lawsuit was U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing the legal cases filed by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who has sued twice in the district over his March deportation and, most recently, confinement by immigration authorities. On Monday, Abrego Garcia filed a habeas petition challenging the legality of his detention by immigration officials. The court issued its standing order and temporarily blocked his immediate removal to a potential third-country, Uganda, where the Trump administration is attempting to send him.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is reinstating a long-dormant practice of conducting \"neighborhood checks\" to vet immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship, expanding its efforts to aggressively scrutinize immigration applications, according to a government memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "The neighborhood checks would involve on-the-ground investigations by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that could include interviews with the neighbors and coworkers of citizenship applicants.",
      "The government investigations would be conducted to determine if applicants satisfy the requirements for American citizenship, which include showing good moral character, adhering to the U.S. Constitution and being \"well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.\"",
      "To qualify for American citizenship in the first place, applicants typically must have lived in the U.S. for three or five years as legal permanent residents. They must also not have any serious criminal records, and pass a civics and English test. The process is known as naturalization.",
      "The Trump administration's memo upends a decades-old U.S. government policy. While the neighborhood investigations for citizenship cases are outlined in U.S. law, they can also be waived, which the U.S. government has done since 1991, government records show. Since then, the government has relied mainly on background and criminal checks by the FBI to vet citizenship applicants.",
      "The USCIS memo immediately terminated the \"general waiver\" for neighborhood checks, directing officers to determine whether such investigations are warranted based on the information, or lack thereof, submitted by citizenship applicants. Officers retain the ability to waive the checks, according to the memo.",
      "The directive said USCIS officers will decide whether to carry out a neighborhood investigation by requesting and reviewing testimonial letters from neighbors, employers, coworkers and business associates who know the person applying for U.S. citizenship.",
      "The memo suggested that citizenship applicants should \"proactively\" submit testimonial letters, to avoid receiving requests for more evidence. The agency said failure or refusal to comply with a request for evidence could lead to a neighborhood investigation and \"impact\" applicants' ability to show they qualify for U.S. citizenship.",
      "While the Trump administration's campaign to expand arrests of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally is frequently touted by the president and his top officials, its effort to tighten access to the legal immigration system has been implemented with less fanfare.",
      "Over several months, the second Trump administration has frozen the refugee admissions program, ended Biden-era policies that allowed some migrants to enter or stay in the U.S. legally and added additional layers of vetting for legal immigrants requesting immigration benefits like green cards and U.S. citizenship.",
      "In August alone, USCIS said it would more heavily scrutinize the \"good moral character\" requirement for U.S. citizenship and probe \"anti-American\" views and activities of those applying for green cards, work permits and other immigration benefits.",
      "The Trump administration has argued the changes are needed to combat fraud and shore up U.S. immigration procedures that it believes became too lax and generous under Democratic administrations.",
      "USCIS Director Joe Edlow, who was confirmed by the Senate earlier this year, said the new memo will \"ensure that only the most qualified applicants receive American citizenship.\"",
      "\"Americans should be comforted knowing that USCIS is taking seriously its responsibility to ensure aliens are being properly vetted and are of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States,\" Edlow said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "But pro-immigrant advocates and critics of the Trump administration said its policies are sending a chilling effect to immigrants across the country, legal and illegal alike.",
      "\"It sounds to me like the idea is to create a more intimidating atmosphere that discourages people from pursuing naturalization,\" said Doris Meissner, who oversaw the Immigration and Naturalization Service during the Clinton administration.",
      "The now-defunct INS adjudicated citizenship requests until USCIS was created in 2003. Meissner said the government had largely discontinued neighborhood checks when she became INS commissioner in the 1990s because they were labor intensive and seldom yielded useful information from neighborhoods or other sources. She also said there are other guardrails in place to prevent bad actors from becoming citizens, including background checks.",
      "\"It was viewed as one of those anachronistic processes,\" Meissner added.",

    "story": [
      "California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way all three states are enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Trump's executive orders. He said the department was also already reviewing how states were enforcing the rules before the crash.",
      "Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can't demonstrate English proficiency and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash that killed three should not have ever been given a commercial driver's license because of his immigration status. But the crash has become increasingly political with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the Trump administration's immigration concerns in interviews.",
      "But Duffy said Tuesday that it is a safety issue \u2014 not a political one \u2014 because truckers need to understand road signs and be able to communicate with law enforcement about what they are hauling if they are pulled over or what happened if there is an accident.",
      "\"This is about keeping people safe on the road. Your families, your kids, your spouses, your loved ones, your friends. We all use the roadway, and we need to make sure that those who are driving big rigs \u2014 semis \u2014 can understand the road signs, that they've been well trained,\" Duffy said.",
      "Duffy says these states aren't enforcing the rules",
      "The Transportation Department said California has conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect requiring truck drivers be able to recognize and read road signs and communicate with authorities in English. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.",
      "He cited similar statistics for the other states with Washington finding more than 6,000 violations of safety rules during inspections, but only pulling four drivers out of service for English language violations. New Mexico has not placed any drivers out of service since the rules took effect.",
      "Duffy said the states will lose money from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program if they don't comply with the rules within 30 days. Duffy said California could lose $33 million, Washington could lose $10.5 million and New Mexico could lose $7 million.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office said on X that the Trump administration is just trying to deflect responsibility for the crash. The other two states did not immediately respond Tuesday.",
      "\"This is rich. The Trump Administration approved the federal work permit for the man who killed 3 people \u2014 and now they're scrambling to shift blame after getting caught. Sean's nonsense announcement is as big a joke as the Trump Administration itself,\" Newsom's office said.",
      "Florida crash killed three people",
      "Three people were killed when truck driver Harjinder Singh made an illegal U-turn on a highway, according to Florida's Highway Patrol. He is being held without bond after being charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations.",
      "A nearby minivan slammed into Singh's trailer as he made the turn on a highway about 50 miles north of West Palm Beach. Singh and his passenger were not injured.",
      "Diamond R. Litty, the elected public defender in St. Lucie County, said her office was provisionally assigned to Singh's case during his initial appearance Saturday morning. A review of his finances will determine whether Litty's office remains on the case.",
      "Litty said her office will focus on the criminal charges against Singh, who is presumed innocent, but they will also work with an immigration attorney to determine how Singh's status affects the case. After more than three decades at her position, Litty said she can't recall a case that garnered more attention than this one.",
      "\"Unfortunately, Mr. Singh has been caught in the crosshairs of politics,\" Litty said.",
      "But the head of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association trade group that represents small-business truck drivers praised Duffy's announcement.",
      "\"Basic English skills are critical for safely operating a commercial motor vehicle \u2014 reading road signs, following emergency instructions, and communicating with law enforcement are not optional. The fatal crash in Florida this month tragically illustrates what's at stake,\" the group's president, Todd Spencer, said.",
      "Federal officials say truck driver was in U.S. illegally",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said Singh, a native of India, was in the country illegally. So Duffy said he should not have been granted a commercial driver's licenses by Washington and California. He said New Mexico should have pulled Singh off the road for not speaking English after he was pulled over in July because he later failed a test given by DOT investigators after the Florida crash.",
      "California is one of 19 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, that issues licenses regardless of immigration status. Supporters say that lets people work, visit doctors and travel safely.",
      "But in addition, Newsom's office said California officials followed all the rules when it issued a license for Singh in July 2024 and at that time, the federal government confirmed he was in the country legally. Newsom has also said Singh obtained a work permit during Mr. Trump's first term, which Homeland Security officials disputed. Newsom also said the permit was renewed in April and federal officials have not addressed that.",
      "Florida authorities have said Singh entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that Singh should have never received a commercial driver's license.",
      "\"You're not allowed to issue a CDL to somebody who is not in this country legally. You're not allowed to issue a CDL to somebody who is not capable of understanding traffic signs,\" DeSantis said, calling the crash an \"avoidable tragedy.\"",

      "Abrego Garcia was freed from pretrial detention last Friday. CBS News reported on Saturday that his attorneys were then sent a court-required notice of his potential\u00a0deportation to Uganda. He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.",
      "\"There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshals Service and basically on house arrest,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.\"",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg filed a new lawsuit on Abrego Garcia's behalf on Monday challenging his confinement and deportation to any country \"unless and until he had a fair trial in an immigration court.\"",
      "The U.S. district court in Maryland soon issued an order preventing the government from immediately removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S. or altering his legal status, meaning his deportation is on hold for now. The court has issued the standing order in all cases involving migrant detainees challenging the legality of their detentions in recent months, a move the Justice Department is challenging as unlawful.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis, who is assigned to the case, held a hearing on Abrego Garcia's new suit on Monday. She issued an oral order preventing the Trump administration from moving Abrego Garcia from the ICE facility in Virginia where he is now being held.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0in a statement that ICE had arrested Abrego Garcia and was \"processing him for deportation.\" DHS said he is \"being processed for removal to Uganda.\" The U.S. reached an agreement with Uganda to accept some deportees last week.",
      "\"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,\" Noem said.",
      "In a legal filing over the weekend, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica. His legal team said they then received a notice of his possible deportation to Uganda. Sandoval-Moshenberg clarified Monday that Abrego Garcia had stated that he was willing to accept refugee status in Costa Rica.",
      "\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday.",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement that he was glad to \"welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.\"",
      "\"The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda \u2014 to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,\" Van Hollen said. \"As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.\"",
      "An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia may not be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore advocated for due process for Abrego Garcia on Sunday, saying on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that \"I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday signed an executive order to push Washington, D.C., and other localities to end cashless bail for arrested suspects, threatening to withhold federal funding from cities that fail to end the program. It's the latest move in the president's federal crackdown on crime.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an order directing the Justice Department to investigate instances of flag burning, although the Supreme Court in 1989\u00a0ruled\u00a0that the First Amendment protected symbolic speech, including flag burning.",
      "The executive order on cashless bail charges Attorney General Pam Bondi with identifying jurisdictions in the U.S. that have cashless bail policies, and withholds or revokes federal grants to those jurisdictions.",
      "\"We're ending it,\" Mr. Trump said of cashless bail before he signed the executive order in the Oval Office. \"But we're starting by ending it in D.C., and that we have the right to do through federalization.\"",
      "The move comes as the National Guard and federal law enforcement are dispersed throughout the district, patrolling the streets. In the last 11 days, the White House says no murders have taken place in the district.",
      "D.C. introduced cashless bail in the 1990s over civil rights concerns, becoming one of the first cities in the country to do so.",
      "\"That was when the big crime in this country started,\" Mr. Trump said Monday, speaking of cashless bail. \"They kill people and they get out. Cashless bail, they thought it was discriminatory to make people put up money because they just killed three people lying on the street.\"",
      "The president also signed an executive order Monday stating it's the government's objective to hold as many suspects captured in D.C. in federal custody as possible, and to charge them with federal crimes. The president also signed an executive order encouraging federal law enforcement agencies to hire additional personnel so they can surge law enforcement to D.C.",
      "Trump on federal government intervention in Chicago: \"We're ready to go anywhere\"",

Mr. Trump has said Chicago could be the next city where the federal government imposes a crime crackdown.",
      "\"We're ready to go anywhere,\" the president said when asked about Chicago. \"We can go anywhere on less than 24 hours' notice.\"",
      "Cracking down on flag burning",
      "The executive order the president signed pushes Bondi to investigate instances of flag desecration. The administration has been critical of pro-Palestinian protests and anti-immigration crackdown demonstrations that have featured flag burning.",
      "\"And then where there's evidence of criminal activity, where prosecution wouldn't fall afoul of the First Amendment, it instructs the Department of Justice to prosecute those who were engaged in these instances of flag burning,\" said Trump staff secretary Will Scharf.",

      "The order also included a provision ordering the defense secretary to create a specialized unit within th eD.C. National Guard \"dedicated to ensuring public safety and order in the Nation's capital.\"",

      "Asked whether Congress would need to sign off on restoring the agency's old name, since lawmakers had passed the initial renaming, Mr. Trump said he didn't think so: \"We're just going to do it. I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that. I don't think we even need that.\"",
      "The president has teased a name change for the federal government's largest agency on and off for months, referring to Hegseth as his \"Secretary of War\" at one point last month\u00a0in a post on Truth Social. During a June press conference, he claimed the old Department of War moniker was abandoned because \"we became politically correct.\"",
      "Why was the Department of War changed to the Department of Defense?",
      "The renaming took place in the wake of World War II, part of a broader reorganization of the U.S. military that placed the Army and Navy into a single Cabinet-level agency.",
      "The War Department \u2014 which oversaw the Army \u2014 dated back to President George Washington's first term, but in the late 1790s, Congress created a separate Navy Department to oversee the new country's naval forces and, later, the Marine Corps. Those two agencies operated separately for over a century.",
      "President Harry Truman pushed for different branches of service to be combined into a single Department of National Defense in 1947, telling Congress the move was necessary to \"cut costs and at the same time enhance our national security.\"",
      "The agencies were combined under a single Secretary of Defense in a 1947 law that also created the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency. Two years later, Congress named the agency the Department of Defense.",

      "Zambada pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and one count of running a continuing criminal enterprise, the Justice Department said. He had originally pleaded not guilty, but last week federal prosecutors wrote in a court filing that he intended to change his plea.",
      "The Associated Press reported that in brief remarks in a court hearing Monday, Zambada apologized for his actions.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 \u00a0President Trump signed an executive order Monday that seeks to punish people who burn the American flag, accusing those who do so of displaying hostility and contempt toward the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years threatened to crack down on flag burning. In 2016, he wrote on social media that anyone who burns the American flag should lose their citizenship or face jail time. During a 2024 speech before the National Guard Association of the United States, then-candidate Trump said he would work to pass a law imposing criminal penalties on those who burn the American flag.",
      "In remarks from the Oval Office on Monday, Mr. Trump alleged that burning the American flag \"incites riots\" and said those who are prosecuted and convicted as a result of his directive would face one year in prison.",
      "\"The people in this country don't want to see our American flag burned and spit on,\" the president said.",
      "Trump's executive order on flag burning",
      "Titled \"Prosecuting Burning of the American Flag,\" Mr. Trump's executive order does not direct the attorney general to prosecute those who burn flags for the act itself. Rather, it says the Justice Department should bring cases \"against acts of American Flag desecration that violate applicable, content-neutral laws, while causing harm unrelated to expression, consistent with the First Amendment.\" Examples of those laws include \"violent crimes; hate crimes, illegal discrimination against American citizens, or other violations of Americans' civil rights; and crimes against property and the peace.\"",
      "The directive acknowledges a 36-year-old Supreme Court decision that found flag burning is protected speech but adds that \"American flag desecration conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or that is an action amounting to 'fighting words'\" may not be entitled to the same protection under the First Amendment.",
      "The order directs the secretary of state, attorney general and secretary of homeland security to take action against foreign nationals who have engaged in \"American flag-desecration activity,\" including by revoking their visas or residence permits, or seeking their removal from the U.S.",
      "The attorney general, Mr. Trump's executive order states, \"shall vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the American Flag, and may pursue litigation to clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions in this area.\"",
      "Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in response to Mr. Trump's executive order that the president does not have the power to change the First Amendment.",
      "\"Flag burning as a form of political protest is protected by the First Amendment. That's nothing new. While people can be prosecuted for burning anything in a place they aren't allowed to set fires, the government can't prosecute protected expressive activity \u2014 even if many Americans, including the president, find it 'uniquely offensive and provocative,'\" he said in a statement. \"You don't have to like flag burning. You can condemn it, debate it, or hoist your own flag even higher. The beauty of free speech is that you get to express your opinions, even if others don't like what you have to say.\"",
      "Is flag burning protected by the First Amendment?",
      "The president's directive appears aimed at re-opening the question in the courts of whether flag burning is constitutionally protected speech. While Mr. Trump believes that it should be illegal to burn the American flag and sought to unilaterally target those who engage in this conduct, the Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the act is expressive conduct covered by the First Amendment.",
      "The 5-4 decision in the landmark case Texas v. Johnson arose from Gregory Lee Johnson's conviction under a Texas law that prohibited desecration of a venerated object. Johnson had burned an American flag outside of Dallas City Hall in protest of then-President Ronald Reagan's policies in 1984. He was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $2,000.",
      "But the Supreme Court ruled that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment, since his flag burning constituted protected expressive conduct. Among the members of the five-justice majority were Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, who often served as the swing vote after Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired.",
      "During a 2012 interview with CNN, Scalia, a conservative stalwart, defended the high court's decision on flag burning and reiterated that the act is a form of expression.",
      "\"If I were king, I would not allow people to go around burning the American flag,\" he said. \"However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged \u2014 and it is addressed in particular to speech critical of the government. That was the main kind of speech that tyrants would seek to suppress.\"",
      "Scalia told CNN that \"burning a flag is a symbol that expresses an idea \u2014 I hate the government, the government is unjust, whatever.\"",
      "Referencing the 1989 ruling, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that the case was decided by a \"very sad court.\"",
      "One year after that decision, the Supreme Court ruled in the case United States v. Eichman that a federal law criminalizing flag burning was unconstitutional.",
      "Congress had passed that law, known as the Flag Protection Act, in 1989 in response to the high court's ruling in Texas v. Johnson. The law made it a crime to knowingly mutilate, deface, physically defile, burn or trample upon the American flag, and violators faced a fine or up to one year in prison.",
      "But in another 5-4 decision, again with Scalia and Kennedy in the majority, the Supreme Court ruled that prosecutions of protesters who burned flags in violation of the Flag Protection Act were inconsistent with the First Amendment.",
      "\"Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and worth revering,\" Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority.",

That ruling applied to more than a dozen cities and counties that had sued the Trump administration for threatening to cut off funding, including San Francisco, Sacramento, Minneapolis and Seattle.",
      "On Friday, San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended his order to dozens of other places that joined the lawsuit. Those include the second- and third-largest cities in the U.S. \u2014 Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 as well as Boston, Baltimore, Denver and Albuquerque.",

The administration argues sanctuary cities are interfering with federal law enforcement and making it harder for ICE to arrest undocumented immigrants, including violent criminals.",
      "The cities and counties that are suing the administration call those policies an \"abuse of power\" and allege they violate the Tenth Amendment, which says any powers that aren't given to the federal government should be reserved to the states. They argue that local governments are entitled to choose not to assist ICE, often casting sanctuary policies as a way of building trust between police and local residents whose immigration status may make them wary of reporting crimes.",
      "\"In flagrant disregard of the law, President Trump seeks once again to punish those who disagree with him, coerce local authorities, and commandeer them into carrying out his agenda,\" the cities' lawsuit says.",
      "The Trump administration's moves against sanctuary cities have generated a flurry of lawsuits, including one suit filed earlier this week by 20 states over the Justice Department's decision to tie crime victim grants to immigration enforcement.",

      "The goal is to explore sunken Northern European landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic settlements as offshore wind farms and other sea infrastructure expand.",
      "Most evidence of such settlements so far has been found at locations inland from the Stone Age coast, said underwater archaeologist Peter Moe Astrup, who's leading underwater excavations in Denmark.",
      "\"Here, we actually have an old coastline. We have a settlement that was positioned directly at the coastline,\" he said. \"What we actually try to find out here is how was life at a coastal settlement.\"",

      "About 8,500 years ago, sea levels rose by about 6.5 feet per century, Moe Astrup said.",
      "Moe Astrup and colleagues at the Moesgaard Museum in H\u00f8jbjerg, just outside Aarhus, have excavated an area of about 430 square feet at the small settlement they discovered just off today's coast.",

      "Excavations in the relatively calm and shallow Bay of Aarhus and dives off the coast of Germany will be followed by later work at two locations in the more inhospitable North Sea.",
      "The sea level rise thousands of years ago submerged, among other things, a vast area known as Doggerland that connected Britain with continental Europe and now lies underneath the southern North Sea.",
      "To build a picture of the rapid rise of the waters, Danish researchers are using dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.",

    "summary": "The first commercial carbon storage facility has been inaugurated off Norway's coast, but is storing CO2 deep under the seabed really the answer?",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

      "Tucked away in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, more than 20 species at risk of extinction, including Mongolia's Przewalski's\u00a0horse, which disappeared from the wild at the end of the 1960s, live on the institute's\u00a0grounds. There are red pandas, maned wolves, and clouded leopards, to name a few more.",

In certain cases, the scientists are responsible for breeding and reintroducing them to their habitats.",
      "But those who work to conserve these species and remove them from the endangered species list are still concerned with the rate at which species are vanishing.",
      "\"We're seeing species disappearing at 10, 100, to 1000 times the normal background rate,\" SCBI conservation biologist Melissa Songer\u00a0told CBS News.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature warned in early 2025 that 28%, or more than 47,000, of the world's assessed species are at risk of extinction. That number includes more than just animal species, showing crucial insect, plant and tree species are also threatened.",
      "\"So we think, okay, well, we're losing the species here and there, you know, there's a lot of other species,\" Songer says, \"but the thing is, that when we lose one species, it has cascading effects.\"",
      "A great example of this effect is with the black-footed ferret, which originally inhabited the North American Great Plains but has been endangered since 1967. While the species remains on the endangered list, its population has grown since preservation efforts began at the Institute.",
      "\"Every animal in the ecosystem is important for that ecosystem,\" says Adrienne Crosier, a cheetah biologist at SCBI, \"they all have a really important role to play.\"",

      "Crosier's team is currently caring for approximately 60 ferret kits, which will be released into the Colorado wild in the Fall.",

    "story": [
      "Running two days late, SpaceX launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship on Tuesday, chalking up what appeared to be a remarkably successful test flight in the wake of three back-to-back failures earlier this year.",
      "While reentry heating damaged a protective \"skirt\" around the engines of the upper stage Starship, along with partially melting a control flap near its hinge, the vehicle remained under control throughout and made it all the way to a powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean as planned.",
      "\"Splashdown confirmed! Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting tenth flight test of Starship!\" SpaceX said in a post on X.",
      "Earlier, the Super Heavy first stage also performed as planned, boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, then flying itself back toward the Texas Gulf Coast for splashdown.",
      "In a test, one of three engines used during a powered descent was deliberately shut down, but the booster compensated and the rocket, falling tail-first, dropped into the Gulf as planned.",
      "SpaceX workers in Texas and California cheered and applauded major milestones throughout the one-hour, six-minute test flight, expressing their obvious elation after three catastrophic failures in a row leading up to Tuesday's 10th test flight.",
      "The mission began when the Super Heavy's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines flashed to life with a ground-shaking roar and a rush of flaming exhaust at 7:30 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the 40-story-tall rocket away from SpaceX's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast.",
      "A launch try on Sunday was called off because of trouble with ground equipment, and a second attempt Monday was blocked by cloudy weather.",
      "But it was clear sailing Tuesday as the rocket, the most powerful ever built, put on a spectacular show accelerating toward space atop some 16 million pounds of thrust \u2014 more than twice the power of NASA's Space Launch System moon rocket and the agency's legendary Saturn 5.",
      "Given the Super Heavy-Starship's uneven track record to date, concern has been growing that a moon lander variant of the Starship being built for NASA may not be perfected in time for a planned 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese plant their own flag on the moon at the end of the decade.",
      "The success of Tuesday's flight will not ease those concerns \u2014 a multitude of technical hurdles remain \u2014 but it was no doubt a shot in the arm for company founder Elon Musk and the SpaceX workforce.",
      "The initial stages of the test flight went smoothly. The 230-foot-tall Super Heavy booster propelled the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, separated, flipped around, and flew itself to a splashdown off the Texas Gulf Coast as planned.",
      "The stage is designed to fly itself back to its launch gantry for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms, a feat pulled off three times during earlier testing.",
      "But for Tuesday's flight, the booster targeted the Gulf while flight controllers monitored how it performed when an engine used for landing was deliberately shut down to simulate a failure. The stage appeared to perform smoothly all the way to splashdown.",
      "The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, flew into a suborbital trajectory as planned, a milestone the three previous test flights failed to achieve.",
      "Over the next 38 minutes or so, the Starship successfully deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators to test the Pez-like deployment mechanism and briefly reignited one of the rocket's six Raptor engines to verify its ability to restart in space.",
      "Then, during reentry into the lower atmosphere, new heat shield tiles were put to the test while cameras and other sensors monitored how the fierce heat of reentry affected various structures.",
      "A protective skirt around the base of the engine compartment appeared to break apart as the heating intensified and at least one flap, used to control the Starship's orientation in the atmosphere, appeared to partially melt near a hinge connecting it to the fuselage.",
      "But it appeared to work normally throughout, flipping back and forth on computer command as the flight computer executed a series of tests.",
      "Like the Super Heavy booster, the Starship is designed to fly itself back to a launch gantry for midair capture. But SpaceX has not yet attempted a return-to-launch-site with a Starship, and the rocket instead descended to an on-target splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "The company positioned a camera buoy in the area before launch, and it captured fleeting views of the big rocket, its skin blistered as expected during reentry, falling tail-first to an on-target rocket-powered \"landing.\" It then broke up and exploded, but that was expected with a water landing.",
      "A successful test flight was critical to SpaceX, which wants to work the bugs out as soon as possible and get the rocket flying on operational missions to launch scores of Starlinks and other satellites and eventually to carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The test flights are also critical to NASA, which is counting on a modified version of the Starship to carry two astronauts to the moon's surface as early as 2027.",
      "Because the rocket is fully reusable, the moon lander will use all of its propellant just reaching low-Earth orbit. To send it to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy tanker flights to refill the lander's tanks with the needed propellant.",
      "It will also need to somehow counteract the natural warming of the liquid oxygen and methane fuel that otherwise will cause the propellants to \"boil off,\" turning into a gas that must be vented overboard.",
      "No orbit-class rockets have ever demonstrated the sort of rapid-fire launch cadence that will be required, or carried out the autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of cryogenic propellants from one rocket to another in the weightless environment of space amid extreme temperature swings.",
      "A single launch failure almost certainly would result in cancellation of a moon mission while an investigation ran its course. And an explosive failure in low-Earth orbit would result in a huge cloud of dangerous debris.",
      "Safely landing on the moon with a 16-story-tall rocket presents its own challenges, not least of which is the possibility of uneven terrain or loosely packed soil that could result in a tip over. And the astronauts will have to ride an external platform down to the surface 100 feet or so below the upper crew section.",
      "Most observers believe SpaceX will eventually overcome those hurdles. The question is, can the company do it in time for a 2027 moon landing? Or if not, will the rocket be ready to carry astronauts to the moon before the Chinese plant their own flag on the surface by the end of the decade?",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current HLS architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",

      "A launch attempt Sunday at SpaceX's sprawling Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast was called off because of an oxygen leak in a ground system. Monday's scrub came with less than a minute to go because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad that did not move out of the area in time.",
      "The company says it will try for the third time Tuesday night. The hour-long launch window begins at 7:30 p.m. ET.",
      "Whenever it takes off, a successful flight would clear the way for a faster launch cadence as SpaceX gears up to test autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, a requirement for a NASA moon landing as early as 2027 and for eventual flights to Mars.",
      "But the company will have to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy-tankers to refuel a moon-bound Starship lander being built for NASA's Artemis program. Many observers doubt the system will be perfected in time for a 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese mount their own moon mission at the end of the decade.",
      "Speaking before the Monday launch attempt, SpaceX founder Elon Musk agreed that \"there are thousands of engineering challenges that remain for both the ship and the booster.\" He put a special emphasis on perfecting orbital refueling.",
      "\"No one has ever demonstrated [cryogenic] propellant transfer in orbit,\" he said. \"This will be propellant transfer at very large scale. But with full reusability and propellant transfer, those are the key technologies needed for building a city on Mars. And I'm confident the SpaceX team will achieve these goals.\"",
      "In the near term, SpaceX's goal is to get the Super Heavy-Starship flying again after multiple back-to-back failures.",
      "The goals of the flight are to test the Super Heavy first stage under a variety of stressful flight conditions, deliberately shutting engines down during descent to splashdown in the Gulf to make sure it can handle real failures during an actual mission.",
      "Given the nature of the tests, SpaceX ruled out a dramatic return to the launch pad for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms on the support gantry.",
      "As for the Starship, the flight plan calls for sending the upper stage halfway around the world on a suborbital trajectory to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along the way, a variety of tests are planned, including the deployment of eight Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space restart of a methane-fueled Raptor engine. Modified heat shield tiles are in place to determine their ability to withstand extreme reentry temperatures.",
      "Multiple upgrades are also in place to minimize the chances of propellant leaks, fires and engine shutdowns like those that led to the loss of the last three Starships launched, none of which were able to complete their mission.",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, is optimistic SpaceX will work the bugs out in time for the agency's planned moon landing mission.",
      "\"If you look at the company as a whole and past performance, they often times are behind, and then all of a sudden, they make these massive leaps forward,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"I would be hard-pressed to say they're not going to meet the goals and the timelines.\"",
      "\"Their leadership has said we feel very confident that we are going to be ready for the mission. And so I'll take them at their word,\" he said.",

      "But as Duffy pointed out, SpaceX has chalked up a remarkable record with its partially reusable Falcon family of rockets, launching them at an unmatched pace that allows the company to rapidly implement and test upgrades and fixes.",
      "As of Friday, SpaceX has launched 518 Falcon 9s and 11 triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets with just two in-flight failures. The company has successfully recovered first-stage boosters 490 times.",
      "Given its record, many fans give SpaceX the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Super Heavy-Starship. But the giant rocket dwarfs the Falcon 9, and the requirements for a successful moon landing are well beyond those faced in a typical satellite launcher.",

      "Test flight No. 10 was expected to get underway at 7:30 p.m. ET from SpaceX's Starbase flight and manufacturing facility and the team was in the process of pumping liquid oxygen and methane fuel into the 40-story-tall rocket when the company announced a scrub.",
      "\"Standing down from today's tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,\" the company said on X. SpaceX later announced that another hour-long launch window would open at 7:30 p.m. EDT Monday.",
      "The flight plan had called for the 30-foot wide, 230-foot tall Super Heavy booster, generating more than 16 million pounds of thrust, to propel the Starship out of the dense lower atmosphere before it would fall away, flip around and head back toward the coast.",
      "During three of the nine previous test flights, the booster flew itself all the way back to its launch pad where giant mechanical arms on the service gantry plucked the descending rocket out of midair. This time around, because of the planned tests, the Super Heavy was expected to descend to splashdown in the Gulf, but it never took off.",
      "SpaceX previously said the primary objectives for the booster test was focused on its landing burn. One of the three center engines used for the final phase of landing was going to be \"intentionally disabled to gather data on the ability for a backup engine from the middle ring to complete a landing burn,\" the company said on its website.",
      "The booster was then going to use two engines toward the end of the descent and hover briefly before dropping to the Gulf.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship, meanwhile, powered by six Raptor engines of its own, would have headed for a suborbital trajectory carrying it halfway around the world before a belly-first reentry, a flip back to vertical and a rocket-powered descent to splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along with deploying eight Starlink simulator satellites, the Starship's flight computer had planned to attempt a variety of other tests, including an in-space engine restart, to verify the performance of numerous upgrades implemented in the wake of the most recent test flight failures.",
      "Working the bugs out of the giant launcher is critical to SpaceX and founder Elon Musk, who designed the ultra-heavy-lift rocket to launch thousands of next-generation Starlinks and other satellites in Earth's orbit and to one day carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The rocket also is critical to NASA, which is paying SpaceX more than $3 billion to develop a modified version of the Starship upper stage to carry Artemis astronauts to the surface of the moon in 2027.",
      "But that flight will require 10 to 20 Super Heavy-Starship flights just to refuel the \"Human Landing System,\" or HLS, lander before it can head to the moon. Transferring thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid nitrogen and oxygen in space has never been attempted.",
      "And it is still not known how SpaceX plans to control propellant temperatures to minimize the amount that will naturally warm up and turn into a gas, which must be vented overboard. SpaceX has provided no details. Musk promised pre-launch update Sunday on the company's plans going forward, but the talk was also canceled with no explanation.",
      "Given the number of flights that must be successfully executed to demonstrate the reliability NASA will expect, the 2027 target date for the Artemis 3 moon landing is considered unrealistic, if not impossible to meet, by many aerospace observers.",
      "China plans to launch its own astronauts on the moon by 2030. It is unclear at this point whether NASA and SpaceX will get back to the moon using the Starship lander before the Chinese plant their own flag on the lunar surface.",
      "Given the sheer size and power of the Super Heavy-Starship \u2014 it has more than twice the thrust of NASA's current Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket \u2014 technical problems during development were not unexpected.",
      "But given the short time between now and NASA's first planned Artemis moon landing, the problems have clearly set the program back and cast doubt on the overall mission architecture, especially the requirement for 10 to 20 problem-free flights in short order just to fuel the lander for its flight to the moon.",
      "The first three test flights of the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage in 2023 and 2024 ended in catastrophic failures with both stages destroyed, either while still attached to each other or after separation.",
      "The fourth flight in June 2024 was generally successful with the Super Heavy flying itself back to a controlled splashdown in the Gulf while the Starship followed the planned sub-orbital trajectory to splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The ship's fins were damaged by reentry heating, but otherwise worked as required.",
      "The fifth flight in October 2024 was highlighted by a successful Super Heavy return to the launch pad gantry where giant mechanical arms snagged the rocket in mid air. The Starship, meanwhile, managed a second controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean although it again suffered fin damage during reentry.",
      "During the sixth integrated flight test in November 2024, the Super Heavy attempted another return to the launch site but it was diverted to a Gulf splashdown because of launch damage to critical sensors in the pad's capture mechanism. The Starship again flew itself to a controlled Indian Ocean splashdown with minimal flap damage.",
      "But the next three flights, in January, March and May of this year, ended with catastrophic failures. Two Super Heavy boosters successfully returned to the launch site, but the most recent broke up over the Gulf while testing a high angle-of-attack entry.",
      "All three Starships were destroyed after catastrophic malfunctions, including two propellant leaks, an on-board fire and multiple engine failures.",
      "In addition to the flight record, another Starship was destroyed on the ground when a high-pressure nitrogen tank exploded during an engine test firing at the Starbase launch site.",

    "story": [
      "SpaceX early Sunday launched its 33rd resupply mission to the International Space Station, sending up a Dragon capsule loaded with 2.5 tons of equipment and supplies along with an add-on thruster kit to help maintain the lab's altitude.",
      "Perched atop a workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, commercial resupply mission 33 got underway with a sky-lighting launch from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 2:45 a.m. ET, climbing away on a northeasterly trajectory lined up with the space station's orbit.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, moments after the discarded first-stage booster safely landed on an offshore droneship, the Dragon was released from the rocket's second stage, kicking off a 29-hour rendezvous with the orbiting laboratory complex.",
      "If all goes well, the cargo ship will move in for docking at the station's forward port at 7:30 a.m. Monday. On board: more than 2,400 pounds of crew supplies, nearly 1,000 pounds of science gear, 1,300 pounds of space station hardware, computer equipment and spacewalk gear.",
      "The food includes the usual variety of fresh, asked-for items for the crew, including coffee, tea and more than 1,500 tortillas.",
      "\"We fly tortillas because ... other breads and things like that have too many crumbs and things of that nature (that float away in weightlessness), so you can't actually maintain it in orbit,\" said Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager. \"Tortillas are a great substitute for that.\"",
      "On a more significant note, Heidi Parris, associate program scientist for the space station, noted that NASA will mark 25 years of continuous human presence aboard the lab in November.",
      "During that quarter century, she said, \"we've hosted more than 280 residents, we've enabled more than 4,000 different ... scientific experiments and technology demonstrations (representing) the work of over 5,000 researchers from over 110 countries around the world.\"",
      "The CRS-33 mission will bring 50 research projects to the lab, including a new study of the effects of microgravity on bone loss, a 3D metal printer to assess the capability for manufacturing spare parts and tools on demand in space, and an experiment to study the effectiveness of 3D \"bioprinting.\"",
      "\"This investigation ... is looking to create a 3D-printed implantable medical device that can support nerve regrowth after injury by bridging the gap to reconnect severed nerves while also simultaneously delivering drugs that can support nerve regeneration,\" Parris said.",
      "Of special interest to NASA is the performance of an add-on propulsion system consisting of two SpaceX Draco engines, six propellant tanks and a supply of helium to pressurize the system. The hardware is mounted in the Dragon's open-to-space aft trunk section.",
      "\"The space station's altitude slowly decays over time due to the thin amount of atmosphere still at our altitude,\" Spetch said. \"To counteract that drag, we must occasionally raise the altitude of the ISS.\"",
      "The Russians handle the majority of those re-boost operations, delivering the needed propellants and periodically firing thrusters aboard Progress cargo ships and the station itself.",
      "\"With the addition of the boost trunk on this mission, Dragon will also provide this ability to maintain the station's altitude,\" Spetch said. \"The boost kit will help sustain the orbiting lab's altitude starting in September with a series of burns planned periodically throughout the fall of 2025.\"",
      "The CRS-33 Dragon will remain docked to the station until December. During that time, the boost kit will provide the one and a half Progress missions.",
      "Sarah Walker, director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said the boost kit will provide about a quarter of the propulsion needed in one year to maintain the station's 260-mile-high altitude. The first \"burn,\" expected to last about 20 minutes, is planned for Sept. 3.",

    "summary": "During its secretive mission, the X-37B will test new laser communications gear and a \"quantum\" navigation sensor.",
    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off late Thursday, propelling a reusable X-37B Space Force rocket plane into space on a classified long-duration mission. It was the eighth such flight since the program's debut in 2010 and the first since a 434-day mission ended last March.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 roared away from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 11:50 p.m. EDT, arcing onto a northeasterly trajectory atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust from the booster's nine first-stage engines.",
      "After the spacecraft climbed out of the lower atmosphere, the engines shut down, the first stage fell away, flipped around and re-ignited three engines to reverse course and head back to Florida. Heralded by an attention-getting sonic boom, the booster landed at the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to wrap up its sixth flight.",
      "It was SpaceX's 66th booster landing in Florida and the company's 490th successful recovery overall.",
      "As usual with classified Space Force missions, SpaceX ended its launch commentary with the first stage landing and offered no information about the Falcon 9's second stage climb to orbit, when the Boeing-built X-37B was to be released to fly on its own, or any details about its orbit.",
      "The seven previous X-37B missions -- three by the orbiter launched Thursday and four by a twin sister ship -- all carried out long-duration missions ranging from 224 days to nearly 909 days. It's not known how long the X-37B launched Thursday will remain in orbit.",
      "While the flights are generally classified, Space Force and Boeing officials publicly discussed two of the payloads on board.",
      "One  will test high-speed, tightly-targeted laser communications between the  X-37B and small data relay satellites making up a growing  \"proliferated\" space-based communications system.",
      "The tests \"will mark an important step in the U.S. Space Force's  ability to leverage proliferated space networks as part of a diversified  and redundant space architecture,\" said Gen. Chance Saltzman, director of space operations for the U.S. Space Force.",
      "\"In so doing, it will strengthen the resilience, reliability, adaptability and data transport speeds of our satellite communications architecture.\"",
      "The other publicly disclosed payload is a sophisticated quantum navigation sensor designed to determine a spacecraft's precise position in space by \"detecting rotation and acceleration of atoms without reliance on satellite networks like traditional GPS,\" the Space Force said in an on-line description.",
      "\"Whether navigating beyond Earth-based orbits in cislunar space or operating in GPS-denied environments, quantum inertial sensing allows for robust navigation capabilities when GPS navigation is not possible,\" said Space Delta 9 commander Col. Ramsey Horn.",
      "\"Ultimately, this technology contributes significantly to our thrust within the Fifth Space Operations Squadron and across the Space Force guaranteeing movement and maneuverability even in GPS-denied environments.\"",
      "Clad in black heat shield tiles and white insulation blankets, the unpiloted X-37B resembles a mini space shuttle with stubby delta wings and two tail fins extending from either side of the rear of the fuselage. It can be launched atop SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets or United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 and Vulcan boosters.",
      "Two virtually identical X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles, or OTVs, are operated by the Pentagon's Rapid Capabilities Office for the U.S. Space Force. The vehicles are designed to serve as test beds for avionics and advanced sensors, to evaluate reusable spacecraft components and to provide a platform for experiments that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Powered by solar cells and batteries, the orbiters feature a small payload bay similar to a space shuttle's that can accommodate a variety of sensors and experiment packages.",
      "The compact spacecraft are designed to end their missions with runway landings at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California or the Kennedy Space Center in Florida using 3-mile-long runways originally built for the space shuttle.",
      "The most recent flight of an X-37B began with a\u00a0launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on Dec. 29, 2023. It ended last March 7, with touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center after 434 days and six hours in space. Going into Thursday's mission, the two X-37Bs had logged a combined 11-and-a-half years in space across seven flights.",

      "Editor's note: This article contains descriptions and an image of hate speech found on the Roblox servers and might be triggering to some readers.",
      "In Roblox, one of the world's largest online gaming platforms, users join to play, create, and be themselves in a virtual world \u2014 but some might be there for a more insidious purpose: to expose youth to hate speech.",
      "Players of \"Spray Paint!\" \u2014 a popular game on Roblox, with over a billion visits, in which players skate and create graffiti art in a virtual skatepark setting \u2014 can bypass moderation by spray painting hate messages across walls, ramps and other virtual game settings, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "CBS News documented dozens of swastikas and at least a dozen instances of hate speech targeting minority groups across Spray Paint! servers, which host multiplayer games. There are millions of games on Roblox where players can join servers to play with friends and strangers.",
      "What's happening in \"Spray Paint!\" is not uncommon \u2014 nor surprising. Roblox currently has at least 18 active lawsuits pending nationwide due to inappropriate content found on its games, attorney Matthew Dolman, whose firm is representing individuals in cases against Roblox, told CBS News.",
      "Roblox said in an emailed statement to CBS News that its 24/7 moderation system closely monitors the platform, and that the company takes \"swift action against any content or users found to be in violation.\"",
      "However, hate speech still appears in Roblox games, like Spray Paint, CBS News found. \"Within three minutes of getting in there for the first time, I also saw a swastika,\" said Rachel Franz, the early childhood advocacy program director at the nonprofit Fairplay, which advocates for children's online safety.",
      "Hate can run rampant across various Roblox games. A group called Active Shooter Studios recreates school shootings at Columbine, Uvalde and Parkland and consistently evades efforts to take down recreations, the Anti-Defamation League found in an April report. A lawsuit filed this month alleges that Roblox hosted hundreds of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs-themed games, as well as more than 900 user accounts registered across Roblox with variations of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's name.",
      "\"Roblox is fully aware that these experiences pervade its app, and it allows them to continue to exist unchecked despite the ability to control or eliminate them,\" the lawsuit alleges, and said the effects on children can be devastating.",
      "Last week, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill filed a child protection lawsuit against the platform.",
      "\"Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,\" Murrill, a Republican, alleged in a press release. \"Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Roblox said, \"We share Attorney General Murrill's urgency to help keep kids safe because safety has always been our priority,\" adding that it looks forward to working with Murrill to help keep children safe.",
      "\"We share the critically important goal of keeping kids safe online and any assertion otherwise is categorically untrue,\" Roblox's statement said. \"We hold ourselves to the highest standard and work constantly to remove violative content and bad actors.\"",
      "What children are encountering",
      "Predators can troll Roblox, experts say, and other similar gaming platforms, to recruit young players for extremist groups or possibly sexual exploitation.",
      "Children and teens make up more than half of Roblox players, and about 40% of players are under the age of 13, according to a 2024 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Roblox attracts an average of 97.8 million daily active users.",
      "\"If you are a predator, it's very clear that there are opportunities to access vulnerable folks on these platforms,\" Franz said.",
      "When children play the Spray Paint! game, they might see slurs targeting Black and Jewish people and phrases like \"KKK\" and \"Jew\" etched in graffiti on virtual brick walls. In one server, there were over 14 instances of this speech, CBS News found, as well as a reference to the \"Third Reich.\"",
      "The phrase \"I can't breathe,\" the words uttered by George Floyd, who died in 2020 in police custody by an officer later convicted of murder, was written across a virtual brick wall in one server. Some servers had graphic sexual drawings, and in another, there was an instance of suicidal language, CBS News found.",
      "Roblox's chat feature, available in some games, has a filtering system that prevents inappropriate content, like discriminatory speech, from being visible, but in Spray Paint! players can bypass filtering mechanisms by scrawling text via the game's paint feature as opposed to writing in the chat, where content is filtered.",
      "Users must enter their birthday when creating a Roblox account, but the platform doesn't require authentication, meaning adults can pose as children and children can pose as older than they actually are. Kids can converse with other players via the voice chat feature \u2014 which has a minimum age requirement of 13 \u2014but also doesn't require age verification.",
      "Roblox says the company has implemented what it calls a \"trusted flagger program,\" where trusted partners can report \"terrorist content\" in an effort to crack down on hate messages.",
      "Roblox also says on its website that content uploaded to be incorporated into games is evaluated in a multi-step review process to screen for child sexual abuse material and other inappropriate content. If it is identified as fodder for possible child sexual abuse, Roblox says it is automatically reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit organization focusing on finding missing children and reducing child exploitation.",
      "Roblox has developed an artificial intelligence system that the company says helped submit about 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to NCMEC \u2014 and last year, Roblox submitted 24,522 reports to NCMEC overall.",
      "Roblox says it has a human review team continuously evaluating flagged games and encourages users to report concerning activity. Spray Paint! players have the option to play in \"safe mode,\" which allows them to only view art created by other players who are on their \"friends\" list in the app.",
      "A Roblox spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement that \"while no system is perfect,\" the company has implemented safeguards including \"restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, as well as content maturity [l]abels and parental controls.\"",
      "\"We share with our community the critically important goal of keeping everyone safe online and ensuring users have positive experiences on Roblox that align with our strict Community Standards,\" the statement said, adding, \"We continuously innovate to deter bad actors and have launched over 50 safety features since last year.\"",
      "Despite efforts to curb extremism and the targeting of young players, experts and CBS News found that protections remain easy to override.",
      "\"There's a larger question of how you regulate and moderate something that is supposed to encourage creativity and freedom of expression, but actually ends up introducing some really unsafe and truly harmful and disgusting practices,\" Franz said.",
      "A double-edged sword",
      "Allegations in several cases suggest Roblox has also been used to exploit teens and children. A Florida teenager was arrested\u00a0in April for allegedly targeting children on Roblox, where he would demand child sexual abuse material over text messages or the messaging platform Discord. In Texas, a lawsuit filed in April alleges a 13-year-old girl was groomed and sexually exploited on Roblox and later, Discord. Roblox has recently been hit by a spate of lawsuits with similar claims. Dolman said his firm currently has seven cases and is investigating 400 more. Another firm filed a lawsuit earlier this month against Roblox and Discord representing over 400 people.",
      "A man in California was arrested\u00a0in April on kidnapping and sexual misconduct charges in connection with a 10-year-old he is believed to have met through Roblox. Last year, a woman in Florida was arrested for allegedly using Roblox to instruct a 10-year-old to kill an infant by dropping the 2-month-old on a tile floor. The infant was seriously injured.",
      "When asked for a response to the lawsuits, Roblox said in an email that the company is \"deeply troubled\" by any incident that endangers its users, noting that safety is a top priority.",
      "\"Roblox is committed to empowering parents and caregivers to help ensure a safe online experience for their children.\"",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced in April that he issued a subpoena to Roblox.",
      "\"There are concerning reports that this gaming platform, which is popular among children, is exposing them to harmful content and bad actors,\" he said in a press release. \"We are issuing a subpoena to Roblox to uncover how this platform is marketing to children and to see what policies they are implementing\u2014if any\u2014to avoid interactions with predators.\"",
      "Open-world games like Spray Paint!, where users can roam a virtual space in relative anonymity, can be a double-edged sword. Doris Chang, a psychologist and associate professor at New York University's Silver School of Social Work, says that these spaces can be affirming for queer youth.",
      "\"They can be whoever they want. Gender fluidity is really common,\" Chang said, adding it can also put those groups at risk for exposure to hate speech and predatory individuals.",
      "\"You're just interacting with people that you wouldn't normally interact with. It's completely wide open,\" Chang said.",
      "Chang said when children play a game like Spray Paint! without parental supervision, they may have to navigate problematic scenarios that might be confusing or upsetting.",
      "\"It brings up the larger question about how much parents know about what their kids are getting exposed to online,\" she said. \"Broadly speaking, Roblox is just one corner of the internet that our kids are navigating.\"",

Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.",
      "But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance.",
      "\"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering,\" Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg.",
      "\"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything,\" Fello said.",
      "A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements.",
      "Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.",
      "\"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore,\" Fello said. \"We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'\"",
      "A \"first-of-its-kind technology\"",
      "One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the Vivistim System. The FDA-approved implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They regulate the body's involuntary functions.",
      "The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises.",
      "Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in \"greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors,\" Nossek said in emailed remarks.",
      "\"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use,\" Nossek said. \"This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population.\"",
      "A 108-person trial\u00a0published in The Lancet in 2021\u00a0found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have \"moderate to severe deficits\" qualify for the device, the company\u00a0said in a fact sheet.",
      "Implant aids in recovery",
      "Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025.",
      "\"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked,\" Fello said.",
      "The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with \"less than 1% chance of any complications.\" Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey.",
      "Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't \"something he could have done before.\" Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.",
      "\"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it,\" he said.",
      "\"The sky's the limit\"",
      "About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and other new technologies may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said.",
      "\"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back,\" Bain said. \"In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery.\"",
      "At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but shared a map that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy.",
      "\"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back,\" Covey said. \"This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down.\"",

      "If you look up at the sky in Texas and see what could be a flying burrito, you may not be imagining things: Chipotle on Thursday launched an autonomous aerial delivery service for digital orders in the Dallas area.",
      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",
      "\"With Zipline, you tap a button, and minutes later food magically appears \u2014 hot, fresh, and ultra-fast,\" Zipline CEO and co-founder Rinaudo Cliffton said in the same announcement. \"What once felt like science fiction is soon going to become totally normal,\" he added.",
      "For now, each autonomous aircraft can carry orders of up to 5.5 pounds in weight. That will increase eventually to 8 pounds, Chipotle said.",
      "Last year, Chipotle was criticized by some customers who alleged certain restaurants were\u00a0skimping on portions. The company initially denied the claims, before then CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0acknowledged that about 10%\u00a0of Chipotle's 3,500 locations had indeed been underserving customers.",

    "story": [
      "The rich are different from other people \u2014 and that also applies to the share of their income they pay in taxes, according to a new study from University of California, Berkeley, economists.",
      "The individuals who make up the\u00a0Forbes 400 list, topped by Tesla CEO Elon Musk with a fortune of $244 billion, paid an average effective tax rate of 24% from 2018 to 2020, compared with a 30% rate for all other U.S. taxpayers, the researchers said in a new paper published in the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The research comes as President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law on July 4, delivers its largest\u00a0benefits to the highest-earning Americans\u00a0through a mix of new and extended tax breaks. Those include raising the estate-tax exemption to $15 million per person, up from about $14 million.",
      "The changes build on an earlier tax cut \u2014 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Mr. Trump's signature first-term legislation. That 2017 law reduced the effective tax rate for the richest Americans from 30% to 24%, the researchers found.",
      "The new findings \u2014 from Berkeley economists and noted inequality experts Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman \u2014 calculates the tax rate by tallying all income taxes, as well as corporate taxes that are paid by the companies owned by the richest Americans. In other words, it assigns a share of Amazon's corporate taxes to that of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos when calculating his total tax burden.",
      "\"The economic income of the wealthiest are essentially the profits of the businesses they own,\" Saez told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Jeff Bezos owns about 10% of Amazon, and hence his true economic income is 10% of Amazon's profits.\"",
      "Corporate taxes are levies on the profits generated for Bezos, similar to how an employer withholds federal income and Social Security contributions from a worker's paycheck, he added.",
      "Saez and Zucman are leading proponents of instituting a U.S. wealth tax to help address widening inequality between the haves and have-nots. That idea has been embraced by some lawmakers, such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.",
      "Some conservative critics have argued that wealth taxes could be self-defeating, with the Hoover Institute noting in a 2023 blog post that the levy could discourage entrepreneurship and investment.",
      "Research shows that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while cutting taxes for many individuals and businesses, hasn't had a significant impact on the economy, the Congressional Research Service found in an April report. Republican proponents of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, also\u00a0say\u00a0that it will boost the economy and provide tax relief to workers and families.",
      "How billionaires pay a smaller share",
      "U.S. income taxes are designed to be progressive, meaning that higher-earning workers pay a bigger share of their income to the IRS than people lower down the ladder. But because capital gains \u2014 the profits earned from selling stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets \u2014and business income are taxed at a lower rate than the top rate for income that people earn through their jobs, the richest Americans reap a massive tax break.",
      "For instance, the highest tax rate on earned income stands at 37%, which is assessed on every dollar earned above $609,351 for individual taxpayers. Yet that same person will pay only a 20% tax rate on long-term capital gains, such as profits from a stock sale, and a 21% corporate tax rate on income earned through a partnership or other business.",
      "And if the rich don't sell their shares, they don't have to pay any taxes on that wealth because they haven't realized a capital gain, Saez noted.",
      "\"The individual income tax is designed to be progressive thanks to its increasing tax rates by brackets, and it does a pretty good job except among the billionaire class,\" he said. \"As I said, the billionaire class can avoid realizing individual income and hence can escape the individual income tax.\"",
      "To be sure, the rich are shouldering the largest share of the nation's taxes, IRS data also shows. The top 1% of earners \u2013 people who make over roughly $663,000 per year \u2014 account for roughly 40% of all federal individual income tax, while the top 50% contribute 97%, a Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis\u00a0of IRS data shows. The bottom half of income earners account for about 3% of those taxes.",
      "Some wealthy Americans pay a tax rate exceeding the 30% average, the new paper also found. The top labor earners \u2014 people who depend on high wages for their incomes rather than capital gains or corporate profits \u2014 have a 45% effective tax rate, according to Berkeley analysis.",
      "The findings about the richest 400 Americans suggest that a wealth tax is still needed to curb inequality in the U.S., Saez said.",
      "\"The wealth tax is the most direct and powerful way to specifically target the ultra-rich and increase tax progressivity at the very top,\" he said. \"The wealth tax on the ultra-rich is also popular but will obviously be fought by billionaires, and they have disproportionate influence.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Wisconsin man who faked his own drowning while kayaking and left his wife and three children to meet a woman in the country of Georgia was convicted Tuesday of obstructing an officer and sentenced to 89 days in jail, which was the amount of time he successfully misled law enforcement about his whereabouts.",
      "The sentence given to Ryan Borgwardt was nearly twice as long as what was recommended under a plea deal reached with prosecutors.",
      "Borgwardt, 45, initially pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor that stemmed from his elaborate escape from the country last August. But under the plea deal unveiled Tuesday, Borgwardt changed his plea to no contest and agreed to pay $30,000 in restitution to law enforcement to cover what was spent trying to locate him. A no-contest plea isn't an admission of guilt but is treated as such for the purposes of sentencing.",
      "\"I deeply regret the actions I did that night and all the pain I caused my family, friends,\" Borgwardt said in court before being sentenced.",
      "Prosecutors asked Green Lake County Circuit Judge Mark Slate to sentence Borgwardt to just 45 days in jail. But the judge nearly doubled it to 89 days. That is the number of days from when he was declared missing until the sheriff's department made contact with him overseas, the judge said.",
      "\"He obstructed law enforcement for a total of 89 days,\" Slate said.",
      "The longer sentence can serve as a deterrent to anyone else who may be considering faking their death and misleading law enforcement, the judge said.",
      "Borgwardt was reported missing on Aug. 12, 2024, after telling his wife the night before that he was kayaking on Green Lake, about 100 miles northwest of Milwaukee.",
      "Authorities who responded to the report found Borgwardt's car and trailer parked on the bank of the lake, and a capsized kayak that apparently belonged to him in an area where the water was about 220 feet deep.",
      "His disappearance was first investigated as a possible drowning. But after failing to find his body following a 58-day search, the investigation broadened.",
      "The investigation took a turn after officials were notified that Canadian authorities had checked Borgwardt's name on Aug. 13, 2024, according to the sheriff's office.",
      "Green Lake Chief Deputy Matt Vandelkolk told CBS News in November that the fact that Borgrwardt's name was checked by law enforcement in Canada after he seemingly went missing \"caught our attention,\" because it meant \"he had contact with Canadian law enforcement in some way, shape or form.\"",
      "Subsequent clues, including that he obtained a new passport three months before he disappeared, led investigators to speculate that Borgwardt had faked his death to meet up with a woman from Uzbekistan he had been communicating with.",
      "A forensic analysis of a laptop that Borgwardt's wife had given to investigators also raised suspicions that he had engineered the disappearance in order to flee to some place in Europe.",
      "Investigators made contact with Borgwardt in November and convinced him to return to the U.S. in December. He turned himself in and was charged with obstructing the search for his body. His wife of 22 years divorced him four months later.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, Borgwardt traveled 50 miles from his family's home in Watertown to Green Lake on Aug. 11, 2024. During the night, he overturned his kayak on the lake, paddled back to shore in an inflatable raft that he brought with him \u2014 dumping his identification in the lake along the way \u2014 and rode an electric bicycle 70 miles to Madison. From there, he caught a bus to Toronto, flew to Paris and then to \"a country in Asia,\" before he landed in the European country of Georgia, according to the criminal complaint.",
      "He told investigators that a woman picked him up and they spent several days in a hotel before he took up residency in Georgia, according to the complaint.",
      "\"His entire plan to fake his death to devastate his family in order to serve his own selfish desires hinged on him dying in the lake and selling his death to the world,\" Green Lake County District Attorney Gerise LaSpisa said ahead of sentencing.",
      "She noted that he took out a life insurance policy, applied for a replacement passport and reversed his vasectomy before faking his death to meet a woman he met online just months earlier.",
      "\"The defendant did not count on the determination and dedication of our law enforcement,\" LaSpisa said.",
      "Borgwardt's attorney, Erik Johnson, said Borgwardt \"deeply regrets\" his actions, and that he returned to the country \"to make amends.\" He noted that Borgwardt paid the $30,000 in restitution last week.",

      "North Carolina",
      "North Carolina was already expected to be competitive in 2026, even before GOP Sen. Thom Tillis announced in June he wouldn't seek reelection. The open seat in the Tar Heel State has emerged as a key prize as Democrats look to make gains in the Senate.",
      "President Trump won the state by more than three points in 2024, and North Carolina has historically voted for Republicans in every presidential race \u2014 with the exception of Barack Obama in 2008 \u2014 which also marked the last time the state sent a Democrat to the Senate. But Democrats are hoping to flip the Senate seat in 2026, with their dream recruit, former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper.",
      "Cooper, who announced his Senate bid in July, is a two-term governor and the longest-serving state attorney general in North Carolina's history.",
      "The contest heated up days after Cooper entered the race, when Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley announced a bid for the open seat, teeing up what's expected to be among the most expensive races of the cycle. Whatley has never run for office but played a key role in Mr. Trump's reelection effort. He's leaning on his conservative acumen and an endorsement from the president, as well as the connections he's forged as RNC chair.",

But Georgia flipped again in 2024, supporting Mr. Trump, making Ossoff the only incumbent Democrat this cycle defending a seat the president won in the last election.",
      "With a number of Republicans already jockeying to take on Ossoff, the GOP primary threatens to be a bruising one for the party. Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, along with former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley have all entered the race. And though Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp opted not to launch a bid, Dooley is widely seen as his pick. Meanwhile, the president, who has publicly clashed with Kemp in recent years, has yet to endorse a candidate.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 22:27:49 -0400",
    "summary": "Removing a top Fed official threatens to shake investor confidence in the central bank's long-standing independence, according to Wall Street observers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's\u00a0move to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook\u00a0could roil financial markets, raise uncertainty for investors and heighten concerns that the White House is trying to wrest control of the historically independent central bank, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Mr. Trump announced her removal in a letter posted Monday night on Truth Social, citing allegations that she had engaged in mortgage fraud.",
      "Cook denies Mr. Trump has the legal authority to fire her and pledged on Tuesday not to resign. \"I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022,\" she said in a statement. Cook's lawyer also vowed to fight the firing in court.",
      "Asked by CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes on Tuesday whether the Trump administration is effectively weaponizing government by digging into the mortgage records of public officials, Mr. Trump responded, \"No. They're public.\"",
      "Cook has not been charged with a crime. Federal Housing Finance Agency head Bill Pulte, who leveled the initial accusations against Cook, has called on the Department of Justice to investigate Cook.",
      "Cook was appointed to a 14-year term on the Fed's Board of Governors in 2022 and also serves on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets short-term interest rates in the U.S.",
      "A Federal Reserve spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday that the central bank will \"continue to carry out its duties as established by law.\" The Fed also pointed to Cook's statement that she plans to contest her firing in court and said it \"will abide by any court decision.\"",
      "\"Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,\" the Fed said.",
      "More influence over the Fed?",
      "Financial markets were subdued\u00a0on Tuesday in digesting Mr. Trump's effort to oust Cook. Yet the decision was the talk of Wall Street, with multiple analysts saying Cook's dismissal could open the door to Mr. Trump gaining control of the Fed's seven-member board.",
      "\"President Trump's decision to fire Lisa Cook as a Fed governor gives him the ability to gain a majority at the Federal Reserve Board and to influence the broader composition of the FOMC,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, said in a report to investors, referring to the central bank's rate-setting panel.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on whether firing Cook could impact financial markets and compromise the Fed's independence.",
      "Mr. Trump has also nominated Stephen Miran, who heads the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to serve on the Fed board. Mr. Trump is slated to name a nominee to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell whose term ends in May of 2025; Powell is scheduled to continue serving on the Fed board until January of 2028 and could continue to serve in that role after stepping down as Fed chair.",
      "If Cook were to leave the Fed board, Mr. Trump could ultimately end up with five appointees on the panel by mid-2026, giving the White House more leverage to influence monetary policy, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "During a meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump demurred when asked by a reporter who he's considering to replace Cook on the Fed board. \"We'll have a majority very shortly so that will be great,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly assailed Powell for the central bank's decision to hold off in cutting interest rates, with policy makers remaining cautious about reducing borrowing costs so long as inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Powell signaled last week that a rate cut could be on the horizon during a speech at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic symposium.",
      "No guarantee of lower interest rates",
      "The 12-member FOMC is made up of seven members of the Fed Board of Governors; the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and four of the 11 Fed bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis for one-year terms.",
      "That interlocking relationship suggests that even stacking the Fed board with loyalists wouldn't guarantee the interest rate cuts that Mr. Trump has demanded, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's not just about the administration nominating individuals and Congress confirming those individuals \u2014 it's also about how these individuals perceive their role and value their independence,\" he said.",
      "Analysts with Capital Economics noted that Mr. Trump's appointees would need to persuade other FOMC members about setting monetary policy in ways that align with the White House's economic objectives. That \"could be difficult if those others felt compelled to defend the Fed from political attacks,\" they said in a report.",
      "For decades, investors have seen the Fed as a generally neutral arbiter guided by its mandate to keep inflation in check and the job market humming. As a result, any perception that Mr. Trump is undermining the Fed's autonomy could rattle markets, according to Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "\"Investors are reacting because the independence of the central bank is critical to market stability, and any sign of political capture raises alarm bells everywhere,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Meanwhile, the question of whether Cook can be removed from the Fed board remains unresolved. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the president has authority to remove Fed appointees before their term ends, but only for \"cause.\" Analysts said the legal dispute over Cook's removal could wind up in the Supreme Court.",
      "\"The situation is extremely fluid,\" Daco said. \"So until we get some clarity as to the exact conviction, you're not necessarily going to see much significant movements in markets.\"",

    "story": [
      "Running two days late, SpaceX launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship on Tuesday, chalking up what appeared to be a remarkably successful test flight in the wake of three back-to-back failures earlier this year.",
      "While reentry heating damaged a protective \"skirt\" around the engines of the upper stage Starship, along with partially melting a control flap near its hinge, the vehicle remained under control throughout and made it all the way to a powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean as planned.",
      "\"Splashdown confirmed! Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting tenth flight test of Starship!\" SpaceX said in a post on X.",
      "Earlier, the Super Heavy first stage also performed as planned, boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, then flying itself back toward the Texas Gulf Coast for splashdown.",
      "In a test, one of three engines used during a powered descent was deliberately shut down, but the booster compensated and the rocket, falling tail-first, dropped into the Gulf as planned.",
      "SpaceX workers in Texas and California cheered and applauded major milestones throughout the one-hour, six-minute test flight, expressing their obvious elation after three catastrophic failures in a row leading up to Tuesday's 10th test flight.",
      "The mission began when the Super Heavy's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines flashed to life with a ground-shaking roar and a rush of flaming exhaust at 7:30 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the 40-story-tall rocket away from SpaceX's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast.",
      "A launch try on Sunday was called off because of trouble with ground equipment, and a second attempt Monday was blocked by cloudy weather.",
      "But it was clear sailing Tuesday as the rocket, the most powerful ever built, put on a spectacular show accelerating toward space atop some 16 million pounds of thrust \u2014 more than twice the power of NASA's Space Launch System moon rocket and the agency's legendary Saturn 5.",
      "Given the Super Heavy-Starship's uneven track record to date, concern has been growing that a moon lander variant of the Starship being built for NASA may not be perfected in time for a planned 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese plant their own flag on the moon at the end of the decade.",
      "The success of Tuesday's flight will not ease those concerns \u2014 a multitude of technical hurdles remain \u2014 but it was no doubt a shot in the arm for company founder Elon Musk and the SpaceX workforce.",
      "The initial stages of the test flight went smoothly. The 230-foot-tall Super Heavy booster propelled the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, separated, flipped around, and flew itself to a splashdown off the Texas Gulf Coast as planned.",
      "The stage is designed to fly itself back to its launch gantry for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms, a feat pulled off three times during earlier testing.",
      "But for Tuesday's flight, the booster targeted the Gulf while flight controllers monitored how it performed when an engine used for landing was deliberately shut down to simulate a failure. The stage appeared to perform smoothly all the way to splashdown.",
      "The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, flew into a suborbital trajectory as planned, a milestone the three previous test flights failed to achieve.",
      "Over the next 38 minutes or so, the Starship successfully deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators to test the Pez-like deployment mechanism and briefly reignited one of the rocket's six Raptor engines to verify its ability to restart in space.",
      "Then, during reentry into the lower atmosphere, new heat shield tiles were put to the test while cameras and other sensors monitored how the fierce heat of reentry affected various structures.",
      "A protective skirt around the base of the engine compartment appeared to break apart as the heating intensified and at least one flap, used to control the Starship's orientation in the atmosphere, appeared to partially melt near a hinge connecting it to the fuselage.",
      "But it appeared to work normally throughout, flipping back and forth on computer command as the flight computer executed a series of tests.",
      "Like the Super Heavy booster, the Starship is designed to fly itself back to a launch gantry for midair capture. But SpaceX has not yet attempted a return-to-launch-site with a Starship, and the rocket instead descended to an on-target splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "The company positioned a camera buoy in the area before launch, and it captured fleeting views of the big rocket, its skin blistered as expected during reentry, falling tail-first to an on-target rocket-powered \"landing.\" It then broke up and exploded, but that was expected with a water landing.",
      "A successful test flight was critical to SpaceX, which wants to work the bugs out as soon as possible and get the rocket flying on operational missions to launch scores of Starlinks and other satellites and eventually to carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The test flights are also critical to NASA, which is counting on a modified version of the Starship to carry two astronauts to the moon's surface as early as 2027.",
      "Because the rocket is fully reusable, the moon lander will use all of its propellant just reaching low-Earth orbit. To send it to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy tanker flights to refill the lander's tanks with the needed propellant.",
      "It will also need to somehow counteract the natural warming of the liquid oxygen and methane fuel that otherwise will cause the propellants to \"boil off,\" turning into a gas that must be vented overboard.",
      "No orbit-class rockets have ever demonstrated the sort of rapid-fire launch cadence that will be required, or carried out the autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of cryogenic propellants from one rocket to another in the weightless environment of space amid extreme temperature swings.",
      "A single launch failure almost certainly would result in cancellation of a moon mission while an investigation ran its course. And an explosive failure in low-Earth orbit would result in a huge cloud of dangerous debris.",
      "Safely landing on the moon with a 16-story-tall rocket presents its own challenges, not least of which is the possibility of uneven terrain or loosely packed soil that could result in a tip over. And the astronauts will have to ride an external platform down to the surface 100 feet or so below the upper crew section.",
      "Most observers believe SpaceX will eventually overcome those hurdles. The question is, can the company do it in time for a 2027 moon landing? Or if not, will the rocket be ready to carry astronauts to the moon before the Chinese plant their own flag on the surface by the end of the decade?",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current HLS architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",

      "\"This is not the place for an ICE facility. This is not the place for a for-profit prison,\" Whitfield told CBS News.",
      "Mason experienced years of financial problems, including allegations of corruption and mismanagement more than a decade ago that left the town with a mountain of debt and few businesses left to help it bounce back.",
      "The West Tennessee Detention Facility has been closed for nearly four years. When it reopens, it has about 600 beds that could soon be filled with ICE detainees.",
      "The private for-profit prison company that owns it, CoreCivic, says the prison will create more than 200 new jobs and boost revenue for Mason and the state of Tennessee through hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes and impact fees, which are fees that developers pay to municipalities.",
      "That is why Mason Mayor Eddie Noeman says he supports the detention center. But town Alderwoman Virginia Rivers voted against it.",
      "\"I need it to be clear I am all for jobs coming to town of Mason,\" Rivers told CBS News. \"What I'm not for is when it comes to mistreating the people. All money is not good money.\"",
      "Immediately after taking office in January, President Trump reversed a policy instituted by former President Joe Biden in 2021 that prevented the Justice Department from renewing contracts with private prison firms. CoreCivic also owned the West Tennessee Detention Facility at the time and was forced to close it in 2021 because of Biden's executive order.",
      "In a statement on the reopening of the prison, CoreCivic said it was \"proud to continue our long-standing relationship within the Mason and Tipton County community, going back nearly 35 years,\" and adding that it did not \"have a timeline to share regarding when the facility will become operational.\"",
      "CoreCivic is the largest private, for-profit prison firm in the U.S., and the sole private prison operator in Tennessee. However, CoreCivic has repeatedly been found in Tennessee\u00a0state audits\u00a0to be deficient in staffing and turnover.",

      "The Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel, which has more than 650 locations in 44 states, saw a Wall Street revolt of sorts, as it lost a staggering nearly $100 million in market value after releasing the new logo, which was part of an ongoing effort to update its image by adding new menu items and redecorating its stores.",
      "\"Rather than just showing one person, we wanted to feature lots of people,\" the company said on its website of the new logo. \"The idea was to celebrate the diversity of all our guests with a logo that represented our continued passion for pleasing people of all races, colors, and genders.\"",
      "The move also drew criticism from customers and some conservative commentators, who saw the change as potentially politically motivated. Branding expert Nick Yeonakis told CBS News the original logo was a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",

      "A more aggressive gerrymander in Florida would launch another salvo in the political battle that has most recently seen GOP-controlled Texas and the Democratic-controlled California fight to enact new political maps.

      "\"[T]here are national conversations ongoing in other states related to midterm redistricting,\" Perez said in the memo. \"Exploring these questions now, at the mid-decade point, would potentially allow us to seek legal guidance from our Supreme Court without the uncertainty associated with deferring those questions until after the next decennial census and reapportionment.\"",
      "The select committee will hold its first meetings as early as the week of Oct. 6. The expectation among Florida lawmakers and GOP operatives in the state is that further debate and potential passage of a new congressional map would be added onto the docket for the Florida legislative session that begins in January 2026, though they say the situation is fluid and are waiting to see how the redistricting select committee operates.",
      "There are at most five Democratic Florida U.S. representatives whose districts would be targeted during a potential redraw, according to two Florida GOP operatives familiar with discussions among lawmakers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Lois Frankel, Jared Moskowitz and Frederica Wilson, as well as Rep. Darren Soto, in Orlando, could see their districts become more competitive by including more Republican-leaning areas, or be drawn into the same district to set up an intraparty primary.",
      "Florida Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat in South Florida, called the potential redraw \"a straight-up power grab, politicians picking their voters, instead of voters picking their representatives.\"",
      "\"The Republicans drew the damn maps, and now they want to come back and cut out Black Democrats and even Democrats who have worked across the aisle for their district,\" Jones said.",
      "Florida Atlantic University political science professor Kevin Wagner said there is substantial risk for the GOP in targeting Democratic seats and taking away reliably Republican voter bases away from strong GOP districts.",
      "\"It depends how much of a risk they wanna take. Because if you were in a +20 district towards your party, are you okay making it go +5 or +6? People get worried and they don't want to be in a non-safe district. It's a little more horse trading than people think,\" Wagner said.",
      "\"The assumptions from redrawing the maps is that voters are going to vote in the same magnitude and pattern that has existed previously. Sometimes that turns out to be true and sometimes it does not,\" he added.",
      "Calling for mid-decade census",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis supports a mid-decade redraw in his state, but he's also taken it a step further. In recent weeks he has repeated Mr. Trump's call for an early \"redo\" of the decennial Census count \u2014 in order to omit undocumented immigrants from the count \u2014 and claimed Florida's population has increased enough to be allocated another congressional seat.",
      "DeSantis claimed Florida's population was undercounted by about 700,000 people \u2014 and Florida's final population count just needed 100,000 to get an additional U.S. House seat.",
      "The Census Bureau revealed in 2022 there had been an undercount of 3.48% (over 756,000) for Florida.",
      "DeSantis said state Attorney General James Uthmeier will also make the argument to the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, for a new mid-decade census. Uthmeier sent a letter in July to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick calling for \"a corrected census to give Floridians the representation they deserve in Congress.\"",
      "\"It's not unusual that states complain that they've not got sufficient representation of their population. There are legitimate arguments about how we count, whether that is an accurate representation of the population,\" Wagner said.",
      "The Census Bureau has not announced any changes or plans for a corrected census to be completed by the 2026 midterm elections. The Constitution states the enumeration, or census count, will happen every ten years. One Census Bureau employee, given anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said it'd be logistically \"impossible\" to conduct a census and reallocate congressional seats in time for the 2026 midterms.",
      "CBS News has contacted the Commerce Department for comment regarding any plans to change the census timeline. Thus far, there have been no official announcements to do so.",
      "Generally, DeSantis does believe there is the political appetite in Tallahassee to redraw the state's congressional lines.",
      "\"Even if they don't do a new census, even if they don't revise the current Census, I still think it is appropriate to [redraw the lines],\" Desantis said during a press conference in Florida on August 11.",
      "\"I've spoken with some folks in the Florida Legislature, and I think that there's broad acknowledgement that this is something that is going to happen,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. financial markets edged higher on Tuesday, with investors shrugging off immediate concerns over President Trump's decision to\u00a0remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, an unprecedented move that analysts say could hinder the central bank's independence.",
      "The S&P 500 gained 26 points, or 0.4%, to close at 6,466, while the Dow Jones industrial Average climbed 135 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 95 points, or 0.5%.",
      "The muted reaction in the U.S. contrasted with sharp declines on global markets, as investors digested news of a potential Fed shakeup that could reshape the composition of the Board of Governors.",
      "Mr. Trump made his announcement in a letter posted on Truth Social on Monday evening, accusing Cook of mortgage fraud. The president said the move was \"effective immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was repeating allegations against Cook first leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. The senior housing official, who runs the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged earlier this week that Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "\"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday in the letter addressed to Cook. The president had previously\u00a0called\u00a0on the Fed official to resign.",
      "Cook responded to the Monday post with a statement saying that Mr. Trump has no authority to fire her and that she will not resign, setting up a potential legal showdown that will test the president's authority to fire a member of the central bank. Under the Federal Reserve Act, the president can only remove a Fed official \"for cause.\" Fed board members serve for 14-year terms.",
      "Mr. Trump \"purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022,\" Cook said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields were mixed, with longer-term yields rising and lower-term yields edging lower.",
      "While Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook could be a source of unease for investors, it did not appear to shake their faith in a September rate cut. Traders put the probability of a 0.25% rate cut at 90%, according to data from CME Group.",
      "Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management expects the Fed to lower rates by a total of 1 percentage point over the central bank's next four meetings.",
      "During a speech last week at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming economic forum Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled a rate cut\u00a0could be on the horizon. The Fed will \"proceed carefully,\" he said, but added that the shifting balance of risks \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:35:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Although unrelated, the Utah ruling comes amid redistricting issues throughout the country, most notably in Texas and California.",
    "story": [
      "A new move by a Utah judge ordering the Legislature to redraw its congressional maps is the latest turn in an ongoing saga over redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "And this latest development could help Democrats.",
      "Back in 2018, Utah voters narrowly passed a ballot measure known as Proposition 4. The effort focused on bringing about an independent redistricting commission while also putting in place \"requirements on the Legislature's redistricting process.\" At the same time, it also prohibited \"the commission or Legislature from favoring or disfavoring incumbent elected officials or from considering partisan political information,\" according to voter information documents from the state.",
      "At issue in the case decided Monday, according to court filings, was whether a bipartisan state law passed in 2020 had \"unconstitutionally impaired\" the voter-passed proposition.",
      "Utah Judge Dianna Gibson ruled against the Legislature Monday, writing in a decision that \"the Legislature is directed to design and enact a remedial congressional redistricting map in conformity with Proposition 4's mandatory redistricting standards and requirements.\" The latest ruling sets up a short window this fall to make changes, although it's unclear how appeals may impact that process and final deadline.",
      "Although it's unrelated, the ruling comes amid redistricting battles across the country that were jumpstarted by the GOP effort this summer to try and help President Trump by making it easier for Republicans to maintain control of the U.S. House for the final years of his second term.",
      "What could the Utah ruling mean for control of the U.S. House?",
      "Utah has four U.S. House seats, all of which are represented by Republicans. But during the 2018 midterms, voters in one Utah district narrowly\u00a0sent a Democrat to the House. The House Democrats' campaign arm immediately reacted to Monday's news about the ruling.",
      "\"In throwing out the current, gerrymandered congressional map, voters in Utah will now have an opportunity to elect leaders that best represent their values, and not have their representation dictated by politicians,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Suzan DelBene said in a statement.",
      "It remains to be seen how the redistricting back and forth between Republicans and Democrats will affect campaigns, but the GOP majority at the moment is incredibly narrow. If the same lines used in the 2024 election were used again, Democrats could gain control of the House by winning back as few as three seats in the 2026 midterms.",
      "Partisan tensions over congressional lines have been rising.",
      "Utah's senior GOP U.S. Sen. Mike Lee on Monday lambasted the court's decision, saying in a lengthy social media thread, \"This is a great day for Utah's Democrats\u2014who haven't controlled the Utah legislature in many, many decades (because most Utah voters don't like what the Democratic Party is selling), and have found a clever way to even the score by enlisting the help of their judicial allies.\"",
      "\"But it's a terrible day for everyone else\u2014and for the rule of law,\" Lee said.",
      "The case that led to Monday's ruling started long before this summer's national redistricting drama but is now a part of the discussion. Last week Texas Republicans followed through on a quest to please Mr. Trump by passing redrawn congressional lines that take five Democratic seats in the state and make them more favorable to Republicans.",
      "The GOP quest isn't limited to Texas, though. Republicans in Indiana and Missouri are also facing a push to redraw their maps, where smaller pickup opportunities of Democratic districts are possible if changes are made to favor Republicans.",
      "California Democrats, led Gov. Gavin Newsom, have responded by asking voters this fall to help redraw congressional lines in the state that would shift five GOP held seats and change them in ways that could help Democrats win some or all of them in next fall's midterms.",
      "The back and forth has made it more difficult to assess how the races for the House may play out next year. What's certain, however, is that the House is viewed by Democrats as their best chance at winning back power for the final two years of Mr. Trump's second term in Washington. And given how close the margin for control has been between Democrats and Republicans in the House in recent years, every winnable seat could make a difference.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith on Monday defended him in the face of an ethics probe into his actions investigating President Trump before the 2024 election, referring to the basis of the investigation as \"imaginary and unfounded.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Office of the Special Counsel \u2014 which is not affiliated with Smith's former position \u2014 launched a probe into Smith's handling of two criminal investigations into Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents and alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Monday's letter, a copy of which was obtained by CBS News, was the first response from Smith and his representatives after the independent federal agency confirmed that it had launched an investigation into Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act, a federal law that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees.\"",
      "In a three-page letter to the acting head of the office, Jamieson Greer, Smith's attorneys Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski, said there is \"no basis\" for an accusation that Smith violated the Hatch Act and that the allegations of wrongdoing are \"wholly without merit.\"",
      "\"Mr. Smith was fiercely committed to making prosecutorial decisions based solely on the evidence, he steadfastly followed applicable Department of Justice guidelines and the Principles of Federal Prosecution, and he did not let the pending election influence his investigative or prosecutorial decision-making,\" Smith's attorneys said.",
      "Smith was appointed by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to take over the two investigations, but resigned in January, days before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas called for an investigation into Smith's conduct and alleged that Smith had pushed for a \"rushed trial\" of Trump before the 2024 presidential election.",
      "\"They were the actions of a political actor masquerading as a public official,\" Cotton wrote on X. \"That's why I've asked this unprecedented interference in the 2024 election be immediately investigated by OSC.\"",
      "Smith's attorneys, however, argued that politics did not play a role in the prosecutions and that no laws prohibited Smith from continuing his prosecutions into Mr. Trump going into the home stretch of the campaign trail.",
      "\"This investigation is premised on a partisan complaint that suggests the ordinary operation of the criminal justice system should be disrupted by the whims of a political contest. But the notion that justice should yield to politics is antithetical to the rule of law,\" Smith's attorneys wrote. \"Moreover, the suggestion that the Hatch Act can be violated by taking routine procedural steps to prosecute a case involving a candidate for public office is unprecedented and risks interfering with the enforcement of our federal criminal laws.\"",
      "Smith's actions, the attorneys said, \"were consistent with the decisions of a prosecutor who has devoted his career to following the facts and the law, without fear or favor and without regard for the political consequences, not because of them.\"",
      "In May, Mr. Trump chose right-wing podcast host and MAGA loyalist Paul Ingrassia to lead the Office of Special Counsel, but his nomination is stalled in the Senate. Mr. Trump fired the former head of the office, Hampton Dellinger, in February.",
      "In addition to investigations into Smith, the investigators who worked with him have also been investigated or fired.",
      "At least 35 Justice Department employees who investigated President Trump and his allies have been fired since Mr. Trump took office, sources told CBS News, and the staffers were identified by the Justice Department's so-called \"weaponization working group,\" which Attorney General Pam Bondi established soon after she was confirmed.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday threw out the Trump administration's challenge to a standing order issued by a U.S. district court in Maryland that bars federal immigration officials from immediately removing migrants who are challenging the legality of their detentions.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen came in a novel and unprecedented lawsuit that the Trump administration filed against all 15 judges on the Maryland court in June. The Justice Department had argued that the standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell in May was unlawful and outside the authority of the court.",
      "The judges, represented by Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under former President George W. Bush, sought to dismiss the lawsuit. They argued that the suit presented a dispute between two co-equal branches of government that could not be decided by the courts.",
      "In a 37-page decision, Cullen agreed with the judges in finding that the Trump administration's challenge should be dismissed because, in part, the U.S. does not have the legal right to sue and the judges are absolute immune from the suit.",
      "\"Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,\" he wrote. \"The Executive's lawsuit will be dismissed, and its motion for preliminary injunction denied as moot. Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.\"",
      "Cullen said that if the Trump administration \"truly believes\" that the standing orders violate the law, it should pursue the paths laid out by Congress.",
      "\"Any fair reading of the legal authorities cited by Defendants leads to the ineluctable conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss,\" he wrote. \"To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.\"",
      "The Justice Department plans to appeal the decision.",
      "While the suit was filed in federal district court in Maryland, Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump to serve on the U.S. district court in Roanoke, Virginia, was assigned to preside over the case.",
      "Cullen's ruling was not a surprise. In a hearing earlier this month in Maryland, the judge previewed his decision, telling Justice Department attorneys that the \"far less destructive\" move by the Justice Department would be to appeal the standing order in one of the cases where it had been issued, rather than sue another branch of the government to \"accomplish its institutional interests.\"",
      "He echoed that position in his decision, writing that \"under normal circumstances,\" it would not be a surprise if the government raised its concerns about the legality of the standing order through the mechanisms laid out by Congress.",
      "\"But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times \u2014 at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,\" Cullen wrote. \"It's no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue \u2014 and in a big way.\"",
      "In a footnote in his decision, Cullen criticized the Trump administration's repeated attacks on members of the federal judiciary who have ruled against the president's agenda.",
      "\"Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,\" Cullen wrote.",
      "The standing order issued by Russell earlier this year prevents federal immigration officials from removing or altering the legal status of any migrant detainee who filed a habeas corpus petition for two business days.",
      "The court adopted the order to address the rise in migrants in Maryland who were at risk of imminent deportation from the U.S. and sought review of their detentions. Signed by Russell, the chief judge, the order states that it aims to \"preserve existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction\" of the Maryland district court over pending matters, ensure immigrant petitioners can participate in court proceedings and have access to legal counsel, and guarantee the government has a \"fulsome opportunity\" to present its defense.",
      "Among the judges named in the Trump administration's lawsuit was U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing the legal cases filed by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who has sued twice in the district over his March deportation and, most recently, confinement by immigration authorities. On Monday, Abrego Garcia filed a habeas petition challenging the legality of his detention by immigration officials. The court issued its standing order and temporarily blocked his immediate removal to a potential third-country, Uganda, where the Trump administration is attempting to send him.",

      "The Trump administration is reinstating a long-dormant practice of conducting \"neighborhood checks\" to vet immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship, expanding its efforts to aggressively scrutinize immigration applications, according to a government memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "The neighborhood checks would involve on-the-ground investigations by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that could include interviews with the neighbors and coworkers of citizenship applicants.",
      "The government investigations would be conducted to determine if applicants satisfy the requirements for American citizenship, which include showing good moral character, adhering to the U.S. Constitution and being \"well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.\"",
      "To qualify for American citizenship in the first place, applicants typically must have lived in the U.S. for three or five years as legal permanent residents. They must also not have any serious criminal records, and pass a civics and English test. The process is known as naturalization.",
      "The Trump administration's memo upends a decades-old U.S. government policy. While the neighborhood investigations for citizenship cases are outlined in U.S. law, they can also be waived, which the U.S. government has done since 1991, government records show. Since then, the government has relied mainly on background and criminal checks by the FBI to vet citizenship applicants.",
      "The USCIS memo immediately terminated the \"general waiver\" for neighborhood checks, directing officers to determine whether such investigations are warranted based on the information, or lack thereof, submitted by citizenship applicants. Officers retain the ability to waive the checks, according to the memo.",
      "The directive said USCIS officers will decide whether to carry out a neighborhood investigation by requesting and reviewing testimonial letters from neighbors, employers, coworkers and business associates who know the person applying for U.S. citizenship.",

      "Over several months, the second Trump administration has frozen the refugee admissions program, ended Biden-era policies that allowed some migrants to enter or stay in the U.S. legally and added additional layers of vetting for legal immigrants requesting immigration benefits like green cards and U.S. citizenship.",
      "In August alone, USCIS said it would more heavily scrutinize the \"good moral character\" requirement for U.S. citizenship and probe \"anti-American\" views and activities of those applying for green cards, work permits and other immigration benefits.",
      "The Trump administration has argued the changes are needed to combat fraud and shore up U.S. immigration procedures that it believes became too lax and generous under Democratic administrations.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 15:12:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers.",
    "story": [
      "California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way all three states are enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Trump's executive orders. He said the department was also already reviewing how states were enforcing the rules before the crash.",
      "Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can't demonstrate English proficiency and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash that killed three should not have ever been given a commercial driver's license because of his immigration status. But the crash has become increasingly political with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the Trump administration's immigration concerns in interviews.",
      "But Duffy said Tuesday that it is a safety issue \u2014 not a political one \u2014 because truckers need to understand road signs and be able to communicate with law enforcement about what they are hauling if they are pulled over or what happened if there is an accident.",
      "\"This is about keeping people safe on the road. Your families, your kids, your spouses, your loved ones, your friends. We all use the roadway, and we need to make sure that those who are driving big rigs \u2014 semis \u2014 can understand the road signs, that they've been well trained,\" Duffy said.",
      "Duffy says these states aren't enforcing the rules",
      "The Transportation Department said California has conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect requiring truck drivers be able to recognize and read road signs and communicate with authorities in English. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.",
      "He cited similar statistics for the other states with Washington finding more than 6,000 violations of safety rules during inspections, but only pulling four drivers out of service for English language violations. New Mexico has not placed any drivers out of service since the rules took effect.",
      "Duffy said the states will lose money from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program if they don't comply with the rules within 30 days. Duffy said California could lose $33 million, Washington could lose $10.5 million and New Mexico could lose $7 million.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office said on X that the Trump administration is just trying to deflect responsibility for the crash. The other two states did not immediately respond Tuesday.",
      "\"This is rich. The Trump Administration approved the federal work permit for the man who killed 3 people \u2014 and now they're scrambling to shift blame after getting caught. Sean's nonsense announcement is as big a joke as the Trump Administration itself,\" Newsom's office said.",
      "Florida crash killed three people",
      "Three people were killed when truck driver Harjinder Singh made an illegal U-turn on a highway, according to Florida's Highway Patrol. He is being held without bond after being charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations.",
      "A nearby minivan slammed into Singh's trailer as he made the turn on a highway about 50 miles north of West Palm Beach. Singh and his passenger were not injured.",
      "Diamond R. Litty, the elected public defender in St. Lucie County, said her office was provisionally assigned to Singh's case during his initial appearance Saturday morning. A review of his finances will determine whether Litty's office remains on the case.",
      "Litty said her office will focus on the criminal charges against Singh, who is presumed innocent, but they will also work with an immigration attorney to determine how Singh's status affects the case. After more than three decades at her position, Litty said she can't recall a case that garnered more attention than this one.",
      "\"Unfortunately, Mr. Singh has been caught in the crosshairs of politics,\" Litty said.",
      "But the head of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association trade group that represents small-business truck drivers praised Duffy's announcement.",
      "\"Basic English skills are critical for safely operating a commercial motor vehicle \u2014 reading road signs, following emergency instructions, and communicating with law enforcement are not optional. The fatal crash in Florida this month tragically illustrates what's at stake,\" the group's president, Todd Spencer, said.",
      "Federal officials say truck driver was in U.S. illegally",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said Singh, a native of India, was in the country illegally. So Duffy said he should not have been granted a commercial driver's licenses by Washington and California. He said New Mexico should have pulled Singh off the road for not speaking English after he was pulled over in July because he later failed a test given by DOT investigators after the Florida crash.",
      "California is one of 19 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, that issues licenses regardless of immigration status. Supporters say that lets people work, visit doctors and travel safely.",
      "But in addition, Newsom's office said California officials followed all the rules when it issued a license for Singh in July 2024 and at that time, the federal government confirmed he was in the country legally. Newsom has also said Singh obtained a work permit during Mr. Trump's first term, which Homeland Security officials disputed. Newsom also said the permit was renewed in April and federal officials have not addressed that.",
      "Florida authorities have said Singh entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that Singh should have never received a commercial driver's license.",
      "\"You're not allowed to issue a CDL to somebody who is not in this country legally. You're not allowed to issue a CDL to somebody who is not capable of understanding traffic signs,\" DeSantis said, calling the crash an \"avoidable tragedy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value Thursday after its stock plunged following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 million in its capitalization.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares gained in early trading Friday, but resumed their slide later in the day. The stock closed down 40 cents, or less than 1%, to $54.40. The shares fell again on Monday, sliding about 1% in late afternoon trading.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "In an updated statement released Monday, the company said the criticism has \"shown us that we could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\" Cracker Barrel added that it continues to serve \"generous portions of the food you crave at fair prices.\"",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",

    "summary": "In February 1942, part of the ceiling of a mine shaft collapsed, flooding the mine and killing the 183 workers inside.",
    "story": [
      "Police said Wednesday that a set of bones recovered at a wartime mine in Japan are human remains, and a Japanese group helping search for the remains said they are certain to belong to about 180 mostly Korean forced laborers who died in an accident in 1942.",
      "Police said their examination of the three bones and a skull found this week by Korean divers at the former site of the Chosei Mine in western Yamaguchi prefecture confirmed they are all human remains.",
      "But police said their analysis could not determine whether the three limb bones and skull belonged to the same person, their age or the timing of the death.",
      "The group, known as Kizamu Kai, said they are certain the remains belong to victims who died at the mine 83 years ago and that the discovery is a major boost in their efforts to recover other remains of the 136 Korean forced laborers and 47 Japanese workers killed in the mine collapse.",
      "\"I was waiting for this day,\" group representative Yoko Inoue said Tuesday after the bones were found.",
      "After initial attempts were unsuccessful, a June survey by the group confirmed a path to the spot where the remains were believed to be, the Japan Times reported.",
      "The recovery of the bones comes just days after a weekend summit in Tokyo between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung \u00a0showcasing friendly ties between the two countries to cooperate on major challenges, such as regional security and trade, while avoiding historical differences.",
      "The Chosei undersea mine started operations in 1914. In February 1942, part of the ceiling of a mine shaft collapsed, flooding the mine and killing the 183 workers inside. The accident had long been forgotten until a group of citizens started to investigate in 1991, initially to erect a memorial for the victims and preserve the former mining site, including the entrance and a ventilation shaft.",
      "Historians say Japan used hundreds of thousands of Korean laborers before and during World War II, including those forcibly brought from the Korean Peninsula, at Japanese mines and factories to make up for labor shortages because most working-age Japanese men had been sent to battlefronts across Asia and the Pacific.",
      "Following years of work collecting witness accounts and historical documents about the mine, the group started undersea searches for the victims' remains last year.",
      "Ishiba, who has acknowledged Japan's wartime aggression and has shown more sympathy toward Asian victims, gave a nod earlier this year for his government to hear from experts on how searches can be carried out safely.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi offered his condolences to all victims of the mine accident and said the government is following the police examination of the bones. He said the government has yet to obtain expertise on the safety of undersea searches for remains at the site.",
      "Kizamu Kai has gone ahead with the searches at the mine site on its own. The Japanese Health and Welfare Ministry, in charge of wartime remains, has been reluctant to help fund the searches.",
      "Critics say Japan's government has long been reticent to discuss wartime atrocities. That includes the sexual abuse and enslavement of Asian women - many of them Koreans known as \"comfort women\" - and Koreans mobilized and forced to work in Japan, especially in the final years of World War II.",
      "Japan's government has maintained that all wartime compensation issues between the two countries were resolved under a 1965 normalization treaty.",
      "Korean compensation demands for Japan's atrocities during its brutal colonial rule have repeatedly strained relations between the two Asian neighbors. But since 2023, their ties have improved under Washington's pressure to set aside differences that hamper crucial security cooperation as China's threat in the region grows.",
      "\"This year marks 80 years since the end of the war end and 60 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea,\" Yoko Inoue, the civic group's co-head,\u00a0told the Japan Times last month. \"To bring back even part of the remains would be of historic significance for our peaceful friendship with people on the Korean Peninsula.\"",

      "The strike was among the deadliest of several that have hit hospitals and journalists over the course of the 22-month war in Gaza, and it came as Israel plans to widen its offensive to heavily populated areas in the densely populated Palestinian territory.",
      "The first strike hit a top floor of a building at Nasser Hospital. Minutes later, as journalists and rescuers in orange vests rushed up an external staircase to reach the scene of the first blast, a second missile hit, said Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, head of Nasser's pediatrics department.",

The strikes came with no warning.\"",
      "The IDF, in its Tuesday statement, said Israeli forces, having identified the alleged surveillance camera, \"operated to remove the threat by striking and dismantling the camera and the inquiry showed that the troops operated to remove the threat.\"",

    "story": [
      "Banda Aceh, Indonesia\u00a0\u2014 Two men in Indonesia's conservative Aceh province were among a group of people publicly caned on Tuesday after an Islamic Shariah court convicted them of violating Islamic law by hugging and kissing, which the court ruled can lead to banned sexual relations.",
      "An audience of about 100 people witnessed the caning on a stage in Bustanussalatin city park in Banda Aceh on Tuesday. The men, aged 20 and 21, were whipped across their backs with a rattan cane dozens of times by a group of people wearing robes and hoods.",
      "Aceh allows up to 100 lashes for morality offenses including gay sex and sex between unmarried people. Caning is also a punishment in Aceh for gambling, drinking alcohol, women who wear tight clothes and men who do not attend Friday prayers.",
      "The court in Aceh sentenced the men to 80 strikes each after Islamic religious police said they caught them engaged in what the court deemed were the sexual acts of hugging and kissing in a bathroom of a public park, court records said.",
      "Eight other people were publicly caned Tuesday for adultery and gambling.",
      "The men were arrested in April at Taman Sari city park in Banda Aceh after residents told a police patrol they saw the men enter the same park bathroom. The police found the men inside kissing and hugging. Prior to meeting in the park, the pair made contact through an online dating app, court records said.",
      "Aceh is the only province in Indonesia to practice Shariah law. There have been four previous canings for cases related to homosexuality since the province implemented Islamic law and established a religious police and court system in 2006. The change was a concession by the national government to end a long-running separatist uprising.",
      "Indonesia's national criminal code does not regulate homosexuality but the central government cannot strike down Shariah law in Aceh. However, the central government previously pressured Aceh officials to drop an earlier version of a law calling for people to be stoned to death for adultery.",
      "Aceh expanded its Islamic bylaws and criminal code in 2015, extending Shariah law to non-Muslims, who account for about 1% of the province's population. The verdict against the two men caned on Tuesday was the fifth handed down against people for homosexuality since the law was implemented in 2015.",
      "Two other men were publicly caned in February at the same Aceh park after a Shariah court convicted them of having sex.",
      "A coalition of human rights groups filed a petition to Indonesia's Supreme Court in 2016 seeking a review of Aceh's regional regulations allowing caning, but the request was rejected. Indonesia's Ministry of Home Affairs issued a letter in 2016 to Aceh's governor about caning, noting regional laws in Indonesia should be enforced for minor crimes.",
      "Canning is a corporal punishment and Indonesia has ratified a convention mandating the abolition of inhumane punishments, said Maidina Rahmawati, acting executive director of the Institute for Criminal Justice Reform in Indonesia.",
      "\"That public caning, even the act of caning itself, is contrary to various laws and regulations and also contrary to human rights interests in Indonesia because its exposure is not good for Indonesia,\" Rahmawati said.",
      "Shifting political dynamics played a role in the implementation of the policy, Rahmawati said.",
      "\"Because it seemed like this was the right thing to do, it had to be done, it had to be narrated to support the Sharia-based government in Aceh,\" Rahmawati said.",
      "Amnesty International issued a statement Tuesday calling the caning of the two men \"a disturbing act of state-sanctioned discrimination and cruelty.\"",
      "\"This punishment is a horrifying reminder of the institutionalized stigma and abuse faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in Aceh. Intimate relationships between consenting adults should never be criminalized,\" Amnesty's Regional Research Director Montse Ferrer said in the statement.",
      "Aulia Saputra, a Banda Aceh resident who attended the caning, said the punishment may prevent other violations of Shariah law.",
      "\"I hope that with the implementation of this caning punishment, it can serve as a lesson for the offender and also create a deterrent effect, so that such incidents do not happen again in the future,\" Saputra said.",

      "Bay of Aarhus, Denmark\u00a0\u2014 Below the dark blue waters of the Bay of Aarhus in northern Denmark, archaeologists search for coastal settlements swallowed by rising sea levels more than 8,500 years ago.",
      "This summer, divers descended about 26 feet below the waves close to Aarhus, Denmark's second-biggest city, and collected evidence of a Stone Age settlement from the seabed.",
      "It's part of a $15.5 million six-year international project to map parts of the seabed in the Baltic and North Seas, funded by the European Union, that includes researchers in Aarhus as well as from the U.K.'s University of Bradford and the Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research in Germany.",
      "The goal is to explore sunken Northern European landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic settlements as offshore wind farms and other sea infrastructure expand.",
      "Most evidence of such settlements so far has been found at locations inland from the Stone Age coast, said underwater archaeologist Peter Moe Astrup, who's leading underwater excavations in Denmark.",
      "\"Here, we actually have an old coastline. We have a settlement that was positioned directly at the coastline,\" he said. \"What we actually try to find out here is how was life at a coastal settlement.\"",
      "After the last ice age, huge ice sheets melted and global sea levels rose, submerging Stone Age settlements and forcing the hunter-gatherer human population inland.",
      "About 8,500 years ago, sea levels rose by about 6.5 feet per century, Moe Astrup said.",
      "Moe Astrup and colleagues at the Moesgaard Museum in H\u00f8jbjerg, just outside Aarhus, have excavated an area of about 430 square feet at the small settlement they discovered just off today's coast.",
      "Early dives uncovered animal bones, stones tools, arrowheads, a seal tooth, and a small piece of worked wood, likely a simple tool. The researchers are combing the site meter by meter using a kind of underwater vacuum cleaner to collect material for future analysis.",
      "They hope further excavations will find harpoons, fishhooks or traces of fishing structures.",
      "\"It's like a time capsule,\" Moe Astrup said. \"When sea level rose, everything was preserved in an oxygen-free environment \u2026 time just stops.\"",
      "\"We find completely well-preserved wood,\" he added. \"We find hazelnut. ... Everything is well preserved.\"",
      "Excavations in the relatively calm and shallow Bay of Aarhus and dives off the coast of Germany will be followed by later work at two locations in the more inhospitable North Sea.",
      "The sea level rise thousands of years ago submerged, among other things, a vast area known as Doggerland that connected Britain with continental Europe and now lies underneath the southern North Sea.",
      "To build a picture of the rapid rise of the waters, Danish researchers are using dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.",
      "Submerged tree stumps preserved in mud and sediment can be dated precisely, revealing when rising tides drowned coastal forests.",
      "\"We can say very precisely when these trees died at the coastlines,\" Moesgaard Museum dendrochronologist Jonas Ogdal Jensen said as he peered at a section of Stone Age tree trunk through a microscope.",
      "\"That tells us something about how the sea level changed through time.\"",
      "As today's world faces rising sea levels driven by climate change, the researchers hope to shed light on how Stone Age societies adapted to shifting coastlines more than eight millennia ago.",
      "\"It's hard to answer exactly what it meant to people,\" Moe Astrup said. \"But it clearly had a huge impact in the long run because it completely changed the landscape.\"",
      "Sea levels rose by a global average of around 1.7 inches in the decade up to 2023.",
      "Denmark has seen several significant archaeological discoveries in recent years, including a metal detectorist's stunning find early last year of gold ring set with a red semi-precious stone that researchers hoped would shed light on the country's history during the early middle ages.",
      "Officials at the National Museum of Denmark announced that find after the centuries-old ring, believed to have been owned by a member of the royal family some 1,400 years ago, was transferred from a different museum nearer to the discovery site in the south, near the German border.",
      "That discovery came just weeks after archaeologists found a small knife inscribed with runic letters dated to the first or second century AD, or almost 2,000 years ago. It was the oldest trace of writing ever found in Denmark, according to the Museum Odense.",
      "Runes, or runic letters, are the oldest alphabet known to have been used in Scandinavia, having been in use for about 1,000 years until they were largely replaced by the Latin alphabet when Christians started spreading their belief system in the 10th century.",

      "Melbourne, Australia\u00a0\u2014 Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese accused Iran of organizing two antisemitic attacks in Australia and said the country was cutting off diplomatic relations with Tehran in response on Tuesday.",
      "The Australian Security Intelligence Organization concluded the Iranian government had directed arson attacks on the Lewis Continental Kitchen, a kosher food company, in Sydney in October last year and on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne in December last year, Albanese said.",
      "Iran's government denied the allegations.",
      "There has been a steep rise in antisemitic incidents in Sydney and Melbourne since the Israel-Hamas war began in 2023.",
      "Australian authorities have previously said they suspect that foreign actors are paying local criminals-for-hire to carry out attacks in the country.",
      "Police have already arrested at least one suspect in the Sydney cafe fire investigation and two suspects directly accused of torching the Melbourne synagogue.",
      "Sayed Mohammed Moosawi, a 32-year-old Sydney-based former chapter president of the Nomads biker gang, has been charged with directing the fire bombings of the Sydney caf\u00e9 as well as the nearby Curly Lewis Brewery. The brewery was apparently confused for the caf\u00e9 and mistakenly targeted three days earlier for an antisemitic attack.",
      "Giovanna Laulu, a 21-year-old man from Melbourne, was charged last month with being one of three masked arsonists who caused extensive damage to the synagogue in December.",
      "A second alleged arsonist, a 20-year-old man also from Melbourne, is expected to appear in court Wednesday, a police statement said. He has not been publicly named.",
      "\"ASIO has now gathered enough credible intelligence to reach a deeply disturbing conclusion,\" Albanese told reporters. \"The Iranian government directed at least two of these attacks. Iran has sought to disguise its involvement but ASIO assesses it was behind the attacks.",
      "\"These were extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil,\" he said. \"They were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow discord in our community. It is totally unacceptable.\"",
      "Shortly before the announcement, the Australian government told Iran's Ambassador to Australia Ahmad Sadeghi that he will be expelled. It also withdrew Australian diplomats posted in Iran to a third country, Albanese said.",
      "An alert to Australians in Iran noted the embassy's closure and urged them to \"strongly consider leaving as soon as possible, if it is safe to do so.\"",
      "\"Foreigners in Iran, including Australians and dual Australian-Iranian nationals, are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest,\" the warning read.",

      "Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has been accused of carrying out attacks abroad over the decades of its existence, though it broadly denies any involvement. The Guard's Quds, or Jerusalem, Force is its expeditionary arm and is accused by Western nations of using local militants and criminals in the past to target dissidents and Israelis abroad.",
      "The U.S., during the first Trump administration in 2019, formally designated the Guard a foreign terrorist organization, accusing it not only facilitating, but perpetrating terrorism.",
      "A spokesperson for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry welcomed the terrorist designation for the Revolutionary Guard, adding in a statement that the group was \"outraged\" that a foreign actor was behind the crimes.",
      "\"Foremost, these were attacks that deliberately targeted Jewish Australians, destroyed a sacred house of worship, caused millions of dollars of damage, and terrified our community,\" the statement said.",
      "Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Israel has arrested several people on charges they had been paid or encouraged by Iran to carry out vandalism and monitor potential targets there.",
      "Iran denied Australia's allegations through its Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei, who tried to link it to the challenges Australia faced with Israel after announcing it would recognize a Palestinian state.",
      "\"It looks like the action, which is against Iran, diplomacy and the relations between the two nations, is a compensation for the criticism that the Australians had against the Zionist regime,\" Baghaei claimed.",
      "The move against Iran came a week after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu branded Albanese a \"weak politician who had betrayed Israel\" by recognizing a Palestinian state.",
      "Netanyahu's extraordinary public rebuke on social media came after an Aug. 11 announcement by Albanese that his government's recognition of a Palestinian state will be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September. That announcement was followed by tit-for-tat cancellations of visas for Australian and Israeli officials.",
      "Albanese previously resisted calls to expel Iran's envoy to Canberra before, analysts said, including in 2024 when Sadeghi was summoned for meetings with foreign ministry officials over his social media posts.",

The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced Ukraine's cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media stories quoted Allen as saying he's always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine's Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said it \"strongly condemns\" Allen's participation in the festival, which \"brings together supporters and mouthpieces of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\"",
      "The ministry called it \"a disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\" adding that Allen \"is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchanges to continue.",
      "\"When it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\" Allen said. \"But, whatever politicians have done, I don't feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\"",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos.",
      "Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Kusturica has been open about his support of Putin, including after the invasion. He received an award from Putin and attended a military parade in Moscow earlier this year.",
      "Allen has long had an affinity for Russian literature and history. His 1975 comedy \"Love and Death\" spoofs the fiction of Tolstoy and other 19th century Russian novelists. The title of his 1989 release \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" echoes Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" and also broods over the themes of wrongdoing, justice and guilt.",
      "In the 1972 essay, \"A Brief Guide to Civil Disobedience,\" Allen jokes about the Russian Revolution, writing that the serfs rebelled when they \"finally realized that the Czar and the Tsar were the same person.\"",

    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 \u00a0Israel struck one of the main hospitals in the Gaza Strip with a missile Monday and then fired another as journalists and rescue workers rushed to the scene, killing at least 20 people and wounding scores more, local health workers in Hamas-run\u00a0Gaza\u00a0said. At least five journalists were among those killed, health officials and their employers said.",
      "It was among the deadliest of several Israeli strikes that have hit both hospitals and journalists over the course of the 22-month war sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack, and the attack came as Israel plans to widen its offensive to heavily populated areas.",
      "The first strike hit a top floor of a building at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. Minutes later, as journalists and rescuers in orange vests rushed up an external staircase, a second missile hit, said Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, head of Nasser's pediatrics department.",
      "Nasser Hospital, the largest in southern Gaza, has withstood raids and bombardment throughout 22 months of war, with officials citing critical shortages of supplies and staff.",
      "Asked about the strike and journalists being among the victims, the Israel Defense Forces issued a statement saying it had carried out an attack and adding that it would \"conduct an initial inquiry as soon as possible,\" adding that it regretted \"any harm to uninvolved individuals and does not target journalists as such.\"",
      "In a statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel \"deeply regrets the tragic mishap\" that occurred at the hospital in Gaza.",
      "\"Israel values the work of journalists, medical staff, and all civilians,\" the statement said. \"The military authorities are conducting a thorough investigation. Our war is with Hamas terrorists. Our just goals are defeating Hamas and bringing our hostages home.\"",
      "A hospital official initially told CBS News that four journalists were killed in the Monday morning double-tap strike at the hospital. The official identified the four as Hossam al-Masri, who worked for the Reuters news agency, Mohammed Salama, who worked for Al Jazeera, and freelance journalists Maryam Abu Daqqa  and Moaz Abu Taha.",
      "The Associated Press' news director for the Middle East, Jon Gambrell, said in a social media post that Abu Daqqa had \"freelanced for the AP since the Gaza war began.\"",
      "Reuters confirmed that al-Masri had worked for the international news agency. It said photographer Hatem Khaled, who also worked as a contractor for the agency, was wounded.",
      "Middle East Eye, a U.K.-based media outlet, later said one of its freelancers, Ahmad Abu Aziz, was also killed.",
      "At least one other journalist was wounded in the strike, a hospital official said, identifying the man as Haithem Omar, who also works for Reuters.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Monday that he was not aware of the strike on the hospital and he was not happy about it when he learned the news.",
      "\"When did this happen?\" Mr. Trump asked a reporter in the White House. \"I didn't know that. Well, I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it. At the same time, we have to end that whole nightmare.\"",
      "Israel has come under mounting pressure over the number of journalists being killed in its military operations in Gaza \u2014 including in targeted strikes against individuals whom Israeli officials claim were Hamas operatives.",
      "Israeli strikes and raids on hospitals are not uncommon. Multiple hospitals have been struck or raided across the Gaza Strip, with Israel claiming its attacks had targeted militants operating inside the medical facilities, without providing evidence.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, the Foreign Press Association, which represents journalists working in Israel and the Palestinian territories, said it was \"outraged and in shock\" over the latest killings of media workers.",
      "\"This is among the deadliest Israeli attacks on journalists working for international media since the Gaza war began,\" the organization said, confirming the identities of the four people killed. \"These strikes hit the exterior staircase of the hospital where journalists frequently stationed themselves with their cameras. The strikes came with no warning.\"",
      "The organization demanded an immediate explanation from the IDF and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office for the strike, adding: \"This has gone on far too long. Too many journalists in Gaza have been killed by Israel without justification. Israel continues to block international journalists from independent access to Gaza. This must be a watershed moment. We appeal to international leaders: do everything you can to protect our colleagues. We cannot do it ourselves.\"",
      "The international Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned the Israeli strike. In a statement, the group called on the international community \"to hold Israel accountable for its continued unlawful attacks on the press.\"",
      "\"Israel's broadcasted killing of journalists in #Gaza continues while the world watches and fails to act firmly on the most horrific attacks the press has ever faced in recent history,\" CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah said in the group's post. \"These murders must end now. The perpetrators must no longer be allowed to act with impunity.\"",
      "On August 11, Israel's military targeted and killed five Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza, including correspondent Anas al-Sharif. The Israel Defense Forces said it had intelligence and documents from Gaza to prove al-Sharif was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, and the IDF shared\u00a0undated\u00a0photos\u00a0of Al-Sharif with Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, who was\u00a0killed last October.",
      "CBS News could not verify the authenticity of the photos. Al Jazeera and al-Sharif had\u00a0previously dismissed\u00a0Israel's claims as baseless, The Associated Press reported. Just three weeks ago, al-Sharif had appealed to the Committee to Protect Journalists over fears he might be assassinated.",
      "A June strike on Nasser Hospital killed three people and wounded 10, according to the health ministry. At the time, Israel's military said it had targeted Hamas militants operating from a command and control center inside the hospital.",
      "The Hamas-run health ministry said Sunday that at least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and saw 251 others taken as hostages.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish in its figures between fighters and civilians, but it says around half of those killed have been women and children. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable information available on war casualties, as such figures are difficult to independently verify, as Israel does not permit foreign journalists into Gaza.",

And I think the sky's the limit and AI is a wonderful tool if used correctly, just like the telephone, the computer, everything else in life that we use every day now and take for granted, at one point in time, it was as frightening as AI is today.\"",

      "Carl Westcott \u2013 a U.S. Army veteran and the founder of 1-800-Flowers \u2013 filed a lawsuit in 2020 against Perry's business manager, Bernie Gudvi (who represented the \"Firework\" singer in the July 2020 purchase of the Santa Barbara-area mansion), after attempting to rescind the deal he made to sell his 8.9-acre estate to Perry for $15 million.",

      "In November 2023, Judge Joseph Lipner ruled that Gudvi was entitled to the sale of the Montecito home purchased on Perry's behalf in 2020. On May 17, 2024, Perry took legal ownership after the deed was recorded. She is seeking up to $4.8 million in damages, including an additional $2 million for damages to the property, citing structural defects, deferred maintenance and lost rental income.",
      "The non-jury trial was split into two parts by the judge. The damages phase took place last year and the penalty phase kicked off last week.",
      "During her testimony on Tuesday, Perry detailed how the outcome of the lawsuit might impact her.",

      "\"Yes,\" the singer, who appeared to be wearing a gray, button-down shirt, said.",
      "\"Please tell us what that financial stake is,\" Thomas asked.",

      "Ahead of her testimony, legal experts said Perry's testimony could prove to be a watershed moment in the case.",
      "Craig Weiner, partner in Blank Rome's business litigation group, stressed that Perry's credibility will be tested during her testimony.",
      "\"The impact of Katy\u2019s trial testimony will in large part rest on her credibility and ability to tell her side of the events in a clear and believable manner,\" Weiner told Fox News Digital. \"As a litigant and celebrity, she should expect that the judge as trier of fact will pay close attention to the matter and possibly ask their own questions.\"",
      "\"If she comes across as likable and truthful, her case will be helped. If she comes across as dislikable, not treating the tribunal with the proper respect, or not being truthful, she should expect that it will hurt her case.\"",

      "According to LA real estate lawyer and litigator Eileen Kendall, founder of Kendall Law, the non-jury aspect of the trial, as well as Perry's demeanor during her \"high-stakes\" testimony, will have a major impact on the judge's decision.",
      "\"Her testimony is high-stakes,\" Kendall told Fox News Digital. \"Generally, jury trials pose high reputational and financial risk; bench trials provide more control, predictability, and privacy. A non-jury trial puts the decision in the hands of a judge, not a panel of everyday jurors. That means less chance of emotion driving the outcome.\"",
      "Kendall added, \"For Perry, that avoids the risk of jurors siding with the 85-year-old veteran simply out of sympathy. It also saves time, money, and media drama. But without a jury, she loses the possibility that some jurors might be star-struck or hesitant to rule against a celebrity.\"",

      "But party leaders and officials, meeting in Martin's home state of Minnesota, are facing a multitude of problems as they try to escape the political wilderness.",
      "Democrats are aiming to rebound after last year's elections, when the party lost control of the White House and the Senate and fell short in their bid to win back the House majority. And Republicans made gains with voters who make up key parts of the Democratic Party's base.",

      "While Martin and other DNC officials preached unity, divisions flared on Tuesday as a key DNC panel considered two dueling resolutions on the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "The tension came as the DNC's Resolutions Committee voted down a symbolic resolution calling for an arms embargo and suspension of U.S. military aid to Israel, which has long been the top American ally in the Middle East.",

      "Martin's move was embraced by the committee.",
      "The showdown over the resolutions came as the Democratic Party's once nearly unshakable support for Israel has fractured amid the bloodshed. And concerns over the growing death toll among Palestinians by many in the party's progressive base have soared this spring and summer, amid what many describe as a famine in Gaza. Recent polling indicates support for Israel's continued military actions in Gaza is plummeting among Democrats.",
      "The Resolutions Committee passed a slew of resolutions, including unanimously approving one that affirmed what was called the \"'American Values' of diversity, equity, and inclusion.\" The party's support for DEI came amid relentless conservative backlash against such programs in recent years.",
      "Another resolution unanimously passed called for \"condemning the first 6 months of the Second Trump Administration.\"",

      "The policy, known as a standing order, requires court clerks in Maryland to automatically enter administrative pauses that last two business days in cases brought by alleged illegal immigrants who are challenging their detentions or removals.

      "6 ways you can stay safe from scammers targeting Google accounts",
      "Google accounts are often a prime target for scammers. The good news is that protecting yourself doesn't require advanced technical skills. A few practical steps can drastically reduce your chances of becoming a victim.",
      "Phishing remains the most common way scammers steal Google account credentials. A fake email or text may claim your account has been locked or that you need to verify suspicious activity. Clicking the link usually takes you to a counterfeit login page that looks almost identical to the real Google sign-in screen.",
      "To avoid falling for these tricks, check the sender's email address carefully, hover over links before clicking, and avoid entering your Google password on any page that doesn't start with accounts.google.com.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Reusing weak passwords across multiple sites is an open invitation for scammers. If one site is breached, your Google account becomes vulnerable. A strong, unique password is your first line of defense.",
      "The easiest way to manage this is with a password manager. It can generate complex passwords, store them securely, and fill them in automatically when you need them. This way, you never have to remember dozens of different logins, and attackers can't guess their way in.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET A PASSWORD RESET EMAIL YOU DIDN\u2019T ASK FOR",
      "Scammers often use information they find online to craft convincing attacks. If your email address, phone number, or even past passwords are floating around on data broker sites, criminals have more tools to impersonate you or trick you into revealing more.",
      "Using a data removal service helps clean up your digital footprint. By reducing the amount of exposed information about you, it becomes much harder for scammers to target you directly.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even the strongest password can be stolen, but\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra barrier. When enabled, Google will ask for a one-time code or prompt on your phone before granting access. That means even if a scammer manages to get your password, they can't log in without also having your device.",
      "Google offers several 2FA methods, from SMS codes to app-based prompts and even hardware security keys. For the best protection, choose app-based or hardware verification rather than text messages.",
      "Many scams rely on exploiting outdated software. If your phone, browser, or operating system isn't up to date, attackers may use known vulnerabilities to install malware or hijack your session.",
      "Set your devices to\u00a0update automatically whenever possible. This ensures you're always running the latest security patches, reducing the number of openings a scammer can use.",
      "Google provides built-in tools to help users spot suspicious activity. By visiting your Google Account's security page, you can see devices that have signed in, recent account activity, and whether recovery options like your phone number and backup email are up to date.",
      "Running a Google Security Checkup only takes a few minutes and gives you a clear overview of any weaknesses. Think of it as a health check for your digital life.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The incident is a reminder that even tech giants with vast resources are not immune to security lapses. While Google insists that no passwords were exposed, the wave of phishing and vishing scams shows how quickly criminals can weaponize even partial leaks. What began as a breach of business data has spiraled into a threat facing millions of everyday users, raising questions about how secure Google's ecosystem really is.",

      "Google's Pixel 10 lineup is the heart of this year's Made by Google event. With the Tensor G5 chip, brighter displays, and new AI-powered camera tools, the series delivers meaningful upgrades for everyday users. Here's what each model brings and why it matters.",

      "The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL models push Pixel photography even further. They introduce Pro Res Zoom up to 100x, powered by generative AI on the Tensor G5 chip. That means close-up shots with detail you'd normally need a DSLR to capture.",
      "Both the Pro (6.3-inch) and Pro XL (6.8-inch) feature Google's brightest Super Actua displays, larger batteries, and up to 16 GB of RAM for faster performance. These phones are made for power users who want the very best in cameras, speed, and AI tools.",
      "A Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold display is shown. (Google)",
      "The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is Google's most durable foldable yet, designed for people who want a phone that doubles as a tablet. With an upgraded gearless hinge, IP68 water and dust resistance, and a larger battery, it's built to last years of folding and unfolding.",

      "The Pixel 10, Pro, Pro XL, and Pro Fold all run on the brand-new Tensor\u202fG5 chip, which Google calls its most significant upgrade to date. The chip is made by TSMC using a 3nm process, delivering faster, more efficient on-device AI performance with Gemini Nano at its core. Across the entire lineup, Google made thoughtful design upgrades. The iconic camera bar has been refined, the bodies use more recycled materials, and the colors are elegant and modern. Choices include Indigo, Frost, and Lemongrass on Pixel 10, and Moonstone, Jade, Obsidian, and Porcelain on the Pro models.",

With a fresh design, better sound, and smarter connectivity, these buds bring everyday value to anyone who wants high performance without breaking the bank.",
      "Pixel Buds 2a are smaller and lighter than the earlier A-series, making them comfortable enough to wear all day. Inspired by the Pixel Buds Pro 2, they include a twist-to-adjust stabilizer and four different eartips so you can find the perfect fit. With an IP54 sweat and water resistance rating, you don't have to worry about rain or workouts. The buds also come in two stylish colors, iris and hazel, designed to complement other Pixel devices.",
      "At the heart of Pixel Buds 2a is the Tensor A1 chip, built specifically for audio. This brings Active Noise Cancellation with Silent Seal 1.5, a first for Google's A-series. A custom speaker driver and new high-frequency chamber enhance music and podcast quality. Wind-blocking mesh covers and Google AI improve call clarity, so your voice sounds crisp on the other end.",
      "Battery life also gets a boost. You'll enjoy 7 hours on a single charge with ANC on, and up to 20 hours with the charging case. With ANC off, you get nearly double the listening time compared to the first-generation A-series. For the first time, the case itself includes a replaceable battery, making the buds more durable and sustainable.",
      "Pixel Buds 2a work as more than headphones; they're also your AI companion. With Gemini built in, you can get quick answers, check messages, or even ask for coffee shop recommendations on the go. Just say \"Hey Google\" or customize the press-and-hold gesture for instant help.",

      "A Pixel Watch 4 is seen with a pink wristband and display. (Google)",
      "The Pixel Watch 4 is Google's biggest smartwatch upgrade yet. It keeps the iconic round look but introduces a domed Actua 360 display that's brighter, larger, and easier to see, even in direct sunlight. The screen is 50% brighter, the bezels are smaller, and everything feels more fluid thanks to new animations and stronger haptics. Simply put, it looks better and feels more responsive on your wrist.",
      "Battery life has always been a concern for smartwatches. Google addressed it with a 25% boost. The 41mm model now lasts up to 30 hours, while the 45mm model stretches to 40 hours. With Battery Saver mode, you can extend usage to two or even three days. Plus, the new Quick Charge Dock takes you from 0 to 50% in just 15 minutes, making it easier to power up before you head out.",
      "One of the most groundbreaking features is standalone satellite connectivity. Pixel Watch 4 LTE is the first smartwatch that can dial emergency services even when you're off the grid. Whether you're hiking, camping, or driving in remote areas, the watch can connect to geo-stationary satellites and get help when you need it most. That's peace of mind you can actually wear.",
      "Health remains a core focus. Pixel Watch 4 adds more accurate sleep tracking, enhanced skin temperature sensing, and dual-frequency GPS for precise route logging in tough environments. Cyclists will love the new real-time bike stats, while fitness fans get 50+ exercise modes, including pickleball and basketball. Even if you forget to start a workout, the watch's AI now auto-detects and logs your activity.",
      "With Gemini AI built in, the Pixel Watch 4 goes beyond tracking; it coaches. A new personal AI health coach gives proactive fitness and sleep advice tailored to your goals. It's like having a trainer and wellness guide on your wrist, available anytime. A preview of this feature arrives in October through the Fitbit app, opening the door to personalized, AI-driven health support.",
      "WWDC 2025: IOS 26, LIQUID GLASS DESIGN AND APPLE\u2019S AI SHORTFALL",
      "The Pixel Watch 4 isn't just about health. With Gemini on your wrist, you can get answers or complete tasks hands-free. Raise your wrist to talk, respond to messages with smart replies, or control your day without pulling out your phone. It's designed for those busy, in-between moments, when your hands are full but you still need help.",
      "The Pixel Watch 4 is available for\u00a0preorder now. It launches Oct. 9 with pricing starting at\u00a0$349 for Wi-Fi and\u00a0$449 for LTE in the 41mm size, and\u00a0$399 for Wi-Fi and\u00a0$499 for LTE in the 45mm size.

      "Pixelsnap and Qi2 Charging: Magnetic power made simple",
      "A Pixelsnap Charger, Pixelsnap Ring Stand and the Pixel Flex 67W Dual USB-C fast charger are showcased. (Google)",
      "The Pixel 10 series is the first major Android lineup to fully embrace Qi2 magnetic charging. Think of it as Google's answer to MagSafe, only it works with a wider range of devices. Qi2 improves on the old Qi standard by adding magnets, so your phone snaps perfectly into place every time. No more fiddling with alignment, charging is instant and reliable.",
      "This upgrade matters because it unlocks a full ecosystem of Pixelsnap accessories, built to make charging and everyday use easier. And since Qi2 is a universal standard, you're not limited to Google's products; you can also use MagSafe accessories with your Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.",
      "The Pixelsnap Charger comes as a simple puck or bundled with a sleek stand. It charges the Pixel 10 Pro XL at up to 25W and other Qi2-certified devices at 15W. The stand looks elegant on a desk or nightstand, and the puck detaches for charging on the go. If you own a Pixel 10 Pro Fold, the stand even supports charging while unfolded, letting you stream, video call, or display widgets on the big screen as your phone powers up.",
      "Need hands-free viewing? The Pixelsnap Ring Stand snaps onto the back of your phone for propping it up. It rotates smoothly thanks to a microfiber liner, making it easy to find the perfect angle for movies or video calls. Slim enough to slip into a pocket or purse, it adds function without adding bulk.",
      "Google designed its new Pixel 10 cases to be Pixelsnap-ready. That means you can attach chargers or accessories without ever removing the case. Available in colors like Moonstone, Jade, Obsidian, Porcelain, Indigo, Frost, and Lemongrass, they not only protect your phone but also match the refreshed Pixel 10 design.",
      "If you prefer wired charging, Google also introduced the Pixel Flex Dual Port 67W charger. It's the fastest dual-port charger yet for Pixel phones. Thanks to a custom algorithm, it prioritizes charging your Pixel first while still powering a second device. Compact with foldable prongs, it's designed to travel as easily as you do.",
      "All Pixelsnap products and the\u00a0Pixel 10 series are available for\u00a0preorder now, with retail availability starting\u00a0August 28.",
      "AI Features: Magic Cue, Camera Coach, and more",
      "An image of the Tensor G5 chip is seen. (Google)",
      "Google made it clear at the 2025 Made by Google event that AI is now at the heart of the Pixel experience. With the Tensor G5 chip and Gemini Nano, Pixel 10 phones deliver more than speed-they anticipate what you need and help you get it done.",
      "The new Magic Cue acts like a personal assistant inside your phone. It proactively pulls information you need at just the right time. For example, if you're on the phone with an airline, it can instantly display your flight details from Gmail. When you're in a group chat, it can surface photos or addresses without making you dig. And because all of this happens on-device, your personal data stays private.",
      "Pixel cameras are known for their quality, but Camera Coach takes it further. Using Gemini AI, it gives real-time tips to improve your photos. It might suggest a different angle, a tighter frame, or a better composition. For beginners, it's a helpful teacher. For experienced photographers, it's like having a second set of creative eyes right in your pocket.",
      "Features like Best Take automatically select the sharpest face from a series of photos, making group shots easier than ever. Meanwhile, Pro Res Zoom, exclusive to Pixel 10 Pro models, uses a generative AI imaging model to deliver astonishing detail up to 100x zoom. It's not just cropping in, it's rebuilding and refining the image to look crisp.",
      "Beyond photography, Google packed the Pixel 10 with over 20 generative AI tools that work directly on the device. They help with editing, writing, and even composing replies in your favorite apps. The goal is simple: make the phone feel less like a tool and more like a helpful companion that adapts to your needs.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Google just staged one of its most memorable launches yet. With Fallon, Curry, Norris, and the Jonas Brothers front and center, the event blended entertainment and innovation. That energy carried through to the devices, which brought Google's boldest AI, camera, and ecosystem upgrades so far. Each product offered clear value. The Tensor G5 chip and Gemini Nano AI make everything faster and more efficient. The Pixel 10 phones push photography and performance further than before. Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 4 adds health coaching and even satellite emergency support. The Pixel Buds 2a also pack premium sound and smart features at a budget price. In addition, Pixelsnap accessories make charging simple and stylish. Finally, Google's promise of seven years of updates sets this lineup apart.

    "story": [
      "Fox News chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on President Donald Trump's goal to put a nuclear reactor on the moon on 'Special Report.'",
      "A Harvard physicist who sounded the alarm earlier this month about a rare interstellar object passing through our solar system \u2014 suggesting it might be more than a comet \u2014 now says it could even be a nuclear-powered spaceship.",
      "The object, 3I/ATLAS, was first detected in early July by an Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. It marks only the third time an interstellar object has been observed entering our solar system, according to NASA.",
      "While NASA classified the object as a comet, Dr. Avi Loeb pointed out that an image showed an unexpected glow in front of the object rather than trailing behind it, something he called \"quite surprising.\"",

      "\"Alternatively, 3I/ATLAS could be a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy, and the dust emitted from its frontal surface might be from dirt that accumulated on its surface during its interstellar travel,\" Loeb wrote. \"This cannot be ruled out, but requires better evidence to be viable.\"",
      "Loeb dismissed other natural power sources. A primordial black hole, he said, would generate only about 20 nanowatts \u2014 far too weak. A radioactive fragment from a supernova was highly unlikely given its rarity, and frictional heating from interstellar gas and dust was ruled out by momentum and density constraints.",

      "A new report by The Wall Street Journal is warning people to think twice before trusting the 'unsubscribe' option at the bottom of promotional emails.",
      "Over the past year, more people have reported receiving order shipment emails for purchases they never made. These messages usually come from legitimate retailers, often sportswear brands or electronics stores, and contain real tracking numbers and delivery details. The products are being shipped to different names at different addresses, but for some reason, the buyer's contact email is yours.",
      "It might seem like a harmless clerical error or someone accidentally typing the wrong email address. But when it happens repeatedly, and across multiple unrelated orders, it starts to look less like a coincidence and more like a tactic.",

      "HOW TO DETECT FAKE AMAZON EMAILS AND AVOID IMPERSONATION SCAMS",

      "Some scammers use valid, active email addresses to bypass retailer fraud filters. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's likely happening with those shipment emails in your inbox",
      "It is unlikely that someone is accidentally typing your email address every single time. Rather, scammers are deliberately using valid, active email addresses like yours to bypass retailer fraud filters. Numerous sources confirm that fake order and shipping confirmation emails are a common tactic in fraud operations, with criminals exploiting the trust systems placed in legitimate email addresses.",
      "When a stolen credit card is used, pairing it with a real email that has not triggered spam alerts increases the chance the transaction will go unnoticed by anti-fraud systems. Retailers often check whether an email address is active or bounces. If the system sees a functioning address, it may be less suspicious than an obviously fake one.",
      "Once the order is placed, products are frequently sent to drop addresses or freight-forwarding services, as confirmed by official investigations into brushing scams. These services act as intermediaries, making the scam harder to trace. In that context, your email is simply a means to an end, a validated contact point that helps the operation move forward smoothly.",
      "Scammers can obtain email addresses when reputable companies experience data breaches. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How bad actors are able to get your email",
      "Your email address may have ended up in the hands of scammers through several common methods. The most likely cause is a data breach. Many well-known companies have\u00a0experienced leaks in which customer emails and other information were exposed.",
      "Once your email is part of a leaked database, it often circulates on the dark web or in underground forums, where it is freely traded and reused. Even if you were not part of a breach, scammers often use a technique called credential stuffing. This involves testing stolen login details across different websites to confirm which email addresses are active.",
      "REMOVE YOUR DATA TO PROTECT YOUR RETIREMENT FROM SCAMMERS",
      "The best thing you can do to prevent this from happening is to invest in a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Start by locking down your email account with a strong, unique password that you don\u2019t reuse anywhere else.

Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Scan your inbox regularly for order confirmations, shipping notices or account sign-ups you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it directly to the retailer or platform; it could be part of a larger scam using your email address. Never click on suspicious links, even if the message looks legitimate, and protect your devices with strong antivirus software to catch threats before they spread.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Avoid entering your email on shady giveaway sites or sketchy online forms. When in doubt, skip the sign-up or use a throwaway email. The fewer places your email lives, the harder it is for scammers to get hold of it.",
      "Set up a dedicated email for online purchases, newsletters and subscriptions. This helps keep your main inbox clean and makes it easier to spot strange activity. Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0 An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",

      "HOW TO TELL IF A LOGIN ALERT IS REAL OR A SCAM",
      "Even if no purchases appear under your name, scams involving your email can be a red flag for future identity misuse. Set up alerts with your bank and consider a credit monitoring service to catch unauthorized activity early.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",
      "In your email settings (e.g., Gmail, Outlook), check for any connected apps, services or delegated access you don't recognize and remove them. This ensures no third party is piggybacking off your account.",
      "If this email misuse leads to fraudulent financial activity, users should file a report with the FTC at IdentityTheft.gov or their local authorities.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If you are receiving order confirmations for things you never bought, do not shrug it off. Your email is likely being misused as part of a larger fraud operation, not by accident but intentionally. Scammers are taking advantage of active, trustworthy email addresses to slip past retailer defenses and carry out unauthorized purchases. The repeated use of your email shows that fraud networks are already circulating it, even if your financial information remains untouched.",

      "Surgeries may become safer and more precise than ever before.",
      "A new brain implant now lets people control Apple devices, such as iPads, iPhones and the Vision Pro, using only their thoughts. Synchron, an endovascular brain-computer interface (BCI) company based in New York, demonstrated the first wireless BCI that works with Apple's official protocol.",
      "Ten patients have received the implant: six in the U.S. and four in Australia. With this technology, users living with severe paralysis can navigate apps, send messages and operate devices hands-free. This breakthrough greatly expands independence, as it enables patients to manage their environment, stream shows and control smart home devices, all using only their minds.",
      "Synchron's advancement in BCI technology marks a significant step for assistive devices and hints at how we may interact with computers in the future. The device's hands-free, voice-free operation offers a powerful new level of accessibility and autonomy for people with disabilities.",

      "ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface (BCI) working with an iPad. (Synchron)",
      "A first for brain-tech and Apple",
      "Synchron is the first company to connect a brain implant directly to Apple devices using Apple's official BCI Human Interface Device (HID) protocol. This means no custom hacks or workarounds. The system simply connects over Bluetooth, just like a keyboard or a mouse, and works with iPhones, iPads, and even the Apple Vision Pro. In a powerful video shared by Synchron, ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates the tech in action. After losing the use of his hands, he's now able to navigate his iPad entirely with thought. That includes opening apps, composing messages, and staying connected with the people he loves-all without moving a muscle.",
      "Behind the scenes, Synchron's system uses artificial intelligence to decode brain signals and turn them into real-time digital commands. Machine learning models interpret motor intent, such as thinking about tapping your finger, and translate that into actions on the iPad. This AI-powered decoding helps the system feel smooth and responsive as users learn to control it with focus alone.",
      "Synchron's brain-computer interface is seen up close. (Synchron)",
      "The game-changing signal strength meter",
      "One surprising new feature is the built-in signal strength meter. This visual cue shows patients how strong their brain signal is in real time. A blue box appears over an icon or app and fills up based on how clearly the system reads the user's intent. It may sound simple, but this is a huge deal. It helps users like Mark fine-tune their mental focus, adjust their posture, and improve their interaction without outside help. It's like seeing your brain in action and learning to drive it better.\u00a0\"When I lost the use of my hands, I thought I had lost my independence,\" Mark says in the video.\u00a0\"Now, with my iPad, I can message my loved ones, read the news, and stay connected with the world, just by thinking.\"",

      "Mark Jackson operates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface, which functions using Apple's official protocol. (Synchron)",
      "What sets Synchron apart",
      "BCIs like Synchron's Stentrode and Elon Musk's\u00a0Neuralink have connected to devices before, but never like this. Previous setups required custom software or physical adapters. Now, thanks to Apple's new BCI HID protocol, brain-computer interfaces can plug right into the Apple ecosystem like any other accessory. That official integration opens the door to more features, better performance, and fewer setup hurdles. Synchron's COO, Kurt Haggstrom, calls it a\u00a0\"game changer\" for both patients and the entire BCI industry.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This tech isn't just for people with paralysis, at least, not forever. Today, it's a medical tool undergoing trials. Tomorrow, it could become a consumer product you buy at your local Apple Store. With Apple embracing BCI as a legitimate input method, everything from your phone to your smart home could one day be controllable by thought. That opens the door for more accessibility, more customization, and completely new ways of interacting with technology.",

      "Falls are the number one cause of injury among adults 65 and older. But the truth is, your risk doesn't suddenly appear the day you turn 65. It increases gradually over time, especially if you're dealing with weak muscles, balance issues, side effects from medication, or even just forgetting a pill. Experts recommend that everyone get screened for fall risk at age 65. But you don't have to wait for a doctor's visit to take action. A new wave of technology is giving older adults the power to track, prevent, and respond to fall risks, all from home. Here are 10 smart tools that can help.",

      "New technology can help track and prevent falls. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "1) Gait sensors track how your balance changes over time",
      "Your walking pattern can reveal subtle issues that increase your risk of falling. If you use an iPhone with iOS 15 or newer, the built-in walking steadiness feature in the Health app can rate your balance as OK, low, or very low over time. Android users can use wearable fitness trackers like\u00a0Fitbit, or Samsung Galaxy Watch to gather similar data. These tools track stride, stability, and pressure patterns that help identify balance changes before you feel unsteady.",
      "FORGET 10,000 STEPS \u2014 RESEARCH REVEALS THE REAL NUMBER YOU NEED FOR BETTER HEALTH",
      "What to check:\u00a0On iPhone, open the Health app and review your walking steadiness trends. Android users can check their wearable app dashboards, like Samsung Health or Fitbit, to view step symmetry, cadence, and gait-related data. Look for any changes over weeks or months and take advantage of in-app exercise suggestions to improve balance and strength.",
      "Apps that track physical activity and walking patterns can help users improve their balance and strength, or even detect a change in gait before it becomes an issue. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "2) Smart pill dispensers prevent risky mistakes",
      "Forgetting to take medication, or taking too much, can cause grogginess or dizziness that increases fall risk. A smart pill dispenser helps make sure you take the right dose at the right time.",
      "What to look for: Look for dispensers with reminders, dose tracking, and alerts for missed meds.",
      "Smart pill dispensers can assist patients in making sure they take the correct dose of the desired medication at the right time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Fitness trackers keep you motivated to move",
      "Building strength, especially in your legs and core, is one of the best ways to prevent falls. Whether you use an\u00a0Apple Watch, Fitbit or another device, fitness trackers can nudge you toward daily movement goals.",
      "What to check:\u00a0Track your cardio fitness levels, not just step counts. It's a good indicator of your overall strength and endurance.",
      "Fitness tracking devices can help users build strength and resilience. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Vital-sign monitors help detect lightheaded spells",
      "Dips in blood pressure or oxygen levels can make you feel woozy, which increases your fall risk.\u00a0Smartwatches and fingertip pulse oximeters help you monitor these changes in real time.",
      "What to check:\u00a0If you're not using a wearable, jot down your daily readings with a standard cuff or oximeter to spot any unusual trends.",
      "5) Motion-activated lighting lights the way",
      "Getting up in the middle of the night without enough light is a common recipe for a fall. Motion-activated lights can illuminate your path without you needing to touch a switch.",
      "What to look for: Try plug-in nightlights that turn on when they sense motion, or during a power outage. Some even double as portable flashlights.",

      "What to look for:\u00a0Choose ones that send alerts to your phone. You'll avoid a fall and possibly a pricey repair bill.",
      "7) Doorbell cameras keep you from rushing",
      "One overlooked fall trigger is rushing to answer the door. A\u00a0doorbell camera lets you see who's there and speak to them, so you can take your time or decide not to answer at all.",

      "8) Fall-detection devices can call for help",
      "Even the most independent older adults face higher fall risks, and family members who live far away may worry more than they let on. If a fall happens and you're alone, getting help quickly is essential. Wearables like the\u00a0Apple Watch can detect a hard fall and automatically alert emergency services or your emergency contacts.\u00a0Apple Watch SE, Series 4 or later, and Apple Watch Ultra include fall detection. If a hard fall is detected, the watch vibrates, sounds an alarm, and gives the option to call emergency services.",

By using smart tech, you can spot early warning signs, make smarter choices, and stay in control of your health, on your own terms.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Getting older doesn't mean giving up your independence. In fact, the right technology can help extend it. Whether it's a\u00a0smartwatch that alerts family during a fall or a simple nightlight that turns on automatically, every tool you use can add peace of mind.

    "summary": "Immigration attorney Peter Lumaj explains how sophisticated smuggling operations adapt to enforcement changes along U.S.-Canada border crossings.",
    "story": [
      "Immigration attorney Peter Lumaj tells Fox News Digital that smugglers are becoming increasingly sophisticated at exploiting the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "Canadian authorities intercepted a U-Haul truck packed with 44 migrants near the Vermont border on Aug. 3, as human smuggling networks grow in sophistication along the United States' northern frontier.",
      "That case, now under investigation as a suspected human trafficking operation, captures a dangerous shift in smuggling routes as pressure mounts along the southern border.",
      "Immigration attorney and former Connecticut Senate candidate Peter Lumaj, who has practiced immigration law for decades, told Fox News Digital that smugglers are constantly adapting to changes in U.S. enforcement.",
      "\"The smugglers are very sophisticated. They are able to read what\u2019s happening in a certain country, whether it\u2019s the United States, Canada, or Mexico,\" he said.",
      "YOUNGKIN CREDITS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WITH BOLSTERING ANTI-HUMAN TRAFFICKING EFFORTS",
      "Migrants are seen crossing the northern border.\u00a0 (Customs and Border Protection)",
      "Smuggling along the northern border is not new, but the direction of movement has changed. Lumaj noted that while the flow used to be largely from Canada into the U.S., in recent years there has also been a surge of migrants attempting to cross into Canada from the U.S. to avoid deportation to their home countries.",
      "Migrants are spotted crossing the northern U.S. border.\u00a0 (Customs and Border Protection)",
      "The sanctuary city factor",
      "Another factor complicating enforcement is state and local sanctuary policies. Lumaj pointed to his home state of Connecticut, where officials recently expanded protections for illegal immigrants.",
      "\"There are almost 1,200 detainees in Connecticut right now whose holds are not being respected by state leaders,\" he said. \"That violates federal law and the Constitution\u2019s supremacy clause. When states reward illegal immigration with driver\u2019s licenses, in-state tuition, and sanctuary protections, it entices more migrants to come.\"",

      "Lumaj warned that such policies not only undermine federal law enforcement but also create \"shopping grounds\" for migrants seeking the most favorable environments after crossing the border.",
      "\"Every state has become a border state,\" he said. \"When millions come in, they\u2019re going to look for where they get the greatest benefits. The smugglers know this, the traffickers know this, and they\u2019re taking advantage of the chaos.\"",
      "ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS STORM US BEACHES AS COAST GUARD BATTLES MIGRANT SURGE THAT ROSE UNDER BIDEN",
      "Who is being smuggled?",
      "According to Lumaj, smuggling rings often target single men, typically aged 18 to 35, who can physically endure the treacherous crossings.",
      "\"I have personally handled cases where people were abandoned in the middle of nowhere, on the verge of losing their lives, before they stumbled into Border Patrol officers begging for help,\" Lumaj said. \"Smugglers have no mercy. It\u2019s about money.\"",
      "Smuggling groups have tapped into GPS tracking and social media channels to coordinate routes to evade border patrols. As Fox News Digital has previously reported, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook have all been used to lure desperate migrants with promises of safe passage.",
      "Migrants cross the northern border between Canada and the United States. (Customs and Border Protection)",
      "The difference between smuggling and trafficking, Lumaj said, is exploitation.",
      "\"Usually, people who want to be smuggled into the United States or Canada, they approach the smuggler, whereas traffickers are very good at sort of identifying the person that they want to traffic,\" he said.",
      "Lumaj described cases where underage girls were promised jobs as babysitters, au pairs or models, only to end up trapped in coercive sex trafficking rings.",

      "On Saturday, Israeli tanks and troops began maneuvering ever closer to Gaza City\u2019s outskirts in preparation for a\u00a0full-scale offensive. Eyewitness accounts reported intensified shelling as Israel is moving toward what could be the defining battle of its war against Hamas terrorists: the capture of Gaza City.",
      "Israel's security cabinet approved the operation, known as Gideon\u2019s Chariots B, and has deployed up to five IDF divisions toward the city\u2019s outskirts\u2014a highly significant mobilization. Thousands of reservists\u2014some 60,000\u2014have been called up.",
      "John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at the Madison Policy Forum and executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, told Fox News Digital the scale of this operation is unprecedented. \"This will be a bigger challenge than anything\u00a0the IDF has faced, arguably ever. It is the densest location in Gaza, the heart of Hamas\u2019s stronghold. And you don\u2019t really know what the tunnels are until you get into them.\"",

      "Spencer said that \"Hamas built semi-circles of defenses oriented at Israel. But the IDF has shown creativity in maneuvering around obstacles.\" Israel plans to send more combat power into Gaza City than it has deployed across the entire Strip thus far. \"If your goal is to clear Gaza City of Hamas\u2019 military capabilities and search for hostages, you need that scale,\" he said.",
      "Gadi Shamni, former commander of the Gaza Division and ex-head of IDF Central Command, told Fox News Digital, \"It is a crowded city with refugee camps, dense neighborhoods, high-rises and a highly developed underground. People say the IDF controls above and below ground, but in the last campaign we saw that wasn\u2019t always true. Even when you destroy tunnels, Hamas can rebuild them quickly. The longer you stay with more forces, the more opportunities you create for the other side to attack.\"",
      "A former senior Israeli security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News Digital, \"The IDF can militarily conquer Gaza, but the costs will be immense on both sides. The IDF will fight with a method of \u2018destroy everything first\u2019\u2014air force bombs, massive charges, detonating streets from afar, wiping out entire areas and advancing slowly.",

      "The tunnels remain the most formidable element of Hamas\u2019 defense. Unlike ISIS terrorists in Mosul, Spencer said, Hamas has built an underground tunnel network that allows commanders and fighters to move between positions, avoid strikes and\u00a0conceal hostages. \"The IDF that will go into Gaza City is not the IDF of 2023,\" Spencer said, pointing to rapid adaptations in the use of drones, robots and specialized units for tunnel warfare. \"They\u2019ve learned so much. But this will still be slow, very careful and costly.\"",
      "To illustrate the scale, Spencer pointed to the 2004 battle for Fallujah in Iraq. \"It took the Marine Corps about two weeks to clear Fallujah\u2014every single home, building, shop. About 68,000 structures were cleared, as if somebody physically looked in them,\" he said. \"If all five of these [IDF] divisions were doing that, absolutely, you could get it done in a few months. But the enemy always gets a vote. You can\u2019t rush to failure.\"",
      "The former Israeli senior security official described the operation as \"telescopic\u2014very slow, with pistons working one by one. This pace also gives Hamas the chance at every stage to try to cut a deal.\"",

      "Shamni also warned Hamas may relocate hostages, 50 hostages, of whom 20 are still believed to be alive, into combat zones to deter strikes\u2014a tactic he said the IDF would be reluctant to engage for fear of harming captives, a conflict between military necessity and core values.",
      "Shamni highlighted a particularly fraught dilemma: evacuating civilians. \"You don\u2019t know who will leave, how many will leave, how they\u2019ll react\u2014or whether Hamas will even allow them to leave,\" he said. \"I assume many will not evacuate, and then you face the hard dilemma of fighting in a place full of noncombatants.\"",
      "Spencer added that history shows around 10% of civilians stay behind. \"Even 10% of a million is 100,000 people,\" he said.",

      "Voters in Taiwan are headed to the polls Saturday to decide whether Taipei should reignite its nuclear power capabilities as the island faces immense energy vulnerabilities amid growing concern over threats posed by China.",
      "In May, Taiwan shut down the Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant \u2014 its last remaining nuclear plant \u2014 after the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pledged in 2016 to phase out\u00a0nuclear power\u00a0by 2025 over concerns relating to nuclear fallout following the 2011 Fukushima accident in Japan.",
      "Security experts have since been sounding the alarm that the move further exposes Taiwan\u2019s vulnerabilities to China as the island is highly dependent on energy imports, relying heavily on nations like the U.S., Australia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar for both Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and crude oil imports.",

      "Though prior to its decision to cut ties with the alternative energy option, nuclear power was a strong supply source and provided nearly 12% of the island\u2019s needs in 2011.",
      "By 2021, that supply had dropped to roughly 9.5%, and, by the following year, it had dipped to just over 4% before being eliminated this year.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump brokering a deal with Azerbaijan and Armenia on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new deal in the South Caucasus has ended a decades-long conflict and handed Washington a rare strategic foothold on Iran\u2019s northern border, experts say.",
      "The agreement, signed earlier this month between Armenia and Azerbaijan, grants the U.S. a 99-year lease over the Zangezur Corridor - a narrow strip of land that will serve as a critical trade and energy route to Europe, bypassing Tehran entirely. Iranian American journalist and dissident Banafsheh Zand told Fox News Digital the move is \"a wonderful gain for the U.S.\" that also delivers a \"slap in the face\" to the regime in Tehran.",
      "The corridor has long been at the center of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which displaced tens of thousands and fueled three decades of instability. Trump\u2019s intervention brought both sides to the table and created what observers say is a new trade and security lifeline linking the Caspian Basin to Europe, bypassing Iran entirely.",
      "ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN LEADERS SEEK TO EASE RUSSIAN AND IRANIAN CONCERNS AFTER US-BROKERED PEACE DEAL",
      "A view from Armenia's southern border reveals the Arax River, with Iran visible across the water. This crossing is a vital lifeline for Armenia, facilitating essential trade and energy flows, especially as tensions rise over the proposed Zangezur Corridor. Iran strongly opposes the corridor, fearing it would sever its direct land access to Armenia and diminish its role as a regional transit hub. The corridor, intended to connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, has become a flashpoint in regional geopolitics. (Anthony Pizzoferrato/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Known as the Trump Route for Peace & Prosperity (TRIPP), economically, the agreement secures Washington a direct role in overseeing the flow of Caspian hydrocarbons to Europe. The U.S. will manage rail and road infrastructure, telecom networks and energy pipelines running through the corridor, giving American companies a dominant position in regional transit for oil, gas and goods. By controlling this artery, the U.S. not only generates billions in future trade and investment but also locks Europe into alternative supply routes that reduce reliance on both Russia and Iran.",
      "For allies, the corridor offers cheaper and safer access to Caspian energy. For Tehran, it represents lost revenue, lost leverage, and the end of its ability to act as a mandatory gatekeeper for east-west commerce.",
      "Zand said the deal is not only historic but also a direct win for Washington. \"It\u2019s a wonderful gain for the U.S.,\" she said. \"American contractors will be supervising oil and gas from the Caspian Basin, routed through Zangezur and Turkey to Europe. The profit margins are great, and it all happens under NATO\u2019s blessing.\"",
      "Zand said the potential goes even further. \"Nobody\u2019s talking about it yet, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to see U.S. bases there,\" she said. \"If that happens, then checkmate the Khamenei regime and Russia.\"",

US President Donald Trump said Friday that Armenia and Azerbaijan were committed to a permanent peace as he hosted a White House summit with the leaders of the two South Caucasus nations, which have fought for decades. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "For Iran, the corridor represents what Zand called a nightmare scenario. Tehran has long used its geography to shape energy and trade flows. By inserting the U.S. into the region, the new deal effectively strips Iran of that leverage. Zand put it in stark terms: \"Iran is shaped like a cat, a sitting cat. This corridor literally runs above the cat\u2019s ears. It bypasses Iran, takes money away from the regime, and pushes them out into the cold.\"",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Iran Program, said the corridor exposes how vulnerable Iran has become in the Caucasus. \"Both the defeat of Armenia in the most recent war with Azerbaijan, as well as the political problems between Moscow and Yerevan today, have made it harder for the Islamic Republic to really benefit from its traditional economic and political relationship with Armenia,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "An infographic titled \u2018Construction of roads and railways extending to the Zangezur Corridor continues without interruption.\u2019 Once constructed, the corridor will connect Azerbaijan's western provinces and Nakhchivan via Armenia, further stretching to China, Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey.\u00a0 (Yasin Demirci/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "\"They still do have ties, and the regime is an opportunistic actor as much as it is an ideological one. If there is any way to throw stones at this agreement, or extract concessions on the back end, they will try.\"",
      "At the same time, he said the strategic picture is clear. \"The Islamic Republic is, in essence, carved out of this route,\" he said. \"This is not just a critical corridor that could bring stability to the South Caucasus and economic improvement for all countries involved-it also drives home the point that the regime has been such a poor guardian of Iran\u2019s national interest that the Iranian state has been excluded from a major transit route just above its border.\"",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei addresses the media during voting for parliamentary elections in Tehran, Iran in May 2024. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The timing, Zand argued, makes the impact even greater. She pointed to Iran\u2019s weakening position since October 7, 2023, and Israel's recent 12-day war with Tehran. \"The regime was self-isolated when it couldn\u2019t come to Hamas\u2019s or Hezbollah\u2019s rescue. Iraq\u2019s Shiites are saying they don\u2019t want to be controlled, Syria is out, and Hezbollah has been degraded. For those of us who\u2019ve watched the regime for decades, we always knew it was a paper tiger. October 7 and the war exposed it to the world.\"",
      "The killing of senior IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists has deepened the sense of vulnerability inside Tehran. \"They can huff and puff about blowing the house down, but the truth is, there\u2019s a whole lot of fear among the regime\u2019s leaders now,\" Zand said. \"Khamenei has even gone into hiding again.\"",
      "TRUMP BRINGS PEACE TO CAUCASUS: INSIDE THE ARMENIA\u2013AZERBAIJAN DEAL 30 YEARS IN THE MAKING",
      "Ben Taleblu added that Washington is now using these shifts to turn Iran\u2019s weakness into opportunity. \"Wherever the regime is weak, that invites pushback, whether militarily or economically,\" he said. \"The U.S. has followed Israel\u2019s military success against the Islamic Republic with strikes of its own against nuclear facilities, and it is now following Azerbaijan\u2019s battlefield success with a political and economic success of its own. This corridor is another example of America moving in when Tehran is most vulnerable.\"",
      "An aerial view of the construction of roads and railways that will pass through the Zangezur Corridor, which will connect the western provinces with Nakhchivan and will also be one of the routes of the Central Corridor extending from China to Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey. (Photo by Resul Rehimov/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Zand, whose father was a well-known Iranian journalist and intellectual assassinated by the regime, said she views Trump\u2019s direct involvement as the key to the corridor\u2019s success. \"Because it\u2019s Trump, it makes all the difference,\" she said. \u00a0\"Trump doesn\u2019t care about not hurting people\u2019s feelings. He responds to how people act. And with this move, he\u2019s sitting over Iran like a vulture-ominous, watching, ready.\"",
      "For dissidents like Zand, the corridor represents more than a transport route. \"We\u2019ve prayed for this for decades,\" she said. \"Until the regime is gone, people inside Iran will remain too afraid to rise up again. But this corridor is a boon. It shows the regime is surrounded, and its days are numbered.\"",

      "The deal was reached with NATO backing and has already been compared by some observers to historic peace accords. Zand believes the significance lies not only in ending a 30-year conflict but also in turning the U.S. presence in the Caucasus into a permanent reality. \"The regime knows the jig is up.\"",

      "Back-to-school season is in full swing. Many students are already back in the classroom, and some are still savoring what\u2019s left of summer while checking items off their shopping lists.",
      "But when it comes to prices, parents and kids are in a whole new territory. It\u2019s murky, to say the least. Some prices are higher, some are lower, and others have stayed put since last year.",
      "Both retailers and consumers are navigating price adjustments as a new wave of tariffs as high as 50% on some imported goods went into effect earlier this month, creating even more uncertainty. Consumers currently face an overall effective tariff rate of 18.6%, the highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale.",
      "NBC News, working with e-commerce price tracking platform Bright Data, is tracking online prices for roughly 30 back-to-school items at Amazon, Walmart and Target to pinpoint if and when those price jumps happen. Bright Data is separately tracking its own set of more than 4,000 back-to-school items across retailers.",
      "The price tracker can\u2019t identify what causes prices to rise or fall, so it\u2019s impossible to determine whether any changes reflect retailers passing along tariff expenses to shoppers. But the tool can help consumers plan their purchases at a time when goods from certain countries, such as China, or with specific components, like steel or aluminum, are disproportionately subject to steeper levies.",
      "Both data sets showed a pattern of journals and notebooks jumping in price during the past several months. The price of a higher-end notebook from Moleskine on Amazon spiked more than 22% since NBC News first started tracking the product in early March. Meanwhile, Bright Data found that journals and notebooks across price points jumped in price nearly 100%.",
      "An Amazon spokesperson said that price increases are not reflective of overall pricing trends and that many back-to-school items decreased in price. \u201cWe have not seen the average prices of products offered in our store change up or down meaningfully this year outside of typical fluctuations across millions of items on Amazon,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Data from NielsenIQ (NIQ), which tracks prices at brick-and-mortar stores, found that some paper products, like index cards and graph paper, are up. The price tags on other paper products, such as filler paper and composition books, however, are down. Steve Zurek, NIQ\u2019s vice president of advanced analytics, said some of those decreases can be attributed to promotional sales on back-to-school items.",
      "Bright Data also found that more than 36% of the calculators it tracks saw price increases. On Walmart\u2019s website, the price of a scientific calculator jumped 58% since NBC News started following the price in June.",
      "Walmart said that it doesn\u2019t control pricing for the calculator in this particular listing and that it is sold by a third-party vendor.",
      "With kids heading back to school, it\u2019s more than just pencils and notebooks they\u2019ll need. New electronics, shoes, clothing and a musical instrument or helmet might be on the shopping list for extracurricular activities.",
      "The latest government consumer inflation report showed the price index for footwear rose 0.9% between July 2024 and July 2025. The price indexes for apparel and sporting goods dropped 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Education and communication commodities, which includes computers and tech accessories, plunged 4.3% during the same time period.",
      "These numbers reinforce financial experts\u2019 assessment that consumers are not feeling the full effects of tariffs just yet.",
      "\u201cPrice hikes may be muted, to some extent, by retailers\u2019 aggressive early ordering to manage inventories and beat the tariff increases,\u201d said Jennifer Timmerman, Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior investment strategy analyst.",
      "However, higher prices are likely on the horizon. Lorraine Hutchinson, a senior retail analyst at BofA Securities, said most back-to-school deliveries arrived at a 10% tariff rate, but tariffs on holiday goods will be higher.",
      "About 90% of back-to-school shoppers said they expected prices on back-to-school items to be higher this year due to tariffs \u2014 and they planned ahead. More than two-thirds of back-to-school families started shopping in July, citing tariffs as a concern, according to a survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF).",
      "Despite extra caution, parents are still shelling out for the new school year. The average K-12 family anticipates spending more than $800 on back-to-school needs, down slightly from last year, according to NRF. Total spending is expected to top $39 billion, up nearly $1 billion from last year.",
      "Walmart is the top choice among parents, according to NIQ. Nearly 80% of surveyed shoppers planned to visit Walmart, followed by 72% at Amazon and 54% at Target.",
      "Walmart, which is known for its low prices, has been drawing more higher-income shoppers in recent months as inflation-weary consumers seek bargains.",
      "Walmart raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook on Thursday, as its online business posted another quarter of double-digit gains. This report comes even as the company said costs are rising from higher tariffs.",
      "Businesses continue to eat more of the tariff costs than expected \u2014 at least for now, according to the NRF.",
      "\u201cThe last thing they want to do is lose their customers because they become the more expensive alternative,\u201d said Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights.",
      "Goldman Sachs economists estimate that consumers already absorbed 22% of tariff costs through June, but that their share could rise to 67% by October.",
      "To save on back-to-school shopping, parents can opt for store-brand products, which, according to NIQ, are on average 26% cheaper than name-brand alternatives. If you really want a name-brand item, buying secondhand can help dodge inflated prices on things like apparel, footwear and sports gear.",
      "With lingering economic uncertainty, early shopping is likely here to stay as consumers prepare for more school-related purchases as well as the upcoming holiday season.",
      "\u201cConsumers today are looking for some answers and for certainty they can plan around,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cThey know that early shopping lets them plan their season according to what they can afford.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Diana, Princess of Wales, is for many a symbol of life in the 1990s. And now a time capsule she buried nearly 35 years ago has been opened, revealing a treasure trove of memorabilia.",
      "The capsule was placed inside a wall at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in 1991 with the help of two children who won a TV competition.",
      "It contained relics of a pre-internet-enabled age including an early pocket TV, a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator and a copy of The Times newspaper.",
      "The items were decided via a competition run by long-running British children\u2019s TV show \u201cBlue Peter\u201d \u2014 viewers were asked to decide eight things that represented life in the 1990s. Despite some moisture damage the items were still recognizable.",
      "The box was not due to be opened until centuries had passed, but that timeline had to be drastically cut short because the hospital is demolishing existing buildings to build a new children\u2019s cancer center.",
      "The CD was the choice of David Watson, then aged 11, from Devon in western England, as well as a sheet of recycled paper and a European passport.",
      "A collection of British coins, a container with five tree seeds and a snowflake hologram was the choice of Sylvia Foulkes, then aged 9, from Norwich in eastern England.",
      "It's unclear what the children, who would both now be in their 40s, thought of the opening. The hospital told NBC News that it was no longer in touch with them.",
      "The hospital asked staff either born in 1991 or already working there in 1991 to help remove the capsule.",
      "One of the latter, senior health play specialist Janet Holmes, said: \"It brought back so many memories seeing the pocket TV in there \u2014 I had bought one for my husband back in the day, for when he had a break whilst driving his coach around the country. They were very expensive then!\"",
      "Anyone born in or after the 1990s may struggle to understand that this coveted gadget \u2014 the Casio TV430 \u2014 had a 2 inch screen and a battery life of just a few hours.",
      "Australian singer Minogue, then famous in Britain for a string of pop hits as well as her role in the TV soap opera \"Neighbours,\" is still a major international star.",
      "CDs, however, were then relatively new: they only surpassed cassettes and LPs as the leading music format in the U.S. in 1991.",
      "Great Ormond Street, known as GOSH, is the U.K.\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospital and a major center for pediatric research in Europe. Diana became its president in 1989 and visited multiple times.",
      "Diana was part of the ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the Variety Club Building in 1991 \u2014 to mark this she sealed a time capsule in the hospital's main entrance.",
      "She was following royal tradition: a former Princess of Wales, Alexandria, laid the foundation stone for an older GOSH building in 1872 and also sealed a time capsule. Curiously, however, the hospital said that capsule has still never been found.",
      "GOSH said the new cancer center \"will make it easier for clinical teams to develop kinder, more effective treatments, all delivered in a child-focused environment where children can play, learn and be with their family while at hospital.\"",
      "While the hospital is run by the taxpayer-funded National Health Service, it still has to raise funds for big projects and the 300 million pound ($403 million) fundraising drive to build the new center is the biggest in its history."

      "A Wisconsin high school dean\u2019s recent arrest on multiple charges of sex crimes against children has triggered an uproar among parents who say school leaders dismissed warning signs and failed to alert authorities to at least one credible claim.",
      "The parents say administrators allowed a troubling pattern of predatory behavior to fester after they mishandled a tip from a senior at Sun Prairie West High School who had raised alarms about Robert Gilkey-Meisegeier \u2014 the fourth person who worked in Sun Prairie schools to be accused of sex crimes against children in the last decade. Two were sentenced within the last year.",
      "Now, parents are calling for top leaders in the school system, which employs nearly 1,400 people, to enact meaningful change or resign as police investigate whether staff members followed state-mandated protocols to report reasonable suspicions that a child had been abused.",
      "\u201cParents are very outraged right now, because if not now, when?\u201d said Kristy Yang, whose two daughters and son attend a different high school in the Sun Prairie Area School District. \u201cWhen are we going to do something about it? I don\u2019t want to wait until it\u2019s my kid.\u201d",
      "Dana Ujor, another parent, said the latest incident was the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d after a series of alarming arrests that she said signaled severe oversight issues.",
      "In April, an anonymous senior warned the school district in a letter that Gilkey-Meisegeier\u2019s behavior toward at least one girl was \u201cdisturbing,\u201d prosecutors said in a criminal complaint.",
      "The senior said the dean followed the girl on social media, regularly texted with her, drove her around, often spent time with her in his office and was \u201cconstantly hovering\u201d around her, according to the letter included in the complaint.",
      "\u201cI am deeply concerned about the appropriateness of their relationship,\u201d the student wrote.",
      "The student urged the administration to investigate the matter thoroughly, saying it has long created an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d atmosphere at the school, which has 1,300 students. But school officials found the claim to be \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d after Gilkey-Meisegeier denied the allegations, the complaint said.",
      "The school district closed the case without reporting it to law enforcement and instructed the dean not to be alone with students in his office or have one-on-one closed-door meetings, according to the complaint.",
      "Then, months later, Gilkey-Meisegeier was arrested on July 24 and charged with more than a dozen counts of possession of child pornography and child sexual exploitation, court records show.",
      "A school resource officer who worked for the police department had become aware of alleged misconduct in late May, and Instagram flagged Gilkey-Meisegeier\u2019s account for suspicious activity.",
      "The charges involve at least three child victims, according to the complaint. Prosecutors alleged that Gilkey-Meisegeier bought alcohol for one of the victims in exchange for topless photos. Investigators found dozens of explicit photos of an \u201cearly pubescent female\u201d in a secret folder on his Snapchat account, the complaint shows.",
      "Text messages, obtained by police through a search warrant and included in the criminal complaint, appear to show Gilkey-Meisegeier enticing a student \u2014 the subject of the anonymous senior\u2019s warning in April \u2014 to secretly meet up multiple times, as well as to send nude photos.",
      "Even though it received the anonymous senior\u2019s tip in April, the school district said it became aware of some allegations involving Gilkey-Meisegeier on May 30, according to a website it created to address the incident. The district said Gilkey-Meisegeier was placed on administrative leave on June 2 and fired on June 9.",
      "Sun Prairie Police Chief Kevin Warych said the police department did not become aware of the issue until May 29. Around that time, a school resource officer who worked for the department had learned about allegations of misconduct, according to the complaint. Warych said the department was informed by the school resource officer, not the school district.",
      "Separately, on May 31, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children received a report from Instagram about suspicions related to Gilkey-Meisegeier\u2019s account and tipped off local police, the complaint said. Sun Prairie police received that report on June 5, according to the criminal complaint.",
      "\u201cWe are investigating whether mandatory reporting protocols were followed,\u201d Warych said.",
      "Gilkey-Meisegeier, 30, is scheduled to be arraigned on Sept. 2, the first day of school. His attorney did not comment.",
      "The school district told NBC News in a statement that it will fully cooperate with police while it focuses on supporting students, families and staff members. The district declined to comment further or respond beyond what it has already said on its webpage.",
      "Since Gilkey-Meisegeier\u2019s arrest, the school system\u2019s hiring processes have come under fire.",
      "Gilkey-Meisegeier did not have a teaching license, which is typically required for the position he held as dean of students, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, which reviews applications for such licenses.",
      "An agency spokesperson said Gilkey-Meisegeier had applied for a teaching license last year but failed to complete the necessary steps to be granted one. The agency declined to specify which steps, citing state and federal law.",
      "Gilkey-Meisegeier had also been arrested in connection with impaired driving and driving with a revoked license in 2018 and 2019, court records show.",
      "Yet he was hired in August 2022 to work in the athletics department, including as a basketball coach and a concession stands manager, according to his LinkedIn page. He became acting dean of students in January 2023 and formally assumed the role in May 2024.",
      "The school district did not comment on the lack of a license or Gilkey-Meisegeier\u2019s priors.",
      "On its webpage, it said that it had completed a background check on Gilkey-Meisegeier and that he was trained in having appropriate boundaries with students.",
      "Lisa Goldsberry, a former school board member, told NBC News she resigned in December in part because of what she described as the school system\u2019s poor vetting process and systemic inaction on complaints from the community.",
      "The school board governs the district, but Goldsberry said she felt the board did not have enough authority over it.",
      "\u201cWe were taking directions from the district as opposed to the other way around,\u201d she said.",
      "While the board has final approval over all administrative hires in the district, Goldsberry said the elected members of the school board were given only candidates\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to make their decision.",
      "Goldsberry said the board did not have the critical information needed to verify candidates\u2019 credentials or histories. She said it did not even receive basic information, such as the names of other candidates or how final candidates answered interview questions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re basically signing off on something that we don\u2019t have enough information to be signing off on,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so disgusted by the way that we were doing things.\u201d",
      "Goldsberry was among several speakers to skewer the administration at a public school board meeting on Aug. 11 after Gilkey-Meisegeier\u2019s arrest.",
      "By the end of the meeting, the school board had voted to determine that Superintendent Brad Saron was not in compliance with policies about communicating to the board or the community. It is unclear whether the vote comes with disciplinary action or any consequences. Saron, the school district and the school board did not comment.",
      "At the meeting, Saron said he was committed to improving. \u201cIt never, ever, ever feels good when you don\u2019t meet the expectations of the people you\u2019re working on behalf of,\u201d he said.",
      "In a message to the community on Aug. 15, the school board said it had hired an attorney to lead an independent investigation. It did not state a focus of the investigation.",
      "\u201cAs we move forward, the Board remains steadfast in our commitment to transparency, accountability, and the safety of every child,\u201d it said in the message. \u201cWe recognize that restoring trust requires both openness and responsible action, and we will provide updates as information becomes available.\u201d",
      "School board President Katey Kamoku resigned Monday, effective immediately, citing a need to prioritize her children and other job, the district confirmed. Kamoku did not immediately comment.",
      "Gilkey-Meisegeier was arrested after two men who worked with Sun Prairie students were sentenced for crimes against children within the last year.",
      "In April, Matthew Quaglieri, a former middle school teacher, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for possessing child pornography after he pleaded guilty and admitted to recording boys in the school bathrooms for four to five years. Investigators had found videos on his iPad of at least 39 minors using the urinals, federal prosecutors said.",
      "Lamont Crockett, who was a school resource officer, was sentenced to four years for child enticement in September 2024, WKOW-TV of Madison reported. In 2017, Brett Berryman, a former school janitor, was sentenced to three years in prison for possession of child pornography, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The school district said on its webpage that the \u201cnumber of unsettling situations\u201d does not represent a trend.",
      "\u201cIn a school community of nearly 9,000 students and nearly 1,400 employees, there are rare but deeply troubling instances when an individual violates the trust we\u2019ve placed in them and the training we\u2019ve had them engage in,\u201d it said.",
      "Many parents disagreed and said the district was shifting accountability.",
      "Yang, whose three children attend school in the district, said it showed a \u201ccontinuous dismissive attitude\u201d and unwillingness to change.",
      "Kaleena Stephan, 37, whose son attends a Sun Prairie elementary school, echoed the call for action.",
      "\u201cWhat happened at West is a severe symptom of a disease that is throughout the district,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "Back-to-school season is in full swing. Many students are already back in the classroom, and some are still savoring what\u2019s left of summer while checking items off their shopping lists.",
      "But when it comes to prices, parents and kids are in a whole new territory. It\u2019s murky, to say the least. Some prices are higher, some are lower, and others have stayed put since last year.",
      "Both retailers and consumers are navigating price adjustments as a new wave of tariffs as high as 50% on some imported goods went into effect earlier this month, creating even more uncertainty. Consumers currently face an overall effective tariff rate of 18.6%, the highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale.",
      "NBC News, working with e-commerce price tracking platform Bright Data, is tracking online prices for roughly 30 back-to-school items at Amazon, Walmart and Target to pinpoint if and when those price jumps happen. Bright Data is separately tracking its own set of more than 4,000 back-to-school items across retailers.",
      "The price tracker can\u2019t identify what causes prices to rise or fall, so it\u2019s impossible to determine whether any changes reflect retailers passing along tariff expenses to shoppers. But the tool can help consumers plan their purchases at a time when goods from certain countries, such as China, or with specific components, like steel or aluminum, are disproportionately subject to steeper levies.",
      "Both data sets showed a pattern of journals and notebooks jumping in price during the past several months. The price of a higher-end notebook from Moleskine on Amazon spiked more than 22% since NBC News first started tracking the product in early March. Meanwhile, Bright Data found that journals and notebooks across price points jumped in price nearly 100%.",
      "An Amazon spokesperson said that price increases are not reflective of overall pricing trends and that many back-to-school items decreased in price. \u201cWe have not seen the average prices of products offered in our store change up or down meaningfully this year outside of typical fluctuations across millions of items on Amazon,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Data from NielsenIQ (NIQ), which tracks prices at brick-and-mortar stores, found that some paper products, like index cards and graph paper, are up. The price tags on other paper products, such as filler paper and composition books, however, are down. Steve Zurek, NIQ\u2019s vice president of advanced analytics, said some of those decreases can be attributed to promotional sales on back-to-school items.",
      "Bright Data also found that more than 36% of the calculators it tracks saw price increases. On Walmart\u2019s website, the price of a scientific calculator jumped 58% since NBC News started following the price in June.",
      "Walmart said that it doesn\u2019t control pricing for the calculator in this particular listing and that it is sold by a third-party vendor.",
      "With kids heading back to school, it\u2019s more than just pencils and notebooks they\u2019ll need. New electronics, shoes, clothing and a musical instrument or helmet might be on the shopping list for extracurricular activities.",
      "The latest government consumer inflation report showed the price index for footwear rose 0.9% between July 2024 and July 2025. The price indexes for apparel and sporting goods dropped 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Education and communication commodities, which includes computers and tech accessories, plunged 4.3% during the same time period.",
      "These numbers reinforce financial experts\u2019 assessment that consumers are not feeling the full effects of tariffs just yet.",
      "\u201cPrice hikes may be muted, to some extent, by retailers\u2019 aggressive early ordering to manage inventories and beat the tariff increases,\u201d said Jennifer Timmerman, Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior investment strategy analyst.",
      "However, higher prices are likely on the horizon. Lorraine Hutchinson, a senior retail analyst at BofA Securities, said most back-to-school deliveries arrived at a 10% tariff rate, but tariffs on holiday goods will be higher.",
      "About 90% of back-to-school shoppers said they expected prices on back-to-school items to be higher this year due to tariffs \u2014 and they planned ahead. More than two-thirds of back-to-school families started shopping in July, citing tariffs as a concern, according to a survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF).",
      "Despite extra caution, parents are still shelling out for the new school year. The average K-12 family anticipates spending more than $800 on back-to-school needs, down slightly from last year, according to NRF. Total spending is expected to top $39 billion, up nearly $1 billion from last year.",
      "Walmart is the top choice among parents, according to NIQ. Nearly 80% of surveyed shoppers planned to visit Walmart, followed by 72% at Amazon and 54% at Target.",
      "Walmart, which is known for its low prices, has been drawing more higher-income shoppers in recent months as inflation-weary consumers seek bargains.",
      "Walmart raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook on Thursday, as its online business posted another quarter of double-digit gains. This report comes even as the company said costs are rising from higher tariffs.",
      "Businesses continue to eat more of the tariff costs than expected \u2014 at least for now, according to the NRF.",
      "\u201cThe last thing they want to do is lose their customers because they become the more expensive alternative,\u201d said Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights.",
      "Goldman Sachs economists estimate that consumers already absorbed 22% of tariff costs through June, but that their share could rise to 67% by October.",
      "To save on back-to-school shopping, parents can opt for store-brand products, which, according to NIQ, are on average 26% cheaper than name-brand alternatives. If you really want a name-brand item, buying secondhand can help dodge inflated prices on things like apparel, footwear and sports gear.",
      "With lingering economic uncertainty, early shopping is likely here to stay as consumers prepare for more school-related purchases as well as the upcoming holiday season.",
      "\u201cConsumers today are looking for some answers and for certainty they can plan around,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cThey know that early shopping lets them plan their season according to what they can afford.\u201d"

      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Democrats are already looking to assemble their early-state presidential nominating calendar for 2028, with the party announcing Tuesday that it would kick off the process in September.",
      "Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said at the DNC's summer meeting here that he aimed to have clarity about the order of the first primaries well ahead of the campaign.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re planning for meetings throughout the fall and winter and through the spring to make sure that we have a rigorous, effective and fair calendar process,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe need this process to give us the strongest possible candidate, a candidate that\u2019s battle-tested to win and ready to lead America forward.\u201d",
      "DNC members are already hearing unofficial pitches from representatives of different state delegations, all of them angling to bump their states to the front of the line.",
      "Nevada wants to be first, arguing it offers a unique mix of working-class voters, diversity and battleground status. New Hampshire says it has its \"First in the Nation\" history \u2014 and state law \u2014 on its side. Iowa has its own state law dictating a first-in-the-nation caucus.",
      "\u201cNevada remains the only state that meets all of the early state criteria previously set forth by the DNC,\u201d Hilary Barrett, executive director of the Nevada State Democratic Party, said in a memo released Wednesday. \u201cElevating a union-strong, diverse, highly competitive battleground state will lay the groundwork to help Democrats win back working-class voters and voters of color. If we fail to rebuild that coalition, we won\u2019t win back the White House.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s South Carolina, which, under President Joe Biden, leaped to the front of the primary pack last year, with the party talking up its large Black population. And Michigan, with its battleground badge and Midwest credentials, joined the early ranks last year.",
      "The 2024 reshuffling happened after the party agreed it should move away from Iowa and New Hampshire because their mostly white populations were less reflective of the Democratic Party and neither was a core battleground state. Iowa also fell into disfavor after the 2020 caucuses turned chaotic, with vote-counting problems that meant it didn't offer a clear winner until days later.",
      "But now, after 2024's bitter White House loss to Donald Trump, Democratic Party dynamics may have changed enough that simply mentioning the word \u201cIowa\u201d isn't enough to throw it out of contention.",
      "Recently, Martin told NBC News he welcomed Iowa\u2019s making a pitch to go first again, in the same way he was open to every state that wanted to be vetted for the role. He said he didn\u2019t believe in ruling out states that had been ruled out in the past.",
      "\"Every state who wants to be considered in the early states window will have an opportunity to bid just like they did last time, including Iowa, and other states,\" Martin said early this month.",
      "Martin said then that he wanted every region of the country represented.",
      "\"Which state emerges out of each region? My other commitment is to make sure that every state who wants to be heard gets a chance for a fair hearing and that no one comes in with a preconceived idea of what the calendar should be,\" he added.",
      "But Martin also didn\u2019t name an Iowa DNC member to the pivotal Rules and Bylaws Committee, or RBC, which will again take a leading role in deciding the 2028 early state lineup.",
      "Scott Brennan, an Iowa DNC member and former longtime member of the Rules and Bylaws Committee, said: \u201cAt the old RBC there was a bias against caucuses. We\u2019ll see if the new RBC is as biased against caucuses. Chair Martin was supportive of us making an application if Iowa Democrats decide to do so.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Diana, Princess of Wales, is for many a symbol of life in the 1990s. And now a time capsule she buried nearly 35 years ago has been opened, revealing a treasure trove of memorabilia.",
      "The capsule was placed inside a wall at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in 1991 with the help of two children who won a TV competition.",
      "It contained relics of a pre-internet-enabled age including an early pocket TV, a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator and a copy of The Times newspaper.",
      "The items were decided via a competition run by long-running British children\u2019s TV show \u201cBlue Peter\u201d \u2014 viewers were asked to decide eight things that represented life in the 1990s. Despite some moisture damage the items were still recognizable.",
      "The box was not due to be opened until centuries had passed, but that timeline had to be drastically cut short because the hospital is demolishing existing buildings to build a new children\u2019s cancer center.",
      "The CD was the choice of David Watson, then aged 11, from Devon in western England, as well as a sheet of recycled paper and a European passport.",
      "A collection of British coins, a container with five tree seeds and a snowflake hologram was the choice of Sylvia Foulkes, then aged 9, from Norwich in eastern England.",
      "It's unclear what the children, who would both now be in their 40s, thought of the opening. The hospital told NBC News that it was no longer in touch with them.",
      "The hospital asked staff either born in 1991 or already working there in 1991 to help remove the capsule.",
      "One of the latter, senior health play specialist Janet Holmes, said: \"It brought back so many memories seeing the pocket TV in there \u2014 I had bought one for my husband back in the day, for when he had a break whilst driving his coach around the country. They were very expensive then!\"",
      "Anyone born in or after the 1990s may struggle to understand that this coveted gadget \u2014 the Casio TV430 \u2014 had a 2 inch screen and a battery life of just a few hours.",
      "Australian singer Minogue, then famous in Britain for a string of pop hits as well as her role in the TV soap opera \"Neighbours,\" is still a major international star.",
      "CDs, however, were then relatively new: they only surpassed cassettes and LPs as the leading music format in the U.S. in 1991.",
      "Great Ormond Street, known as GOSH, is the U.K.\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospital and a major center for pediatric research in Europe. Diana became its president in 1989 and visited multiple times.",
      "Diana was part of the ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the Variety Club Building in 1991 \u2014 to mark this she sealed a time capsule in the hospital's main entrance.",
      "She was following royal tradition: a former Princess of Wales, Alexandria, laid the foundation stone for an older GOSH building in 1872 and also sealed a time capsule. Curiously, however, the hospital said that capsule has still never been found.",
      "GOSH said the new cancer center \"will make it easier for clinical teams to develop kinder, more effective treatments, all delivered in a child-focused environment where children can play, learn and be with their family while at hospital.\"",
      "While the hospital is run by the taxpayer-funded National Health Service, it still has to raise funds for big projects and the 300 million pound ($403 million) fundraising drive to build the new center is the biggest in its history."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The House Freedom Caucus faces an existential moment with some of its most prominent members eyeing the exits for new jobs in the 2026 election, calling into question the future of the band of far-right rebels.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, the group\u2019s thought leader and most outspoken lawmaker, is running for state attorney general.",
      "Barry Moore, R-Ala., is running for the Senate.",
      "Ralph Norman, R-S.C.; Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.; and Byron Donalds, R-Fla., are all running for governor. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., is considering running for governor. And yet others facing tough re-elections or redistricting threats could be gone by the end of next year.",
      "With about three dozen members, the House Freedom Caucus has created persistent headaches for Republican leaders since its founding in 2015 as a home for fiscal conservatives willing to use aggressive tactics to get their way.",
      "In recent years, the ultraconservative group has been embroiled in public infighting as its members clashed over the direction of the caucus. In 2023, members booted Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., out of the group over her support for then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and after she cussed out fellow member Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.",
      "This year, the hard-line caucus has softened and acceded to President Donald Trump\u2019s wishes on issues it never used to compromise on, such as government funding.",
      "A current Freedom Caucus member said Tuesday that he was contemplating dropping out of the group himself but has decided to stay on after having heard that Roy and other \u201cattention seekers\u201d who \u201chijacked\u201d the caucus won\u2019t be running for re-election to the House in 2026.",
      "\u201cChip Roy is an intelligent guy. Legislatively, he knows his s---, but he\u2019s a total freaking pain in the ass,\u201d the lawmaker said.",
      "Asked to respond to that description, Roy accepted it as a \u201cbadge of honor\u201d and quipped: \u201cI might say the same thing. As somebody described as a frequent nuisance to leadership, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to accomplish, in terms of changing the game and making them respond to the broader electorate.\u201d",
      "And Roy added that he\u2019s not worried about the group\u2019s future after the departures.",
      "\u201cThe Freedom Caucus is a decade old and has had a significant impact on the entire culture and policy landscape of Washington \u2014 and will continue to do so,\u201d he said.",
      "Over the years, the group has pushed House legislation to the right, forcing moderate Republicans into difficult positions. Some of the departing lawmakers won\u2019t be missed by those colleagues, either.",
      "\u201cNot all Freedom Caucus are the same, but some have undermined the speaker at every step and divided the team,\u201d said Don Bacon, R-Neb., a centrist swing-district member who is retiring after 2026. \u201cTeams that work together get much more done and win.\u201d",
      "In other cases, the ideological litmus tests the group was founded on have largely dissolved into one that has come to define the party more broadly: loyalty to Trump.",
      "Last year, Trump helped defeat the Freedom Caucus chairman, then-Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., in his GOP primary race after Good endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over Trump in the presidential primaries. Earlier that year, members voted to oust Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, from the group after he publicly backed Good\u2019s primary challenger.",
      "And this March, Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., resigned from the group after her colleagues grew infuriated with her push to force a vote to allow remote voting for lawmakers who become new parents, as she did in 2023.",
      "The Freedom Caucus member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss current colleagues, has been frustrated by some caucus members\u2019 \u201cobstruction\u201d of the Trump agenda, including Trump\u2019s \u201cone big, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey voted for everything that they were against on four or five different occasions, but not until they got to go over and sit in the White House and get attention or phone calls from Trump,\u201d the Freedom Caucus member said. \u201cAnd so I don\u2019t know what their motive is, and I doubt they\u2019re getting any deals.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a two-seat majority. Let\u2019s tell people what our principles are, what our values are,\u201d the caucus member continued. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we got to go with the play the coach calls. And we don\u2019t need to make this look like a freaking circus up here.\u201d",
      "Roy, who also endorsed DeSantis over Trump in the 2024 primaries, has argued that he and others initially opposed the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d to secure \u201ckey wins,\u201d including making additional spending cuts, eliminating clean energy tax credits and making changes to Medicaid and food assistance programs.",
      "\u201cTexans\u2019 next attorney general must have a proven record of fighting to preserve, protect and defend our legacy, an attorney general unafraid to fight, unafraid to win,\u201d Roy said in a campaign ad. \u201cThat\u2019s why I fought to secure our border and help President Trump deliver results.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, other Freedom Caucus leaders face a questionable future.",
      "Scott Perry, R-Pa., has a difficult re-election battle in his increasingly competitive district as he prepares for a possible rematch with Democrat Janelle Stelson, a former local news anchor. Perry won their matchup last year by about 5,000 votes.",
      "And Andy Harris, R-Md., the current Freedom Caucus chair, could get drawn out of his district after Maryland\u2019s Democratic governor, Wes Moore, said he might pursue a new House map in the blue state \u2014 though state Democrats already tried to draw out Harris in 2021, and a state court struck down that map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. Still, it raises the possibility that Harris could become a casualty of a battle that Texas Republicans kicked off this year with an unusual mid-decade redistricting.",
      "Harris suggested in a statement that Moore's redistricting threats could result in more Republicans' being elected to Congress in Maryland: \"If the Democrats want to roll the dice, let them roll the dice.\"",
      "A Freedom Caucus spokeswoman praised the group's departing members, saying they had fought for conservative priorities and will \"carry that fight into leadership roles across the country, strengthening the movement in new arenas.\"",
      "\"While faces may change, our principles remain the same and will continue to echo through each legislative battle and every hard-won victory on Capitol Hill,\" spokeswoman Anna Adamian said.",
      "The Freedom Caucus has already shifted from its initial version, when it was willing to band together and vote down the priorities of GOP leaders to achieve its goals \u2014 even occasionally opposing Trump in his first term. But that willingness has dissipated in his second term. The group that resolutely opposed continuing resolutions and debt limit increases voted for both this year. The faction that styled itself as fiscal hawks who wouldn't vote to grow the national debt supported a bill that's projected to increase it by $3.4 trillion.",
      "The Freedom Caucus this year has developed a reputation for bluffing with threats to vote against bills, only to fold and vote yes when the time comes.",
      "Roy insisted that there are plenty of strong conservatives in the group, which doesn\u2019t maintain a public list of its members, to carry on the fight as he and others move on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s got a lot of new blood and fresh members actively involved in the fights,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong organization that goes deeper than any one individual. It\u2019s got a long legacy that I\u2019m not worried about in the slightest bit.\u201d",
      "Some of the Freedom Caucus\u2019 founding members have previously used the group as a springboard to bigger roles or statewide office. Two founders, Mick Mulvaney and Mark Meadows, went to work in the Trump White House during his first term; Mulvaney was Trump\u2019s budget director and acting chief of staff, while Meadows, a former Freedom Caucus chairman, was chief of staff.",
      "DeSantis has been Florida\u2019s governor since 2019, while former Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador has been Idaho\u2019s attorney general since 2023. Another founder, former Rep. John Fleming, served in the first Trump administration before he won the race for Louisiana treasurer in 2023.",
      "The founding caucus chairman, Jim Jordan of Ohio, has opted to remain in Congress and is chairman of the powerful Judiciary Committee. He has since become an ally of GOP leadership, though he still holds roles with the caucus.",
      "A former Freedom Caucus member noted that there has always been churn within its ranks. The latest departures will give newer members \u2014 like Brandon Gill, R-Texas, Eric Burlison, R-Mo., and Eli Crane, R-Ariz. \u2014 the chance to take on bigger roles with the group.",
      "\u201cThis will open up a new opportunity for leadership,\u201d the former member said."

      "India, one of the world's fastest growing economies and a key partner for the West in the Indo-Pacific region, is heavily reliant on trade with the U.S., its largest export market.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to stand firm in the face of what he termed \"the politics of economic selfishness.\"",
      "The 50% levy risks decades of warming of ties between Washington and New Delhi.",
      "The tariffs are a reversal of the favorable position India seemed to enjoy early in the second Trump administration due to its expanding economic relationship with America, its strategic importance on China and Trump's personal relationship with Modi.",
      "Vice President JD Vance \u2014 whose wife is the daughter of Indian immigrants \u2014 told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that the U.S. had applied \"aggressive economic leverage\" on India to \"try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d",

      "\u201cFor me, the interests of farmers, small businesses and dairy are topmost. My government will ensure they aren\u2019t impacted,\u201d Modi said at a rally this week in his home state of Gujarat.",
      "India and the U.S. are yet to reach a bilateral trade deal, even after holding five rounds of negotiations. That's mostly because India is unwilling to open those sectors to cheaper American imports as it could threaten the livelihood of millions of Indians.",
      "The Indian leader is also under immense domestic pressure not to cave to the U.S., but Trump has shown little sign of softening his demand that India stop buying Russian oil as he shifted his focus in recent weeks to brokering peace in Ukraine.",
      "India's continued purchase of Russian oil is actually informed by past U.S. requests to keep the price of oil low amid Western-led sanctions on Russia.",
      "\u201cThey bought Russian oil because we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil,\u201d Eric Garcetti, the U.S. ambassador to India under President Joe Biden, said at a conference last year. \"It was actually the design of the policy, because as a commodity we didn\u2019t want oil prices going up.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Aug 2025 01:34:57 GMT",
    "summary": "A top Senate Democrat said new FBI deputy director Andrew Bailey used his power as Missouri\u2019s attorney general to aid President Trump politically.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u2019s new pick for co-deputy director of the FBI, Andrew Bailey, brings more legal and managerial experience than current Deputy Director Dan Bongino. Bailey, who was resoundingly re-elected as Missouri\u2019s attorney general last fall, says his focus is on \u201cenforcing the laws as written\u201d and \u201cprotecting the Constitution.\u201d",
      "But a top Senate Democrat and other critics say Bailey\u2019s two-year tenure as Missouri\u2019s attorney general was overly political and that he has a track record of aiding President Donald Trump politically while in office.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is appointing a partisan politician,\" Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement to NBC News. \"Mr. Bailey is another Trump loyalist who has continuously peddled the \u2018Big Lie,\u2019 that the 2020 election was stolen.\"",
      "\u201cThis appointment further proves President Trump will stop at nothing to politicize and weaponize the federal government\u2019s most prestigious and powerful law-enforcement agency to protect his allies and punish his critics,\u201d he said.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi praised Bailey, a decorated Iraq War veteran, for his \u201cexpertise and dedication to service\u201d in a statement to Fox News after his appointment last week. \u201cHis leadership and commitment to country will be a tremendous asset as we work together to advance President Trump\u2019s mission,\u201d she said.",
      "But Democrats and the editorial board of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch have accused Bailey of filling lawsuits that highlighted culture war issues that had little to do with law enforcement in Missouri.",
      "\u201cFor more than two years now, the state\u2019s top lawyer has routinely used that perch to pursue frivolous and often deranged legal action designed to inflame his MAGA base,\u201d the editorial board wrote last month. \u201cHe has improperly inserted his office into various national culture-war controversies.\u201d",
      "Bailey\u2019s office in Missouri referred questions to the Justice Department. The Justice Department, the FBI and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump had considered Bailey as a potential nominee for attorney general or FBI director, The New York Times reported, citing people briefed on the meetings at the time.",
      "Bailey, who is expected to take his new role in early September, previously was a general counsel for the governor of Missouri and for the Missouri Department of Corrections. He also was an assistant attorney general and a county prosecutor in Missouri.",
      "A new position",
      "Bailey\u2019s appointment as co-deputy director was a surprise, in part because the position did not previously exist. The FBI\u2019s leadership structure has been a single director, with a single deputy director who was a career agent. Now, Bailey and Bongino are set to split the No. 2 job.",
      "Durbin criticized Trump's appointment of Bongino and Bailey, who have no prior experience in the FBI, calling it \"an unprecedented move.\" He said a career FBI official should again be Deputy Director. \u201cPrior to the current Trump Administration, the FBI Deputy Director has always been a career agent,\u201d Durbin said.",
      "A former senior Justice Department official supported the idea of two deputy directors, citing past reviews which said that the deputy director oversaw too many people.",
      "But the former senior official, who asked not to be named, citing fear of retaliation from the Trump administration, said both should be career FBI agents with in-depth knowledge of the organization, something Bongino and Bailey lack.",
      "\u201cYou could have two deputies, perhaps one over administration and one over operations,\u201d said the former senior Justice Department official. \u201cBoth should be highly experienced career FBI officials.\u201d",
      "Bongino's future",
      "The change to two deputy directors has also led to speculation among current and former FBI staff members that Bailey\u2019s appointment is a sign that Bongino will soon leave, current and former FBI officials told NBC News.",
      "Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who had been a pro-Trump podcaster before Trump chose him to be deputy director, clashed with Bondi over how the Justice Department has recently handled the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.",
      "In July, Bongino considered resigning over the issue after a heated confrontation with Bondi over his frustration with how the Justice Department has handled the Epstein files, according to a person who has spoken with Bongino and a source familiar with the interactions that Bongino and FBI Director Kash Patel have had with Bondi.",
      "\u201cAll the retired people think it shows Bongino\u201d could be on the way out, said a former senior FBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A current federal law enforcement official said it seems \u201cclear as day\u201d that Bongino, who has publicly spoken about the toll the job has taken on his family, would \u201ctransition\u201d out of the bureau.",
      "Former Justice Department and FBI officials say the Trump administration is reversing sweeping reforms enacted in the 1970s  to make the bureau independent, nonpartisan and apolitical. The changes were spurred by decades of abuses by longtime Director J. Edgar Hoover, who meddled in politics, surveilled political groups and provided dirt on rivals to presidents.",
      "The Trump administration has removed career FBI officials whom they apparently deemed not loyal enough to Trump from top leadership positions. They requested the names of thousands of FBI agents who investigated Jan. 6 rioters and ousted the career official who tried to protect them. And they have flouted civil servant rules designed to make the bureau nonpartisan and protect agents from political retaliation.",
      "Missouri tenure",
      "In his time in office in Missouri, Bailey has aligned himself politically with Trump and his MAGA base, according to local news reports. Bailey was appointed attorney general in 2023 after his predecessor was elected to the Senate, and he was easily elected to a four-year term in November, defeating his Democratic opponent 60% to 40%. Critics accused Bailey of filing culture war lawsuits focused on issues outside Missouri.",
      "Last year, Bailey asked the Supreme Court to stop a judge in New York from sentencing Trump after he was convicted of falsifying business records. \u201cNew York is working to hijack our national election and jail President Trump,\u201d Bailey posted on X. \u201cMissourians absolutely have an interest in ensuring that does not happen.\u201d",
      "He sued to block the Biden administration\u2019s student loan relief program. He sued Starbucks to block its efforts to expand the diversity of its workforce. And he sued Facebook to force it to allow Missouri residents to have access to third-party moderation to avoid what Bailey argued was politically biased moderation by Facebook.",
      "And last year he sued Planned Parenthood based on a video surreptitiously obtained by the right-wing group Project Veritas. Planned Parenthood said Bailey distorted the incident captured in the video and asked a judge to throw out the case, which is still pending.",
      "Some of Bailey\u2019s legal actions that relate more to the law enforcement efforts he will be involved in at the FBI have been criticized, as well. Last year, he tried to block the release from prison of Sandra Hemme, then 64, who spent 43 years in prison before a judge overturned her murder conviction.",
      "The judge in the case criticized Bailey\u2019s office, which was alleged to have told corrections officials not to release her. Hemme spent an additional month in jail but was freed after the state\u2019s highest court ordered her release.",
      "Separately, the state NAACP sued Bailey after he stopped including a \u201cDisparity Index\u201d mandated by a state law in an annual state report. The law was enacted after data showed that police pulled over Black drivers at a higher rate than white drivers and searched their vehicles more often, despite white drivers being found to have contraband more frequently.",
      "The NAACP also claimed in the suit, which is still pending, that Bailey violated the state Sunshine Law by withholding documents that would shed light on how the decision was made.",
      "Patel dismissed criticism of Bailey in a statement of his own to Fox News last week. He said the FBI \"will always bring the greatest talent this country has to offer in order to accomplish the goals set forth when an overwhelming majority of American people elected President Donald J. Trump again.\u201d"

      "Earlier in the week, Hodgson, 29, appeared in court and had a preliminary hearing set for late September, according to court documents.",

      "He faced seven years in prison if he were convicted. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, according to court records.",
      "The charges stem from an incident on July 7 when Hodgson was off-duty and alleged to have been unruly at a popular boardwalk destination filled with restaurants and shops.",
      "He was accused of entering a women\u2019s restroom at a restaurant and approaching a woman who saw his gun and firearm magazine. Witnesses told police he left the restaurant soon after the woman told the restaurant\u2019s manager there was a drunk man with a gun inside the women\u2019s bathroom.",
      "According to investigators, security guards near the restaurant repeatedly told Hodgson to leave, but he refused. When Long Beach police officers arrived, he remained obstinate and would not cooperate, authorities said.",
      "\u201cAs Hodgson resisted arrest, he allegedly became agitated and physical with the officers, injuring one of them,\u201d Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said at the time.",
      "\u201cThe conduct exhibited by Mr. Hodgson, a border patrol agent who has the duty to uphold the law and protect its citizens, is unacceptable and deeply troubling,\u201d Hochman added in a statement. \u201cNo one is above the law, regardless of their position or badge.\u201d"

      "Swift posted a series of engagement photos on Aug. 26. Slide 3 of the carousel is a close-up of the diamond ring itself.",
      "The old mine diamond is set in a ring designed by Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine Jewelry, TODAY.com can confirm. The diamond is a brilliant cushion cut.",
      "Old mine cuts are notable because they are antique diamonds dating back to the time that diamonds were hand-cut and polished. Jeweler Hannah Florman tells TODAY.com old mine diamonds \"send a signal that the wearer values individuality over mass-produced perfection,\" since each is cut by hand.",
      "\"This ring honors craftsmanship and subtle beauty that\u2019s not about trends,\" Florman says.",
      "Jewelry specialist Laura Taylor says old mine cuts are a \"hallmark of antique jewelry,\" and are known for \"having a romantic glow rather than the sparkle we associate with engagement rings today.\"",
      "The vintage look is underlined by the ring\u2019s thick gold cigar band, an increasingly popular choice for rings. Dua Lipa's engagement ring, for example, has this type of band.",

This ring style feels reminiscent of a bygone era tied to the 18th and 19th centuries when diamonds were cut by candlelight,\" Florman says.",
      "Simone Kendle, CEO of Wove Made Inc., the jewelry brand behind the viral TNT bracelet Swift and Kelce once wore, agrees that the vintage feel mirrors Swift's aesthetic and value as an artist.",
      "\"It\u2019s not trendy or flashy; it\u2019s rooted in history and romance, which is very her,\" Kendle says.",
      "She says the thick band adds to an \"old-money vibe\" and the feeling the ring is a \"vintage heirloom.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s not about following current trends, it\u2019s about leaning into heritage,\" Kendle says.",
      "In terms of the diamond\u2019s carat size and pricing, the jewelers give a range of estimates.",
      "Florman estimates the ring is 8 carats and between $500,000 to $1 million.",
      "Kendle says it could be between 7 and 8 carats. \"A diamond of that size and character would be valued in the millions, depending on its color and clarity \u2014 it\u2019s truly one of a kind,\" she says."

      "Waller considered not following through with her second audition, \u201cjust because I was going through so much mentally and emotionally.\u201d But she was bolstered by her family, friends and the women with whom she became \u201cso close\u201d while auditioning.",
      "\u201cThey just take you in. They help you through the whole training camp,\u201d she says of the veterans on the team. \u201cI think it\u2019s because they know how hard it is on you as a rookie that you just form these deep bonds.\u201d",
      "For year two, she took a more targeted approach. While Waller had been dancing since she was 2 and had performed at the collegiate level, her DCC prep amounted to just a few specific classes the first time around.",
      "\u201cThis year, I joined Jennifer Amburn\u2019s pro focus program,\u201d Waller says, referring to the DCC alum who started classes to prepare dancers for NFL and professional teams. Waller trained with Amburn twice a week \u2014 once privately, and once in classes \u2014 then did a separate DCC prep class.",
      "The result? A completely different audition process.",
      "\u201cI was pleasantly surprised that I felt a lot more calm going into this training camp,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt at peace through the whole process this year.\u201d",
      "The feeling of peace without such heightened nerves allowed her to \u201cperform so much better,\u201d Waller adds.",
      "\u201cI remember waking up finals day \u2014 and finals day is scary because it\u2019s a solo. It feels very audition-y \u2014 whereas training camp feels more like practice,\u201d Waller explains. \u201cI woke up finals day expecting to be all nerves, stomach in a knot, and it was just none of that. I felt so at peace and so excited and just happy to be there for the whole thing.\u201d",
      "Once at training camp, Waller says she had the epiphany that there were simply \u201chealthy nerves\u201d she\u2019d learn to live with.",
      "\u201cThis is never actually going to go away. Practice is scary. This team has so much pressure. There\u2019s a certain amount of nerves that are just natural and they\u2019re going to be there,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cAnd of course, there is the pressure of being cut, but I didn\u2019t feel like my life was going to end whether I did or didn\u2019t make the team, and I think that helped me a lot,\u201d Waller adds.",
      "Gearing Up for Her 1st 'Thunderstruck'",
      "While Waller can't reveal whether auditions were taped or if \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweethearts\u201d Season 3 is confirmed, she says \u201clittle things\u201d changed this year compared to what was shown in Season 2 of the docuseries.",
      "For example, Waller says cuts happened \u201ca little bit earlier on this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like last year the cuts seemed really scary because they didn\u2019t happen until, I want to say, Week 3. So it was this built up anxiety,\u201d she says, later adding, \u201cThis year, the first cut happened a little bit earlier. So I do believe that the faster the cuts happen, the better.\u201d",
      "Now, the athletes have entered the NFL football season. The Cowboys are already in their preseason, with their first regular season home game on the books Sept. 14 against the New York Giants.",
      "Preparing for the upcoming season, Waller says the squad has practice every day, when they learn the rest of the routines and \u201cgame elements\u201d not taught during training camp.",
      "While Waller says being a collegiate cheerleader helped her, nothing can prepare her for how being on the Cowboys field will feel.",
      "With the first game on the horizon, Waller says she\u2019s both \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cexcited\u201d for her first \u201cThunderstruck\u201d performance, the DCC\u2019s iconic dance routine that opens every Cowboys game at AT&T Stadium.",
      "\u201cI am nervous for \u2018Thunderstruck\u2019 just because you need to have such high stamina, and it requires such endurance, so that part is scary,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m excited. And now doing \u2018Thunderstruck,\u2019 I feel so proud to be doing it, whereas before I was scared.\u201d"

      "On Aug. 4, Mann posted a TikTok illustrating his growing obsession with the movie. Featuring the song \u201cGolden,\u201d the video has been viewed about 10 million times. It shows Mann going from mild interest on first watch to dramatically singing into a sword on his 10th watch.",
      "\"This is the pop culture moment of the year,\" he says. \"It has broken the internet.\"",
      "The movie has even infiltrated TODAY host Craig Melvin\u2019s household.",

Six songs from the movie\u2019s soundtrack have taken over Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart, with two rising into the top 10 slots, according to Billboard\u2019s website. On Aug. 25, Netflix released a special sing-along edition on its streaming platform.",

      "\"Everybody went. The whole school went,\" he explains. \"It's almost like the school version of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, where you don't want to miss out.\"",
      "The movie has similarly been \u201cblowing up\u201d teacher Rob D\u2019Urbano\u2019s parent group chat. \u201cHonestly, none of us mind that it\u2019s on repeat in our houses,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. \u201cI feel like all the dads are enjoying it.\u201d",
      "Alongside a TikTok video of himself watching the movie even after his three young daughters went to bed, he wrote, \u201cI can\u2019t be the only parent that bops to this movie.\u201d",
      "No, sir. You certainly are not.",
      "Influencer Josh Jones made a TikTok video similar to Mann's showing his evolution from skeptic to believer. He added costumes, wigs and a dance routine to really show his dedication to the film.",
      "For Jones, it's the \"message behind the movie\" that really resonates.",
      "\"There's this really positive message here, where it perfectly portrays the battle between good and evil,\" he says.

He says, \"It's complimented our spiritual journey as a family very nicely.\"",
      "As the father of one son and five daughters \u2014 with another daughter on the way \u2014 Jones also appreciates the \"girl power\" theme of the movie. \"Having all of these daughters, that's something that I just really want to support,\" he shares.",
      "The phenomenon isn\u2019t limited to girl dads.",
      "Mann's two sons also love the movie. His 4-year-old sings \"Soda Pop\" and his 8-year-old is trying to teach himself to play the song on the piano by ear. Mann, an actor who played the title role in the the Broadway tour of \"Phantom of the Opera\" for 700 performances, does a mean version of \"Golden.\"",
      "\u201cSomething about these competing boy and girl groups is super nostalgic for millennial parents,\" Mann says. \"We get to relive this fandom all over again through our kids. It\u2019s like our boy band DNA meeting parenting reality.\u201d",
      "Mann adds, \"This Halloween, it's going to be only 'KPop Demon Hunters.' I wish I had stock in this movie.\""

      "Jillian Harris and her longtime love, Justin Pasutto, have tied the knot in not one but two \"fairy tale\" ceremonies.",
      "The former \"Bachelorette\" and HGTV star, 45, and her fianc\u00e9, a former pro snowboarder, tied the knot Aug. 21 in a church ceremony before saying \u201cI do\u201d again two days later in front of 176 guests on their farm in West Kelowna, British Columbia, People reported.",
      "\u201cAfter eight years of planning, we\u2019ve decided to really go for it!\u201d Harris told the publication. \u201cIt is an actual fairy-tale dream come true. I\u2019m so happy that we waited this long so that we could truly plan the day that we\u2019ve always dreamed of.\u201d",
      "The newlyweds, who have been together for 13 years, exchanged vows for the first time at the same church where Pasutto\u2019s parents wed. Harris walked down the aisle wearing a custom-made lace wedding dress by Cand\u00e9 Bridal Boutique.",
      "The couple put thought into \"customizing the liturgy\" so that the ceremony felt \"special and personal to us as a couple and as a family,\u201d said Harris, noting that Pasutto's Catholic faith played a \"meaningful\" role.",
      "Afterward, Harris and Pasutto hosted an Italian-themed rehearsal dinner at their home to honor Pasutto's Italian roots.",
      "The pair and their loved ones spent the following day doing yoga and golfing before they walked down the aisle again at Harris and Pasutto\u2019s property in a \"flower farm\"-themed ceremony.",
      "Harris described the ceremony's aesthetic as \u201ctimeless, elegant, and luxurious\" but with a \"floral touch.\"",
      "\u201cJustin has worked tirelessly over the past two years to repair the property, replanting trees, moving dirt, planting grass, irrigating and managing the team,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has devoted the last year of his life to making my wedding venue dreams come true.\u201d",
      "Afterward, at the reception, the couple shared their first dance to Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLover.\u201d",
      "Harris starred on Season 5 of \"The Bachelorette\" in 2009 before appearing as a designer on the HGTV series \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\" in 2010 and, later, as the co-host of \"Love It or List It Too\" from 2013 to 2019.",
      "She met Pasutto in 2012. The couple, who got engaged on Christmas 2016, share two kids: son Leo, 9, and daughter Annie, 6.",
      "\u201cWell THAT was SOME Christmas morning!!!!!\u201d Harris wrote, announcing their engagement on Instagram next to a photo of the couple in bed with their son and two dogs. \u201cOH MY GOD my heart cannot handle this much LOVE! @slipperygoose you\u2019ve made me the HAPPIEST girl in the world.\u201d",
      "\u201c#Finally,\u201d she added along with the hashtag \u201c#ISimplyAskedForOneThingForChristmas.\u201d",
      "The couple originally planned to walk down the aisle in the summer of 2020  \u2014 with Harris' grandmother meant to be her maid of honor \u2014\u00a0but their wedding plans were thwarted by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Harris's grandmother, who passed away in 2019, still played a role in their ceremony: Harris carried her ashes in the pocket of her dress.",
      "In June, Harris shared a video with footage from her bachelorette party, which was held at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge in her native Alberta, Canada, on Instagram.",
      "\"After eight years of being engaged, I finally had my Bachelorette party, and here\u2019s how it went\u2026,\u201d Harris wrote in text in the clip.",
      "The video began by showing Harris and her friends tossing cowboy hats in the air. It went on to show the group of women decorating the lodge \u2014 with a banner that read \"Last Hoedown\" \u2014\u00a0along with footage of them dancing and doing yoga together.",
      "\u201cGoing back to my Alberta roots with 15 of my besties was exactly what my soul needed,\u201d Harris wrote in her caption.",
      "\u201cWe made so many unforgettable memories,\" she added. \"From the yummiest food, to morning pilates and canoeing on the lake, dancing to country music, singing, belly laughing, and stories we\u2019ll be telling for years.\u201d"

      "\u201cI\u2019m also a bad actress and a bad liar \u2014 I think people would be able to catch on quickly,\u201d Amaya chimed in. \u201cI\u2019m like, I need Botox after this, he makes me smile this much.\u201d",
      "Since then, though, the couple has been dogged by persistent breakup rumors that reached a fever pitch this week.",
      "Ahead of the \"Love Island USA\" Season 7 Reunion, both Amaya and Bryan have unfollowed each other on Instagram, adding fuel to split speculation that first surfaced earlier this summer.",
      "The rumors began swirling when Bryan was allegedly spotted  with another woman at a nightclub just days after the couple left the villa together.",
      "At the time, the pair seemed to shut down the chatter with a romantic TikTok posted to Bryan\u2019s account. \u201cWhen everyone thinks you\u2019re over meanwhile this is us,\u201d read the caption, accompanying footage of the couple gazing into each other\u2019s eyes before Amaya leaped into Bryan\u2019s arms.",
      "Based on the reunion trailer, Bryan will address the rumors. Here's what to know.",
      "What happened between Amaya and Bryan on \u2018Love Island USA\u2019?",
      "Amaya\u2019s journey to find love in Fiji was far from straightforward.",
      "Entering the villa as a bombshell on Episode 4 alongside Hannah Fields, Amaya originally coupled up with Ace Greene.",
      "While there seemed to be a spark between the pair at first, Ace quickly switched up on Amaya, citing her usage of nicknames (particularly \u201cbabe\u201d) and physical touch as too much, too soon.",
      "From there, Amaya found more connections and obstacles. She coupled up with Austin Shepard on Episode 14, but he, like Ace, began to distance himself from Amaya.",
      "The couple split up when Casa Amor happened on Episode 19, leaving them both single and open to exploring new connections.",
      "Bryan came into the show as a bombshell in Casa Amor, the biggest relationship test of every \u201cLove Island\u201d season. This is where either the men or the women from the main villa are secretly whisked away to a second villa nearby, where they get to meet a group of other singles hoping to find love in Fiji.",
      "In Casa Amor, Bryan quickly hit it off with Andreina. Amaya, meanwhile, was striking up a connection with Zak Srakaew, who also came into the show during Casa Amor. They ultimately coupled up and remained a couple as they went back to the main villa.",
      "However, Zak blindsided Amaya during the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge and gang up on her alongside Austin and Ace, which led to Amaya exploring new connections and hitting it off with Bryan.",
      "Wait, what happened during the \u2018Stand on Business\u2019 challenge?",
      "During the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge in Episode 26, Amaya was confronted by all three men she had previously been coupled up with: Ace, Austin and Zak.",
      "As Amaya stood in front of her peers, she read cards that had been written about her \u2014 specifically about her emotions and how she expressed herself in her relationships.",
      "\u201cYou cry more than needed. You try to move to fast for everyone,\u201d Austin wrote on a card that Amaya had to read in front of the entire villa.",
      "\u201cGod forbid I\u2019m a sensitive gangsta,\u201d Amaya replied (a phrase that became one of her signature one-liners).",
      "\u201cI would just have to say that many people could view this as a weakness, but to me personally, after everything I\u2019ve been through in my life, I view it as a strength,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo if you guys view it like that, then guess what. I\u2019m just not your cup of tea to be drinking, so don\u2019t f------ drink it.\u201d",
      "Austin admitted to writing the card, explaining that after they initially coupled up, \u201cthe intensity of your emotions and feelings and wants just felt like they built way up.\u201d",
      "Ace and Zak decided to join Austin and gang up on Amaya in front of everyone. But what could have been Amaya\u2019s lowest point in the villa actually became a silver lining, as this is where her and Bryan\u2019s story began.",
      "\u201cOne thing I got to add though,\u201d Bryan interjected that night. \u201cComing from a Hispanic household, calling someone \u2018Babe,\u2019 \u2018Mi amor,\u2019 \u2018Mi vida,\u2019 that\u2019s just how we talk. You\u2019re telling her meet you halfway, you got to meet her halfway, too.\u201d",

      "The pair coupled up on Episode 30, and America eventually voted to send them to the Season 7 finale. Viewers got to see their final date and declarations of love, the loving speeches all the final couples give to one another right before the winners are announced.",
      "During their first and final date, Amaya expressed her appreciation for Bryan, especially for how he spoke on her behalf during the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge.",
      "\u201cBabe, you don\u2019t understand how much it meant, that moment, like of you standing up for me in the Stand on Business,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou know, like, if my light is too bright for somebody, wear sunglasses or something.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut with you, you looked right into the sun, you know?\u201d she continued.",
      "Bryan \u201cpopped the question,\u201d as Amaya put it in her confessional later in the episode, to continue dating exclusively each other when they leave Fiji.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to talk to you and just basically let you know how much I care about you and how much you mean to me here,\u201d he said.",

I definitely wanted to leave here letting you know that I want to make stuff exclusive with us and prioritize us. I want to continue taking the right steps with you and attacking the outside world with you.\u201d",
      "Are Amaya and Bryan still together now?",
      "The couple publicly confirmed their exclusive relationship after leaving the villa and during a recent profile with TODAY.com. Amaya said she visited Bryan's family in Boston.",
      "\u201cI had such a great time, met his mom \u2014 it was just very wholesome,\u201d Amaya said.",
      "But their decision to unfollow each other on Instagram signals serious trouble in paradise.",
      "Adding to the breakup speculation, Amaya reposted a cryptic TikTok video the same day fans noticed the social media snub.",
      "The video says, \"How it feels when you know you have to leave him alone,\" over pictures of  girls crying, alone, or looking forlornly. The caption features a few hashtags, including \"#ex,\" \"#sad,\" and \"#imissyou.\""

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 13:58:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Expert reveals how Love Island's isolated environment affects contestants' mental health, decision-making, and relationships through psychological manipulation.",
    "story": [
      "Joining \"Love Island\" may seem like the ultimate dream gig \u2014 a trip to Fiji where you bask in the sun all day surrounded by attractive singles, playing what amounts to glorified frat party games with no real-world distractions. Just you, your best bathing suits, and endless tropical sunshine.",
      "But behind this Instagram-perfect facade is a intense psychological experiment.",
      "The hit reality dating show strips participants of modern life's most basic comforts \u2014 no personal phones, no clocks, little privacy \u2014 creating conditions that could fundamentally alter how they think, feel and form relationships.",
      "TODAY.com spoke with Beverley Andre, a licensed psychologist, about how the villa's unique environment could affect contestants' minds and decision-making processes, and why the show has mental health care professionals on set.",
      "Her insights reveal why \"Love Island USA\" relationships can appear and feel so intense in the moment, yet may struggle to survive in the real world.",
      "When Time Stands Still",
      "Perhaps the most disorienting aspect of villa life is the complete absence of time cues. Without clocks or calendars, contestants lose all sense of how long they've actually known each other.",
      "\"When time is distorted, your day can feel like a week,\" Andre says. \"So you're thinking that you have this really deep bond with this person, but it's only been like one day or two days.\"",
      "This temporal confusion accelerates emotional investment in ways that can seem almost comical to viewers. Remember when contestants declare they\u2019re \u201cready to be locked in\u201d after just 48 hours? That\u2019s not just reality TV drama \u2014 it\u2019s psychology in action.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no indication, no cues for you to remember, \u2018You guys just got here. This is brand new,\u2019\u201d Andre says.",
      "The result? Some decisions can be driven more by proximity rather than compatibility.",
      "While \"Love Island's\" relatively tech-free environment might sound like a wellness retreat, it brings both benefits and challenges for contestants.",
      "On the positive side, the absence of digital transactions allows for unprecedented focus.",
      "\"When you aren't surrounded by so much noise, you're able to center in and really focus on your own thoughts,\" Andre says.",
      "Forced introspection can lead to genuine self-discovery and deeper connections.",
      "However, the isolation comes with a major downside: Contestants lose access to established neutral parties. Without the outside perspectives people in the real world often engage with when dating, contestants can become trapped in their own biases and misconceptions.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have neutral sounding boards because technically, the other people there are your competitors,\u201d Andre explains.",
      "When Romance Meets Competition",
      "The villa's unique blend of romantic pursuit and competition creates what Andre calls a \"pressure pot effect.\" Contestants aren't just looking for love, they're fighting for public votes and a cash prize, which fundamentally changes relationship dynamics.",
      "\u201c'How can you gain the fastest connection possible?' becomes the driving question, rather than, 'Is this person right for me?'\u201d Andre says.",
      "The format of the show \u2014\u00a0and the $100,000 cash prize at the end \u2014 can lead people to pursue a relationship for the sake of appearing to be in a strong connection, as opposed to laying the groundwork for a relationship.",
      "(The show aims to \"test\" these motives at the end by forcing one member of the winning couple to decide whether they split the prize money or keep it for themselves, with the goal of proving whether or not they were in the villa for love.)",
      "The constant questioning of motives adds another layer of complexity. As Andre points out, both contestants and viewers, may wonder: \u201cAre you really digging me, or do you just want us to win and look cute?\u201d",
      "Living Under Surveillance",
      "Sharing one bedroom and one bathroom with a house full of strangers, all while being filmed 24/7, would create unprecedented challenges for emotional regulation, Andre says.",
      "\"When you have a hard day at work, sometimes you just need space and time to process without having witnesses,\u201d Andre says. \u201cBut then you can\u2019t, because you have eyes all around you.\u201d",
      "The lack of privacy doesn't just affect comfort. It can actively shape behavior. Contestants must constantly consider how their actions will be perceived by both their fellow Islanders and the viewing public. The result can be emotional shutdown rather than emotional regulation.",
      "For contestants from marginalized groups, this scrutiny carries additional weight. Black women on the show face particular pressure around public perception, which can affect everything from their romantic choices to their physical expressions of affection, Andre says.",
      "\u201cBlack women can\u2019t go on this show and sleep with any of these people or any of these men, because of the public perception around Black women and being overly sexualized,\u201d Andre says.",
      "She cites contestants Olandria Carthen and Chelley Bissainthe, who appeared on Keke Palmer's podcast, \"Baby, This is Keke Palmer,\" on July 22 and spoke to this perception.",
      "During the episode, Palmer asked the former Islanders how often they feel they had to \"tone down\" their emotions and reactions to events in the villa as Black women.",
      "\"It's taken out of context, and I'm a bad guy and I'm a mean girl,\" Olandria responded. \"It\u2019s very exhausting to say the least. I truly feel like initially I had to tone down a lot to not cross over that boundary because a person that looks the opposite of us, as soon as they get emotional it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to cater to this person.\u2019 It\u2019s like bro, what about us? I don\u2019t understand.\"",
      "The 'Challenges'",
      "While \"Love Island\" occasionally includes what Andre calls \"wholesome activities\" that can mirror real relationship milestones, such as family day, some viewers are here for prime reality TV drama. Enter: the challenges.",
      "While many feature elaborate props, costumes and kissing, some can expose interpersonal rifts. For example, the \"Stand on Business\" challenge encouraged contestants to anonymously call out other Islanders, while \u201cHate to Burst Your Bubble\" involved Islanders sorting each other in categories like \"most genuine,\" before revealing how viewers at home ranked them.",
      "Andre says while these challenges are entertaining for the viewer, they can cause emotional harm to the islanders participating in them. She uses Season 7's infamous Heart Rate challenge, which involves Islanders dressing in costume and acting out to try and raise their fellow contestants' heart rates the most, as an example.",
      "\"These situations \u2014 do they really have the time to process?\" Andre says. \"Granted, they\u2019re with each other 24 hours a day, but do they have the capacity and the space to process?\"",
      "The Heart Rate challenge led to a feud between Huda Mustafa and Chelley, after several people in the villa thought Huda went too far while dancing with Ace, the other half of Chelley's couple.",
      "\"'Wow, we just had this experience, and I\u2019m in this relationship, but there are some things that happened in that challenge that made me feel, you know, really jealous, or I felt very humiliated,'\" Andre explains of how Islanders may process these situations. \"'You\u2019re saying that you\u2019re really feeling me, or you love me, but then someone else was kissing up on you, and I don\u2019t know how to react to that, right?'\"",
      "Reality Check: Transitioning Back to the Real World",
      "Perhaps the most significant psychological challenge may come after the cameras stop rolling, when contestants must process an intense, highly controlled experience while navigating new relationships under public scrutiny.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re still processing the whole experience,\u201d Andre says.",
      "The villa\u2019s emotional intensity, combined with challenges that may have triggered feelings of jealousy or humiliation, would require serious psychological work to unpack.",
      "Add in the pressures of newfound fame, social media attention and public investment in their relationships, and it\u2019s no wonder \"Love Island\" couples can struggle post-villa.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re really down for the cause and down for the relationship, I would imagine they\u2019re in therapy,\u201d Andre says."

      "Trump started the tariff rate at 25% but doubled it earlier this month as punishment for India buying Russian oil, making it one of the highest of the many tariffs imposed during Trump's ongoing global trade war.",
      "India, one of the world's fastest growing economies and a key partner for the West in the Indo-Pacific region, is heavily reliant on trade with the U.S., its largest export market.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to stand firm in the face of what he termed \"the politics of economic selfishness.\"",
      "The 50% levy risks decades of warming of ties between Washington and New Delhi.",
      "The tariffs are a reversal of the favorable position India seemed to enjoy early in the second Trump administration due to its expanding economic relationship with America, its strategic importance on China and Trump's personal relationship with Modi.",
      "Vice President JD Vance \u2014 whose wife is the daughter of Indian immigrants \u2014 told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that the U.S. had applied \"aggressive economic leverage\" on India to \"try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d",

      "India and the U.S. are yet to reach a bilateral trade deal, even after holding five rounds of negotiations. That's mostly because India is unwilling to open those sectors to cheaper American imports as it could threaten the livelihood of millions of Indians.",
      "The Indian leader is also under immense domestic pressure not to cave to the U.S., but Trump has shown little sign of softening his demand that India stop buying Russian oil as he shifted his focus in recent weeks to brokering peace in Ukraine.",

    "story": [
      "MAALE ADUMIM, West Bank \u2014 The sun-starched strip of sand and brush doesn\u2019t look like much, but if you squint, you can almost glimpse the dreamscape of a future Palestinian capital.",
      "\u201cThese spare lands mean that we can build our parliament, we can build our future institutions,\u201d Khalil Toufakji, a Palestinian expert on geography and settlement expansion, told NBC News earlier this month as he gestured across the controversial \u201cEast 1,\u201d or E1, section of the occupied West Bank.",
      "\u201cIf Israel builds here, it means that everything is finished at the same time,\u201d the 76-year-old expert on Israeli settlements said at an overlook in the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim. \u201cThis means that Jerusalem is surrounded from everywhere. \u2026 It means that there is no Palestinian geographic continuity between the north and south.\u201d",
      "The almost 5 square miles of land may seem undesirable and the conflict around it theoretical, but both Israel and the Palestinians regard the area\u2019s fate with the same sense of urgency.",
      "So when Israeli authorities approved the development of 3,400 homes last week, ultranationalist lawmakers celebrated what they saw as the death knell for a nascent Palestinian state and an acceleration of plans for Israel to annex the whole of the West Bank.",
      "The development \u201cpractically erases the two-state delusion and consolidates the Jewish people\u2019s hold on the heart of the Land of Israel,\u201d Bezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, told a news conference when he announced his approval of the plans.",
      "\u201cNow they declare it clearly and they don\u2019t need to hide it,\u201d said Shawan Jabarin, the general director of Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organization based in the West Bank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need philosophers and intellectuals to analyze. They speak about it themselves: \u2018This is to kill any possibility of a Palestinian state.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since the plan was tabled in the early 1990s, Israeli authorities and Jewish settlers like Smotrich have expounded upon the practical needs for new development as Jerusalem has become too crowded and environmental regulations have forbidden new building in the west of the city, which mostly belongs to Israel.",
      "But Palestinians say the area, which straddles the enormous Maale Adumim Jewish settlement and the Palestinian-majority east Jerusalem, is the only undeveloped land that might host government buildings for a new state.",
      "The construction would also split the West Bank in two, again fracturing an incipient Palestinian state already divided between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where almost 63,000 people have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the enclave\u2019s health ministry. Israel launched its military campaign after the Hamas-led terror attacks that day, which killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage.",
      "After almost 23 months of war, the country has faced mounting criticism about its conduct from traditional Western allies like the U.K., France and Canada, which have recently made conditional offers to recognize a Palestinian state, unless Israel revives talks to achieve that and agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Those countries were among 21 that criticized the E1 development plans as a \u201cviolation of international law\u201d in a statement Friday. \u201cWe condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms,\u201d it read. British Foreign Minister David Lammy also called Tzipi Hotovely, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.K., to raise his objections.",
      "But the recognition of a Palestinian state is seen by some Israeli politicians as rewarding Hamas, leading them to view the E1 proposals as a deliberate broadside against longtime allies whose statements are increasingly drifting away from their country.",
      "\u201cIn the eyes of the right wing of Israeli politics, this is diplomatic pushback,\u201d said David Weinberg, a fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy. \u201cBut it\u2019s diplomatic pushback that\u2019s already on top of what have long been salient reasons, good reasons, for Israel wanting to build on E1.\u201d",
      "But for the Israeli right, the resounding triumph of President Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has drowned out such protests.",
      "\u201cThe E1 plan was initiated three decades ago and it was always blocked due to American pressure,\u201d said Lior Amihai, the executive director of Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy organization. \u201cNow under Trump, they\u2019re approving it. So certainly the lack of American resistance \u2026 enabled the Israeli government to approve it.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment from NBC News about the E1 development.",
      "Upon retaking office, Trump lifted Biden-era sanctions on Israeli settlers who had been implicated in repeated violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "In his first term, he moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognized all of the city as Israel\u2019s capital. Most countries consider east Jerusalem to be occupied territory and do not recognize Israeli sovereignty. Israel, which captured east Jerusalem, including the Old City, from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, deems it as its eternal, indivisible capital.",
      "So far this year, Israel has approved 25,000 settlement housing units in the West Bank, Amihai said, far surpassing the record of 12,000 units during the whole of 2020 \u2014 a massive increase Amihai credited in part to Trump because his administration had created \u201can environment where it\u2019s easier for this government,\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t have to hide anything, they can say it vocally out loud.\u201d",
      "The additional units will accommodate the burgeoning growth of the 700,000 settlers the United Nations estimates already live in the West Bank in settlements widely considered illegal under international law.",
      "Even as the E1 plan slogged through decades of bureaucratic and diplomatic obstacles, Israeli officials prepared the land some of their countrymen refer to as Judea and Samaria, using the biblical term, with a clear intention to develop it.",
      "The Samaria and Judea Police District headquarters relocated there in 2008. Highways and other roadworks connecting Jerusalem and Maale Adumim\u2019s infrastructure to the same largely uninhabited land have also been installed.",
      "Once housing there is finished, Palestinian observers say the area will become closed to their community. Even those simply driving through from the Palestinian provisional capital of Ramallah to the southern West Bank town of Bethlehem will probably have to seek longer routes, they say.",
      "Such detours shouldn\u2019t preclude further agreements between Palestinians and Israelis, Weinberg said, even as he dismissed the notion of a Palestinian state under current circumstances.",
      "\u201cInstead of battering Israel, the West should be advancing realistic space-saving arrangements for Judea and Sumeria,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s need to build on E1 does not need to be a bar to an agreement with a serious Palestinian government.\u201d",
      "Yet the Israeli right wing has made its intentions known, Jabarin said. Such a sudden, strenuous assault on Palestinian statehood \u2014 particularly with American blessings \u2014 will require more than diplomatic rhetoric to reverse.",
      "\u201cWording there, condemnations here \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make any change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not push Israel back in any way.\u201d"

      "\u201cIran\u2019s regime is not only a threat to Jews or Israel, it endangers the entire free world, including Australia,\u201d the embassy said in a statement on X.",
      "Albanese said the Australian Security Intelligence Organization had assessed that Iran was behind last year\u2019s Oct. 20 attack on Lewis\u2019 Continental Kitchen in Sydney and Dec. 6 attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne. The two arson attacks caused significant property damage, but no injuries were reported.",
      "Australian intelligence official Mike Burgess said that while not all of the country\u2019s antisemitic incidents are tied to Iran, authorities are investigating whether Tehran was involved in other cases.",
      "No Iranian diplomats or embassy staff in Australia were involved in the attacks, he said.",
      "This is the first time since World War II that Australia has expelled an ambassador, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said, adding that the country will maintain \u201csome diplomatic lines\u201d with Tehran to \u201cadvance the interests of Australians.\u201d",
      "Australia has struggled to address a surge in antisemitic attacks on homes, schools, synagogues and vehicles since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, with a terrorist attack on Israel during which Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others.",

      "The first human case of the flesh-eating parasite \"New World screwworm \"has been detected in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services said early Monday.",
      "The case, involving a person who had recently traveled to El Salvador, was confirmed to be screwworm by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maryland Health Department on Aug. 4.",
      "The Maryland Health Department said in a statement Monday that the resident has recovered \"from the infection, and the investigation confirmed there is no indication of transmission to any other individuals or animals.\"",
      "\"This is the first human case of travel-associated New World screwworm myiasis (parasitic infestation of fly larvae) from an outbreak-affected country identified in the United States,\" HHS spokesperson Emily G. Hilliard said in a statement.",
      "\"The risk to public health in the United States from this introduction is very low,\" he said.",
      "The parasite \u2014 the larva of the New World screwworm fly \u2014 can devastate cattle herds and is rife in parts of Central America and Mexico. It can destroy wildlife and even kill household pets.",
      "There were serious outbreaks in the 1980s and the 1990s in Central America, and it was eradicated at great expense, only to return in the last two years.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins traveled to Texas to announce a five-part plan to combat the screwworm on Aug. 15",
      "It includes plans to breed billions of sterile flies and dump them from the air over southern Texas and Mexico in the hope of stopping the parasite's spread.",
      "The sterilized male flies mate with females, but the eggs don't hatch. Eventually, the population reduces and dies out. The technique worked in the 1960s when the United States suffered its last screwworm outbreak.",
      "And the federal government may face calls to accelerate its work: When it was  first announced in June, the sterilization plan wasn't due to be operational for \"two to three years.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbot, commenting on the federal government scheme, said the state agriculture industry, with its 2 million jobs, was worth $867 billion. \"All of this is at risk because of the New World screwworm,\" he said.",
      "A report from the Agriculture Department last year estimated an outbreak of screwworm could cost Texas at least $1.8 billion in livestock deaths, labor costs and medication.",
      "The little parasitic flies \u2014 also known as Cochliomyia hominivorax \u2014 have an effect that's vast and devastating but in isolation quite disgusting. The females can lay eggs in any warm-blooded animal, which then hatch, unleashing hundreds of screwworm larvae, so-called because of their sharp mouths and their burrowing being compared to the motion of a screw.",
      "Human infections can be fatal but are rare, and most cases can be treated.",
      "The Agriculture Department has said screwworms have been making their way north into Mexico from other parts of Central America. The fly is endemic in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and some South American nations, it said.",
      "Mexico reported a case in Ixhuatl\u00e1n de Madero, Veracruz, last month, 370 miles from the Texas border, prompting Health and Human Services to immediately shut down cross-border cattle trade, following similar stops in November and May."

      "But its new president, Lee Jae Myung, met with Trump on Monday touting a $150 billion offering whose name is sure to appeal to him: \u201cMake America Shipbuilding Great Again.\u201d",
      "The package, which South Korean officials also refer to as MASGA, includes building U.S. shipyards, training shipbuilding personnel and maintaining U.S. Navy ships.",
      "It\u2019s a key part of the last-minute trade deal South Korea struck last month with Trump, who says he wants to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding for both economic and national security reasons. Trade and security were high on the agenda at his summit with Lee, which came amid growing tensions with China and North Korea.",
      "A White House official said before the meeting that Trump \u201clooks forward to hosting\u201d Lee and that they would \u201cdiscuss North Korea, defense posture, trade barriers, maritime security, American shipbuilding, energy dominance, and more.\u201d",
      "Trump himself injected a note of uncertainty into the day\u2019s meeting Monday by posting on Truth Social: \u201cWHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can\u2019t have that and do business there.\u201d",
      "It was not clear what Trump was referring to. Later, speaking to reporters at the White House during their meeting, Trump explained that he had \u201cheard from Intel that there was a raid on churches. We\u2019re going to talk about that later.\u201d",
      "After decades of industry decline, the United States now accounts for less than 1% of the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Rand national security think tank, compared with 50% for China, 30% for South Korea and 10% for Japan. South Korean equipment, designs and knowledge could help put the United States back on the map.",
      "On Tuesday, Lee and possibly Trump will visit a Philadelphia shipyard acquired last year by the South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group.",
      "The shipbuilding initiative is \u201ca strategic and symbolic win\u201d for South Korea as well as the United States, said Eun A Jo, an assistant professor of government at William & Mary and director of its Asia Policy Lab.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a smart move to try and secure influence in a critical American sector while at the same time countering Chinese expansion in global maritime infrastructure,\u201d she said in a phone interview Sunday.",
      "No 'bromance' expected",
      "The White House summit is an important opportunity for Lee to advocate South Korea\u2019s interests with Trump after months of political instability created by former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Though Lee comes from a liberal party, he and Trump have much in common \u2014 both have been the subjects of assassination attempts, and both are more open to diplomacy with nuclear-armed North Korea than their predecessors.",
      "But they have very different outlooks on political, economic and foreign policy, which could make the summit challenging, said Bae Jong-chan, president of Insight K, a private think tank in Seoul.",
      "\u201cOne will not be able to expect bromance between President Lee and President Trump,\u201d he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The relationship has already been strained by Trump\u2019s tariffs on South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, which has a large trade surplus with the United States.",
      "Trump said last month that the U.S. tariff on South Korean imports would be 15%, down from the 25% he had threatened earlier. He said South Korea, which does not impose any tariffs on U.S. goods, managed to \u201cbuy down\u201d the U.S. tariff by promising $450 billion in U.S. investment and energy purchases, including the $150 billion shipbuilding fund.",
      "Jo said Lee is seeking to lock in the terms favorable to South Korea in the trade deal, which remains unwritten and largely unclear.",
      "\u201cI think he wants that to be firm and solid, to have at least some sense of predictability and stability in their economic relations,\u201d she said.",
      "Trickier are questions about South Korea\u2019s long-standing security alliance with the United States and its position on China.",
      "Trump wants South Korea to take more responsibility for its own defense, freeing up the almost 30,000 U.S. service members stationed there to focus more on containing China, Washington\u2019s biggest strategic rival.",
      "South Korea worries that such a shift could expose it more to threats from North Korea, as well as increase the chances it could be drawn into a potential U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Though Lee strongly supports the decades-old U.S.-South Korea alliance, he also has to balance relations with China, South Korea\u2019s main trading partner.",
      "On Sunday, a special envoy told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that South Korea hopes to normalize relations with China after years of tension.",

      "Faced with a stalling peace push, Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that Russia had made \"significant concessions\" in ending its war in Ukraine.",
      "There is little public evidence, however, that Russian President Vladimir Putin has moved his ambitions an inch since launching his full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "Vance told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that the Kremlin had been \u201cflexible on some of their core demands\u201d \u2014 namely recognizing \u201cthat they are not going to be able to install a puppet regime\u201d in Kyiv, and \u201cthat there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d",
      "That appears at odds with Russian officials, who have spent the days since the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska pushing back on both of these points.",
      "Also on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d was Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who \u2014 while not advocating the installation of a Russian puppet \u2014 made no secret of Moscow\u2019s belief that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is illegitimate.",
      "Russia was open to Ukraine having security guarantees, Lavrov said last week \u2014 but only if the Kremlin can play a role in them, arguably rendering them useless.",
      "\"We cannot agree\" to \"resolve collective security issues without the Russian Federation. This will not work,\" he said at a news conference. \"I am sure that in the West and above all in the United States they understand perfectly well that seriously discussing security issues without the Russian Federation is a utopia, a road to nowhere.\"",
      "Far from being a new and significant concession, Lavrov made clear that the security guarantees should be based on talks held in Istanbul, in 2022.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Russia has made compromises.",
      "Despite Lavrov's trenchant remarks, there may be subtle hints that Putin is ready to do a deal \u2014 and that's without knowing what has gone on behind closed doors.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what was said at Alaska, that\u2019s the problem,\" Mark Galeotti, the British-based director of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence, told NBC News. \"It may well be that what Vance is saying reflects what Putin said there.\u201d",
      "Though Russian officials remain steadfast, Russia\u2019s tightly controlled media have been noticeably less critical of the usually vilified Zelenskyy, he said. And academics close to the Kremlin have suggested there may be some wiggle-room to the Kremlin\u2019s demands."

      "The episode is the latest sign of a growing divide between the United States and its longtime partners in Europe. It comes as Washington's close ally, Israel, increasingly clashes with Western countries amid fallout from its military assault on Gaza.",
      "\u201cAntisemitism has long scarred French life, but it has exploded since Hamas\u2019s barbaric assault on Oct. 7, 2023,\u201d Kushner wrote in an open letter in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday.",

      "\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve already seen some significant concessions from both sides, just in the last few weeks,\u201d Vance said in an exclusive interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Vance also weighed in on a Russian missile strike in western Ukraine overnight Thursday that hit an electronics factory owned by a U.S.-based company. Asked by moderator Kristen Welker if he was \u201cenraged\u201d by the strike, which the company said injured  several workers, Vance pivoted to a criticism of former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Vance said of the assault. \u201cBut this is a war, and this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don\u2019t like. A lot of civilians have died. We\u2019ve condemned that stuff from the get-go and, frankly, President Trump has done more to apply pressure and to apply economic leverage to the Russians, certainly, than Joe Biden did for 3 \u00bd years, when he did nothing but talk, did nothing to bring the killing to a stop. So you asked me what I\u2019m enraged by? What I\u2019m enraged by is the continuation of the war.\u201d",
      "Trump told reporters Friday that he was not happy about the strikes on western Ukraine and indicated that any peace deal between the countries could be weeks away.",
      "\u201cI think over the next two weeks, we\u2019re going to find out which way it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Trump said.",
      "During his interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Vance did not characterize the strike, and a number of other issues, as long-term hindrances to peace, saying there was still plenty of room for negotiation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we\u2019re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,\u201d Vance added. \u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close.\u201d",
      "Welker then asked Vance what the pressure is on Russia if the U.S. is not \u201cimposing new sanctions.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow do you get them to a place of getting to the table with Zelenskyy and stopping to drop bombs?\u201d she asked.",
      "Vance replied by saying Trump has applied \u201caggressive economic leverage,\u201d such as \u201csecondary tariffs on India, to try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d",
      "Asked by Welker if he could guarantee that the U.S. would not send troops to help enforce any peace deal, Vance reaffirmed Trump\u2019s opposition to such a deployment.",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThere are not going to be boots on the ground in Ukraine. But we are going to continue to play an active role in trying to ensure that the Ukrainians have the security guarantees and the confidence they need to stop the war on their end and the Russians feel like they can bring the war to a conclusion on their end.\u201d",
      "The interview, which aired Sunday, comes amid new, heightened tensions in the effort to end the war.",
      "On Friday, Russia\u2019s top diplomat told NBC News that no meetings between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been scheduled, raising further doubts about Trump\u2019s ability to mediate the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, details about security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and Russia\u2019s role in shaping them \u2014 remain unresolved.",
      "In the interview, Vance said he doesn\u2019t believe the Russians are stringing Trump along.",
      "\u201cI think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in 3 \u00bd years of this conflict,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands. They\u2019ve talked about what would be necessary to end the war.\u201d",
      "Trump, Vance added, stepped up efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution \u201cbecause this war is not in anyone\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not in Europe or the United States\u2019 interest.\u201d",
      "While acknowledging some of the hurdles that have popped up since Trump\u2019s Aug. 15 meeting with Putin in Alaska, Vance expressed optimism that persistence would deliver results.",
      "\u201cThere are hills and valleys to the negotiations,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe sometimes feel like we\u2019ve made great progress with the Russians, and sometimes, as the president has said, he\u2019s been very frustrated with the Russians. We\u2019re going to keep on doing what we have to do to bring this thing to a close. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen overnight. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress. But, ultimately, whether the killing stops, that determination is going to belong to whether the Russians and Ukrainians can actually find some middle ground here.\u201d",
      "Putin has rejected calls \u2014 including from Trump before their recent meeting \u2014 for a ceasefire.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say they conceded on everything,\u201d Vance said in the interview, referring to Russia. \u201cBut what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They\u2019ve recognized that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. \u2026 Have they made every concession? Of course they haven\u2019t. Should they have started the war? Of course they [shouldn\u2019t have], but we\u2019re making progress.\u201d",
      "Asked about disagreements surrounding how involved Russia will be in establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Vance asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of talking past each other here.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re not talking about security guarantees until after the war has come to a close,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd, of course, the Russians are going to be a part of the conversation about bringing that war to a close. So, of course, they\u2019re going to have some stake in this.\u201d",
      "The interview with Vance also touched on several domestic issues, including new congressional maps passed by the Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives that could pad the GOP\u2019s majority by as many as five seats. The issue has become a political flashpoint, with California Democrats preparing retaliatory moves and other states aiming to redraw maps, too.",
      "\u201cAll we\u2019re doing, frankly, is trying to make the situation a little bit more fair on a national scale,\u201d Vance said of GOP efforts. \u201cThe Democrats have gerrymandered their states really aggressively. We think there are opportunities to push back against that, and that\u2019s really all we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "On the subject of his own political ambitions, Vance again sidestepped questions about whether he sees himself as Trump\u2019s heir apparent in 2028, when the president is term-limited.",
      "\u201cI see myself as a vice president who\u2019s trying to do a good job for the American people ... and if I do a good job, and if the president continues to be successful, as I know that he will be, the politics will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe can cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d",
      "Welker asked if Vance has discussed the possibility with Trump.",
      "\u201cAs you know, the president talks about everything, and if it\u2019s in the news, the president and I have certainly discussed it,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cBut I think the president is just focused on doing a good job for the American people. He wants me to be focused on doing a good job for the American people. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep on doing.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 Postal services across the world are halting shipments to the United States this week amid mounting confusion over new import duties that will apply to parcels starting Friday.",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month abolishing the trade loophole known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d which since 2016 had allowed goods worth up to $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "The end of the exemption is being extended worldwide after the loophole was closed in May for packages from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "Under the new rules, personal gifts worth less than $100 will still be duty-free, but all other packages will face the same tariffs as standard imports from their country of origin.",
      "The planned policy shift, which operators say lacks clear procedures, has raised concerns about backlogs as services are put on hold.",
      "Postal providers in Belgium, Denmark and New Zealand are among several operators that have already suspended shipments of packages to the U.S. until they can retool their systems to comply with the new rules. Letters and documents are generally unaffected.",
      "Services in Germany, France, Britain and India have announced they will follow suit in the coming days.",
      "France\u2019s national postal service, La Poste, said in a statement that the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time to prepare for new customs procedures. New Zealand\u2019s postal service said parcel deliveries to all U.S. states and territories would be \u201ctemporarily unavailable until further notice\u201d while systems are updated to meet new U.S. customs requirements.",
      "DHL, one of the world\u2019s largest courier companies, said Friday that it will stop accepting parcels containing goods from business customers destined for the U.S. beginning Monday.",
      "The company cited unresolved \u201ckey questions\u201d about the process, including \u201chow and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.\u201d",
      "DHL will, however, continue to deliver private parcels labeled as gifts valued under $100, in line with White House assurances.",
      "The White House said ending the duty-free exemption would help combat \u201cescalating deceptive shipping practices, illegal material, and duty circumvention,\u201d claiming some shippers had \u201cabused\u201d the exemption to send illicit drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "It said the number of de minimis parcels jumped from 134 million in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024 as shippers \u201cdeceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties,  inspection, and U.S. law.\u201d",
      "Most of those packages came from mainland China and Hong Kong, which the Trump administration initially targeted as part of efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value goods from China-linked retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "The White House briefly closed the loophole for mainland China and Hong Kong in February, but quickly extended the deadline to May 2 amid confusion over how the new duties would be collected."

      "The film, inspired by Chinese mythology, opened in more than 2,500 American theaters on Friday. It is the latest in a wave of successful animations featuring Asian culture, such as Netflix\u2019s recent hit \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "The sequel to a hit movie released in 2019, \u201cNe Zha II\u201d tells the story of a child demigod named Ne Zha who rebels against his innate devilry and chooses to use his magical powers and martial arts skills to defend humanity from dragons and other foes.",
      "Yeoh, a Malaysian actor and fluent Mandarin speaker, said she found it hard to follow the English subtitles during some of its more spectacular scenes when she first watched the movie in Hong Kong. She left the theater thinking it needed to be dubbed in English.",
      "She later received a call asking if she wanted to voice Lady Yin, Ne Zha\u2019s mother, for an English-dubbed version being distributed by A24. The New York-based independent film company is known for productions including \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the 2022 film that made Yeoh the first Asian to win the Academy Award for best actress.",
      "\u201cHell yes,\u201d Yeoh said in response, calling the movie \u201ca beautiful way\u201d to cross the cultural bridge between East and West.",

      "Since its release in mainland China in January, \u201cNe Zha II\u201d has become the world\u2019s fifth-highest-grossing movie of all time, just behind James Cameron\u2019s \u201cTitanic.\u201d In February, it surpassed Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d as the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film.",
      "It is also the first non-Hollywood film to exceed $2 billion in global earnings, most of which came from the Chinese box office.",
      "The movie \u2014 which is directed by Sichuan-born Yang Yu, also known as Jiaozi \u2014 has stoked national pride in China, with the state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily praising its commercial success as the \u201cfruits of a confident nation.\u201d",
      "Many schools, state-owned companies and government entities across China have actively organized group viewings of \u201cNe Zha II\u201d in celebration of what they see as a milestone in Chinese animation.",
      "The success of \u201cNe Zha II\u201d is driven by both the maturation of China\u2019s animation industry and authorities\u2019 \u201cfull support\u201d for strengthening the country\u2019s soft power and cultural exports, said Zeng Hong, assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.",
      "Although the English-dubbed version may do better in the U.S. than the earlier Chinese-only release with English subtitles, which earned about $20 million, Zeng said that if \u201cNe Zha II\u201d succeeds with international viewers it is likely to stem more from its domestic acclaim and novelty than from genuine interest in Chinese mythology.",
      "Zeng said while she expects some reviews in the U.S. will criticize the film as Chinese propaganda, other viewers may just watch it out of curiosity.",
      "Kevin Ma, a veteran observer of the film industry who is based in Hong Kong, said another challenge \u201cNe Zha II\u201d faces in its latest release is the tight theatrical window in today\u2019s streaming-dominated market.",
      "New films may capture public attention for only one or two months before moving to streaming platforms, said Ma, who is also a film festival consultant.",
      "Even though \u201cNe Zha II\u201d came out only at the beginning of this year, it almost seems \u201clike a distant memory now\u201d because of consumers\u2019 \u201cshorter attention span\u201d in the streaming age, he said."

      "Famine was officially declared on Friday in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world's leading authority on hunger as Israel vowed to raze the area if Hamas doesn't agree to its terms.",
      "The declaration of famine by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, comes as deaths from starvation rise across the Palestinian enclave in a spiraling crisis under Israel's military assault and aid restrictions.",
      "Israel's military is preparing to push ahead with a new operation to seize Gaza City that could displace hundreds of thousands of people and worsen the dire situation there. It has launched intense strikes on the city this week after announcing it had begun the first stage of its planned assault.",
      "Famine declared",
      "The IPC, an internationally recognized system for classifying food insecurity and malnutrition, said in its report that famine had been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate \u2014 and that it was projected to expand to the Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates farther south by the end of September if the humanitarian situation does not change.",
      "The number of people now experiencing famine in Gaza was nearly 514,000, the IPC said \u2014 around a quarter of the enclave's population. That was projected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.",
      "\"Famine is a race against time,\" the IPC said. \"An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to enabling an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response to save lives.\"",
      "The United Nations-backed body had up until now only declared famine on four other occasions since it was first established in 2004, most recently in Sudan last year.",
      "The report's findings were met with little surprise by global health authorities and humanitarian groups.",
      "\u201cFamine warnings have been clear for months,\u201d said Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,\u201d said World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cThe world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forcefully rejected the report's findings, calling them a \"lie,\" and repeated that \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation.\"",
      "The IPC's 59-page report does not state that Israel has a policy of starvation in Gaza.",
      "Earlier, Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC had published a \u201cfabricated report to fit Hamas\u2019s fake campaign.\u201d It hit out at the IPC\u2019s methods, accusing it of having \u201ctwisted its own rules and ignored its own criteria.\u201d",
      "The IPC rejected Israel\u2019s accusation.",
      "Mike Huckabee, the United States' ambassador to Israel, attacked the famine declaration before it was officially announced.",
      "\"You know who IS starving? The hostages kidnapped and tortured by uncivilized Hamas savages,\" he said in a post on X early Friday.",
      "Famine, the highest phase of the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale, is classified when an area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition and at least two people or four children out of every 10,000 people are dying each day from starvation.",
      "But the bar can also be met if 15% of children are considered to be suffering from acute malnutrition based on mid-upper arm circumference with evidence of rapidly worsening underlying drivers, according to the IPC, which cited the latter practice in its report.",
      "The IPC said that this did not mean it had altered its threshold for famine, saying it used this method in line with established standards where a lack of other data is available, as it had also done in South Sudan.",
      "This \"does not represent a 'lowered threshold' in IPC methodology. Instead, it demonstrates the continued application of established IPC standards,\" it said.",
      "Israel has repeatedly denied reports of growing starvation in Gaza, while seeking to blame any hunger in the enclave on humanitarian groups and Hamas.",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza intensified after Israel launched a blockade on March 2, in the middle of its ceasefire with Hamas, barring the entry of food and other vital supplies for more than two months. It lifted the blockade in May, but only allowed a basic amount of aid in for weeks after that.",
      "Data published by COGAT states that in the weeks since Israel lifted its blockade on May 19 to August 17, when the database was last updated, 9,165 trucks carrying aid entered the enclave, with food making up just over 95% of the supplies.",
      "That boils down to an average of around 100 trucks carrying aid per day during that time period. Prior to Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, around 500 trucks per day were entering the enclave, according to humanitarian groups.",
      "Israel threatens 'gates of hell'",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed Friday to open the \u201cgates of hell\u201d on Gaza City until Hamas agreed to Israel\u2019s conditions for ending the war, including the release of all hostages and the militant group's complete disarmament.",
      "If not, he said, the city would \u201cbecome like Rafah and Beit Hanoun,\u201d areas that have been largely reduced to ruins under Israel\u2019s 22-month offensive.",
      "Netanyahu said a day earlier that he had authorized the operation to take over Gaza City, while also revealing he had instructed \u201cimmediate negotiations\u201d to begin for a deal to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages who remain held in the enclave.",
      "The video statement followed days of silence after Hamas announced it had accepted a ceasefire proposal put forward by Arab mediators.",
      "The IPC\u2019s declaration comes just over three weeks after it warned that the \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d was already unfolding in the Palestinian enclave under Israel\u2019s offensive and crippling aid restrictions \u2014 but it had emphasized the alert was not a formal famine classification.",
      "Aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks there is still not enough food entering Gaza to stave off famine.",
      "The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said on Monday it had recorded three new adult deaths \u201cdue to famine and malnutrition\u201d within a 24-hour period, bringing the total death toll from starvation to 266 people, including 112 children.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decades-long conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local Palestinian health ministry, with much of the territory destroyed.",
      "Among the dead are hundreds of people who have been killed while trying to seek aid following the introduction of a new distribution system led by Israel and the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation."
