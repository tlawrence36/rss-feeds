      "Filmmaker Matt Wolf learned that Paul Reubens had died along with the rest of the world",
      "Paul Reubens did not tell his director that he was dying.",
      "On July 31, 2023, the news of Reubens' death came as a shock to documentary filmmaker Matt Wolf, who had spent a year trying to convince him to make the ambitious two-part documentary \u201cPee-wee as Himself,\u201d now streaming on HBO Max, and over 40 hours interviewing him on camera.",
      "But in 2023, the project was in danger of falling apart: The two had been at an impasse for a while over the issue of creative control and they\u2019d finally found a way forward. He had one last interview scheduled, set for the first week of August. Then the texts started coming in. Wolf sat there shaking.",
      "They\u2019d spoken about everything \u2014 Reubens' childhood, his complicated relationship with fame, his ambitions, his commitment to his alter-ego Pee-wee Herman, his sexuality, his arrest \u2014 except the fact that he\u2019d been battling cancer for the past six years. But after the initial shock, a renewed purpose set in.",
      "\u201cI went to work the day after Paul died. I started to read the 1,500-page transcript of our interview through the night and was struck by the significance and meaning that came by understanding that he was privately contemplating mortality,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was aware that this was an extraordinary situation that was part of the story of the film and that the stakes were the highest I had ever experienced.\u201d",
      "For the next year, Wolf would wake up and say to himself, \u201cYou cannot drop the ball. Rise to the occasion.\u201d It was, he said, \u201cthe most challenging and involved and emotional process of filmmaking that I\u2019ve ever gone through and maybe that I\u2019ll ever go through again.\u201d",
      "Reubens wanted to direct his own documentary. He\u2019d always prized creative control and couldn\u2019t fathom why he would cede it in telling his own story for the first time. But everyone around him seemed to think that was a bad idea. It would take over a year of getting to know Wolf, whose film credits include documentaries about cellist Arthur Russell and news archivist Marion Stokes, to consider letting go.",
      "Even after Reubens had agreed to let Wolf direct the project, he continued to push back and resist at times. Early on, they decided to record their phone conversations as well, recognizing that their dynamic illuminated something true about Reubens.",
      "\u201cRight away, Paul was sort of rebelling against the process, blowing off steam, procrastinating, teasing me, sometimes being adversarial, but in a funny wink-wink way,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was frustrated. I thought, how am I ever going to get through this? This is the most resistant interview subject I\u2019ve ever encountered. Then I realized this is actually a pretty significant form of portraiture. This is showing Paul\u2019s discomfort and uncertainty about really showing and sharing himself.\u201d",
      "The result is a collaboration, Wolf said, but one in which he also had editorial control. It wasn\u2019t going to be a hit piece, but it wasn\u2019t going to be a puff piece either.",
      "Wolf, 43, was part of the generation of kids who grew up with the children\u2019s television series \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d It was, he said, the first time he\u2019d felt viscerally moved by a work of art.",
      "Still, he wasn\u2019t approaching the project as a fan. He was coming as a filmmaker who makes documentaries about gay artists and unconventional visionaries who \u201cbeg for reappraisal.\u201d Unlike most of his subjects, however, Reubens was an icon and a cult figure.",
      "\u201cI was determined not to make a film that fell into the traps of the celebrity biopic with platitudes from other famous people and manufactured self-reflection,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI wanted to make portrait of an artist.\u201d",
      "Much of the film focuses on the prehistory of Pee-wee, showing how his childhood, his artistic awakening, his early improv days and his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d rejection would converge into the commitment to this alter ego. Part of that involved engaging with Reubens\u2019 sexuality in a direct way. In the film, Reubens speaks about living openly as a gay man, and then going back in the closet.",
      "\u201cHe had always intended to come out but was very ambivalent about that,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAnd I saw myself as a younger gay person who could help somebody achieve that and also to give a sense of nuance and depth to his artistry that one could appreciate, and to understand the personal sacrifices that were required for him to do that.\u201d",
      "Reubens\u2019 career was derailed when he was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult movie theater in 1991. He was handed a small fine but the damage was incalculable. In 2001, he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of child pornography, which was reduced to an obscenity charge with probation. These are covered in the documentary\u2019s second part.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to set the record straight, particularly about the unfortunate footnotes of his arrest, which to some extent have overshadowed his artistic accomplishments,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThat to me felt like the easy part and also the least interesting part of the film.\u201d",
      "\u201cPee-wee as Himself\u201d premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival, where Wolf got to see emotional responses from audiences, no matter if they came to it as fans or out of some curiosity around the controversies. That emotional intensity was what he hoped they\u2019d feel.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make a film with a big range of emotions, from joy and delight to tragedy and sorrow,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cPaul contains that big spectrum of feelings. And I wanted the viewer to feel it, to have a lasting connection to him. When a film can affect you emotionally it becomes unforgettable.\u201d",

      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival has played host to the directorial debuts of three stars: Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Stewart and relative newcomer Harris Dickinson.",
      "Their films are very different but the fulfillment of longtime dreams of being behind the camera. All three movies are part of Cannes' Un Certain Regard section, which has helped launch the careers of directors like Yorgos Lanthimos, Lynne Ramsay and Molly Manning Walker.",
      "At 28, Dickinson is an up-and-coming actor, known for \u201cBabygirl,\u201d \u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d and the Palme d'Or-winning \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d who worked for years to develop his film, \u201cUrchin.\u201d",
      "Johansson, a two-time Oscar acting nominee who's been a star since her teens and played Black Widow in multiple Marvel films, brought \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a film about a nonagenarian who coopts her late friend's Holocaust story, to Cannes this week.",
      "Stewart, also an acting Oscar nominee, debuted \u201cThe Chronology of Water,\u201d an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch\u2019s 2011 memoir, last week.",
      "Awards for the Un Certain Regard section will be announced Friday, a day before the Cannes Film Festival closes.",
      "Here's what the actors-turned-directors had to say about their first forays into creating a film from behind the camera.",
      "\u201cI wanted to direct from a very young age. I wanted to make films,\u201d says Dickinson, who got his start as many young creators do now: on YouTube. He even had a web sketch series. \u201cThat was my first love, just making things.\u201d",
      "Dickinson's profile as an actor has exploded in recent years, but his desire to direct was so strong, he started saying no to roles.",
      "\u201c'Urchin' was all I could think about. It was pouring out of me. It was all that was on my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say no when you\u2019ve got something to take you away from that, you know? Nothing that came in would make me question my own film, which is a sign that I had to make it at this time.\u201d",
      "The film stars Frank Dillane as a homeless Londoner suffering from drug addiction.",
      "Johansson is now one of the world's most recognizable stars. She's also one of its most respected, earning two Oscar nominations in 2020, for \u201cMarriage Story\u201d and \u201cJojo Rabbit.\u201d",
      "Her success as an actor helped her take on new roles on films, including producing, and, now, directing.",
      "\u201cAt some point, I worked enough that I stopped worrying about not working, or not being relevant \u2014 which is very liberating,\u201d Johansson says. \u201cI think it\u2019s something all actors feel for a long time until they don\u2019t. I would not have had the confidence to direct this film 10 years ago.\u201d",
      "She says that throughout her career, imagining how to make movies has been part of her process: \u201cWhether it was reading something and thinking, \u2018I can envision this in my mind,\u2019 or even being on a production and thinking, \u2018I am directing some elements of this out of necessity.\u2019\u201d",
      "The New York-set \u201cEleanor the Great\u201d stars June Squibb as a 94-year-old who, out of grief and loneliness, takes over her friend's story of Holocaust survival as her own.",
      "\u201cIt was eight years in the making and then a really accelerated push. It\u2019s an obvious comparison but it was childbirth,\u201d says Stewart of the film. \u201cI was pregnant for a really long time and then I was screaming bloody murder.\u201d",
      "Stewart in interviews has talked about challenging the myth that men are better suited to directing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really not fair for people to think it\u2019s hard to make a movie insofar as you need to know things before going into it. There are technical directors, but, Jesus Christ, you hire a crew. You just have a perspective and trust it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy inexperience made this movie.\u201d",
      "Yuknavitch's memoir recounts her surviving sexual abuse by her father and how she sought refuge in competitive swimming and, later, writing.",
      "While Stewart expressed doubts that she offered much to her film's star, Imogen Poots, in terms of useful direction, the actor disagrees.",
      "\u201cKristen is incredibly present but at the same has this ability, like a plant or something, to pick up on a slight shift in the atmosphere where it\u2019s like: \u2018Wait a minute,\u2019\u201d Poots said, causing Stewart to laugh. \u201cThere is this insane brain at play and it\u2019s a skill set that comes in the form of an intense curiosity.\u201d",

      "Salgado's style is marked by black-and-white imagery, rich tonality, and emotionally charged scenarios. Many of his best pictures were taken in impoverished communities, especially in the Amazon and in Africa. He was recently experiencing undisclosed health problems.",
      "\u201cThrough the lens of his camera, Sebasti\u00e3o tirelessly fought for a more just, humane, and ecological world,\u201d Salgado's family said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAs a photographer who traveled the globe continuously, he contracted a particular form of malaria in 2010 in Indonesia while working on his Genesis project. Fifteen years later, complications from this illness developed into severe leukemia, which ultimately took his life,\u201d the family added.",
      "Earlier, Instituto Terra, which was founded by Salgado and his wife L\u00e9lia Wanick Salgado, and the French Academy of Fine Arts, of which he was a member, announced his death, but did not provide details on the circumstances or where he died.",
      "\u201cSebasti\u00e3o was more than one of the best photographers of our time,\u201d Instituto Terra said in a statement. \u201cHis lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, (brought) the power of transformative action.\u201d",
      "Composer Laurent Petitgirard, secretary of the French Academy of Fine Arts, said in a statement that Salgado, one of his colleagues, was \u201cremarkable for his moral integrity, his charisma, and his commitment to serving art.\u201d",
      "\"He leaves behind a monumental body of work,\u201d Petitgirard said about a photographer who received many awards, and was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in the United States in 1992 and to the French Academy of Fine Arts in 2016.",
      "Salgado\u2019s main works include the recent \u201cAmazonia\u201d series, \u201cWorkers,\u201d which shows manual labor around the world, and \u201cExodus\u201d (also known as \u201cMigrations\u201d or \u201cSahel\u201d), which documents people in transit, including refugees and slum residents.",
      "Salgado had his life and work portrayed in the documentary \u201cThe Salt of the Earth\u201d (2014), co-directed by Wim Wenders and his son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado. The film was was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2015.",
      "One of Brazil\u2019s most famous artists, though, always insisted he was \u201cjust a photographer.\u201d",
      "Salgado moved to France in 1969 as Brazil endured a military dictatorship. He said in different interviews he was then a leftist militant against the regime.",
      "It was in Paris in 1973 that he started to fully dedicate his time to photography and develop his black-and-white style, years after his economics degree.",
      "His first professional works were for the agency Sygma in 1974. The following year, he documented the lives of peasants and Indigenous peoples in Latin America for the Gamma agency. Five years later, he joined Magnum, a top brand for photographers, of which he later became president.",
      "Salgado left it in 1994 to found Amazonia Images with his wife, an agency that exclusively handles his work.",
      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who received Salgado\u2019s support throughout his political career, requested a minute of silence during a ceremony in the capital city of Brasilia to honor \u201cone of the greatest, if not the greatest, photographer the world has ever produced.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis nonconformity with the fact that the world is so unequal and his stubborn talent in portraying the reality of the oppressed always served as a wake-up call for the conscience of all humanity,\u201d Lula said. \u201cSalgado did not only use his eyes and his camera to portray people: he also used the fullness of his soul and his heart.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron posted a picture of Salgado\u2019s in Alaska in his Instagram profile as a tribute to the photographer, who also had French citizenship.",
      "Salgado and his wife, whom he married in 1967, raised their two sons, Juliano and Rodrigo, in France. His friends said every morning that he could he would breathe the air near the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris. His death also caused commotion in the country he adopted.",

In 1998, they turned a plot of land they owned into a nature reserve, according to Salgado\u2019s biography on the French Academy of Fine Arts\u2019 website. That same year, they created Instituto Terra, which promotes reforestation and environmental education.",

      "\u201cHow many times in my life have I put my camera to the side and sat down to cry? Sometimes it was too dramatic, and I was alone. That's the power of the photographer; to be able to be there,\u201d Salgado said.",

      "King Charles III is coming to Canada to deliver a message: Canada is a sovereign nation distinct from the United States",
      "TORONTO -- King Charles III is coming to Canada to deliver a message: Canada is a sovereign nation distinct from the United States.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne on Tuesday where he will lay out the Canadian government\u2019s agenda when Parliament reopens.",
      "The monarch is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in our sovereign,\" Carney said when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is extraordinarily rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, only did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re different,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cWe are not the United States. It sounds simple, but that\u2019s what the visit says.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the same institutions. We don\u2019t have the same history,\u201d Charest said. \"We are a different country with a different choice in terms of how how we built ourselves, and King Charles tells that story.\u201d",
      "This will be Charles' first visit as monarch. He visited Canada 19 times as prince. The king has been showing his support for Canada in recent months, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a Royal Navy aircraft carrier.",
      "Historian Robert Bothwell said that the king\u2019s speech in Parliament \u201cis a gesture of solidarity and identity that can be construed to be a gesture of support.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn't necessary.",
      "\u201cWe're thrilled that the king will be here. If there's a message in there, you know, there's easier ways to send messages. Just give me a call. Carney can call the president at any time,\u201d Hoekstra told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cBut I know what the implication is. It's, oh about ... the 51st state, it's over. And, you know, move on.\u201d",
      "The speech sets the legislative agenda for a new session of Parliament. It's not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state.",
      "The king will read what is put before him by Canada's prime minister and his team. The speech is usually read by Canada's governor general, the monarch's representative in Canada. The governor general holds a constitutional but mostly ceremonial and symbolic position.",
      "\u201cKing Charles is unlikely to comment directly on the 51st state issue. Yet, his introductory remarks could feature broad statements about Canada\u2019s integrity and sovereignty. At least this is what many Canadians would like him to do,\" said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "Former Canadian prime ministers and governor generals will attend the speech. The king will then pay his respects at the National War Memorial before a Royal Canadian Air Force flyby.",
      "B\u00e9land said the monarchy has long been unpopular among Quebec\u2019s French-speaking majority, and some nationalist voices in the province have been critical of the Carney government\u2019s decision to invite the king to deliver the throne speech.",
      "\"Whether the separatists work themselves into a lather over this frankly, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think Quebecers will care a lot,\u201d said Charest, the former premier of Quebec. \u201cThe may not like the monarchy or whatever they\u2019d like to read into it, but British institutions have served us very well.\u201d",

      "Chinese students make up a large part of Harvard University\u2019s international student population. The university enrolled 6,703 international students across all of its schools in 2024, according to the school\u2019s data, with 1,203 of those coming from China.",
      "The Trump administration's move, announced Thursday, was a hot topic on Chinese social media. State broadcaster CCTV questioned whether the U.S. would remain a top destination for foreign students, noting Harvard was already suing the U.S. government in court.",
      "\u201cBut with the long litigation period, thousands of international students may have trouble waiting,\u201d the CCTV commentary said.",

      "It's been nearly a decade since robbers stormed Kim Kardashian\u2019s luxury residence and tied her up at gunpoint",
      "PARIS -- The Paris robbery of Kim Kardashian lasted only minutes \u2014 but its impact reverberated for nearly a decade.",
      "On Friday, a court in the French capital will decide the verdict in one of the most audacious celebrity heists in modern French history \u2014 the night masked men stormed the star\u2019s luxury apartment, tied her up at gunpoint and vanished into the dark with $6 million in jewels.",
      "Nine men and a woman stand accused of carrying out or aiding the crime during the Paris Fashion Week in 2016, when the robbers, dressed as police, forced their way into the glamorous H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, bound her with zip ties and escaped with her jewelry \u2014 a theft that would force celebrities to rethink how they live and protect themselves.",
      "After delivering final statements in court, the defendants were dismissed Friday morning, with a verdict expected later in the day.",
      "Among them was 69-year-old Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the alleged ringleader, who arrived at court walking with a stick, his face hidden from cameras. Prosecutors have asked for a 10-year sentence. His DNA, found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece of jewelry ever recovered.",
      "Khedache says he was only a foot soldier. He blamed a mysterious \u201cX\u201d or \u201cBen\u201d \u2014 someone prosecutors say never existed.",
      "His lawyer pleaded for clemency, pointing to one of the trial\u2019s most visceral moments \u2014 Kardashian\u2019s earlier courtroom encounter with the man accused of orchestrating her ordeal. Though she wasn't present Friday, her words \u2014 and the memory of that moment \u2014 still echoed.",
      "\u201cShe looked at him when she came, she listened to the letter he had written to her, and then she forgave him,\u201d lawyer Franck Berton told The Associated Press.",
      "Kardashian, typically shielded by security and spectacle, had locked eyes with Khedache as the letter was read aloud.",
      "\u201cI do appreciate the letter, I forgive you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change the feelings and the trauma and the fact that my life was forever changed.\u201d A tabloid crime had become something raw and human.",
      "Khedache on Friday asked for \u201ca thousand pardons,\u201d communicated via a written note in court. Other defendants also used their final words to express remorse.",
      "The accused became known in France as \u201cles papys braqueurs\u201d \u2014 the grandpa robbers. Some arrived in court in orthopedic shoes and one leaned on a cane. Some read the proceedings from a screen, hard of hearing and nearly mute. But prosecutors warned observers not to be seduced by soft appearances.",
      "The trial is being heard by a panel of three judges and six jurors, who will need a majority vote to reach a decision.",
      "The defendants face charges including armed robbery, kidnapping and gang association. If convicted, some of them could face life in prison.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s testimony earlier this month was the emotional high point. In a packed courtroom, she recounted how she was thrown onto a bed, zip-tied, and had a gun pressed to her on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "\u201cI absolutely did think I was going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cI have babies. I have to make it home. They can take everything. I just have to make it home.\u201d",
      "She was dragged into a marble bathroom and told to stay silent. When the robbers fled, she freed herself by scraping the tape on her wrists off against the sink, then hid with her friend, shaking and barefoot.",
      "She said that Paris had once been her sanctuary \u2014 a city she would wander at 3 a.m., window shopping, stopping for hot chocolate. That illusion was shattered.",
      "The robbery echoed far beyond the City of Light. It forced a recalibration of celebrity behavior in the age of Instagram. For years, Kardashian had curated her life like a showroom: geo-tagged, diamond-lit, public by design. But this was the moment the showroom turned into a crime scene. In her words, \u201cPeople were watching \u2026 They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Afterward, she stopped posting her location in real time. She stripped her social media feed of lavish gifts and vanished from Paris for years. Other stars followed suit. Privacy became luxury.",
      "Defense attorneys have asked the court for leniency, citing the defendants\u2019 age and health. But prosecutors insist that criminal experience, not frailty, defined the gang.",
      "Even by the standards of France\u2019s famously deliberate legal system, the case took years to reach trial.",
      "Kardashian, who once said that the experience \u201creally changed everything,\u201d now waits for a verdict \u2014 and perhaps, a final measure of closure.",

Clients have included Hanson, Pierce The Veil, Parkway Drive, Sum 41 and Vanessa Carlton.",

He was included in Billboard's 2012 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list recognizing rising stars in entertainment. Industry veterans say Shapiro paved the way for the formation of other independent agencies and helped many alternative bands find audiences in the mainstream.",

      "Shapiro grew up in upstate New York in the \u201cstraightedge hard-core\u201d scene, a subculture that promotes not using drugs and alcohol in reaction to mainstream punk.",

      "Flying \u201chelps me focus and helps me not be distracted by all the nonsense in the world, and whatever\u2019s going on outside the plane kind of doesn\u2019t matter in those moments,\u201d Shapiro said in a 2020 podcast interview.",
      "Shapiro owned a flight school called Velocity Aviation and a record label, Velocity Records.",
      "He offered flights in both San Diego and Homer, Alaska, where he and his wife, Julia Pawlik Shapiro, owned a home, according to his online posts.",
      "Shapiro married his wife in 2016 in the small town of Talkeetna, Alaska. They picked up their wedding licenses, got on a plane and flew to a glacier inside Denali National Park, landing with skis strapped to the plane\u2019s wheels.",
      "\u201cWhen I met Dave, we became instantly bonded over the unconventional lifestyles we lead and our constant need for adventure,\u201d she wrote in a blog post.",

      "Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hasn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years",
      "CANNES, France -- Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hadn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "These and other films of Panahi\u2019s premiered to considerable acclaim at international film festivals where the director\u2019s conspicuous absence was sometimes noted by an empty chair. When his last film, 2022\u2019s \u201cNo Bears,\u201d debuted, he was in jail. Only after his hunger strike made worldwide news was Panahi \u2014 who had gone to Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison to inquire about his friend, the then-jailed filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof \u2014 released, in early 2023.",
      "Two years later, with his travel ban finally lifted, Panahi arrived at the Cannes Film Festival with a film, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d riven with the fury and pain of incarceration by the Islamic Republic.",
      "\u201cBeing here does matter, of course. But what\u2019s even more important is that the film is here,\u201d Panahi said in an interview on a Palais terrace. \u201cEven when I went to jail, I was happy that the film was done. I didn\u2019t mind being in prison because my job was done.\u201d",
      "Yet Panahi\u2019s appearance in Cannes, where the film premiered Tuesday, carries tremendous meaning \u2014 and risk \u2014 for a filmmaker who has played such a massive role in international cinema in absentia. But for a director who has previously had his films smuggled out of Iran on USB drives, risk is a constant for Panahi.",
      "\u201cYes, this is an ongoing risk,\u201d he says, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cNow it will probably be higher. But the Iran situation is unpredictable. It changes everyday. New politics everyday. So we have to see what happens the day we go back.\u201d",
      "Last year, in order to reach Cannes, Panahi\u2019s countryman Rasoulof crossed the Iranian border on foot before resettling in Germany. (His film, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig,\u201d was ultimately nominated for best international film at the Oscars.) Panahi says they speak every other day. After the premiere of \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d Rasoulof texted Panahi to congratulate him on the moment.",
      "Unlike Rasoulof, though, Panahi \u2014 whose \u201cNo Bears\u201d captured him emotionally gazing across, but not crossing, the border \u2014 has no plans to flee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m flying back to Tehran on Sunday,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "What Panahi does have, as his latest film shows once again, is the ability to deftly lace complicated feelings of resistance, sorrow and hope into gripping movies of elegant, if heartbreaking, composition.",
      "In \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which is in competition for the Palme d\u2019Or in Cannes, a man named Vahid (played by Vahid Mobasser) believes he sees his former captor and torturer. Though blindfolded while imprisoned, Vahid recognizes the sound of the man's prosthetic leg. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In this strange odyssey, they are all forced to confront revenge or forgiveness for the man who ruined their lives. Panahi drew from his own imprisonment but also from the stories of detainees jailed alongside him.",
      "\u201cIt was the experience of all these people I met in prison, mixed with my own perception and experience,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cFor instance, the fact of never seeing the face of your interrogator is everyone\u2019s experience. But then the people who have spent over a decade in prison have more experience than myself, so I\u2019ve been very sensitive to their narratives.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d may be Panahi\u2019s most politically direct film yet. It\u2019s certainly his most anguished. That\u2019s a product of not just his personal experience in prison but of the protests in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini.",
      "\u201cI think ultimately violence will be inevitable. And it\u2019s exactly what the regime wants, because it gives a justification to the repression,\u201d says Panahi. \u201cThe longer they remain and the more pressure they put on the people, the more the people will feel that they have no other solution. And that\u2019s when it will get dangerous.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Panahi is without hope.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians\u2019 struggle and fight for freedom is extremely precious,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat people are doing is so impressive. The regime is just trying to divide us. That\u2019s all they focus on now, to create division between the people.\u201d",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won't allow him to make the films he wants to. So committed is he to making film, he notes that the downside to being able to travel is that he might have to spend a year promoting his film, instead of making the next one. On Thursday, Neon acquired the North American distribution rights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I can do. Maybe if I had other abilities, I would have changed to something else,\u201d Panahi says. \u201cWhen you know that\u2019s the only thing you can do, you find ways. Now, I\u2019ve gotten used to it. It was harder at the beginning. There were less people doing underground films. We started this fashion, in a way, so there are ways we have learned and practiced, many of us.\u201d",
      "More than perhaps any filmmaker on earth, you can expect Panahi to find a way to keep making movies, no matter the circumstances.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he nods, \u201cat least.\u201d",

      "The music agency Sound Talent Group says three of its employees died on the private plane that crashed into a San Diego neighborhood on Thursday",
      "SAN DIEGO -- A private jet carrying a music talent agent and five others hit a power line in foggy weather early Thursday and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood, slamming into a home and killing multiple people on the flight.",
      "With the home engulfed in flames and jet fuel rolling down the streets, half a dozen vehicles ignited while residents in the neighborhood of U.S. Navy-owned housing were shaken awake just before 4 a.m. by the thunderous crash and subsequent explosions. Out their windows, they saw a wall of fire.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t quite put words to describe what the scene looks like, but with the jet fuel going down the street, and everything on fire all at once, it was pretty horrific to see,\u201d San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said.",
      "No one in the neighborhood died, but eight were taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation and injuries that were not life-threatening, including a person who was hurt climbing out a window, police officer Anthony Carrasco said.",
      "Dave Shapiro, co-founder of Sound Talent Group, and two employees were among those killed, the music agency said in a statement. Sound Talent Group has represented artists including American pop band Hanson, American singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton and the Canadian rock group Sum 41. Hanson is perhaps best known for its earworm 1990s pop hit, \u201cMMMBop.\u201d Shapiro also owned Velocity Records.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends. Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today\u2019s tragedy,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Six people were on board the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Authorities were still combing the scene and recovering the bodies before releasing an official number and identifying the dead, though there were not believed to be any survivors aboard the flight.",
      "Daniel Williams, former drummer for metal band The Devil Wears Prada, posted on his Instagram on Wednesday afternoon that he was boarding the plane with Shapiro. The band posted a tribute to Williams on their Instagram page.",
      "\u201cNo words. We owe you everything. Love you forever,\u201d the band wrote.",
      "A representative for the band referred to their social post when asked about Williams\u2019 death.",
      "Parts of Shapiro\u2019s 1985 Cessna 550 Citation littered a large area, including fragments under the power lines and a section of wing on a road behind the homes, said Elliot Simpson of the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "The home that was struck was destroyed, with its front heavily burned and its roof partially collapsed, and about 10 others were damaged in Murphy Canyon, the largest neighborhood of Navy-owned housing in the country, officials said.",
      "Ben McCarty and his wife, who live in the home that was hit, said they felt heat all around them.",
      "\u201cMy wife was screaming, and she\u2019s like, 'There's a fire,'\u201d McCarty, who has served in the Navy for 13 years, told local ABC affiliate KGTV.",
      "When he walked toward the front of the house, he saw that the roof had fallen off and flames blocked their exit. They grabbed their children and dogs and ran to the back, where their neighbors helped them climb over the fence to escape.",
      "The plane also hit both of the couple's vehicles, which burned.",
      "\u201cIt put my truck into our living room,\u201d McCarty said.",
      "Other vehicles along the block were melted and scorched into burned shells. One stubborn car fire sent smoke billowing up for hours.",
      "Ariya Waterworth said she woke up to a \u201cwhooshing sound\u201d and then saw a giant fireball outside. She screamed for help as firefighters arrived and helped her get out with her two children and their family dog.",
      "One of the family\u2019s cars was \u201ccompletely disintegrated,\u201d and the other had extensive damage. Her yard was littered with plane parts, broken glass and debris.",
      "\u201cI definitely do feel blessed, because we\u2019ve been spared,\u201d she said.",
      "At least 100 residents were evacuated. Hours after the crash, jet fuel rolled down Salmon Street. The smell of fumes lingered throughout the day, and officials said it was unclear when it would be safe for people to return.",
      "\u201cWe have jet fuel all over the place,\u201d Assistant San Diego Fire Department Chief Dan Eddy said.",
      "Eddy added that the fog was so thick in the morning that \u201cyou could barely see in front of you.\u201d",
      "The flight took off from Teterboro, New Jersey, near Manhattan, at about 11:15 p.m. Wednesday and made a fuel stop in Wichita, Kansas, before continuing on to San Diego, according to Simpson.",
      "Based on the flight path, it was bound for Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport when it struck power lines about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) southeast of the airfield, Simpson said.",
      "Audio recorded by www.liveATC.net includes a brief transmission from the pilot saying he was on final approach to the airport and was about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) out at 3:45 a.m.",
      "NTSB investigators planned to spend Thursday and Friday at the scene gathering evidence, Simpson said. He welcomed video or other details from any witnesses.",
      "At that hour and in foggy weather, the plane was likely operating on an instrument flight rules plan, which is typically used during reduced visibility, said Barry Newman, a board-certified aviation attorney.",
      "However, for that airport, once an aircraft reaches 673 feet (205 meters), the pilot also has to rely on sight.",
      "\u201cIf a pilot descends to that level and he can\u2019t see the runway, he has to call for a missed approach or divert to another airport,\u201d Newman said.",
      "In October 2021 a twin-engine plane plowed into a San Diego suburb, killing the pilot and a UPS delivery driver on the ground and burning homes. It was preparing to land at the airport.",
      "And in December 2008, a Marine Corps fighter jet slammed into a house in San Diego\u2019s University City neighborhood, causing an explosion that killed four people inside. The Marine Corps blamed the crash on mechanical failure and human error.",

    "story": [
      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering day in early 1952 in Algiers",
      "PARIS -- Decades before transgender became a household word and \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d became a worldwide hit \u2014 before visibility brought rights and recognition \u2014 there was Bambi, the Parisian icon who danced for Hollywood.",
      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering summer day in early 1950s Algeria. An effeminate teenage boy named Jean-Pierre Pruvot stood mesmerized as traffic halted and crowds swarmed around a scandalous spectacle unfolding in the conservative Algiers streets.",
      "All had stopped to look at Coccinelle, the flamboyant \u201ctransvestite\u201d star of Paris\u2019 legendary cabaret, the Carrousel de Paris, who strutted defiantly down the boulevard, impeccably dressed as a woman, sparking awe and outrage and literally stopping traffic.",
      "What Pruvot \u2014 who would become famous under the female stage name \u201cBambi\u201d and Coccinelle\u2019s best friend \u2014 witnessed was more than mere performance. It was an act of resistance from the ashes of the Nazi persecution of the LGBTQ+ community in World War II.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that (identity) existed,\u201d Bambi told The Associated Press in a rare interview. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to do the same.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Carrousel troupe in the late 1940s emerged as a glamorous, audacious resistance. Bambi soon joined Coccinelle, April Ashley, and Capucine in Paris to revive queer visibility in Europe for the first time since the Nazis had violently destroyed Berlin\u2019s thriving queer scene of the 1930s.",
      "The Nazis branded gay men with pink triangles, deported and murdered thousands, erasing queer culture overnight. Just a few years after the war, Carrousel performers strode onto the global stage, a glittering frontline against lingering prejudice.",
      "Remarkably, audiences at the Carrousel knew exactly who these performers were \u2014 women who, as Bambi puts it, \u201cwould bare all.\u201d",
      "Elvis Presley, Ava Gardner, \u00c9dith Piaf, Maria Callas and Marlene Dietrich all flocked to the cabaret, drawn to the allure of performers labeled \u201ctravestis.\u201d The stars sought out the Carrousel to flirt with postwar Paris\u2019s wild side. It was an intoxicating contradiction: cross-dressing was criminalized, yet the venue was packed with celebrities.",
      "The history of queer liberation shifted in this cabaret, one sequin at a time. The contrast was chilling: as Bambi arrived in Paris and found fame dancing naked for film stars, across the English Channel in early 1950s Britain the code-breaking genius Alan Turing was chemically castrated for being gay, leading to his suicide.",
      "Today, Marie-Pierre Pruvot \u2014 as she is also known \u2014 lives alone in an unassuming apartment in northeastern Paris. Her bookshelves spill over with volumes of literature and philosophy. A black feather boa, a lone whisper from her glamorous past, hangs loosely over a chair.",
      "At nearly 90, Bambi is the last of a dying generation. She outlived all her Carrousel sisters \u2014 April Ashley, Capucine, and Coccinelle.",
      "And though the spotlight faded, the legacy still shimmers.",
      "In her heyday, Bambi wasn\u2019t just part of the show; she was the show \u2014 with expressive almond-shaped eyes, pear-shaped face, and beauty indistinguishable from any desired Parisienne. Yet one key difference set her apart \u2014 a difference criminalized by French law.",
      "The depth of her history only becomes apparent as she points to striking and glamorous photographs and recounts evenings spent with legends.",
      "Such was their then-fame that the name of Bambi\u2019s housemate, Coccinelle, became slang for \"trans\" in Israel \u2014 often cruelly.",
      "Once Dietrich, the starry queer icon, arrived at the tiny Madame Arthur cabaret alongside Jean Marais, the actor and Jean Cocteau 's gay lover. \u201cIt was packed,\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cJean Marais instantly said, \u2018Sit (me and Marlene) on stage' And so they were seated onstage, legs crossed, champagne by their side, watching us perform.\u201d",
      "Another day, Dietrich swept in to a hair salon.",
      "\u201cMarlene always had this distant, untouchable air \u2014 except when late for the hairdresser,\u201d Bambi says, smiling. \u201cShe rushed in, kissed the hairdresser, settled beneath the dryer, stretched her long legs imperiously onto a stool, and lit a cigarette. Her gaunt pout as she smoked \u2014 I\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she says, her impression exaggerated as she sucked in her cheeks. Perhaps Dietrich wasn\u2019t her favorite star.",
      "Then there was Piaf, who, one evening, teasingly joked about her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the French singing legend Charles Aznavour, performing nearby. \u201cShe asked, \u2018What time does Aznavour start?\u2019\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cSomeone said, \u2018Midnight.\u2019 So she joked, \u2018Then it\u2019ll be finished by five past midnight.\u2019\"",
      "Behind the glamour lay constant danger. Living openly as a woman was illegal. \u201cThere was a police decree,\u201d Bambi recalls. \u201cIt was a criminal offense for a man to dress as a woman. But if you wore pants and flat shoes, you weren\u2019t considered dressed as a woman.\u201d",
      "The injustice was global. Homosexuality remained criminalized for decades: in Britain until 1967, in parts of the U.S. until 2003. Progress came slowly.",
      "In 1950s Paris, though, Bambi bought hormones casually over-the-counter, \u201clike salt and pepper at the grocery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was much freer then,\u201d but stakes were high, she said.",
      "Sisters were jailed, raped, driven into sex work. One comrade died after botched gender reassignment surgery in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cThere was only Casablanca,\u201d she emphasized, with one doctor performing the high-risk surgeries. Bambi waited cautiously until her best friends, Coccinelle and April Ashley, had safely undergone procedures from the late 50s before doing the same herself.",
      "Each night required extraordinary courage. Post-war Paris was scarred, haunted. The Carrousel wasn\u2019t mere entertainment \u2014 but a one-fingered salute to the past in heels and eyeliner.",
      "\u201cThere was this after-the-war feeling \u2014 people wanted to have fun,\u201d Bambi recalled. With no television, the cabarets were packed every night. \u201cYou could feel it \u2014 people demanded to laugh, to enjoy themselves, to be happy. They wanted to live again \u2026 to forget the miseries of the war.\u201d",
      "In 1974, sensing a shift, Bambi quietly stepped away from celebrity, unwilling to become \u201can aging showgirl.\u201d Swiftly obtaining legal female identity in Algeria, she became a respected teacher and Sorbonne scholar, hiding her dazzling past beneath Marcel Proust and careful anonymity for decades.",
      "Despite what she\u2019s witnessed, or perhaps because of it, she\u2019s remarkably skeptical about recent controversies around gender. This transgender pioneer feels wokeism has moved too quickly, fueling a backlash.",
      "She sees U.S. President Donald Trump as part of \u201ca global reaction against wokeism\u2026 families aren\u2019t ready\u2026 we need to pause and breathe a little before moving forward again.\u201d",
      "Inclusive pronouns and language \u201ccomplicate the language,\u201d she insists. Asked about author J.K. Rowling\u2019s anti-trans stance, her response is calmly dismissive: \u201cHer opinion counts no more than a baker\u2019s or a cleaning lady\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Bambi still stands \u2014 proud, elegant, unbowed \u2014 in a life spanning World War II to \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d",
      "When she first stepped onstage, the world had no words for someone like her. So she danced anyway. Today, the words exist. So do the rights. And the movements she helped inspire.",
      "\u201cI never wore a mask,\u201d she says softly, but firmly. \u201cExcept when I was a boy.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kid Cudi is the latest celebrity being called to testify at Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u2032 sex trafficking trial in New York.",
      "The popular melodic rapper is expected to take the stand Thursday and tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "According to court filings and testimony, the Cassie-Cudi relationship, which grew out of the two working on music together, sent Combs into rages in which he beat her. Prosecutors contend that Combs was so upset he arranged to have Cudi\u2019s convertible firebombed.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his status as a power broker to abuse women.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the 41-year-old Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi.",
      "The Cleveland born-and-raised, skinny-jean wearing, Grammy Award-winning rapper has long been celebrated for his alternative hip-hop, emotional music that effortlessly weaves genres together in surprising ways.",
      "Music blogs and other tastemakers quickly caught on to Cudi's 2007 single, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite,\u201d with its unique singsong style that later appeared on his blockbuster 2009 debut, \u201cMan on the Moon: The End of the Day\u201d as \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite (Nightmare).\" The album's hits included \u201cPursuit of Happiness (Nightmare)\u201d and is easily one of the most influential rap records of the last two decades. In September, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite\u201d was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America.",
      "Cudi began as something of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West, when the then-uncontroversial rapper signed Cudi to his G.O.O.D. Music label in 2008. Cudi left in 2013.",
      "He is featured on Jay-Z's \u201cThe Blueprint 3\u201d and West's landmark \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d Cudi has always had an eye and ear toward innovation. In 2022, his album \u201cEntergalactic\u201d was released alongside a Netflix adult-animated romantic comedy of the same name, which he told The Associated Press allowed him to \u201cexplore the abstract.\u201d",
      "Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, has been the trial\u2019s central witness with her accounts of years of violence and sexual abuse.",
      "She testified that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi in 2011 to work on music. The two began dating soon after, and she said she got a burner phone to communicate with Cudi in secret.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in sex parties that Combs orchestrated. It was during one of these that Combs looked at her phone and learned of the Cudi relationship, Cassie testified.",
      "In response, she said he lunged at her with a corkscrew and kicked her in the back.",
      "When Cassie and Combs were out of the country in 2012, Combs told her that Cudi\u2019s car would be blown up and Combs wanted Cudi\u2019s friends there to see it, Cassie testified.",
      "On Tuesday, Cassie\u2019s mother, Regina Ventura, testified that Cassie told her Combs was so angry about her relationship with Cudi that he planned to release sexually explicit videos of her and send someone to hurt Cassie and Cudi.",
      "Cassie testified that Cudi came to visit her at her mother\u2019s Connecticut home around Christmas in 2011 and she broke up with him, fearing for both of their safety.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has.",
      "His latest album, \u201cInsano,\u201d arrived last year. Soon after its release, \u201cInsano (Nitro Mega),\u201d a partner record that featured Wiz Khalifa, Pusha T, Steve Aoki and more, arrived.",
      "On May 9, Cudi released his latest single, \u201cNeverland.\u201d A short film of the same name, directed by Ti West and produced by Monkeypaw Productions, will premiere at Tribeca Film Festival this June.",
      "Also in May, Cudi officially launched his new apparel label, WZRD.",
      "Daring fashion has been a longtime passion for Cudi; the rapper has partnered with brands such as BAPE and Adidas. He collaborated with the late designer Virgil Abloh, and in 2021 channeled Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain by wearing an Abloh-designed Off-White floral dress on stage at \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "Last week, he announced his engagement to menswear designer Lola Abecassis Sartore.",

      "\u201cAs you prepare to take this big leap into real life, here's a little advice \u2014 if you're willing to listen to a frog,\" the beloved Muppet said. \u201cRather than jumping over someone to get what you want, consider reaching out your hand and taking the leap side by side, because life is better when we leap together.\u201d",

The quest takes them to far-flung places from Vienna to the pyramids, as they try to evade capture by the authorities and a shadowy operation intent on stopping the search.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been looking to watch this movie for years,\u201d Krasinski said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThis is the movie I pretended to be in when I was a kid. This is what got me into the business.\u201d",
      "The film also stars Domnhall Gleeson as the wealthy businessman funding the operation and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez as one of the protectors of the Fountain of Youth.",
      "\u201c Guy Ritchie gets to work with some of the best cast in the world,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, who has now worked with him three times. \u201cThe biggest gift Guy has given me, besides the privilege of working with him, is working with them.\u201d",
      "Gleeson, a newcomer to the world of Ritchie, was pretty sure that it was going to be as enjoyable as it looked. And he got a vote of confidence from his director.",
      "\u201cGuy basically said, if you\u2019re not having fun, then this is not going to work and so the idea is to turn up and have fun,\u201d Gleeson said.",
      "There were a lot of things about \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d that piqued Portman\u2019s interest. The chance to work with Ritchie, Krasinski, and the rest of the cast, as well as the travel, but it also felt like something she could share with her own son and daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rare to get to make a movie that has this scale and this scope of adventure that you can watch with your kids,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for something that I can enjoy with my children.\u201d",

We meet her amid a contentious divorce and custody battle over her 12-year-old son, and she\u2019s not exactly pleased when Luke steals a piece of art from her gallery and attempts to recruit her for the bigger mission. But soon, she\u2019s in scuba gear hunting down a lost Rembrandt in the wreckage of the RMS Lusitania.",
      "\u201cI think that something we search for as adults is how to regain that youthful spirit, how to hold onto that youthful energy and freedom and wildness, even when having to move into some adult responsibilities,\u201d said Portman, who, like her character is recently divorced. \u201cMaybe that can make you a better parent to have a little bit of that glint in your eye.\u201d",
      "She and Krasinski, working together for the first time, fell into the sibling dynamics easily.",
      "\u201cThese movies sort of live and die with the relationships,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cThe sibling thing really only works if you\u2019re having genuine fun with the person and it can come off screen. And I laughed with her every single day. She\u2019s so funny.\u201d",
      "Globe-trotting films aren\u2019t just travelogues for the audience, but their own sort of adventure for the cast and crew. This production earned their miles, skipping between the streets of Bangkok and Liverpool, the Austrian National Library in Vienna and Cairo to film at the great pyramids \u2014 where \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d became the first film of this scale to be granted the privilege to shoot action sequences there.",
      "\u201cIt was really a pinch me kind of moment to be like, oh, those are the pyramids and we\u2019re just hanging out here and walking into them and filming in them,\u201d Portman said.",
      "The big first was landing a Boeing Chinook CH47 helicopter in front of the Giza Plateau, and blowing up a jeep, all while the site remained open to tourists.",
      "\u201cWith any luck, we didn\u2019t blow it for Hollywood going back there for somebody else,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cBut if we did, at least we got to do it.\u201d",
      "Most of the big action moments \u201cinside\u201d the pyramids were saved for the safety of sets constructed at London\u2019s Leavesden Studio, where they also built the wreckage of the Lusitania in a water tank so big that it took two weeks to fill.",
      "\u201cFountain of Youth\u201d might seem like the type of movie that would be a natural fit for the big screen: A big budget, global adventure with major stars and sweeping vistas. While Krasinski champions movie theaters \u2014 at the time of the interview, he had a ticket to see \u201cSinners\u201d on IMAX the next day \u2014 he\u2019s also not feeling bittersweet that this one won\u2019t be playing at the multiplex. They all came into \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d knowing that it was a streaming-first endeavor.",
      "\u201cThis was always going to be a streaming movie, so I didn\u2019t really think about it in terms of ... Would people want to see it in theaters because it was just one of those things,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the new reality. There are definitely movies that are being made for streaming, and there are movies being made for theatrical.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIt all depends on what the filmmaker\u2019s intent was, what the studio\u2019s intent and I think as long as those rules are laid out clearly in the beginning, I\u2019m down for either one.\u201d",

      "Haitians with HIV are defying stigma as they publicly denounce USAID cuts implemented by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump that has led to a dwindling of life-saving medication",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- A video showing dozens of people marching toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister elicited gasps from some viewers as it circulated recently on social media. The protesters, who were HIV positive, did not conceal their faces \u2014 a rare occurrence in a country where the virus is still heavily stigmatized.",
      "\u201cCall the minister of health! We are dying!\u201d the group chanted.",
      "The protesters risked being shunned by society to warn that Haiti is running out of HIV medication just months after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump slashed more than 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall aid across the globe.",
      "At a hospital near the northern city of Cap-Haitien, Dr. Eugene Maklin said he struggles to share that reality with his more than 550 HIV patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to them, to tell them that they\u2019re not going to find medication,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a suicide.\u201d",
      "More than 150,000 people in Haiti have HIV or AIDS, according to official estimates, although nonprofits believe the number is much higher.",
      "David Jeune, a 46-year-old hospital community worker, is among them. He became infected 19 years ago after having unprotected sex. \u201cI was scared to let people know because they would point their finger at you, saying you are infecting others with AIDS,\u201d he said.",
      "His fear was so great that he didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even his mother. But that fear dissipated with the support Jeune said he received from nonprofits. His confidence grew to the point where he participated in Monday\u2019s protest.",
      "\u201cI hope Trump will change his mind,\u201d he said, noting that his medication will run out in November. \u201cLet the poor people get the medication they need.\u201d",
      "Patrick Jean No\u00ebl, a representative of Haiti\u2019s Federation of Associations of HIV, said that at least five clinics, including one that served 2,500 patients, were forced to close after the USAID funding cuts.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t stay silent,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people need to come out.\u201d",
      "But most people with HIV in Haiti are reluctant to do so, said Dr. Sabine Lustin, executive director of the Haiti-based nonprofit Promoters of Zero AIDS Goal.",
      "The stigma is so strong that many patients are reluctant to pick up their medication in person. Instead, it is sent via packages wrapped as gifts to not arouse suspicion, Lustin said.",
      "Lustin\u2019s organization, which helps some 2,000 people across Haiti, receives funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While their funding hasn\u2019t been cut, she said that shortly after Trump was sworn in, the agency banned prevention activities because they targeted a group that is not a priority. By that, Lustin said she understood they were referring to gay men.",
      "That means the organization can no longer distribute up to 200,000 free condoms a year or educate people about the disease.",
      "\u201cYou risk an increase in infections,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a young population who is sexually active who can\u2019t receive the prevention message and don\u2019t have access to condoms.\u201d",
      "On a recent sunny morning, a chorus of voices drowned out the din of traffic in Haiti\u2019s capital, growing louder as protesters with HIV marched defiantly toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister.",
      "\u201cWe are here to tell the government that we exist, and we are people like any other person,\u201d one woman told reporters.",
      "Another marching alongside her said, \u201cWithout medication, we are dying. This needs to change.\u201d",
      "Three days after Monday's protest, the leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council, Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles, announced that he had met with activists and would try to secure funding.",
      "Meanwhile, nonprofit organizations across Haiti are fretting.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said Marie Denis-Luque, founder and executive director of CHOAIDS, a nonprofit that cares for Haitian orphans with HIV/AIDS. \u201cWe only have medication until July.\u201d",
      "Her voice broke as she described her frantic search for donations for the orphans, who are cared for by HIV-positive women in Cap-Haitien after gang violence forced them to leave Port-au-Prince.",
      "Denis-Luque said she has long advocated for the orphans\u2019 visibility.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hiding these children. They are part of society,\u201d she said, adding that she smiled when she saw the video of Monday\u2019s protest. \u201cI was like, whoa, things have changed tremendously. The stigma is real, but I think what I saw \u2026 was very encouraging to me. They can\u2019t be silenced.\u201d",
      "Experts say Haiti could see a rise in HIV infections because medications are dwindling at a time that gang violence and poverty are surging.",
      "Dr. Alain Casseus, infectious disease division chief at Zamni Lasante, the largest non-governmental healthcare provider in Haiti, said they expected to see a surge in patients given the funding cuts, but that hasn\u2019t happened because traveling by land in Haiti is dangerous since violent gangs control main roads and randomly open fire on vehicles.",
      "He warned that abruptly stopping medication is dangerous, especially because many Haitians do not have access or cannot afford nutritious food to strengthen their immune system.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take long, especially given the situation in Haiti, to enter a very bad phase,\u201d he said of HIV infections. And even if some funding becomes available, a lapse in medication could cause resistance to it, he said.",
      "Casseus said gang violence also could accelerate the rates of infection via rapes or physical violence as medication runs out.",
      "At the New Hope Hospital run by Maklin in Haiti\u2019s northern region, shelves are running empty. He used to receive more than $165,000 a year to help HIV/AIDS patients. But that funding has dried up.",
      "\u201cThose people are going to die,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how or where we\u2019re going to get more medication.\u201d",
      "The medication controls the infection and allows many to have an average life expectancy. Without it, the virus attacks a person\u2019s immune system, and they develop AIDS, the late stage of an HIV infection.",
      "Reaction is swift when Dr. Maklin tells his patients that in two months, the hospital won\u2019t have any HIV medication left.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018No, no, no, no!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to keep living.\u201d",

      "Also an avid runner, Rizvi has completed two marathons and although jogging with a guide is great, tennis offers more.",
      "\u201cOn a tennis court, I have absolute freedom because I know where the boundaries are, no one needs to tell me which way to turn, I don\u2019t need to have a cane or anything of this sort,\" he told The Associated Press during a practice session at the National Tennis Center in southwest London.",
      "\"It\u2019s just the absolute sense of freedom to know that I can run comfortably, make my own decisions, and then be able to play points or rallies. It\u2019s just incredible.\u201d",
      "The rules are basically the same as mainstream tennis just with smaller dimensions and slightly lower net. Tactile lines are taped onto the court so players like Rizvi can feel the boundaries. Depending on the level of visual impairment, you are allowed up to three bounces of the ball. The foam ball contains a bell so players can audibly track it.",
      "\u201cWhat I find interesting about blind tennis is it\u2019s incredibly technical,\u201d said Rizvi, who also possesses a big serve.",
      "The problem-solving aspect of the sport is something Rizvi enjoys \u2014 no surprise given that he studied engineering at University College London.",

      "\u201cI can almost assure you that if you did a survey of blind and partially sighted people,\" he said, \"the majority of them wouldn\u2019t have any idea because it\u2019s not televised, it\u2019s not in any other mainstream events, so how are people supposed to find out?\u201d",
      "The Lawn Tennis Association supports a visually impaired program that includes practice sessions at the governing body's National Tennis Center. That's where Jack Draper, the world No. 5 player, tried out the different levels. The LTA also runs tournaments each year and sends \u201cTeam GB\u201d to an international competition.",
      "Rizvi noted that there's not much financial backing in the sport. There's no prize money at tournaments and players often fund their own travel.",
      "\u201cUnless you obviously have the visibility and the money behind it, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cGoverning bodies need to take a more active role and try and give parity to all forms of disability tennis not just the ones that have made it big like wheelchair tennis, for example.\u201d",
      "Rizvi, who is married and works in finance, originally represented his native Pakistan but for the past year has been part of England's program since gaining British citizenship.

      "Reproductive rights advocates are suing Arizona to unravel several laws regulating abortion access in the state",
      "PHOENIX -- Reproductive rights advocates sued Arizona on Thursday to unravel several laws regulating abortion in the state.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by two providers in the state and the Arizona Medical Association. It comes more than six months after voters enshrined in the state constitution access to abortions up to fetal viability, which is the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the uterus.",
      "The advocates are seeking to undo laws including those that bar abortions sought based on genetic abnormalities, require informed consent in-person at least 24 hours before the procedure and offer an opportunity to view the ultrasound, and prohibit abortion medication delivered by mail and the use of tele-health for abortion care.",
      "\u201cThese stigmatizing and medically unnecessary abortion restrictions violate the right to reproductive freedom established by Arizona voters last November, and it\u2019s time for them to go,\u201d Rebecca Chan, staff attorney for the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. \u201cArizonans are perfectly capable of making decisions about their own reproductive futures.\"",
      "The state attorney general's office is reviewing the complaint, and an agency spokesperson noted that state law should be in line with the amendment approved by voters last November.

      "It would require many low-income adults to work to receive Medicaid health insurance coverage and more to work to get food assistance, require hospitals to verify the citizenship status of patients, and cut funding for services like birth control to the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Supporters of the bill say the moves will save money, root out waste and encourage personal responsibility.",
      "A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.",
      "The measure, which also includes tax cuts, passed the House by one vote and could have provisions reworked again as it heads to the Senate.",
      "Here's a look at the potential impact.",
      "Starting next year, many able-bodied Medicaid enrollees will be required to show that they work in exchange for the health insurance coverage.",
      "While about 92% of people enrolled now meet the requirement, roughly 5 million would likely lose their coverage, according to previous estimates of an earlier version of the bill provided by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Increased eligibility checks and red tape related to work requirements may result in some people wrongly getting booted off, said Eduardo Conrado, the president of Ascension, a health care system that operates hospitals across 10 states.",
      "That could spell trouble for rural hospitals, in particular, who will see their small pool of patients go from paying for their emergency care with Medicaid coverage to not paying anything at all. Hospitals could have to eat their costs.",
      "\u201cAdding work requirements is not just a policy change, it\u2019s a shift away from the purpose of the program,\u201d Conrado said of the rule.",
      "Only Arkansas has had a work requirement that kicks people off for noncompliance. More than 18,000 lost coverage after it kicked in in 2018, and the programs was later blocked by federal courts.",
      "Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families, said work requirements do not result in more people having jobs \u2014 but in fewer people having health insurance.",
      "\u201cIf you lose your job going forward, good luck to you,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a good chance you\u2019re going to be uninsured because of this bill.\u201d",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, already requires work for some of its roughly 42 million recipients. Adults ages 18-54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents must work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month, or else be limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation passed by the House would raise the work requirement to age 65 and also extend it to parents without children younger than age 7. The bill also would limit the ability to waive work requirements in areas with unemployment rates significantly above the national average.",
      "The combination of those changes could put 6 million adults at risk of losing SNAP benefits, according to the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Like work requirements for Medicaid, those for SNAP tend to cause a decrease in participation without increasing employment, according to an April report by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Hamilton Project.",
      "Under the bill, the federal government would punish states that use their own state dollars to provide Medicaid-covered services to immigrants lacking legal status or to provide subsidies to help them buy health insurance.",
      "Some states that provide that sort of coverage extend it only to children.",
      "Those states would see federal funding for the Medicaid expansion population \u2014 typically low-income adults \u2014 drop from 90% to 80%.",
      "That could mean states pull back that Medicaid coverage to avoid the federal penalty.",
      "\u201cIf that penalty of 10% is imposed, we would expect that states will have to drop that coverage,\u201d said Georgetown's Alker.",
      "KFF said the provision could affect 14 states and Washington, D.C., that cover children regardless of their immigration status.",
      "This month the Democratic governor of one of them \u2014 California's Gavin Newsom \u2014 announced a plan to freeze new enrollments in state-funded health care for immigrants who do not have legal status as a budget-balancing measure.",

      "Government vaccine advisers are meeting to decide if the recipe for COVID-19 vaccines needs updating for this fall and winter",
      "WASHINGTON -- Government advisers are meeting Thursday to decide if COVID-19 vaccines need updating to improve protection this fall and winter \u2014 even as a new Trump administration policy has thrown into question who may be eligible for shots.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s outside experts have met regularly since the launch of the first COVID-19 vaccines to discuss tweaking their recipes to stay ahead of the virus. Thursday\u2019s meeting is the group's first since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "But it comes just two days after FDA leaders upended the prior U.S. policy of recommending annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.",
      "Instead, the FDA said routine approval of COVID-19 boosters will be limited to seniors and to younger people who are at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to do new studies to show whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people younger than 65.",
      "That has big implications for the fall vaccination campaign, with uncertainty over whether healthy people still could get a vaccine even if it's not recommended for them \u2014 or whether insurers will keep paying for the shots for everyone. Nor is it clear what the policy means for babies who have never been vaccinated.",
      "\u201cThis is a mess,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert. \u201cThe one thing we don't want to do is put a barrier in place that prevents parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to.\u201d",
      "The FDA deflected questions about the new policy at Thursday's meeting to decide whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. The committee\u2019s recommendation is nonbinding guidance ahead of an agency decision.",
      "Last fall\u2019s recipe was tailored to omicron descendants on the JN.1 branch of the virus family tree. Novavax brewed shots targeting the parent JN.1 variant while Pfizer and Moderna opted for a subtype called KP.2.",
      "With JN.1 descendants still dominating worldwide, Pfizer and Moderna representatives told panelists Thursday that their current vaccines remain effective, although switching to a newer subtype, LP.8.1, could provide even more protection. Novavax said sticking with the parent strain JN.1 \u2014 the company\u2019s current vaccine formula \u2014 might be best.",
      "The challenge for regulators is there's no way to predict how the virus will evolve by the time fall vaccinations begin.",
      "The World Health Organization recently issued guidance that last year's version remained OK but that vaccine-makers could also choose an update. A representative for the organization told FDA panelists that current data on the COVID-19's continuing evolution might not yet warrant switching to a newer subtype. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency recently recommended targeting the newest subtype.",
      "While demand for vaccinations has dropped, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 30,000 to 50,000 adults have died from COVID-19 since October. The virus continues to cause \u201cenormous burden\u201d on the health care system, CDC\u2019s Dr. Fiona Havers told panelists. Older adults count for most hospitalizations and deaths but COVID-19 also is \u201ca major cause of pediatric hospitalization,\u201d especially in children under 2 -- many of whom had no underlying medical problems before their infections.",
      "The strain decision normally isn't the final word on recommendations about who should be vaccinated.",
      "The CDC's own advisory panel meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are keeping universal access or recommending vaccination for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice in getting a shot.",
      "CDC staffers presented real-world data Thursday showing that getting a booster last fall offered added protection even in people who had been infected and previously vaccinated. Company studies reached the same conclusion \u2014 including one by Moderna that compared medical records of about 900,000 people.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A highly-anticipated White House report about childhood diseases has provoked a tug-of-war pitting farmers and some prominent Republican lawmakers against health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement ahead of its release.",
      "President Donald Trump promised a review within 100 days that would analyze the ramifications that U.S. lifestyle \u2014 from the medications prescribed for children to the food served on their school lunch trays \u2014 has on childhood diseases like obesity, depression or attention deficit disorder. The report, led by a so-called \u201cMAHA Commission,\u201d is expected to be released on Thursday.",
      "Farmers and Republicans are nervous about what the report might say about glyphosate, the ingredient commonly used in pesticides sprayed on crops. Kennedy has denied the report will be unfavorable to farmers.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley warned that farmers have reached out to him, upset they have not been able to provide input on the MAHA report ahead of its release.",
      "\u201cI hope there is nothing in the MAHA report that jeopardizes the food supply or the livelihood of farmers,\u201d Grassley said.",
      "Last month, a group of 79 Republicans \u2014 including several senators who represent farming states \u2014 echoed similar concerns about the report saying in a letter to Kennedy that without the products agricultural \u201cyields and quantity are negatively impacted.\u201d",
      "Glyphosate has been available for about 50 years and some farmers say it remains essential for controlling weeds without excessive tilling, helping to conserve both soil and fuel.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we still use: It works,\u201d said Blake Hurst, a Missouri farmer who is past president of the Missouri Farm Bureau.",
      "Kennedy, though, has built a sizable following over many decades, in part, because of the lawsuits he's waged against corporations, including the company that produced weedkiller Roundup. The World Health Organization has labeled that product's key ingredient, glyphosate, as a probable carcinogen for humans.",
      "On Wednesday a large group of his supporters sent Kennedy a letter calling on the commission to \u201chold the chemical industry\u201d accountable in the report, noting that pressure is mounting.",
      "\u201cEvidence is piling up and the risks from pesticide exposure are undeniable,\u201d the letter, signed by 360 self-proclaimed MAHA supporters that include farmers, former Kennedy campaign staffers and those who worked with him at his anti-vaccine nonprofit.",
      "Dave Murphy, a fundraiser for Kennedy's failed presidential bid, said that he submitted studies and comments on pesticides to Trump administration officials for inclusion in the MAHA report but said that there's \u201ca lot of pressure within Washington\u201d over what the final report says on the issue.",
      "During a senate hearing on Wednesday, Kennedy rebutted concerns from Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith that the report would \u201cunfairly\u201d target farmers.",
      "\u201cThere's not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer,\u201d Kennedy said of his report. \u201cWe are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\u201d",
      "Kennedy was appearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee to discuss the White House's proposed budget, which would give a $500 million boost for Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. That same proposal also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and medical research programs.",
      "In February, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Make America Healthy Again Commission tasked with examining the \u201cthreat\u201d that prescription drugs, chemicals and certain food ingredients pose to children.",
      "That review was supposed to be led by several members of the president's cabinet, including Kennedy, Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Kennedy, who has pledged \u201cradical transparency\u201d since taking over the nation's health department, never convened a public meeting of the commission. The White House only released brief, edited clips from a single, closed-door meeting of the commission held in March.",
      "A White House spokesman called the report, which has not been released, a \u201chistoric step,\u201d without sharing further details.",

      "A person attended a Shakira concert at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey while infectious with measles",
      "New Jersey health officials are asking people who went to last week's Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium to monitor for measles symptoms because a person went to see the singer while infectious.",
      "There is no confirmed outbreak in New Jersey, but the U.S. and North America are seeing high measles activity this year \u2014 including hundreds sickened by the highly infectious airborne virus in West Texas \u2014 and declining rates of people getting the vaccine, which is 97% effective after two doses.",
      "Schools and daycares are among the most common places for measles exposures, like one that happened in three western North Dakota public schools in early May that led to all unvaccinated students being held at home for 21 days under state law.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the measles and how to protect yourself.",
      "Most U.S. children get vaccinated against measles before entering public school, but increasing numbers of people skipping shots for religious or personal reasons have fueled outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad this year.",
      "Overall, the U.S. has seen more than 1,000 measles cases across 30 states since the beginning of the year, and 11 states with outbreaks \u2014 defined as three or more related cases. The largest outbreak in the U.S. has been in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. There are also large outbreaks in Mexico and Canada.",
      "It's a respiratory disease caused by one of the world\u2019s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.",
      "\u201cOn average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,\u201d said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s only a few viruses that even come close to that.\u201d",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",
      "People who have had measles once can\u2019t get it again, health officials say.",
      "It usually doesn\u2019t kill people, but it can.",
      "Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.",
      "Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis \u2014 which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.",
      "\u201cChildren develop the most severe illness,\" said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \"The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.\u201d",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cBefore a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got\u201d measles, Weaver said. There is \u201cgreat data\u201d on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades.",
      "\u201cAny of these outbreaks we\u2019re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we\u2019re not going to see this happening in the future. And we\u2019ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.\u201d",
      "Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Not usually. People who are vaccinated are considered protected against measles for their lifetime.",
      "Health care providers can test for antibodies and give boosters if needed.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\u201d",
      "Weaver said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.",

      "Emotional well-being",
      "NEW YORK -- Marian Rivman is pushing 80. Harriet Luria is a proud 83. In this trio, Carol Leister is the baby at 62. Together, they have decades of experience with yoga. Only now, it involves a chair.",
      "Chair yoga adapts traditional yoga poses for older people and others with physical challenges, but the three devotees said after a recent class that doesn't mean it's not a quality workout. As older adults have become more active, chair yoga has grown in popularity.",
      "\u201cYou're stretching your whole body,\u201d Rivman offered. \u201cWhat you can do in the chair is a little bit more forgiving on the knees and on the hips. So as you age, it allows you to get into positions that you were doing before without hurting yourself.\u201d",
      "Sitting down to exercise, or standing while holding onto a chair to perform some poses, may not sound like a workout, but Rivman, Luria, Leister and practitioners everywhere see a world of benefits.",
      "\u201cI took it up because I have osteoporosis and the chair yoga is much easier,\u201d Luria said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry as much about falling and breaking anything. It's not as difficult as I thought it would be, but it\u2019s not easy. And you really do use your muscles. It\u2019s an excellent workout.\u201d",
      "Chair yoga is clearly marketed to older women, who made up the class where the three yoga friends got together at the Marlene Meyerson JCC on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. But the practice also has a lot to offer others, said their instructor, Whitney Chapman.",
      "Desk workers can squeeze in 15 minutes of chair yoga, for instance. Many companies offer it as a way to cut down on stress and improve overall health. And people recovering from surgery or injuries may not be ready to get down on a yoga mat, but they can stretch in a chair.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known these ladies probably 18 to 20 years. And the very first time in a yoga class that I brought in the chair, all of my students said I don\u2019t want geriatric yoga. I\u2019m not an old person,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "\u201cAnd then they saw that having a chair is just as good as a yoga strap, a yoga block. It\u2019s another prop that\u2019s going to help you do what you want to do. So it\u2019s not necessarily because you\u2019re older, but that it can be helpful. And it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re geriatric just because you\u2019re sitting in a chair.\u201d",
      "The benefits are many, Chapman said: improved flexibility, strength, balance. And there's the overall emotional well-being that yoga practitioners in general report. It's particularly useful for people with mobility issues or chronic ailments like arthritis or back pain. Chapman also teaches yoga to cancer and Parkinson's disease patients.",
      "In addition to restorative and other benefits, the practice of chair yoga can help improve posture for people of all ages and abilities, and help older people prevent falls.",
      "Leister recently retired.",
      "\u201cI've been looking for all different kinds of exercises to do and this is one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one that I could see doing for the rest of my life, where some that are a little more strenuous I may not be able to do in the future.\u201d",
      "Traditional yoga originated more than 5,000 years ago in India. Many of the poses used today are also that old. It can be as much spiritual as physical, and that also goes for its chair descendant. The precise movements are tied to deliberate, cleansing breathwork.",
      "Rivman has been doing yoga for about 50 years.",
      "\u201cOnce you start and you get what it does for your body, you don\u2019t want to give it up. And if there\u2019s a way that you can keep doing it and keep doing it safely, that\u2019s a choice you\u2019re going to make,\u201d she said.",
      "The practice of yoga, including chair yoga, has been on the rise in the U.S. over the last 20 years. In 2022, the percentage of adults age 18 and older who practiced yoga in the past 12 months was 16.9%, with percentages highest among women ages 18\u201344, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Women are more than twice as likely as men to practice yoga, the data showed. The percentage of adults who practiced yoga to treat or manage pain decreased with increasing family income.",
      "The CDC, didn't break out chair yoga for analysis but recommends that adults 65 and older focus on activities that improve balance and strength. That, the health agency said, can be achieved through various exercises, including chair yoga.",
      "Chapman and her students have thoughts on why more men don\u2019t practice yoga. Traditionally, Chapman said, the practice was reserved for men, but as yoga became more westernized, women took over.",
      "\u201cWomen tend to be more group-oriented. I would love to see more men in class. I do have a few. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re intimidated, but you know, it\u2019s a great way to meet women if everybody\u2019s single,\u201d Chapman said with a chuckle.",
      "Luria theorizes that fewer men are drawn to yoga because it's not a competitive sport.",
      "\u201cYou're really working at your own level,\u201d she said. \u201cTake out the competition and it's not their thing.\u201d",
      "These chair yoga practitioners have lots of advice. Rivman summed it up best: \u201cGet into a chair and do some yoga. You don't have to stand on your head, but you have to move. You're never too old to start.\"",

      "It was what it looked like, a starter swimming class. But here, instructors worked one-on-one or even two to a child. Some held cards to help kids communicate with teachers by pointing instead of speaking. No one blew whistles.",
      "All the students in the class at the Small Fish Big Fish swim school had autism, a developmental disorder linked to a higher-than-average danger of drowning.",
      "It has long worried autism experts and parents, but recent data make the stakes starkly clear. In Florida, a state where water abounds from beaches to backyards, over 100 children who had autism or were being evaluated for it have drowned since the start of 2021, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County.",
      "The numbers highlight an oft-overlooked dilemma: Autism makes swimming instruction all the more necessary but, often, all the more difficult to get.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s life-changing for kids with autism,\u201d said Lovely Chrisostome, who was terrified this winter when her 6-year-old son slipped out of the family\u2019s home and wandered through their lake-dotted neighborhood. She\u2019d once tried enrolling him in swim classes at a public pool, but he had refused to go in.",
      "But her son was in the pool at the autism-specific class at Small Fish Big Fish. An instructor helped him float on his back. When he started showing discomfort \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like to get his head wet \u2013 she eased him onto his side, where he seemed content.",
      "Autism affects an estimated 1 in 31 U.S. children. Their water safety has gotten occasional public attention after tragedies such as the death of Avonte Oquendo, an autistic teen who was found in a New York river in 2014 after disappearing from his school.",
      "While academic research on the issue is limited, a pair of 2017 studies documented a substantially heightened risk of drowning among people with autism spectrum disorder. The risk stems in large part from their propensity to wander off and to underappreciate perils, according to co-author Dr. Guohua Li and other experts.",
      "One Florida 5-year-old apparently wriggled out a doggy door and got into his grandmother\u2019s pool. Another died in a canal after slipping through a fence hole at a playground specifically intended for autistic kids. A 6-year-old drowned in a lake after she evidently climbed a bookshelf positioned to block an apartment door, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County. It\u2019s now building a national database.",
      "\u201cSwimming lessons should be a first-line treatment for autism,\u201d said Li, a Columbia University epidemiology professor who isn't involved in the council's research. Li himself has a son with the condition.",
      "Some autistic people excel at swimming, such as the New Jersey teens featured in the 2017 documentary \u201cSwim Team.\" Many others are adept in water. Even some profoundly autistic children can master survival basics with as little as eight hours of aquatic occupational therapy, said Michele Alaniz, a practitioner who published research based on her work at Casa Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare in Pomona, California.",
      "But some families don't sign up for classes, fearing they'll overwhelm children who might have symptoms ranging from not speaking to repeatedly banging their heads to becoming distressed by noise. Other youngsters get kicked out of programs that can\u2019t handle them. Private sessions can be helpful, but pricey.",
      "\u201cHaving somebody that understands a child on the spectrum \u2014 what the special needs are, how to communicate with a child, how to also mitigate a meltdown, particularly in a pool \u2014 is so vital,\u201d says Lindsey Corey. She said her 5-year-old son didn't absorb much from a general swim class or from private lessons at home in Lake Worth, Florida, but made progress in a program with instructors trained by the Autism Society.",
      "As drowning risks have come into focus, advocates are trying to make swimming lessons more accessible. An Australian charity called Autism Swim says 1,400 swim teachers, physical therapists and others worldwide have taken its online training since 2016.",
      "In Florida, the Children's Services Council's of Palm Beach County provided $17,000 last year for the Autism Society of America to train dozens of instructors, said Jon Burstein, who did the council's research on autism and drowning. The organization paid another $13,500 for the classes at Small Fish Big Fish.",
      "The dozen students, ranging from about 4 to 8, attend a nearby autism-specific charter school. They initially were reluctant to get in the bus, let alone in the water, organizers said. But on an early April afternoon, they readily headed for the shallow pool.",
      "One girl floated on a foam board with her face in the water, an exercise in breath control. Another girl grinned as she propelled herself on a foam noodle.",
      "\u201cShe's fearless to the point it's scary because she'll just jump into a pool, whether she can swim or not,\u201d her mother, Jana D'Agostino, said later. \u201cSo this is really important. It's saving their lives.\u201d",
      "Across the pool, a boy reluctantly eased himself from the steps into the water, where Small Fish founder Melissa Taylor waited for him. \u201cMy turn!\u201d she said, and dunked her head in the water.",
      "He did likewise, then retreated to the steps. Taylor continued working with him, but he soon backed out of the pool and began making hand movements. Realizing he'd had enough, instructors let him towel off.",
      "\u201cIt's taking a lot to get him to trust us,\u201d explained Taylor. But she also recognizes when repetitive splashing and movement signal excitement, not alarm.",
      "The session continued for the other children, including Chrisostome's son, who emerged with a smile.",
      "He has learned a lot in the lessons, but what struck her most?",
      "\u201cThe happiness that he has.\"",

      "Federal health officials will no longer routinely approve annual COVID-19 shots for younger adults and children who are healthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Annual COVID-19 shots for healthy younger adults and children will no longer be routinely approved under a major new policy shift unveiled Tuesday by the Trump administration.",
      "Top officials for the Food and Drug Administration laid out new requirements for access to yearly COVID shots, saying they'd continue to use a streamlined approach that would continue offering them to adults 65 and older as well as children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.",
      "But the FDA framework urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people. In a framework published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, agency officials said the approach still could keep annual vaccinations available for between 100 million and 200 million people.",
      "The upcoming changes raise questions for people who may still want a fall COVID-19 shot but don't clearly fit into one of the categories.",
      "\u201cIs the pharmacist going to determine if you're in a high-risk group?\u201d asked Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThe only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.\u201d",
      "The framework is the culmination of a series of recent stepsscrutinizing the use of COVID shots and raising major questions about the broader availability of vaccines under President Donald Trump. It was released two days ahead of the first meeting of FDA\u2019s outside vaccine experts under the Trump administration.",
      "Last week the FDA granted full approval of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine but with major restrictions on who can get it \u2014 and Tuesday's guidance mirrors those restrictions. The approval came after Trump appointees overruled FDA scientists' earlier plans to approve the shot without restrictions.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna, which make the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines, didn't immediately comment.",
      "For years, federal health officials have told most Americans to expect annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines, similar to the annual flu shot. Just like with flu vaccines, until now the FDA has approved updated COVID shots when manufacturers provide evidence that they spark just as much immune protection as the previous year's version.",
      "But FDA's new guidance appears to be the end of that approach under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID shots, particularly their recommendation for young, healthy adults and children. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday's policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s update, written by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach and states that the U.S. has been \u201cthe most aggressive\u201d in recommending COVID boosters, when compared with European countries.",
      "\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had Covid-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Makary and Prasad recommended that companies study people not deemed at high risk for six months, randomly assigning them to get a vaccine or a placebo and tracking outcomes with special attention to severe disease, hospitalization or death.",
      "Experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly COVID vaccination or whether they should be recommended for people at increased risk.",
      "An influential panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups.",
      "The FDA's announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel's job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people.",

      "The cucumbers were sold to restaurants, stores and food service distributors between April 29 and May 19 and may still be within their shelf life this week. Illnesses were reported between April 2 and April 28, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

In that outbreak, investigators found salmonella bacteria linked to many of the illnesses in untreated canal water used at farms operated by Bedner Growers and Thomas Produce Company.",
      "In the current outbreak, officials found salmonella bacteria from samples on the farm that matched samples from people who got sick.",
      "Health officials are investigating where the potentially contaminated cucumbers were distributed. Several people who fell ill ate cucumbers on cruise ships leaving ports in Florida, according to the CDC. Organic cucumbers are not affected, officials said.",
      "Retailers should notify consumers who may have bought the tainted produce. If consumers don't know the source of cucumbers, they should throw them away, officials said.",
      "Symptoms of salmonella poisoning include diarrhea, fever, severe vomiting, dehydration and stomach cramps. Most people who get sick recover within a week. Infections can be severe in young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who may require hospitalization.",

      "The announcement that Joe Biden has prostate cancer is the latest example of how the final chapters of his political career have been shaped by the disease",
      "WASHINGTON -- In Joe Biden\u2019s family, there\u2019s a saying that the three worst words anyone can hear are \u201cyou have cancer.\u201d",
      "One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumor. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.",
      "Now it is the former president\u2019s turn. Biden\u2019s office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones.",
      "Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. The announcement is a bitter revelation that a disease that has brought so much tragedy to Biden\u2019s life could be what ends it.",
      "\u201cCancer touches us all,\u201d Biden wrote on social media. \u201cLike so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.\u201d",
      "Even before the diagnosis, Biden's post-presidency was shadowed by questions about his health and whether he should have run for reelection. As questions about his fitness for office mounted, he abandoned the campaign and Donald Trump retook the presidency by defeating Kamala Harris. As the 82-year-old Biden works to safeguard his damaged political legacy, he'll also be fighting a disease that shaped the final chapters of his decades-long career.",
      "Biden was serving as Barack Obama's vice president when Beau died in 2015. He decided not to seek the Democratic nomination the following year, which helped clear a path for Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016.",
      "Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, said Biden wanted to \u201cchannel his grief into action and figure out how we can do better\u201d on treating cancer to \"make sure that other people didn\u2019t have to go through what he went through.\u201d",
      "The effort was formalized as a White House task force, with Biden in charge. After a few years out of office, Biden re-entered politics to campaign against Trump in 2020. The heartache from Beau's death was never far from the surface though. His eldest son had been Delaware's attorney general and often viewed as Biden's political successor.",
      "\u201cBeau should be the one running for president, not me,\u201d Biden said, a thought he echoed on many occasions.",
      "He made fighting cancer a focus for his presidency, resurrecting a \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative to increase funding for research and improve treatment. He unveiled the initiative at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in 2022, echoing the Democratic icon's famous speech declaring that \u201cwe will go to the moon\u201d six decades earlier.",
      "\"Beating cancer is something we can do together,\" Biden said.",
      "By this point, he had already signed legislation known as the PACT Act to expand healthcare benefits for veterans. The law guarantees treatment for chronic illnesses blamed on burn pits, which were used to dispose of chemicals, tires, plastics, medical equipment and human waste on military bases.",
      "Biden left no doubt that he believed Beau\u2019s death resulted from his service with the National Guard in Iraq.",
      "\u201cWhen they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same \u2014 headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son Beau was one of them.\u201d",
      "Denis McDonough, who led the Veterans Affairs Department under Biden, said the president didn't talk about Beau's death during policy discussions. But he said it was clear that Biden \u201cknew the experience that other families were having, and he was going to be damn sure that we weren\u2019t going to miss an opportunity to address that.\u201d",
      "McDonough recalled that Biden wanted the new law to take effect as quickly as possible.",
      "\u201cHe had an option to stretch it out,\" he said. \"He said no way.\u201d",

      "GENEVA -- The World Health Organization on Monday opened its annual meeting of government ministers and other top envoys facing one of the most serious crises of its 77-year history in the wake of Trump administration funding cuts and plans to withdraw the United States.",
      "The U.N. health agency this year has seen a plunge in its ability to carry out its sweeping mandate to do everything from recommend reductions in sugar levels in soft drinks to head the global response to pandemics like COVID-19 or outbreaks like polio or Ebola.",
      "Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been grappling with a response to the U.S. cuts as well as reduced outlays from other traditional Western donors who are putting more money toward defense and less toward humanitarian aid.",

      "\u201cThe WHO faces an existential crisis that goes well beyond a budget gap to the question of whether this sort of multilateralism can succeed in addressing global health in this new era of nationalism and misinformation,\u201d he said.",

      "Member countries are expected to agree to raise annual dues, known as \u201cassessed contributions,\u201d by 20% to support WHO finances and reduce dependency on governments\u2019 voluntary contributions \u2014 which change each year and make up over half of the budget.",
      "They are also expected to agree to a hard-wrought \u201c pandemic treaty \u201d that was born of a desire to avoid any replay of the patchy, unequal response to COVID-19 when the next \u2014 and inevitable, most experts say \u2014 pandemic hits.",

      "Health officials are urging vigilance as reports of bird flu cases in humans appear to have stopped",
      "Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped.",
      "Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration's deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections?",
      "\u201cWe just don't know why there haven't been cases,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \u201cI think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren't being detected.\u201d",
      "The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.",
      "In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. \u2014 most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.",
      "The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in Nevada, Ohio and Wyoming.",
      "California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation\u2019s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.",
      "During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.",
      "That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural \u2014 maybe temporary \u2014 decline in cases.",
      "It's unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.",
      "What's more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested limited activity recently.",
      "New infections are still being detected in birds and cattle, but not as frequently as several months ago.",
      "\u201cGiven the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it\u2019s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,\u201d the CDC said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody\u2019s hiding anything,\u201d said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "But Osterholm and some other experts think it's likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.",
      "Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government\u2019s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.",
      "Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.",
      "And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.",
      "Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said \"targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.\"",
      "She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.",
      "\"I can\u2019t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,\u201d she said.",
      "The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.",
      "Earlier this month, an agency assessment said there is a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.",
      "Still, research is continuing.",
      "Texas A&M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.",
      "Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.",
      "\u201cWe have had very good participation,\u201d Douphrate said. \u201cThey have been very willing.\u201d",
      "Similar surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.",
      "Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of the first signs that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S.",
      "Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu \u2014 or whether the virus can spill over into people.",
      "Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.",
      "\u201cIt's easy to downplay something because that's usually what humans do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we really need to be doing is ramping up.\u201d",

      "Pope Leo XIV's record handling sex abuse cases while he was an Augustinian superior and bishop in Peru has come under renewed scrutiny since his election May 8",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV made plenty of enemies helping dismantle a powerful Catholic movement whose leaders physically, sexually, spiritually and psychologically abused members. As Leo's past record of handling clergy sexual abuse cases comes under scrutiny, his biggest defenders are the victims of the group, known as the Sodalitium Christiane Vitae.",
      "These survivors say that starting in 2018, when the pope was a bishop in Peru, Robert Prevost met with them. He took their claims seriously when few others did, got the Vatican involved and worked concretely to provide financial reparations for the harm they had endured. They credit him with helping arrange the key 2022 meeting with Pope Francis that triggered a Vatican investigation into the group that resulted in its suppression earlier this year.",
      "\u201cWhat can I say about him? That he listened to me,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Rey de Castro, a teacher who spent 18 years in the Sodalitium as the personal cook for its leader, Luis Fernando Figari. \u201cIt seems obvious for a priest. But that\u2019s not the case, because the Sodalitium was very powerful.\u201d",
      "Figari, a Peruvian layman, founded the Sodalitium in Peru in 1971 as a lay community to recruit \u201csoldiers for God.\u201d It was one of several Catholic societies born as a conservative reaction to the left-leaning liberation theology movement that swept through Latin America starting in the 1960s. At its height, the group counted about 1,000 core members and several times that in three other branches across South America and the United States. It was enormously influential in Peru and has its U.S. base in Denver.",
      "Starting in 2000, stories about Figari\u2019s twisted practices began to filter out in Peru when a former member wrote a series of articles in the magazine Gente. A formal accusation was lodged with the Lima archdiocese in 2011 but neither the local church nor the Holy See took concrete action until former member Pedro Salinas and journalist Paola Ugaz exposed the practices of Sodalitium in their 2015 book \u201cHalf Monks, Half Soldiers.\u201d",
      "In 2017, a report commissioned by the group\u2019 s new leadership determined that the charismatic Figari was \u201cnarcissistic, paranoid, demeaning, vulgar, vindictive, manipulative, racist, sexist, elitist and obsessed with sexual issues and the sexual orientation of SCV members.\u201d The report found that Figari sodomized his recruits and forced them to fondle him and one another, that he liked to watch them \u201cexperience pain, discomfort and fear,\u201d and humiliated them in front of others to enhance his control over them.",
      "Yet when members found the courage to escape and denounce the abuses they suffered, they say they often met a wall of silence and inaction from the Peruvian Catholic hierarchy and the Holy See. Both were slow to act against a movement that had been formally approved by St. John Paul II's Vatican, which had looked fondly on conservative, wealthy movements in Latin America, like the similarly-disgraced Mexican-based Legion of Christ.",
      "But not Prevost, whom Francis made bishop of Chiclayo, Peru in 2014 and later was elected vice president of the Peruvian bishops conference. He headed the bishops\u2019 commission created to listen to victims of abuse, and became a critical \u201cbridge\u201d between victims and Sodalitium, the victims say.",
      "Rey de Castro, the former Figari cook who got out in 2014 and now teaches public policy to Peruvian police, turned to Prevost in 2021. He had been critical of a 2016 Sodalitium reparations program that, according to the group, provided some $6.5 million in academic, therapeutic and financial support to nearly 100 Sodalitium victims over the years.",
      "He and Prevost met in the offices of the Peruvian bishops conference and stayed in touch via text message up until Prevost's election as pope.",
      "From the start, Rey de Castro said, \u201cPrevost was very clear in saying \u2018For me, Sodalitium doesn\u2019t have a charism,\u2019\u201d the church term for the fundamental inspiration and reason for a religious movement to exist. After their 2021 meeting, Prevost helped arrange a confidential settlement with Sodalitium, he said.",
      "\u201cFor Prevost to get the Sodalitium to do something just was exceptional, which was more or less what happened,\u201d he said in an interview in Lima.",
      "Salinas and Ugaz, for their part, say Prevost also stepped in when the Sodalitium started retaliating against them with legal action for their continued investigative reporting on the group. After the Sodalitium\u2019s archbishop of Piura, Jos\u00e9 Eguren, sued Salinas in 2018 for defamation, Prevost and the Vatican\u2019s ambassador to Peru helped craft a statement from the Peruvian bishops conference backing the journalists.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time that anyone had done anything against the Sodalitium publicly,\u201d Ugaz said. \u201cAnd not only did they make this declaration, but they communicated with Francis, told him what was happening and Francis got mad.\u201d",
      "Ugaz and Salinas provided years of emails, text messages and anecdotes dating back to 2018 to demonstrate how committed Prevost was to their cause. While not all his initiatives succeeded, Prevost stepped in at critical junctions.",
      "\u201cI assure you I share your concern and we are looking for the best way to get the letter directly to the pope,\u201d Prevost wrote one victim Dec. 11, 2018, about getting a letter from Sodalitium victims to Francis.",
      "\u201cI will continue working so that there is justice for all those who suffered at the hands of Sodalitium,\u201d Prevost wrote another victim on Dec. 23, 2018. \u201cI ask forgiveness for the errors of the church.\u201d",
      "After the Sodalitium criticism accelerated against Ugaz and Salinas, Prevost helped arrange for Ugaz to meet with Francis at the Vatican on Nov. 10, 2022, during which she laid out her findings and convinced Francis to send his top sex crimes investigators to Peru.",
      "Their 2023 investigation uncovered physical abuses \u201cincluding with sadism and violence, \u201d sect-like abuses of conscience, spiritual abuse, abuses of authority including the hacking of Ugaz\u2019s communications and economic abuses in administering church money. The probe also identified a publicity campaign some Sodalitium members had mounted against critics.",
      "The investigation resulted in Francis taking a series of initiatives, starting with the April 2024 resignation of Eguren which Prevost handled. It continued with the expulsion of Figari, Eguren and nine others, and finally the formal dissolution of the Sodalitium in April this year, just before Francis died.",
      "The Sodalitium has accepted its dissolution, asked forgiveness for \u201cthe mistreatment and abuse committed within our community\u201d and for the pain caused the entire church.",
      "\u201cWith sorrow and obedience, we accept this decision, specifically approved by Pope Francis, which brings our society to an end,\u201d the group said in an April statement after the decree of dissolution was signed.",
      "There was no reply to an email sent to the group with specific questions about Prevost's role.",
      "Leo\u2019s record of handling sex abuse cases while he was an Augustinian superior and bishop in Peru has come under renewed scrutiny since his election May 8. And overall, one of the biggest challenges facing history\u2019s first American pope will be how he addresses the clergy abuse scandal, which has traumatized thousands of people around the world and devastated the Catholic hierarchy\u2019s credibility.",
      "The idea Prevost might have enemies was crystalized in a recent podcast hosted by Salinas on Peru\u2019s La Mula streaming platform. While Salinas dedicated most of the hourlong episode to reading aloud seven years of glowing correspondence between Sodalitium victims and Prevost, he also said Prevost had become the target of a defamation campaign questioning his handling of past abuse cases. Salinas blamed the campaign on Sodalitium's supporters trying to discredit him.",
      "One of the cases in question is Prevost\u2019s handling of abuse allegations made in 2022 by three sisters against one of his priests in Chiclayo. The diocese and Vatican say Prevost did everything he was supposed to do, including removing the priest from ministry, sending a preliminary investigation to the Vatican\u2019s sex crimes office, offering psychological help to the victims and suggesting they go to Peruvian authorities, who archived the case because it happened too long ago.",
      "Nine days after Peruvian authorities closed the case, Prevost was named to head the Vatican's office for bishops and left the diocese.",
      "The Vatican archived the case for lack of evidence, but it was reopened in 2023 after it gained traction in the media. Victims\u2019 groups are demanding an accounting from Leo.",
      "Salinas, Ugaz and even some in the Vatican believe Sodalitium supporters fueled publicity about the case and its reopening to discredit Prevost. They note that the victims\u2019 lawyer is a former Augustinian antagonist of Prevost who has since been defrocked and barred from presenting himself as a canon lawyer in Peru.",
      "Anne Barrett-Doyle, of the online abuse database BishopAccountability.org, said even if the Chiclayo case is being exploited by Sodalitium supporters, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that he handled the case correctly.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth things could be true: that then-Bishop Prevost acted valiantly on behalf of the victims of the Sodalitium and that he didn\u2019t do nearly enough to investigate the allegations in Chiclayo,\u201d she said.",
      "Signing off his podcast, Salinas read aloud a WhatsApp message he had exchanged with Prevost on Oct. 16, 2024, when he warned him to beware of retaliation from the group.",
      "\u201cI have it very much on my mind,\u201d Prevost wrote.",

      "Only about 900 people in the world speak Cypriot Maronite Arabic",
      "KORMAKITIS, Cyprus -- Ash dangled precariously from Iosif Skordis' cigarette as he reminisced with fellow villagers in a language on the edge of extinction, one that partly traces its roots to the language Jesus Christ once spoke.",
      "The 97-year-old Skordis is one of only 900 people in the world who speak Cypriot Maronite Arabic, or Sanna. Today, his village of Kormakitis is the last bastion of a language once spoken by tens of thousands of people across dozens of villages.",
      "The tongue, an offshoot of Syrian Arabic that has absorbed some Greek, has been passed from generation to generation in this windswept community in Cyprus. Until less than two decades ago, there was no written script, or even an alphabet, since parents transmitted it to children in conversation. Only a handful of people are trained to teach it.",
      "Sanna is at risk of disappearing, according to the Council of Europe\u2019s minority language experts. One Indigenous language dies every two weeks, the United Nations estimates, diminishing the tapestry of human knowledge one strand at a time.",
      "But the 7,500-strong Maronite community in Cyprus is pushing back. With help from the Cypriot government and the European Union, it has built schools, created a Sanna alphabet to publish textbooks and begun classes to keep the language alive and thriving.",
      "\u201cSanna \u2026 is undoubtedly one of the most distinguishing features of our cultural identity,\u201d said Yiannakis Moussas, the Maronite community\u2019s representative in the Cypriot legislature. He spoke in the Kormakitis coffeehouse adorned with soccer trophies and banners emblazoned with a Lebanese cedar.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s striking evidence of our heritage. The fact that we speak a kind of Arabic over so many centuries makes it clear that we descend from areas of Syria and Lebanon.\u201d",
      "The language was brought to Cyprus by waves of Arab Christians fleeing persecution by invading Arab Muslim fighters in what is now Syria, Lebanon and Israel, starting as early as the 8th century.",
      "Sanna at its root is a semitic language that, unlike other Arabic dialects, contains traces of the Aramaic that was spoken by populations prior to the Arab invasion of the Levant, according to University of Cyprus linguistics professor Marilena Kariolemou, who leads the team responsible for the language\u2019s revitalization.",
      "That\u2019s because the Maronite community in Cyprus was isolated from other Arabic-speaking populations.",
      "But as Maronites increasingly interacted with the island\u2019s majority Greek-speaking population and became bilingual, Sanna evolved to incorporate several Greek words, adding to its uniqueness among the many Arabic dialects.",
      "According to Kariolemou, Sanna contains five vowels similar to Greek and another three similar to Aramaic, while consonants whose sounds are formed in the back of the throat have diminished, likely because of the Greek influence. Sanna also adopted Greek syntax, she said.",
      "Until the mid-1970s, the Maronite community was largely centered around four villages: Asomatos, Ayia Marina, Karpasia and Kormakitis as the cultural center.",
      "But the 1974 Turkish invasion that split Cyprus into a breakaway Turkish Cypriot north and a Greek Cypriot south, where the internationally recognized government is seated, saw most Maronites dispersed throughout the south.",
      "Asomatos and Ayia Marina are empty of Maronite inhabitants and are now Turkish army camps.",
      "Moussas, the community representative, said the consequences of 1974 were \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the Maronites as they gravitated toward the island\u2019s major cities, putting their culture and language at risk as children attended Greek-speaking schools and intermarriage with Greek Cypriots increased.",
      "It\u2019s said that currently, only one in five Maronite marriages are between members of the community.",
      "That left Kormakitis as the linguistic \u201chive\u201d for Cypriot Maronite Arabic, only spoken by residents over 50, according to retired teacher Ilias Zonias. Born in Kormakitis, Zonias is the only native Sanna speaker qualified to teach the language.",
      "Kormakitis was a closed society in which residents spoke Sanna, while their kids went to school not knowing Greek. That\u2019s how the language was preserved, Zonias said.",
      "Still, speakers after 1974 began to dwindle until around the turn of the millennium, when the Maronite community with the help of the Cypriot government increased efforts to save the language.",
      "Cyprus\u2019 2004 membership in the EU was a milestone for Sanna as the bloc poured resources into safeguarding Indigenous minority languages, a designation that Cypriot authorities had bestowed.",
      "Kariolemou said her team in 2013 set up a recorded archive of spoken Sanna, some 280 hours long, for further study.",
      "A 27-letter alphabet was created in mostly Latin characters, thanks mainly to the work of linguist Alexander Borg. Grammar was formulated and refined, enabling the publication of books for teaching Sanna.",
      "Language courses are in their early stages, Skordis said, with about 100 children and adults in classes in Kormakitis and the Saint Maronas primary school in the Nicosia suburb of Lakatamia. A summer language camp for children and adults in Kormakitis has also been created.",
      "An initiative is underway for native-born speakers \u2014 primarily Kormakitis residents \u2014 to learn how to teach Sanna.",
      "At Ayios Maronas primary school, 20 kindergarten-age children are learning the language with books containing QR codes that can be scanned so students can follow an audio adaptation on school-provided tablets.",
      "But for Sanna to have a real future, there is no substitute for young families returning in large numbers to Kormakitis, where the language can be taught in the newly built, EU-funded school, Moussas said.",
      "Community leaders, however, aren\u2019t pleased with the low number of people expressing interest. Moussas said community leaders and the Cypriot government are looking into offering incentives, primarily to make it easier to find housing.",
      "For Zonias, keeping the language alive for the ages would be the crowning achievement of his career.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the last teacher of Sanna,\u201d he said.",

      "A United Nations expert has warned at the conclusion of her two-week visit that Guatemala\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office is increasingly using criminal law against former prosecutors, judges, defense attorneys, journalists and others",
      "GUATEMALA CITY -- A United Nations expert warned Friday at the conclusion of her two-week visit that Guatemala\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office is increasingly using criminal law against former prosecutors, judges, defense attorneys, journalists and others.",
      "Margaret Satterthwaite, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, traveled the country meeting with judges, lawyers, lawmakers and others, including Guatemala\u2019s chief prosecutor.",
      "\u201cThe instrumental use of criminal law by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office appears to amount to a systematic pattern of intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights, targeted at specific groups,\u201d Satterthwaite wrote in her preliminary report. \u201cThis persecution appears to be intensifying, as those who have sought to end impunity and corruption, defend human rights, or speak out against abuses of power increasingly face digital harassment, threats, and criminal charges.\u201d",
      "The office is led by Consuelo Porras, who has been sanctioned by the United States and other countries and accused of being an obstacle to corruption investigations.",
      "Satterthwaite met with Porras and her staff. They told Satterthwaite that they acted within the law, denied using criminal law to pursue opponents and said they were the real victims of attacks by the executive branch and its allies, the U.N. expert said.",
      "\u201cCriminal charges have been directed at more than 60 justice operators and defense or human rights lawyers,\u201d Satterthwaite said, noting that more than 50 \u201cjustice operators\u201d have been forced into exile by the prosecutor\u2019s office.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa\u2019s top law enforcement official said Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump wrongly claimed that a video he showed in the Oval Office was of burial sites for more than 1,000 white farmers and he \u201ctwisted\u201d the facts to push a false narrative about mass killings of white people in his country.",
      "Police Minister Senzo Mchunu was talking about a video clip that was played during the meeting between Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House on Wednesday that showed an aerial view of a rural road with lines of white crosses erected on either side.",
      "\u201cNow this is very bad,\u201d Trump said as he referred to the clip that was part of a longer video that was played in the meeting. \u201cThese are burial sites, right here. Burial sites, over a thousand, of white farmers, and those cars are lined up to pay love on a Sunday morning.\"",
      "Mchunu said the crosses did not mark graves or burial sites, but were a temporary memorial put up in 2020 to protest the killings of all farmers across South Africa. They were put up during a funeral procession for a white couple who were killed in a robbery on their farm, Mchunu said.",
      "A son of the couple who were killed and a local community member who took part in the procession also said the crosses do not represent burial sites and were taken down after the protest.",
      "South Africa struggles with extremely high levels of violent crime, although farm killings make up a small percentage of the country's overall homicides. Both white and Black farmers are attacked, and sometimes killed, and the government has condemned the violence against both groups.",
      "Whites make up around 7% of South Africa's 62 million people but generally still have a much better standard of living than the Black majority more than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system of racial segregation. Whites make up the majority of the country's wealthier commercial farmers.",
      "Mchunu said Trump's false claims that the crosses represented more than 1,000 burial sites was part of his \u201cgenocide story\u201d \u2014 referring to the U.S. president\u2019s baseless allegations in recent weeks that there is a widespread campaign in South Africa to kill white farmers and take their land that he has said amounts to a genocide.",
      "\u201cThey are not graves. They don\u2019t represent graves,\u201d Mchunu said regarding the video that has become prominent on social media since it was shown in the White House. \u201cAnd it was unfortunate that those facts got twisted to fit a false narrative about crime in South Africa.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have respect for the president of the United States,\u201d Mchunu added. \u201cBut we have no respect for his genocide story whatsoever.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the South African official\u2019s remarks.",
      "Of the more than 5,700 homicides in South Africa from January through March, six occurred on farms and, of those, one victim was white, said Mchunu. \u201cIn principle, we do not categorize people by race, but in the context of claims of genocide of white people, we need to unpack the killings in this category,\u201d he said.",
      "Lourens Bosman, who is a former lawmaker in the national Parliament, said he took part in the procession shown in the video the Trump administration played. It happened near the town of Newcastle in the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal in September 2020. The crosses were symbols to white and Black farmers and farmworkers who had been killed across South Africa over the previous 26 years, Bosman said.",
      "Trump's falsehoods that South Africa's government is fueling the persecution and killing of its minority white farmers has been strongly denied by the country, which says the allegations are rooted in misinformation.",
      "Ramaphosa pushed for this week's meeting with Trump in what he said was an attempt to change Trump's mind over South Africa and correct misconceptions about the country to rebuild ties.",
      "Trump issued an executive order on Feb. 7 that cut all U.S. financial assistance to South Africa and accused it of mistreating white Afrikaner farmers and seizing their land. The order accused Ramaphosa's government of \"fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.\"",
      "Trump's executive order also accused South Africa of pursuing an anti-American foreign policy and specifically criticized its decision to launch a case at the International Court of Justice accusing U.S. ally Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The order accused South Africa of supporting the Palestinian militant group Hamas through that case.",

      "\u201cThe road to membership is not easy, so my message today is to stay on the course and to take next steps necessary towards the opening of the negotiations,\" Kallas said. \u201cNorth Macedonia faces era-defining choices for its citizens and its future.\u201d",
      "Key among those steps is a constitutional amendment to formally recognize a Bulgarian minority \u2014 a condition set by EU neighbor Bulgaria to lift its veto of North Macedonian membership. The issue has become a political flashpoint in North Macedonia, where the conservative government insists that EU accession should not be affected by bilateral disputes.",
      "Although the European Union has not accepted any new members since Croatia's accession in 2013, the war in Ukraine and concerns for broader European stability have refocused efforts to advance membership bids.",

It comes after the government took a number of steps that have fueled concerns that the country may be entering a new wave of crackdowns. Critics warn that it falls in line with measures passed by autocratic governments in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, Belarus and China.",
      "Here are more details about the root of the criticism:",
      "Anyone \u2014 individual or organization, local or foreign \u2014 who acts in the interest of a foreign entity or receives foreign funding to operate in El Salvador is required to register under the law. Every payment, whether in cash, goods, or services, made to such groups will be subject to a 30% tax. The final law passed does not specify how the money from the tax will be used.",
      "While the United States also has a law that requires individuals working on behalf of foreign entities and governments to register, Bukele's is far broader in scope and grants him greater powers. It is fairly common in poorer countries in Latin America to depend on international aid dollars, as it\u2019s often difficult to raise money in their own countries.",
      "Analysts say a broad definition of a \u201cforeign agent\u201d in the law could cover:",
      "\u2014 Human rights organizations",
      "\u2014 Community associations",
      "\u2014 Independent media outlets",
      "\u2014 Foreign-funded startups or businesses",
      "\u2014 Religious groups",
      "\u2014 International aid agencies",
      "The law creates a new government body called RAEX, or Registry of Foreign Agents, which will have wide powers, including setting requirements for registration, approving or denying applications, revoking or refusing to renew registrations and to demand documents or information at any time.",
      "Some NGOs can apply for exceptions, but RAEX will decide who can operate in the country. Around 8,000 NGOs operate in El Salvador and often depend on foreign donations due to lack of funds available in the Central American nation.",
      "Some of those groups have long been at odds with Bukele and have criticized some of his actions, including waiving key constitutional rights to crack down on the country's gangs and seeking reelection despite clear constitutional prohibitions.",
      "The rules NGOs will have to follow:",
      "\u2014 They must register with RAEX and report the source and purpose of all donations.",
      "\u2014 They must keep complete accounting records, use the banks for transactions and follow anti-money laundering laws.",
      "\u2014 They cannot operate without registering.",
      "\u2014 They cannot engage in political activities or actions seen as threatening public order or national security.",
      "\u2014 They cannot use foreign donations for undeclared activities or share information on behalf of foreign donors without labeling it as such.",
      "Violations of the rules can lead to fines between $100,000 to $250,000, and possible closure.",
      "Critics say Bukele revived the law because he has now consolidated power across all branches of government. His political alliance with U.S. President Donald Trump has emboldened him.",
      "Bukele announced the law shortly after a protest near his home ended in a violent crackdown by police and two people being arrested.",
      "It comes after a number of moves by Bukele that have raised concerns that the self-described \u201cworld's coolest dictator\u201d is cracking down on dissent.",
      "\u2014 Just two days before the law passed, the government arrested an anti-corruption lawyer with the human rights organization Cristosal \u2013 one of Bukele's most outspoken critics \u2013 on corruption charges.",
      "\u2014 The government arrested the heads of bus companies for defying an order from Bukele posted on his social media.",
      "\u2014 Journalists with the investigative news organization El Faro said they had to flee the country after receiving word the government was preparing orders for their arrest after they published reports on the president's links to gangs.",
      "\u2014 Opposition lawmaker Claudia Ortiz called the law \u201can authoritarian tool for censorship\u201c and said it hands the president excessive levels of control. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that exemptions will only be given to groups that align with the government, while those who expose corruption or abuse will be punished,\u201d she said.",
      "\u2014 Lawyer Roxana Cardona of the NGO Justicia Social y Controlar\u00eda Ciudadana said: \u201cThe Foreign Agents Law seeks to suppress organizations that promote civic participation or support marginalized groups the state ignores.\u201d",

      "Venezuelans are again finding themselves as pawns in their country\u2019s political game",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- As Venezuelans head to a Sunday election, they are again being used as political pawns. Opposition factions are urging abstention while the ruling party aims to tighten its grip on power \u2014 all while both sides appeal to the U.S. government for decisions that would have a greater impact on people\u2019s lives than the vote\u2019s results.",
      "The election for members of the National Assembly, governors and other regional offices will be the first to allow broad voter participation since last year\u2019s presidential contest, which President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed to have won despite credible evidence to the contrary.",
      "The contest comes as the opposition\u2019s most recognizable figure, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, remains in hiding to avoid arrest and most other leaders are in exile or prison due to the government's repressive measures unleashed after the July election.",
      "\u201cWe lost confidence in voting. On July 28, they made fun of us,\u201d said Carmen Medina, who sells plastic jewelry in the capital, Caracas. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to vote.\u201d",
      "A nationwide poll conducted between April 29 and May 4 by the Venezuela-based research firm Delphos showed that only 15.9% of voters expressed a high probability of voting Sunday. Of those, 74.2% said they would vote for the candidates of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela and its allies, while 13.8% said they would vote for contenders associated with two opposition leaders who ignored Machado\u2019s call to boycott the elections.",
      "Sociologist Roberto Brice\u00f1o, director of the independent Laboratory of Social Sciences research group, said many Venezuelans no longer see their vote as a tool to \u201cgenerate change or improve the country\u2019s dire situation.\u201d After July\u2019s election, he said, people are living with a \u201cpersistent sadness about the future\u201d as \u201cthey feel they did their part\u201d to get someone other than Maduro elected.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s most recent economic troubles pushed year-over-year inflation in April to 172%, bringing the price of food and other basic goods for a family to $409 a month, according to a group of economists. Meanwhile, the value of the monthly minimum wage, paid to state employees in Venezuelan bolivares, dropped to $1.36, which they supplement with a roughly $100 monthly government bonus and second or third jobs.",
      "The latest chapter in the 12-year crisis even prompted Maduro to declare an \u201ceconomic emergency\u201d last month.",
      "At the heart of the recent challenges of the oil-dependent economy is the status of a U.S. government-issued permit that determines the activities of energy giant Chevron Corp. in Venezuela.",
      "The company has become responsible over the past two years for about 20% of Venezuela\u2019s oil production and a regular infusion of U.S. dollars that ultimately helped the government maintain an artificially low currency exchange rate. That rate is crucial to Venezuelans as it determines the prices of food, goods and services.",
      "Chevron\u2019s permit, formally known as a general license, was granted by the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden. But under Donald Trump, the White House rescinded it in February, giving Chevron time to wind down its operations in the South American country and meeting one of Machado's appeals.",
      "The U.S.'s decision to either stick to the rescission, or fulfill Maduro\u2019s wish to extend Chevron\u2019s wind-down period beyond its May 27 expiration date, will have a greater, more immediate effect on Venezuelans than the result of Sunday's poll.",
      "That is because Maduro\u2019s government controls seemingly every aspect of the country, including health and social services, utilities and education. It also deploys its repressive apparatus against opponents by, for instance, disqualifying a candidate after the election or appointing a ruling-party loyalist to oversee the elected offices held by opposition members, rendering them powerless.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Machado supporter, on Wednesday posted on X that Chevron's oil license will expire as scheduled, contradicting statements from Trump\u2019s envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, who after meeting with Maduro\u2019s negotiators Tuesday said it would be extended by 60 days.",
      "Asked for clarity on Rubio and Grenell\u2019s differing positions, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said \u201cSecretary Rubio, as Secretary of State and National Security Adviser, is representing the Administration\u2019s position.\u201d",
      "The ruling party-loyal National Electoral Council will oversee Sunday\u2019s election for state legislators, 285 members of the unicameral National Assembly and all 24 governors, including the newly created governorship purportedly established to administer Essequibo, a region long under dispute between Venezuela and neighboring Guyana.",
      "Earlier this month, the Electoral Council moved to remove the QR code that previously appeared on the tally sheets that every electronic voting machine used in an election printed after polls closed. The tally sheets are considered the ultimate proof of election results, and their QR codes were used by Machado\u2019s team to show that opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez defeated Maduro by a more than 2-to-1 margin in July.",
      "Some opposition factions, including Machado\u2019s, are using social media to urge people to not vote Sunday, arguing that casting votes legitimizes Maduro\u2019s government. But voters have grown accustomed to opposition leaders promoting boycotts on and off for years without delivering the promised change.",
      "The strategy is destined to fail again without unanimity.",
      "\u201cThe government has co-opted some opposition (parties) and there\u2019s other opposition that are just tired of this strategy that\u2019s never worked,\u201d said David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for 30 years. \u201cSo, what you are going to have is a partial boycott, which means the government is going to cruise to victory and can say, \u2018We had elections, the opposition didn\u2019t participate.' It\u2019s going to backfire on the opposition.\u201d",

      "The British government has signed a deal to transfer the Chagos Islands\u2019 sovereignty to Mauritius",
      "LONDON -- Bernadette Dugasse was just a toddler when her family was forced to leave her birthplace. She didn\u2019t get a chance to return until she was a grandmother.",
      "Dugasse, 68, has spent most of her life in the Seychelles and the U.K., wondering what it would be like to set foot on the tropical island of Diego Garcia, part of the remote cluster of atolls in the middle of the Indian Ocean called the Chagos Islands.",
      "Like hundreds of others native to the islands, Dugasse was kicked out of her homeland more than half a century ago when the British and U.S. governments decided to build an important military base there.",
      "After years of fighting for the right to go home, Dugasse and other displaced islanders watched in despair Thursday as the U.K. government announced it was formally transferring the Chagos Islands\u2019 sovereignty to Mauritius.",
      "While political leaders spoke about international security and geopolitics, the deal meant only one thing for Chagossians: That the prospect of ever going back to live in their homeland now seems more out of reach than ever.",
      "\u201cWe are the natives. We belong there,\u201d said Dugasse, who has reluctantly settled in Crawley, a town south of London. \u201cIt made me feel enraged because I want to go home.\u201d",
      "Dugasse was born on the Chagos Islands, which had been under the administration of Mauritius, a former British colony, until 1965, when Britain split them away from Mauritius.",
      "Mauritius gained independence in 1968, but the Chagos remained under British control and were named the British Indian Ocean Territory.",
      "Dugasse was barely 2 years old when her family was deported to the Seychelles in 1958 after her father, a laborer, allegedly broke a work contract. They were never allowed back. Throughout the 1960s, many other islanders who thought they were leaving temporarily \u2013 for a holiday, or medical treatment -- would be told they cannot return to the Chagos.",
      "It turned out that Britain was evicting the entire population of the Chago Islands -- about 1,500 people descended from African slaves and plantation workers \u2013- so the U.S. military could build a base on the largest island, Diego Garcia.",
      "By 1973, all Indigenous Chagossians were forced to leave. Thousands of islanders and their descendants are now spread around the world, most living in Mauritius, the U.K. and Seychelles. Most want to return home.",
      "Britain\u2019s government has acknowledged that its removal of islanders was wrong, and has granted many citizenship and set aside some funds to improve their lives. But it continues to bar Chagossians from returning and living in their homeland, citing defense and security concerns and \u201ccost to the British taxpayer.\u201d",
      "Although the British government this week finalized a deal to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos to Mauritius, ending a long contested colonial legacy, there is no upside for Chagossians.",
      "Dugasse and other islanders say they were completely excluded from political negotiations, and that Mauritius\u2019 government is unlikely to grant them any right to return. Under the deal, which still needs Parliament's approval, Britain will lease back the Diego Garcia military base for at least 99 years. That means the island will be off-limits for the foreseeable feature.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a Mauritian passport. I don\u2019t want to affiliate myself with Mauritius,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have our own culture. We have our own identity. We are unique Indigenous people.\u201d",
      "Dugasse and another Diego Garcia native, Bertrice Pompe, sought to bring legal action against the British government over the deal to transfer the Chagos Islands to Mauritian control. They only managed to halt the signing of the deal by a few hours Thursday.",
      "Pompe said it was a \u201cvery sad day\u201d but she wasn\u2019t giving up.",
      "\u201cThe rights we\u2019re asking for now, we\u2019ve been fighting for for 60 years,\u201d Pompe said outside a London courthouse. \u201cMauritius is not going to give that to us. So we need to keep fighting with the British government to listen to us.\u201d",
      "Human Rights Watch and other groups have urged Britain\u2019s government to recognize the Chagossians\u2019 right to return home, calling its failure to do so a \u201ccontinuing colonial crime against humanity.\"",
      "Dugasse \u2014 who received British citizenship but said she got no other compensation \u2014 has been allowed back to Diego Garcia just twice in recent years. Both times the visits were only possible with special permission from the U.K. government.",
      "She described the island as a \u201cmini-America,\u201d populated by American service members and Filipino staffers. She visited the church where her parents were married and where she was baptized, but found her village cemetery and school in ruins.",
      "And when she collected seashells and white sand from the beach, officials told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to bring those home.",
      "\u201cI told them no \u2014 (the shells and the sand) are mine, not yours,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were allowed there for only nine days, and every day I cried.\u201d",
      "Dugasse said her elderly mother, who lives in the Seychelles, would like to die on Diego Garcia. She doesn't think that's possible \u2014 and she is pessimistic that any of her children or grandchildren will get a chance to see where their family came from.",
      "\u201cAre we Chagossians always going to be nomads, going from place to place?\" she asked. \"Most of the natives are dying. What will happen? It\u2019s time for us to set foot home.\u201d",

      "Publix recalled 4-ounce Greenwise Pear, Kiwi, Spinach & Pea Baby Food pouches sold at more than 1,400 stores.",
      "The pouches were produced by Bowman Andros, a French company with a manufacturing plant in Mount Jackson, Virginia, according to the company's website. Publix issued the voluntary recall on May 9, but it wasn't added to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recall list until late Thursday.",
      "The potential contamination was flagged by officials in North Carolina, the state that first identified a 2023 lead poisoning outbreak linked to tainted applesauce pouches that sickened more than 500 U.S. children.",
      "Routine sampling of the baby food pouches found lead levels at 13.4 parts per billion, according to North Carolina agriculture officials. That exceeds the FDA's recommended limit of 10 parts per billion for such products intended for babies and young children.",
      "Publix said all the potentially contaminated products have been removed from store shelves. No illnesses have been reported, the company said. Customers can return the pouches to local stores for full refund.",
      "This is the second baby food pouch recall because of potential lead contamination in two months. In March, Target recalled more than 25,000 packages of its store brand Good & Gather Baby Pea, Zucchini, Kale & Thyme Vegetable Puree because of elevated lead levels.",
      "North Carolina collaborates with the FDA to conduct routine testing of food products, officials said.",
      "In 2023, state health officials investigated reports of lead poisoning in four children who consumed WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree. Those findings led to the detection of a nationwide outbreak linked to the pouches, which were widely sold in Dollar Tree and other stores. Tests showed they contained lead at levels 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum recommended level, as well as chromium.",
      "Federal health officials eventually identified 566 cases of confirmed, probable or suspected cases of lead poisoning tied to the pouches in 44 states.",

      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans were jubilant after muscling through President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d tax and immigration package by a single vote. But across the Capitol, senators were more cautious.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune can afford to lose three Republican senators and still pass the bill, and there are more than that, right now, who have problems with it. Like the House, he will have to balance the concerns from moderate and conservative members of his conference.",
      "Republicans\u2019 aspirational deadline is July 4, ahead of a potential debt default. Thune said groups of senators had already been meeting to discuss the legislation and that they would want to take some time to review it. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll put our stamp on it,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWhat does it take to get to 51?\u201d",
      "A look at a few of the potential sticking points in the Senate:",
      "Several Republican senators have said the House\u2019s multi-trillion-dollar tax package doesn't have enough savings. Thune said many in his GOP conference favor the tax breaks in the bill but \u201cwhen it comes to the spending side of the equation, this is a unique moment in time, in history, where we have the House and the Senate and the White House, and an opportunity to do something meaningful about how to control government spending.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a sharp critic of the House bill, wants the United States to go back to pre-pandemic spending levels. He has indicated he would be a no on the bill as it stands now, and he says he has at least three other senators aligned with him.",
      "Senate Republicans are generally on board with stricter work requirements for older Medicaid recipients that make up much of the bill\u2019s $700 billion savings from the program. But Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Susan Collins of Maine, among others, have voiced concerns about other changes in the bill that could potentially cut funding to rural hospitals or increase copays and other health care costs for recipients.",
      "The senators could have a powerful ally in Trump, who has frequently said he doesn\u2019t want cuts to Medicaid, even as he\u2019s endorsed the House bill. Hawley said he talked to Trump this week on the phone and \u201chis exact words were, \u2018Don\u2019t touch it, Josh.\u2019\u201d",
      "Others have been wary of the House bill\u2019s effort to shift some costs of the food stamp program to states, potentially a major issue for some red states that have high numbers of food aid recipients. The House bill saves $290 billion from the food aid, and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman said the Senate savings will be \u201cprobably be a little bit lower.\u201d",
      "Thune said this week that \u201cone of the principal differences\u201d between the House and Senate is that Republican senators want to make many of the tax cuts permanent while the House bill has shorter time frames for many of its cuts \u2014 including no taxes on tips, overtime pay, car-loan interest and others.",
      "Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo said Thursday that trying to make some of the cuts permanent is \u201can objective right now.\"",
      "One of the biggest questions for the Senate: whether the tax breaks really need to be offset by cuts elsewhere.",
      "To offset the costs of lost tax revenue, House Republicans have proposed more than $1 trillion in spending reductions across Medicaid, food stamps and green energy program rollbacks. However, Republicans in the Senate do not believe there is a cost associated with permanently extending the existing taxes, setting up a political and procedural showdown ahead.",
      "The House bill includes a $4 trillion increase in the debt limit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the United States is on track to run out of money to pay its bills as early as August without congressional action.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he won\u2019t support the bill if the debt ceiling increase is included. He said he\u2019s willing to consider it if it\u2019s taken out.",
      "But most Republican senators want it to avoid a separate fight that would require 60 votes in the Senate. Texas Sen. John Cornyn said that if they deal with the debt ceiling outside of the legislation then they would have to \u201cpay a king\u2019s ransom\u201d to Democrats to get enough votes.",
      "Several Republican senators have said they are concerned about House provisions that repeal or phase out clean energy tax credits passed in 2022 that have spurred investment in many states.",
      "Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Moran wrote Thune a letter last month arguing that removing the credits could \"create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.\u201d",
      "The House bill would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade, giving the federal government more control over the policy. It\u2019s an approach that has been favored by the AI industry but has drawn concern from members on both sides of the aisle.",
      "And even if it has enough support, the provision may not pass muster from the Senate parliamentarian because it\u2019s unlikely to have impact on the federal budget.",
      "With a narrow margin for victory and only 53 Republicans in the Senate, every senator\u2019s top priority takes on outsize importance. South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said he supports the House bill but that the way that it deals with spectrum auctions \u2014 selling off telecommunications signal rights \u2014 is a \u201cdealbreaker\u201d for him. He said he\u2019s in talks with other senators on the issue.",
      "Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said one of his main goals is that they include money for certain farm safety net programs and set up passage for a broader farm bill later this year.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we have to have 50 plus one supporting it,\u201d Hoeven said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got some work to do.\"",

      "U.S. Ambassador Warren Stephens has met Prime Minister Keir Starmer after President Donald Trump urged the U.K. to ditch wind power projects and drill for oil",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 U.S. Ambassador Warren Stephens met British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday to \u201cconvey the priorities of the Trump administration,\u201d after President Donald Trump urged the U.K. to ditch wind power projects and drill for oil.",
      "The U.S. Embassy said those priorities include \u201cmaximizing the U.S.-U.K. partnership to advance our shared interests, such as the recently announced trade deal and our defense and security alliance which promotes stability and prosperity worldwide.\u201d",
      "The embassy said the meeting at 10 Downing St. was the second for the two men since Stephens, a billionaire investment banker and Republican donor, took up his post on May 12.",
      "Stephens arrived in London just after the two governments struck a trade deal that saw the Trump administration lift tariffs on U.K. autos, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to Britain for American products including beef and ethanol.",
      "Trump wrote on the Truth Social platform Friday that the agreement \u201cis working out very well for all.\u201d",
      "But he advised Britain \u201cthat in order to get their Energy Costs down, they stop with the costly and unsightly windmills, and incentivize modernized drilling in the North Sea, where large amounts of oil lay waiting to be taken.\u201d",
      "He said the North Sea had \u201ca century of drilling left, with Aberdeen as the hub,\u201d and claimed \u201cU.K.\u2019s Energy Costs would go WAY DOWN, and fast!\u201d with more oil extraction.",
      "One of the president's two Scottish golf courses, Trump International Golf Links, is near Aberdeen.",
      "Britain is investing heavily in wind farms as it seeks to generate all of the country\u2019s energy from renewable sources by 2030 and break free from what Starmer has called \u201cthe rollercoaster of international fossil fuel markets.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration is doing the opposite \u2014 prioritizing fossil fuels, including boosting coal, canceling financing for clean energy and climate-friendly projects, and targeting the wind industry.",
      "In contrast to his words about Britain, Trump threatened Friday to impose a 50% tax on all imports from the EU, saying trade talks with the 27-nation bloc \u201care going nowhere.\u201d",

      "Sales at building materials and garden supply retailers rose 0.8% last month from March, the biggest gain since 2022, and were up 3.2% from April last year. At the same time, U.S. retail sales overall rose 0.1%, a sharp slowdown from March.",

      "He also noted that the chain is seeing fewer customers taking on large home improvement jobs like kitchen and bath remodels, because high interest rates may be dissuading homeowners from borrowing money to finance such projects.",
      "Spending on home renovations has remained resilient as elevated mortgage rates and skyrocketing home prices have frozen out many would-be buyers. That's kept U.S. home sales in a slump, limiting the market for homeowners who want to sell.",
      "Many homeowners also bought or refinanced their mortgage when the average rate on a 30-year home loan was below 3% or 4% in the first couple of years of the pandemic. That's made them reluctant to sell now, when the average rate is hovering near 7%.",
      "In response, many homeowners have opted to to invest in sprucing up their home rather than sell and take on a mortgage with a sharply higher interest rate.",
      "A shortfall in new home construction more than a decade in the making has kept people living in older homes longer. Nearly half of the owner-occupied homes in the U.S. were built before 1980 and have a median age of 41 years, according to an analysis of Census data by the National Association of Home Builders. That aging stock of homes has helped fuel the need for repairs and improvements.",
      "Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies\u2019 most recent quarterly outlook of home improvement projects that spending on home renovations will continue to increase this year, despite economic uncertainty.",
      "Spending by homeowners on maintenance and home improvement projects increased 0.5% in the first quarter from a year earlier to $513 billion, according to the JCHS' leading indicator of remodeling activity, or LIRA.",
      "It also forecasts annual increases from here that will drive spending to $526 billion by the first quarter of next year. That would represent a 2.5% increase from the first quarter of this year.",
      "Rising home prices and signs of a solid economy have supported the outlook for higher spending on home improvement, but that could change if the housing market and economic outlook worsen, said Carlos Mart\u00edn, director of the JCHS\u2019 Remodeling Futures Program.",
      "\u201cBuilding materials retail sales are strong, but we are seeing a significant downturn in the sales of existing homes and their median sales price since the last projection \u2014 both are known contributors to home improvements,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBroader economic turbulence like a recession, a worsening job market or higher inflation would almost certainly temper our expectations.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "News that air traffic controllers directing planes into New Jersey\u2019s busiest airport twice lost both their radar and radios is alarming",
      "It was alarming news when air traffic controllers directing planes coming and going around one of the nation's busiest airports repeatedly lost their radar and radio communications, but pilots, independent air safety experts and the Federal Aviation Administration say other redundant systems kept planes from colliding.",
      "\u201cI think the risk of a collision or an incident was increased, but not significantly because of the redundancy in the aviation system,\u201d said Jeff Guzzetti, a former accident investigator for the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "Crashes like January's deadly collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter usually have different causes \u2014 a combination of many things that go wrong, he says.",
      "Here's a look at what happened in Newark \u2014 and how key pieces of the safety net protected planeloads of people.",
      "The radar and communications systems that a terminal control team in Philadelphia relies on to direct planes in and out of Newark International Airport simultaneously failed twice in the past month for brief periods. The main line that carries the radar signal from another FAA facility in New York failed, and the backup line didn\u2019t work immediately. The system relies in part on aging copper wires and even when there are fiber optic lines, the signal has to be slowed down when it reaches the facility because the FAA computers are so old they can't handle all the data at full speed.",
      "As a result, the controllers were suddenly unable to see or communicate with planes coming from or going to Newark for as long as 90 seconds on April 28 and May 9. Their radar screens showing each flights in motion suddenly went black. Their radio connections went silent.",
      "The main line failed a third time May 11, but the backup system worked and the radar stayed online. The FAA said a fourth outage Monday knocked out radio communications for two seconds, but the radar stayed online.",
      "After the initial outage, the already shorthanded control center in Philadelphia lost five to seven controllers to trauma leave. Newark's terminal control team could no longer manage a full schedule of handoffs with the airport's control tower, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations and delays that rippled across the nation's airlines. The FAA then imposed safety limits, allowing no more than 28 arrivals and 28 departures every hour. Before, 38 or 39 flights typically took off and landed hourly.",
      "When air traffic controllers lose the ability to see or speak to airborne planes, they can try text messaging the pilots via data link systems or try high-powered portable radios. An emergency radio frequency might also be an alternative if main communications are down. Tower controllers have high-powered light guns to send a green or red signal to pilots to let them know if they are clear to land even if they can't talk to them over the radio.",
      "And the entire air traffic control system is built on an overlapping network of radar sites. So if a terminal control team like the one in Philadelphia loses its communications, a controller in a radar center that normally directs planes at higher altitudes might step in. If some other controller in the area hears a pilot broadcasting on an emergency frequency, they too can relay a message.",
      "During these Philadelphia outages, voice communications came back online first while the radar took another minute to reboot, and controllers were able to hand off planes without having to resort to some of those other options.",
      "In a May 9 recording captured by www.liveATC.net, a controller can be heard saying \u201cFedEx 1989. I'm going to hand you off here. Our scopes just went black again. If you care about this, contact your airline and try to get some pressure for them to fix this stuff.\u201d The pilot acknowledged that and wished the controllers \u201cgood luck guys\u201d before switching frequencies.",
      "Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau has tried to reassure the public that all these backups and limits on the number of flights keep flying safe, despite these problems that have exposed how fragile and outdated some air traffic control systems have become.",
      "\u201cWhen disruptions occur at any airport because of equipment issues or staffing, the FAA will always ensure safety by slowing down airport arrivals and departures and reducing congestion,\u201d Rocheleau posted on X. \u201cWe keep the flying public safe because there are redundancies built throughout the entire system used by pilots, technicians and air traffic controllers.\u201d",
      "Every pilot is trained on what to do if they can't talk to the air traffic controllers, and modern passenger jets have their own backup systems. Airline pilots all regularly get refresher training emphasizing safety.",
      "Capt. Miles Morgan oversees all training for 17,000 United Airlines pilots at a facility in Denver filled with simulators and classrooms. He said losing communications is rare, but it's something pilots prepare for, as most training focuses on what to do if something goes wrong.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been flying for 30 years. I\u2019ve got almost 18,000 hours in United airplanes -- jets, and I\u2019ve lost communication one time,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt really ended up not being that big of a deal. I just went to the emergency frequency, got a different channel, and contacted a different facility to get back into communication.\u201d",
      "In addition to multiple communications systems, planes are equipped with collision avoidance technology that shows pilots where all the other planes are moving around them. These systems alert pilots to an approaching aircraft's trajectory and can recommend evasive action to prevent a collision if planes get too close, Morgan said.",
      "Allied Pilots Association union spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said that when pilots lose contact with controllers, their first action is to continue on their last-directed path. If the outage continues, they'll broadcast their position to every other plane in the area \u2014 much like pilots do at small airports that don\u2019t have a control tower \u2014 as they follow their flight plans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not to downplay the seriousness of communication failure or radar outages, but it\u2019s to recognize that we have procedures, we trained to those procedures, and we have additional equipment that can only enhance the safety margin while we deal with that scenario,\u201d Tajer said.",

      "Despite having received Environmental Protection Agency funding to monitor Sulphur's pollution using high quality air monitors for several years, Michah 6:8 Mission stopped posting data on the group's social media after the law was signed last May, Robertson said.",
      "While federal law requires publicly disclosed monitoring of major pollutants, fence-line communities in Louisiana have long sought data on their exposure to hazardous and likely carcinogenic chemicals like chloroprene and ethylene oxide, which were not subject to these same regulations.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the EPA tightened regulations for these pollutants, though the Trump administration has committed to rolling them back.",
      "The Biden administration's EPA also injected funding to support community-based air monitoring, especially in neighborhoods on the \u201cfence-line\u201d with industrial plants that emitted pollutants that they were not required to publicly monitor under federal law. Some groups say they lack confidence in the data the state does provide and embraced the chance to monitor the air themselves with federal funding.",
      "\u201cThese programs help detect pollution levels in areas of the country not well served by traditional and costly air monitoring systems,\u201d the lawsuit stated.",
      "In response to the influx of grassroots air monitoring, Louisiana's Legislature passed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act, or CAMRA, which requires that community groups that monitor pollutants \u201cfor the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance\u201d of federal law must follow EPA standards, including approved equipment that can costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
      "\u201cYou can't talk about air quality unless you're using the equipment that they want you to use,\u201d said David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, which represents the plaintiffs. He added there was no need for community groups to purchase such expensive equipment when cheaper technology could provide \u201cperfectly adequate results ... to be able to tell your community, your family, whether or not the air they're breathing is safe.\u201d",
      "Community groups sharing information based on cheaper air monitoring equipment that did not meet these requirements could face penalties of $32,500 a day and up to $1 million for intentional violations, according to analysis from the Environmental Integrity Project.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a small nonprofit, we couldn\u2019t afford to pay one day's worth of that,\u201d Robertson said. \"And the way the law is written, it\u2019s so ambiguous, you don\u2019t really know what you can and can\u2019t do.\"",
      "There is no known instance in which the state has pursued these penalties, but community groups say the law has a chilling effect on their work.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this was very clear: to silence the science, preventing people from doing anything with it, sharing it in any form,\u201d said Caitlion Hunter, director of research and policy for Rise St. James, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs \u2018violates their constitutional rights\u2019,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill countered in a written statement.",
      "Industry groups are excluded from the law's requirements, the lawsuit notes.",
      "The law presumes \u201cthat air monitoring information lacks accuracy if disseminated by community air monitoring groups, but not by industry participants or the state,\u201d the complaint states.",
      "The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment, citing pending litigation.",

      "ANTIBES, France -- Artwork by Adrien Brody and James Franco and a chance to sit courtside at a Knicks game with director Spike Lee were among the starry offerings at the annual amfAR Gala to raise money for AIDS research.",
      "Held at the famous Hotel Du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes on Thursday, the evening attracted scores of celebrities in the area for the Cannes Film Festival. Guests included Brody, Lee, Colman Domingo, Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, and Heidi Klum.",
      "This year\u2019s top items for sale included a Dodge Charger that featured in \u201cFast X,\u201d sold off by Rodriguez, raising 475,000 euros ($536,843). There were also some Chopard pear-shaped, yellow-diamond earrings that reached 400,000 ($452,005) euros in the bidding.",

Guest shimmied from their tables to the front of the room to stand in front of the stage and sing along to hits like \u201cNotorious\u201d and \u201cView to a Kill\u201d (which wouldn't be the only James Bond reference of the night).",
      "The sale included artwork from Brody \u2014 sold for 375,000 euros ($423,755) with lunch with the star thrown in \u2014 and Franco \u2014 (sold for 325,000 euros ($367,254) also with a lunch offered with the winning bid.

      "Lee came to the stage and offered a surprise lot, a walk-on part in his next movie. Part of the way through the bidding he added tickets to sit next to him courtside at a New York Nicks game next season, driving the price up to 400,000 euros ($452,005).",
      "The fashion show is a regular feature of the auction curated by Carine Roitfeld, this year was Bond-inspired and saw 27 models turn the middle of the dinning room into a catwalk as they paraded through the room waving at guests they recognized and posing for photos on route.

      "Brazil-based meat giant JBS hopes an upcoming shareholder vote will put it one step closer to a listing on the New York Stock Exchange",
      "Making meat is a messy business. But for Brazilian meat giant JBS, getting approval to trade its shares on the New York Stock Exchange has been even messier.",
      "Environmentalists, animal rights groups, U.S. lawmakers and even some of its own investors have tried to stop a U.S. listing for JBS, noting the company\u2019s long record of corruption, monopolistic behavior and environmental destruction.",
      "But JBS has persevered, saying dual listings in Sao Paulo and New York would attract new investors and better reflect its global portfolio. Late last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission granted the company\u2019s request to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "JBS is one of the world\u2019s largest food companies, with more than 250 production facilities in 17 countries. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees. It\u2019s America\u2019s top beef producer and it\u2019s second-largest producer of poultry and pork.",
      "On Friday, JBS\u2019 minority shareholders \u2013 who hold 30% of its shares \u2013 are scheduled to vote on the dual-listing plan. If they approve it, the company could list its shares in New York as early as next month.",
      "Early vote totals, which JBS released Thursday in a filing in Brazil, showed that 52% of shareholders opposed the plan. But there were many more votes to be counted, so the outcome was far from clear.",
      "Last fall, 20 environmental organizations \u2014 including Mighty Earth, Greenpeace and Rainforest Action Network \u2014 signed an open letter to JBS investors opposing the listing, saying it would put the climate at greater risk.",
      "Glass Lewis, an influential independent investor advisory firm, was also among those recommending that shareholders reject the plan.",
      "In its report, Glass Lewis said the recent return of brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista to the JBS board should concern investors. The brothers, who are the sons of JBS\u2019 founder, were briefly jailed in Brazil in 2017 on bribery and corruption charges.",
      "\u201cIn our view, the involvement of the company and of Joesley and Wesley Batista in multiple high-profile scandals has tarnished the company\u2019s reputation, undermining stakeholder trust and posing a significant risk to its competitive position,\u201d Glass Lewis said.",
      "Glass Lewis also objected to the company\u2019s plan for dual share classes, which would give the Batistas and other controlling shareholders more voting power.",
      "In its response to Glass Lewis' report, JBS said it has established more stringent controls and anti-corruption training at the company in recent years. It also said a U.S. listing would ensure more oversight from U.S. authorities.",
      "\u201cWe believe this transaction will increase our visibility in global markets, attract new investors and further strengthen our position as a global food industry leader,\u201d JBS Global CEO Gilberto Tomazoni said in a statement last month when the company announced Friday\u2019s vote.",
      "But many U.S. lawmakers also aren't convinced JBS belongs on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "In a letter sent last week to JBS, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, noted that Pilgrim\u2019s Pride \u2014 a U.S. company owned by JBS \u2014 was the largest single donor to President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, with a $5 million gift. The SEC\u2019s approval came just weeks after that donation, Warren said.",
      "\u201cI am concerned Pilgrim\u2019s Pride may have made its contribution to the inaugural fund to curry favor with the Trump administration,\u201d Warren wrote in the letter, which asked the company why the donation was made.",
      "In a statement, JBS said it has a \u201clong bipartisan history of participating in the civic process.\u201d",
      "Warren was also among a bipartisan group of 15 U.S. senators who sent a letter to the SEC in January 2024 urging the agency to reject a U.S. listing for JBS. The senators, a diverse group that rarely agrees on policy, included Republicans Marco Rubio of Florida and Josh Hawley of Missouri, Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey and Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont.",
      "The letter noted that in 2020, J&F Investments, a controlling shareholder of JBS that is owned by the Batista family, pleaded guilty to bribery charges in U.S. federal court and agreed to pay fines of $256 million.",
      "It also said Pilgrim\u2019s Pride pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges in 2021. And it said U.S. Senate investigations found that JBS is \u201cturning a blind eye\u201d to rainforest destruction in the Amazon by its suppliers.",
      "\u201cApproval of JBS\u2019 proposed listing would subject U.S. investors to risk from a company with a history of blatant, systemic corruption, and further entrench its monopoly power and embolden its monopoly practices,\u201d the letter said.",

      "The lawsuit, filed in January, alleged that PepsiCo was giving unfair price advantages to Walmart at the expense of other vendors and consumers.

      "A message seeking comment was left Thursday with PepsiCo. At the time of the lawsuit, the Purchase, New York-based company said it didn't offer discounts or promotional support to some customers but not others.",

      "Argentina\u2019s government has unveiled an ambitious scheme to bring billions of undeclared U.S. dollars tucked under mattresses or stashed in foreign bank accounts back into the crisis-prone country",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina's government on Thursday unveiled an ambitious scheme to bring billions of undeclared U.S. dollars tucked under mattresses or stashed in foreign bank accounts back into the crisis-prone country, as libertarian President Javier Milei seeks to boost Argentina's low international currency reserves and stimulate the limping economy.",
      "By eliminating tax reporting requirements, the plan invites savers \u2014 who long have swapped their depreciating pesos for American currency in the country's underground market \u2014 to spend unreported dollars on everyday transactions at home. The government won\u2019t ask questions regarding the source of the repatriated funds, officials promised.",
      "\u201cYour dollars, your decision. What\u2019s yours is yours, not the state\u2019s,\u201d Milei\u2019s presidential spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said in a press conference announcing the policies. \u201cYou can use them however you want, without having to prove where you got them from.\u201d",
      "Milei \u2014 who ran on a controversial campaign pledge to \u201cdollarize\u201d Argentina's troubled economy \u2014 wants a new gush of greenbacks to boost the volume of U.S. dollars in circulation.",
      "Although Argentina's depleted currency reserves sent Milei backpedaling from his initial campaign trail-fervor for \u201cburning down\u201d the central bank and adopting the U.S. dollar as the national currency, these latest measures seek to hasten the country\u2019s transition to a new currency system that would see dollars gradually replacing pesos.",
      "Milei's \u201cendogenous dollarization\u201d scheme would involve fixing the supply of the local currency even as Argentines could use dollars or pesos. He hopes this would encourage Argentines to use their dollar-denominated savings to buy houses and cars as the economy grows and more cash is needed in circulation.",
      "To lay the groundwork, Milei\u2019s government last year imposed a generous tax amnesty for Argentines willing to repatriate capital. In April, it lifted most currency controls as part of a $20 billion bail-out deal with the International Monetary Fund, which conditions its support on the government boosting its scarce foreign reserves.",
      "\u201cYou can spend those dollars without anyone bothering you. So, you go, you want to buy, I don\u2019t know, a house for $200,000, no one has to ask you anything,\u201d Milei told the TV channel of Argentine newspaper La Nacion in an interview Monday.",
      "Over decades of financial turmoil, Argentines have come to depend on U.S. dollars to evade a byzantine system of currency controls, hedge against hyperinflation and protect their nest eggs from government freezes, as has happened several times in the country's recent history, such as during the catastrophic 2001 foreign-debt default.",
      "\u201cThis is how we reached a catastrophic outcome in which 50% of our economy ended up being informal, and the state, like Big Brother, controlled all of its citizens\u2019 transactions, as if they were criminals deserving of punishment,\u201d Adorni said.",
      "Argentina\u2019s official statistics agency estimates that, as of late 2024, Argentine households and firms held more than $270 billion outside their financial system, largely denominated in U.S. currency. While most of the billions are in foreign bank accounts, a significant amount of cash is also stuffed under mattresses and floorboards and in rented safety deposit boxes in underground vaults across the country.",
      "\u201cThose who do this are not criminals,\u201d Economy Minister Luis Caputo said Thursday. \u201cThey are the vast majority of Argentines who have been abused by excessive taxes and controls.",
      "To encourage Argentines to spend their repatriated funds, the new measures scrap strict requirements for businesses and credit card providers to report citizens' purchases to ARCA, Argentina's equivalent of the IRS. They relax strict tax evasion rules so property buyers and public notaries won't need to report transactions. Banks won't be able to request access to clients' tax records.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like an invitation not to pay taxes,\u201d said Ignacio Labaqui, a Buenos Aires-based senior analyst at advisory firm Medley Global Advisors.",
      "That raises concerns about an injection of potentially dirty funds, some of which could be the product of illegal activity. Asked about the danger created by the new fiscal incentives, the IMF sounded a cautious note.",
      "\u201cThe authorities have committed to strengthening financial transparency,\u201d said Julie Kozack, an IMF spokesperson. \u201cAny new measures, including those that may be aimed at encouraging the use of undeclared assets, should be, of course, consistent with these important commitments.\u201d",

      "Researchers are beginning to wonder if blockbuster drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic and Zepbound could play a role in preventing cancer",
      "Excess body weight can raise the risk of certain cancers, leading researchers to wonder whether blockbuster drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic and Zepbound could play a role in cancer prevention.",
      "Now, a study of 170,000 patient records suggests there's a slightly lower risk of obesity-related cancers in U.S. adults with diabetes who took these popular medications compared to those who took another class of diabetes drug not associated with weight loss.",
      "This type of study can't prove cause and effect, but the findings hint at a connection worth exploring. More than a dozen cancers are associated with obesity.",
      "\u201cThis is a call to scientists and clinical investigators to do more work in this area to really prove or disprove this,\u201d said Dr. Ernest Hawk of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The findings were released Thursday by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and will be discussed at its annual meeting in Chicago. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was led by Lucas Mavromatis, a medical student at New York University\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine.",
      "\u201cChronic disease and chronic disease prevention are some of my passions,\u201d said Mavromatis, a former research fellow with an NIH training program.",
      "GLP-1 receptor agonists are injections used to treat diabetes, and some are also approved to treat obesity. They work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. They don't work for everyone and can produce side effects that include nausea and stomach pain.",
      "In the study, researchers analyzed data from 43 U.S. health systems to compare two groups: people with obesity and diabetes who took GLP-1 drugs and other people with the same conditions who took diabetes drugs like sitagliptin. The two groups were equal in size and matched for other characteristics.",
      "After four years, those who took GLP-1 drugs had a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause compared to those who took the other type of diabetes drug. There were 2,501 new cases of obesity-related cancer in the GLP-1 group compared to 2,671 cases in the other group.",
      "The effect was evident in women, but not statistically significant in men. The study couldn't explain that difference, but Mavromatis noted that differences in blood drug concentration, weight loss, metabolism or hormones could be at play.",

      "The budget reconciliation bill passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- The multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago while supporting increased mining, drilling and other traditional energy production.",
      "A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.",
      "The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden's term. Biden\u2019s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law's incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.",
      "\u201cIn a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,\" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "\u201cThese credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy -- creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,'' Goldfuss said.",
      "President Donald Trump celebrated the bill\u2019s passage, calling it \u201carguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.\u201d Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.",
      "The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by the Fourth of July holiday. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.",
      "Full-scale repeal of current credits \"could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,'' the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota.",
      "\"A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,\u201d the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.",
      "In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.",
      "The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.",
      "Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.",
      "House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China \u2014 an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.",
      "The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don\u2019t start construction within 60 days of the bill\u2019s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.",
      "\u201cThis bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it\u2019s proving to be not only economically beneficial \u2014 lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies \u2014 but also essential to America\u2019s energy future,\" said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.",
      "At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.",
      "The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump\u2019s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.",
      "\u201cOnce the land is sold, we will never get it back,\u201d Zinke said after the provision\u2019s removal. \u201dPublic access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism \u2014 our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.\u201d",
      "The land sales had been inserted in an early version of the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that land sales were off the table.",
      "Supporters said the sales would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah. Some states in the Midwest and East have 1% or less federal land by comparison.",
      "A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was \u201cexploring all options\u201d to make the transfers happen.",
      "Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.",
      "Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management Bureau under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke\u2019s work to prevent the public lands sale.",
      "But she added that the bill was still a \u201cbig giveaway\u201d to the private sector. \u201cBy opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,\u201d she said.",
      "At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.",
      "Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.",

In March, an American Airlines plane caught fire after landing in Denver, sending 12 people to the hospital.

The victims in this crash included a family from Spain who was celebrating the ninth birthday of one of their children.",

      "\u2014 Two small planes collided midair near an Arizona airport in mid-February, killing two people who were on one of the aircraft. Following the collision, one plane landed uneventfully, but the other hit the ground near a runway and caught fire. The crash happened at Marana Regional Airport near Tucson.",
      "\u2014 A small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska in early February, killing all 10 people on board. The crash was one of the deadliest in the state in 25 years. Radar data indicated that the plane rapidly lost elevation and speed. The U.S. Coast Guard was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft.",
      "\u2014 A medical transport plane that had just taken off plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood in late January, killing all six people on board and one person on the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board said its cockpit voice recorder likely hadn't been functioning for years. The crew made no distress calls to air traffic control.",
      "\u2014 The collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and a U.S. Army helicopter above the nation's capital killed everyone aboard both aircraft in late January. It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.",
      "\u2014 A jetliner operated by Jeju Air skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames in late December in South Korea after its landing gear apparently failed to deploy. All but two of the 181 people aboard were killed in one of that country\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "\u2014 The American Airlines plane that caught fire at Denver International Airport in March had been diverted there because the crew reported engine vibrations. While taxiing to the gate, an engine caught fire, prompting slides to be deployed so passengers could evacuate quickly. The people taken to hospitals had minor injuries.",
      "\u2014 A single-engine plane carrying five people crashed and burst into flames that same month in the parking lot of a retirement community near a small airport near Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Everyone on board survived. Three people were taken to an area burn center.",
      "\u2014 A Delta Air Lines jet flipped over while landing at Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport in February. All 80 people on board survived, but some people received minor injuries.

Investigators said when trying to determine the cause, they would consider the weather conditions and the possibility of human error.",
      "\u2014 Earlier this month, two commercial planes had to abort their landings at Reagan National Airport near Washington because of an Army Black Hawk helicopter flying near the Pentagon. The Army suspended all its helicopter flights in the area after this incident. It was a Black Hawk priority air transport from the same unit known as the PAT25 that collided with the passenger jet in midair in January.",
      "\u2014 In April, on the same day as the fatal New York helicopter crash, a wing tip of an American Airlines plane struck another plane from the same airline on a taxiway of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia. There were no reported injuries. Multiple members of Congress were aboard one of the flights.",

      "The rate increased to 6.86% from 6.81% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.94%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also rose. The average rate ticked up to 6.01% from 5.92% last week. It\u2019s down from 6.24% a year ago, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasurys, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions and bond market investors\u2019 expectations about the economy and inflation.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, which it set in mid-January. The average rate\u2019s low point so far was five weeks ago, when it briefly dropped to 6.62%. It\u2019s now at its highest level since Feb. 13, when it averaged 6.87%.",
      "The elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have discouraged home shoppers, leading to a lackluster start to the spring homebuying season, even as the inventory of homes on the market is up sharply from last year. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last month to the slowest pace for the month of April going back to 2009.",
      "The recent rise in mortgage rates reflects moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which had mostly fallen after climbing to around 4.8% in mid-January, began rising March amid investor anxiety over the Trump administration's trade war. It rose again last week after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day truce in their trade dispute, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t have to cut interest rates  as deeply as expected this year in order to shield the economy from the damage of tariffs.",

      "The increase in mortgage rates is discouraging some would-be homebuyers during what\u2019s traditionally the busiest period of the year for home sales. Last week, mortgage applications fell 5.1% from a week earlier as home loan borrowing costs increased, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Applications for a loan to buy a home were still up 13% from a year earlier.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A government report released on Thursday covering wide swaths of American health and wellness reflects some of the most contentious views on vaccines, the nation's food supply, pesticides and prescription drugs held by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The much-anticipated \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d report calls for increased scrutiny of the childhood vaccine schedule, a review of the pesticides sprayed on American crops and a description of the nation's children as overmedicated and undernourished.",
      "\u201cNever in American history has the federal government taken a position on public health like this,\u201d Kennedy told a group of MAHA supporters during an event unveiling the report on Thursday.",
      "While it does not have the force of a law or official policy, the 69-page report will be used over the next three months for the MAHA commission to fashion a plan that can be implemented during the remainder of President Donald Trump's term.",
      "Speaking to MAHA supporters at the White House on Thursday, Trump praised the report.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong and we will not stop until we defeat the chronic disease epidemic in America,\u201d",
      "Kennedy refused to provide details about who authored the report.",
      "Increased scrutiny of childhood vaccines \u2014 credited with saving millions of people from deadly diseases \u2014 figures prominently in the report. It poses questions over the necessity of school mandates that require children to get vaccinated for admittance and suggestions that vaccines should undergo more clinical trials, including with placebos.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, has raised doubts about the safety of shots even as a measles outbreak has sickened more than 1,000 Americans. This week, Kennedy\u2019s health department moved to limit U.S. access to COVID-19 shots.",
      "The report does not provide any evidence that the childhood vaccine schedule, which includes shots for measles, polio and the chickenpox, is to blame for rising obesity, diabetes or autism rates, said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not as if they\u2019re positing any kind of causal link,\u201d Adalja said, adding that Kennedy is \u201cis trying to devalue vaccines in the minds of Americans.\u201d",
      "Parts of the report highlight growing factions within the Trump administration's MAHA movement, even as the report strained to appease opposing forces within the politically diverse coalition that Trump and Kennedy have fostered.",
      "The report makes dozens of references to dietary guidelines and standards in Europe, but Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin promised it would not yield more rigorous regulations.",
      "\u201cThis cannot happen through a European mandate system that stifles growth,\u201d Zeldin said in a call with reporters.",
      "Despite numerous studies and statements throughout the MAHA report that raise concerns about American food products, Trump Cabinet officials insisted during a call with reporters on Thursday that the nation's food supply is safe.",
      "The report mentions that glyphosate, a commonly used chemical sprayed on crops, may cause serious health problems, including cancer. The World Health Organization has said that the chemical is a probable carcinogen to humans, although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is unlikely.",
      "Farmers, who \u2014 alongside Republican lawmakers \u2014 hounded the Trump administration leading up to the report's release, swiftly criticized the report's comments on the chemicals.",
      "\u201cThe Make America Healthy Again Report is filled with fear-based rather than science-based information about pesticides,\u201d the National Corn Growers Association said in a statement.",
      "But Kennedy's MAHA supporters were also disappointed, saying the report didn't go far enough when it came to chemicals used on crops.",
      "\u201cIf the Trump White House and Republicans don't take pesticides and glyphosate's link to human health issues seriously, it will cost them the MAHA vote in the midterms,\u201d said Dave Murphy, a former Kennedy fundraiser who spearheaded a push for the issue to be addressed in the report.",
      "Talking about the report on Thursday, Trump reiterated his \u201clove\u201d for farmers.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins acknowledged the tight rope Trump officials are walking to keep farmers, many of them in Republican-leaning states, happy while also working to satisfy Kennedy's eclectic and health-conscious following.",
      "\u201cDo all of us agree on everything? Of course not,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cBut the place that we have landed, which is, I think all of us agree, is that this is not a binary choice between an industry, agriculture and health.\u201d",
      "The report comes out stronger, however, against ultraprocessed foods \u2014 industrially made products high in refined grains, sugar, saturated fats and additives like artificial dyes that now make up two-thirds of the diet for U.S. teens and children. Such products have been linked to a host of poor health outcomes, though documenting how they cause those problems has been notoriously difficult and time-consuming.",
      "The MAHA commission report \u201cis a pretty accurate depiction of the nutrition crisis facing our country,\u201d said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, an expert in nutrition and policy at Tufts University.",
      "The report focuses not only on ultraprocessed foods, but also on how too few fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds and fish are present in U.S. diets, he noted. But the report leaves out excess salt, which causes harm, even in young children.",
      "The MAHA report calls on the National Institutes of Health to execute sweeping, nationwide studies of ultraprocessed foods, even as the White House has called for $18 billion to be axed from the agency's budget. An extra $500 million has been requested from Congress for Kennedy's MAHA initiative.",
      "The report raises concerns about other environmental and chemical research results, funded by corporations and industry, being skewed.",
      "But the MAHA commission's call for more neutral research comes as sweeping budget and staff cuts propelled by Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency have resulted in 20,000 jobs lost at the nation\u2019s health department and billions of dollars rescinded for research studies. The Trump administration also gutted the Environmental Public Health Tracking Program in its cuts of health-tracking programs.",
      "The report also raises concerns about the lack of physical activity among children and their prescription drug use, including antibiotics and medications used to treat attention deficit disorders.",
      "Some in the MAHA movement have raised concerns about offering medications, even over-the-counter drugs like pain relievers, to children.",
      "But Trump spent 10 minutes during Thursday's event telling MAHA supporters how he's working to lower the cost of prescription drugs. The East Room crowd, packed full of MAHA supporters that offered applause for Trump's calls to investigate chronic disease in children, responded mildly \u2014 and eventually stopped clapping entirely \u2014 as he continued to talk about lowering drug costs.",
      "\u201cI think it's going to go down as one of the most important things we've ever down because drug prices are going to go down,\u201d he said, as Kennedy looked on.",

      "NEW YORK -- Tyrese Haliburton smiled widely as he envisioned the scene Sunday when the Pacers host Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals to cap a daylong sports celebration in Indiana.",
      "Yet along with the Pacers' excitement after winning the first two games against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden came a word of caution. A 2-0 lead guarantees nothing and things can change quickly.",
      "Look no further than last year in a series between these same teams.",
      "\u201cYou cannot assume going home is going to be easier. It never is,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cEach game as you ascend in a playoff series becomes harder. New York, they've got an amazing fighting spirit.\u201d",
      "The Knicks will have to call upon it after digging themselves a big hole in New York. They blew Game 1 with a bad finish to the fourth quarter, then couldn't overcome a poor start to the period in Game 2.",
      "Now they will need to become the first team to lose the first two games at home in the conference finals and come back to win the series.",
      "\u201cWe know it's 2-0 but it's still a long series,\u201d Knicks guard Mikal Bridges said.",
      "Bridges wasn't on the Knicks team that took a 2-0 lead over the Pacers last year in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Indiana evened it up when the series changed sites and eventually won it with a Game 7 romp back at Madison Square Garden.",
      "The Pacers may not need to go back to New York this time. A win Sunday and another Tuesday in Game 4 would send them to the NBA Finals for the second time as they chase the franchise's first title since their ABA days.",
      "An NBA Finals wouldn't be any bigger than what the Pacers should have Sunday. The Indianapolis 500 is being run that afternoon, with Game 3 tipping off at night. It's the first time since 2013 the Pacers have a home game the day of the race.",
      "\u201cI've been to the 500. It's crazy, so I can\u2019t imagine all those people then coming over to Gainbridge (Fieldhouse). You know, going to be a rowdy crowd, going to be a little intoxicated. Who knows?\" Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton said.",
      "\"It\u2019s going to be a special time. It's going to be a lot of fun.\"",
      "On the other side, Jalen Brunson was telling the Knicks' fans to hang in there.",
      "New York's first trip to the conference finals since 2000 is shaping up to be a short one. The starting unit has put the Knicks into quick deficits in both games and the Pacers' huge depth advantage may have worn down the Knicks and led to their shaky play in both fourth quarters.",
      "Coach Tom Thibodeau played backup center Mitchell Robinson longer than All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns in Game 2 for better hope of stopping the Pacers, but that weakened his team offensively. The Knicks need to figure out the right combinations \u2014 if they have any \u2014 to both score with and slow down the Pacers.",
      "\u201cFor me, what I want to say to them is obviously we've got to continue to fight,\u201d Brunson said, when asked his message. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take one day at a time, one game at a time. We can\u2019t look ahead, we can\u2019t think about anything other than Game 3 at this point.\u201d",
      "The All-Star point guard has done his part, scoring 43 points in Game 1 and adding 36 more along with 11 assists in Game 2. But the Knicks went cold when he was on the bench to start the final 12 minutes and that turned out to be the decisive stretch of the game.",
      "The Pacers don't have those problems. Carlisle can go deep into his bench \u2014 even for players who hadn't been in his recent rotation \u2014 and Indiana remains just as effective.",
      "Carlisle has continuously called this a 13-day series, referring to the stretch between Game 1 and a potential Game 7 in New York on June 2. After tying K.C. Jones for 10th place on the career list with his 81st postseason victory Friday, he was still thinking that way.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Day 3 of 13 days and no one\u2019s getting ahead of themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to do.\u201d",

      "MONACO -- Lando Norris beat the Monaco track record, his main Formula 1 rival and a local hero to take pole position on Saturday.",
      "Perhaps most importantly, Norris made a breakthrough in his own struggles with F1 qualifying, which have hampered his championship chances against McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri.",
      "\u201cIt's been a long time coming,\u201d said Norris, who hadn't been on pole since the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever doubted what I can do. Of course, I\u2019ve got frustrated, I\u2019ve been unhappy, because that\u2019s normal,\" Norris added. \"If you don\u2019t win, if you don\u2019t get pole, you\u2019re not going to be happy, especially when it\u2019s where you should be, it\u2019s what the objective is.\u201d",

      "Norris' time of 1 minute, 9.954 seconds replaced a record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2019.",
      "It comes as Norris tries to cut into Piastri's 13-point standings lead and follows weeks of frustration in qualifying \u2014 sometimes from small mistakes, but also a dramatic crash in Saudi Arabia last month. Leclerc, who won the Monaco GP last year, was denied a fourth career pole at his home race.",
      "Leclerc said Monaco\u2019s slow and twisty layout allowed Ferrari to dodge some of the \u201ccompromises\u201d it\u2019s had to make with its setup at more varied tracks.",
      "Defending champion Max Verstappen, the winner of the Emilia-Romagna GP last week, was fifth for Red Bull after predicting Monaco\u2019s low-speed nature wouldn\u2019t suit his car.",
      "Qualifying has typically been more important at Monaco than anywhere else on the F1 calendar. It's almost impossible to overtake on the narrow streets so grid position is vital.",
      "It could be a little different this time because drivers will be required to change tires at least twice during the race.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really knows what to expect,\" Piastri said.",
      "That rule change follows a dull race last year when an early red flag allowed all drivers to make their mandatory pit stop. The race finished with the top 10 all in the same order that they started the race.",
      "Seven-time world champion Hamilton was fourth on Saturday after Ferrari rebuilt the entire rear end of his car following a crash in practice.",
      "It was a session to forget for Mercedes as its cars caused two red flags.",
      "George Russell is set to start 14th after his car broke down in the tunnel with a suspected electrical problem, causing a lengthy stoppage while it was pushed out of the way by a track marshal crew. His 18-year-old teammate Kimi Antonelli hit the wall and was 15th.",
      "Haas rookie Oliver Bearman qualified 17th but dropped to the back of the grid because of a 10-place penalty imposed on Friday for overtaking under red flags when practice was stopped.",

      "Naqi Rizvi loves the \u201cabsolute freedom\u201d he feels on the tennis court",
      "LONDON -- Naqi Rizvi loves the \u201cabsolute freedom\u201d he feels on the tennis court.",
      "Winning titles is fun, too.",
      "The 34-year-old blind tennis champion is on a mission to not only raise awareness but also elevate the sport into the Paralympics.",
      "\"That would be the dream, and I\u2019d love to be the first Paralympic champion if I can,\u201d Rizvi said.",
      "The London resident, fully blind from the age of 7 because of congenital glaucoma, only took up the sport a decade ago and is now the No. 1-ranked men's player in the world for his category.",
      "Also an avid runner, Rizvi has completed two marathons and although jogging with a guide is great, tennis offers more.",
      "\u201cOn a tennis court, I have absolute freedom because I know where the boundaries are, no one needs to tell me which way to turn, I don\u2019t need to have a cane or anything of this sort,\" he told The Associated Press during a practice session at the National Tennis Center in southwest London.",
      "\"It\u2019s just the absolute sense of freedom to know that I can run comfortably, make my own decisions, and then be able to play points or rallies. It\u2019s just incredible.\u201d",
      "The rules are basically the same as mainstream tennis just with smaller dimensions and slightly lower net. Tactile lines are taped onto the court so players like Rizvi can feel the boundaries. Depending on the level of visual impairment, you are allowed up to three bounces of the ball. The foam ball contains a bell so players can audibly track it.",
      "\u201cWhat I find interesting about blind tennis is it\u2019s incredibly technical,\u201d said Rizvi, who also possesses a big serve.",
      "The problem-solving aspect of the sport is something Rizvi enjoys \u2014 no surprise given that he studied engineering at University College London.",
      "\u201cYou really need to anticipate after you\u2019ve heard the first bounce where the second and third will be,\u201d he said. \"You obviously can\u2019t see how your opponent has hit the ball, so it\u2019s a lot of anticipation and a lot of practice and getting used to different trajectories that the ball can take.",
      "Rizvi didn't even know that tennis was an option until he visited Metro Blind Sport in London a decade ago. He was hooked right away.",
      "\u201cI can almost assure you that if you did a survey of blind and partially sighted people,\" he said, \"the majority of them wouldn\u2019t have any idea because it\u2019s not televised, it\u2019s not in any other mainstream events, so how are people supposed to find out?\u201d",
      "The Lawn Tennis Association supports a visually impaired program that includes practice sessions at the governing body's National Tennis Center. That's where Jack Draper, the world No. 5 player, tried out the different levels. The LTA also runs tournaments each year and sends \u201cTeam GB\u201d to an international competition.",
      "Rizvi noted that there's not much financial backing in the sport. There's no prize money at tournaments and players often fund their own travel.",
      "\u201cUnless you obviously have the visibility and the money behind it, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cGoverning bodies need to take a more active role and try and give parity to all forms of disability tennis not just the ones that have made it big like wheelchair tennis, for example.\u201d",
      "Rizvi, who is married and works in finance, originally represented his native Pakistan but for the past year has been part of England's program since gaining British citizenship. He discussed his childhood \u2014 his father is Pakistani and his mother is Indian \u2014 in a TEDx Talk he gave as a student at UCL.",
      "Invented in Japan by Takei Miyoshi in 1984, blind tennis is played around the world. Last year's world championships in Italy were the largest to date with 117 players from 20 countries, the International Blind Tennis Association said.",
      "Rizvi has won several national titles, a European championship, the world championship in 2023 \u2014 as well as gold that year at the ISBA World Games. He is also the two-time defending champion of the Play Your Way to Wimbledon tournament.",
      "The International Paralympic Committee handbook spells out that the sport or discipline must be \u201cwidely and regularly practiced\u201d in at least 32 countries and three continents.",
      "\u201cI really want it to be in the Paralympics,\u201d Rizvi said, \"but I also want this to be a mainstream sport which can be part of the ATP Tour, part of Grand Slam tournaments, just like wheelchair tennis has made such amazing leaps forward. I\u2019d love for blind tennis to be there as well because it\u2019s definitely got the potential.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s got the countries, the continents, the people, the passion behind it.\"",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school\u2019s ability to enroll international students",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school's ability to enroll international students.",
      "The government told Harvard's thousands of current foreign students that they must transfer to other schools or they will lose their legal permission to be in the U.S.",
      "The move could significantly affect the university, which enrolls nearly 6,800 international students, most of them in graduate programs. Those students may now have to scramble to figure out their next steps.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security took this latest step because Harvard refused to comply with requests to produce records about its foreign students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a letter. Noem accused Harvard of \u201cperpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies and employs racist \u2018diversity, equity and inclusion\u2019 policies.\u2019\u201d Harvard said the action is unlawful and undermines the school\u2019s research mission.",
      "Here's what to know about how this decision affects international students and what legal authority Noem has to take the step.",
      "The U.S. government has authority over who comes into the country. The Department of Homeland Security oversees which colleges are part of the Student Exchange and Visitor Program, and on Thursday it said it would remove Harvard. The program gives colleges the ability to issue documentation to foreign students admitted to the schools. Then, the students apply to obtain visas to study in the United States.",
      "Students who completed their degrees this semester will be allowed to graduate. Noem's letter said the changes would take effect for the 2025-2026 school year. Harvard's Class of 2025 is expected to graduate next week.",
      "However, students who have yet to complete their degree need to transfer to another university, Noem said, or they'll lose their legal permission to remain in the U.S.",
      "No, not unless the government changes its decision or a court steps in. For now, Noem said Harvard could restore its status as a host institution for foreign students if it complied with a list of demands within 72 hours. Those demands include requests for a range of records, such as disciplinary records for international students, plus audio and video recordings of protest activity.",
      "Harvard previously declined to provide those records. The university said Thursday it was working to provide guidance to affected students.",
      "Harvard's battle with the Trump administration dates to early April. The storied institution became the first elite college to refuse to comply with the government's demands to limit pro-Palestinian protests and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion policies. That kicked off a series of escalating actions against Harvard. Various federal agencies, including DHS and the National Institutes of Health, have cut their grant funding to Harvard, significantly impacting research projects conducted by faculty. Harvard has sued the administration, seeking to end the grant freeze.",
      "The administration first threatened to revoke Harvard's ability to host international students back in April. Trump also has said Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status. Doing so would strike at the school's ability to fundraise, as wealthy donors often give to tax-exempt institutions to lower their own tax burdens.",

      "More than 10,000 internet-connected cameras were targeted, including private devices and public traffic cameras near critical transportation points, such as ports, rail hubs or border crossings. Most were in Ukraine, though some were in Romania, Poland and other eastern or central European countries.",
      "Officials did not disclose details about the hackers' success or how long they remained unnoticed. The activity detailed in the report began in 2022, the same year that Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "Russia is expected to continue its efforts to spy on aid shipments, and companies involved in aid logistics or shipments should be on guard, according to the report, which was issued jointly by the NSA, the FBI and security agencies in several allied nations.",
      "\u201cTo defend against and mitigate these threats, at-risk entities should anticipate targeting,\u201d the NSA said.",
      "Authorities linked the activity to a Russian military intelligence unit dubbed \u201cFancy Bear\u201d that is well known for its past campaigns targeting the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The hackers used a variety of tactics to gain access, including spearphishing, which involves sending authentic-looking messages to a potential victim that contain links to harmful software or requests for sensitive information.",
      "The Russian team also exploited security vulnerabilities in computer devices used at small and in-home offices, networks that often lack the security measures found in larger systems.",
      "The hackers didn't use particularly innovative techniques, according to Grant Geyer, chief strategy officer at the cybersecurity company Claroty. Nevertheless, the sprawling yet carefully orchestrated effort gives the Russians a \u201cgranular understanding\u201d of the aid sent to Ukraine, he said.",
      "\u201cThey have done detailed targeting across the entire supply chain to understand what equipment is moving, when and how \u2014 whether it\u2019s by aircraft, ship or rail,\u201d Geyer said.",
      "Russia could use the information it obtained to hone its war planning, Geyer said, or to plot further cyber or physical attacks on the supply chain to Ukraine.",
      "Last fall, U.S. intelligence officials issued a public bulletin directing American defense companies and suppliers to increase security precautions following several acts of sabotage in Europe that officials have blamed on Russia.",
      "The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.",

      "It\u2019s not an official holiday \u2013 yet \u2013 but for many cryptocurrency enthusiasts \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day\u201d is still special. Thursday marks the 15th anniversary of the first known use of cryptocurrency to buy real-world goods.",
      "The 10,000 bitcoin that software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid for two Papa John\u2019s pizzas delivered to his Florida home on May 22, 2010, were worth about $41 at the time. Today they\u2019re worth $1.1 billion, as bitcoin hits record high prices.",
      "Several cryptocurrency companies are announcing promotions and other celebrations to mark Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it\u2019s giving away pizzas to more than 2,000 people at gatherings held around the world.",
      "Here\u2019s the backstory of Bitcoin Pizza Day:",
      "The first bitcoin was created in early 2009 by the digital currency\u2019s still unknown creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It started as a passion project for libertarian-minded computer nerds who wanted to create a digital payment system that didn\u2019t rely on a third party \u2013 like a government or financial institution \u2013 for transactions.",
      "Hanyecz was an early enthusiast and became active on an early bitcoin internet message board, offering technical advice on how to \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin more effectively.",
      "Central to bitcoin\u2019s technology is the process through which transactions are verified and then recorded on what\u2019s known as the blockchain. Computers connected to the bitcoin network race to solve complex mathematical calculations that verify the transactions, with the winner earning newly minted bitcoins as a reward in a process known as mining.",
      "In the early days, enthusiasts could mine bitcoin through their home computers and Hanyecz accumulated thousands of the new digital asset. Nowadays, mining bitcoin has become a highly competitive field with multi-billion-dollar companies using specialized computers in entire data centers to acquire new bitcoins.",
      "In the early days, no one quite knew what to do with the bitcoin they were mining. On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz tried an experiment and posted a message offering 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.",
      "\u201cI like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that,\u201d Hanyecz wrote.",
      "Three days later, Hanyecz wondered if he needed to up the price.",
      "\u201cSo nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I\u2019m offering too low?\u201d he wrote.",
      "But the next day, Hanyecz said he\u2019d successfully traded his bitcoin for pizza. Another bitcoin enthusiast from California had paid for the Papa John\u2019s pizza in exchange for the cryptocurrency, according to a book about bitcoin's early history, \u201cDigital Gold.\u201d",
      "\u201cA great milestone reached,\u201d said another early bitcoin enthusiast on the message board congratulating Hanyecz.",
      "It did not take long for bitcoin to take off after the first pizza deal. Bitcoin started getting more publicity and grew, thanks in part to the popularity of an online black-market site, Silk Road, which only accepted bitcoin.",
      "By February 2014, with bitcoin trading at around $600, Hanyecz marveled at what the digital currency had become.",
      "\u201cI mean people can say I\u2019m stupid, but it was a great deal at the time,\u201d Hanyecz wrote on the bitcoin message board. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have known it would take off like this.\u201d",
      "Five years later, when bitcoin was trading as high as $11,000, Hanyecz reflected on what buying that first pizza meant for bitcoin.",
      "\u201cIt made it real for some people, I mean it certainly did for me,\u201d Hanyecz said on the television show \u201c60 minutes.\u201d",
      "Hanyecz has largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years and efforts to contact him by The Associated Press were unsuccessful.",
      "After many years of fits and starts, bitcoin now appears firmly entrenched in the mainstream financial system. While it hasn\u2019t taken off as a way to pay for everyday items like pizza, bitcoin has found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value.",
      "Retirement accounts can buy bitcoin ETFs, more and more companies buy bitcoin as corporate treasuries, and President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a government reserve of bitcoin.",
      "Bitcoin was trading at about $111,000 on Thursday morning \u2014 a new record. That price gives it a market cap of more than $2 trillion, or about the same as Amazon.",

      "New research finds clownfish shrink their bodies to survive warming oceans",
      "NEW YORK -- To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.",
      "Scientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papa New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.",
      "Heat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.",
      "Scientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that's still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.",
      "\u201cWe were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,\u201d said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "Though scientists don\u2019t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It\u2019s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.",
      "Certain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.",
      "Other animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn't yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,\u201d said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it's not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.",
      "Researchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to \u201ccatch up\u201d and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.",
      "\u201cThese natural systems really are under stress, but there's a capacity for incredible resilience,\u201d Versteeg said.",

      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \u201ca huge win.\"",
      "\u201cTeachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group\u2019s political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\u201d Hoffman said.",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\u201cIt was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\u201cIt is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\u201d Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\u201cProviding some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201dThat said, most states have not.\"",

      "Google on Tuesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence technology to accelerate a year-old makeover of its search engine that is changing the way people get information and curtailing the flow of internet traffic to websites",
      "Google on Tuesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence technology to accelerate a year-long makeover of its search engine that is changing the way people get information and curtailing the flow of internet traffic to websites.",
      "The next phase outlined at Google's annual developers conference includes releasing a new \u201cAI mode\u201d option in the United States. The feature makes interacting with Google's search engine more like having a conversation with an expert capable of answering questions on just about any topic imaginable.",
      "AI mode is being offered to all comers in the U.S. just two-and-half-months after the company began testing with a limited Labs division audience.",
      "Google is also feeding its latest AI model Gemini 2.5, into its search algorithms and will soon begin testing other AI features, such as the ability to automatically buy tickets to concerts and conduct searches through live video feeds.",
      "The expansion builds upon a transformation that began a year ago with the introduction of conversational summaries called \u201cAI overviews\u201d that have been increasingly appearing at the top of its results page and eclipsing its traditional rankings of web links.",
      "About 1.5 billion people now regularly engage with \u201cAI overviews,\u201d according to Google, and most users are now entering longer and more complex queries.",
      "\u201cWhat all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said before a packed crowd in an amphitheater near the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters.",
      "Although Pichai and other Google executives predicted AI overviews would trigger more searches and ultimately more clicks to other sites, it hasn't worked out that way so far, according to the findings of search optimization firm BrightEdge.",
      "Clickthrough rates from Google's search results have declined by nearly 30% during the past year, according to BrightEdge's recently released study, which attributed the decrease to people becoming increasingly satisfied with AI overviews.",
      "The decision to make AI mode broadly available after a relatively short test period reflects Google's confidence that the technology won't habitually spew misinformation that tarnishes its brand's reputation, and acknowledges the growing competition from other AI-powered search options from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity.",
      "The rapid rise of AI alternatives emerged as a recurring theme in legal proceedings that could force Google to dismantle parts of its internet empire after a federal judge last year declared its search engine to be an illegal monopoly.",
      "In testimony during a trial earlier this month, longtime Apple executive Eddy Cue said Google searches done through the iPhone maker's Safari browser have been declining because more people are leaning on AI-powered alternatives.",
      "And Google has cited the upheaval being caused by AI's rise as one of the main reasons that it should only be required to make relatively minor changes to the way it operates its search engine because technology already is changing the competitive landscape.",
      "But Google's reliance on more AI so far appears to be enabling its search engine to maintain its mantle as the internet's main gateway \u2014 a position that's main reason its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., boasts a market value of $2 trillion.",
      "During the year ending in March, Google received 136 billion monthly visits, nearly 29 times more than ChatGPT, according to data compiled by onelittleweb.com.",
      "Even Google's own AI mode acknowledged that the company's search engine seems unlikely to be significantly hurt by the shift to AI technology when a reporter from The Associated Press asked whether its introduction would make the company even more powerful.",
      "\u201cYes, it is highly highly that Google's AI mode will make Google more powerful, particularly in the realm of information access and online influence,\u201d the AI mode responded. The feature also warns web publishers should be concerned about AI mode reducing the traffic that they get from search results.",
      "Google's upcoming tests in its Labs division foreshadow the next wave of AI technology likely to be made available to the masses.",
      "Besides using its Project Mariner technology to test the ability of an AI agent to buy tickets and book restaurant reservations, Google will also experiment with searches done through live video and an opt-in option to give its AI technology access to people's Gmail so it can learn more about a user's tastes and interests. Other features on this summer's test list include a \u201cDeep Search\u201d option that will use AI to dig even deeper into complex topics and another tool that will produce graphical presentations of sports and finance data.",
      "Google is also introducing its equivalent of VIP access to all its AI technology with an \u201cUltra\u201d subscription package that will cost $250 per month and include 30 terabytes of storage, too. That's a big step beyond Google's previous top-of-the-line AI \u201cpro\u201d package that cost $20 per month and included two terabytes of storage. \u2014\u2014",
      "The Associated Press and Google have a licensing and technology agreement that gives Google\u2019s Gemini AI chatbot access to AP\u2019s news coverage.",

      "The solid reception for the Chinese company, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., in Hong Kong suggests there is still an appetite among international investors for leading Chinese manufacturers despite trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.",
      "It sold more than 135 million shares at their maximum offer price, 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.6) each. Its shares rose after they started trading at 296 Hong Kong dollars ($37.80), 12.5% higher than their offer price. They closed 16.4% higher.",

      "The company has faced pressure from the U.S. In January, the U.S. Defense Department added it to a list of companies it says have ties to China\u2019s military, an accusation that CATL denied. It called the inclusion a \u201cmistake.\u201d",
      "In April, John Moolenaar, chairperson of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, wrote to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America to demand that the two American banks withdraw from their work on CATL's IPO. But the two banks stayed on.",
      "In the U.S., Ford Motor Co. is licensing technology from CATL to build batteries, but the plan faces resistance from some Republican lawmakers, who have expressed concern that the Chinese company could benefit from U.S. tax dollars.",
      "Because the U.S. has listed CATL as having ties to the U.S. military, the share offering excluded onshore U.S. investors. However, many large U.S. institutional investors have offshore accounts that allowed them to participate.",

      "\u201cListing in Hong Kong means we are more broadly integrated into the global capital markets, and it\u2019s also a new starting point for us to promote the global zero-carbon economy,\u201d Zeng said.",
      "Zeng, who trained as a physicist, helped found Amperex Technology Ltd. in 1999. It mainly was engaged in research and development and manufacturing of consumer lithium batteries. The company was sold to Tokyo-listed TDK Corporation in 2005, but Zeng continued to oversee the firm's management until 2017, its listing documents say.",

      "The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure.",
      "Monday\u2019s 66-32 procedural vote keeps one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities on track for passage and highlights the growing political strength of the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last year\u2019s election and has amassed a large war chest for next year\u2019s midterms. Several Democrats reversed and voted to move forward with the legislation after negotiations with Republicans in recent days.",
      "The fate of the legislation, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had been uncertain in recent weeks despite early bipartisan support. Senate Democrats blocked it earlier this month in part over concerns about how Trump and his family were benefiting from private crypto endeavors, including a newly launched stablecoin.",
      "Republicans won support from Democrats after strengthening regulations on foreign issuers, beefing up enforcement and barring large tech companies like Meta and Google from issuing their own stablecoins. The Senate will now consider the bill and could vote on final passage as soon as this week, depending on the number of amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans.",
      "Still, Democrats were divided on the legislation. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have said the bill could help Trump enrich himself and needs stronger protections.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the final bill does nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 to rein in the President\u2019s crypto corruption,\u201d Warren said ahead of the bill\u2019s passage. She said the legislation would \u201caccelerate Trump\u2019s corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market\u201d and make Trump \u201cthe regulator of his own financial product.\u201d",
      "Negotiators added tougher ethics rules for members of Congress and the executive branch, including preventing members of Congress from issuing stablecoins. But Warren and several other Democrats said it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThis Congress should be a check on the president,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The bill would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.",
      "Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset for commercial transactions than other forms of crypto.",
      "The move to regulate the industry has been bipartisan, but Trump\u2019s involvement in the crypto industry complicated the legislation\u2019s path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And he is set to attend a dinner May 22 that\u2019s open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins.",
      "Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "A former skeptic turned zealous promoter, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previous enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industry\u2019s top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation.",
      "Democratic supporters of the legislation argued that Congress can\u2019t step aside just because of Trump\u2019s involvement in the market.",
      "\u201cThe stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can\u2019t afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, one of the lead Democratic negotiators on the legislation. \u201cWe need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\u201d",

The platforms must also take steps to delete duplicate content.",
      "Many states have already banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn, but the Take It Down Act is a rare example of federal regulators imposing on internet companies.",
      "The bill, sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in April by a 409-2 vote and clearing the Senate by unanimous consent.",
      "But the measure isn't without critics. Free speech advocates and digital rights groups say the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, including legal pornography and LGBTQ content. Others say it could allow the government to monitor private communications and undermine due process.",
      "The first lady appeared at a Capitol Hill roundtable with lawmakers and young women who had explicit images of them put online, saying it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see what teenagers and especially girls go through after this happens to them. She also included a victim among her guests for the president's address to a joint session of Congress the day after that meeting.",

      "Scientists have found evidence of monkey kidnappings in Panama",
      "WASHINGTON -- A baby howler monkey clung to the back of an older male monkey, its tiny fingers grasping fur. But they're not related and not even the same species.",
      "Scientists spotted surprising evidence of what they describe as monkey kidnappings while reviewing video footage from a small island of Panama. The capuchin monkeys were seen carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023.",
      "\u201cThis was very much a shocking finding,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Goldsborough, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this in the animal kingdom.\"",
      "The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. Capuchins are house cat-size monkeys found in South America and Central America. They are long-lived, clever and learn new behaviors from each other. One group of capuchins in Panama has even learned to use stone tools to crack open nuts and seafood.",
      "Goldsberg and other researchers at Max Planck and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute had set up more than 80 cameras to study capuchin tool use, but were surprised to see the first howler babies appear in early 2022.",
      "The footage showed the capuchins walking and pounding their stone tools with baby howlers on their backs. But cameras did not capture the moments of abduction, which scientists said likely happened up in the trees, where howlers spend most of their time.",
      "\u201cOur window into this story is constrained,\u201d said co-author Margaret Crofoot of Max Planck and the Smithsonian. The findings were published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video -- from a few weeks to a few months in age -- were too young to be weaned.",
      "\u201cA hopeful part of me wants to believe some escaped and went back to their mothers, but we don\u2019t know,\" said Crofoot.",
      "The videos recorded a few instances of young capuchin males still carrying howler babies that had died, likely from starvation. Many animals -- from gorillas to orcas -- have been observed carrying their own dead offspring, though scientists aren\u2019t sure the reasons.",
      "Why did the capuchin males do it? There were no signs of deliberate aggression toward the babies and they weren\u2019t eaten, ruling out predation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all spent hours wracking our brains why they would do this,\u201d said Goldsborough.",
      "The first baby-snatcher may have had a confused \u201ccaring motivation,\u201d or parental instinct, because he showed gentleness interacting with the infants, she said. Then four other males copied his actions.",
      "The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. So far, only one group of capuchins has been known to kidnap.",
      "The research shows the \u201cremarkable behavioral variation across social groups of the same species,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France, who was not involved in the study.",

      "Health agencies working under Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. clinched the political support needed to become the nation\u2019s top health official by pledging to work within the decades-old federal system for approval and use of vaccines. Yet his regulators are promising big changes that cloud the outlook for what shots might even be available.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration will soon \u201cunleash a massive framework\u201d for how vaccines are tested and approved, according to Commissioner Marty Makary. Details aren't yet public but the plan is being overseen by the agency's new vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, an outspoken critic of the FDA's handling of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "Makary and other Trump administration officials already have taken unprecedented steps that raise uncertainty about next fall's COVID-19 vaccinations, including delaying FDA scientists' full approval of Novavax's shot \u2014 and then restricting its use to people at higher risk from the virus. They've also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products requiring extra testing.",
      "The changes cross multiple health agencies.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn't yet acted on an influential advisory panel's recent recommendations on use of a new meningitis shot or broader RSV vaccination. A meeting of Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d allies was recently told to expect an end to COVID-19 booster recommendations for children \u2014 something that vaccine advisory panel was supposed to debate in June. And researchers around the country lost National Institutes of Health funding to study vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cI think you have to assume that RFK Jr.\u2019s intention is to make it harder for vaccines to come to market,\u201d said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a vaccine expert at Johns Hopkins University. The changes are \u201clooked at suspiciously because this is someone with a proven track record of evading the value of vaccines.\u201d",
      "In a Senate health committee hearing last week, Kennedy wrongly claimed that the only vaccines tested against a placebo, or dummy shot, were for COVID-19.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the committee, briefly interrupted the hearing to say, \u201cFor the record, that\u2019s not true\" \u2014 pointing to placebo-controlled studies of the rotavirus, measles and HPV vaccines.",
      "Concerned by rhetoric about how vaccines are tested, a group of doctors recently compiled a list of more than 120 vaccine clinical trials spanning decades, most of them placebo-controlled, including for shots against polio, hepatitis B, mumps and tetanus.",
      "\u201cIt directly debunks the claim that vaccines were never tested against placebo,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, a Stanford University infectious disease physician who\u2019s helping lead the project.",
      "Antivaccine groups argue that some substances scientists call a placebo may not really qualify, although the list shows simple saline shots are common.",
      "Sometimes a vaccine causes enough shot-site pain or swelling that it\u2019s evident who\u2019s getting the vaccine and who\u2019s in the control group \u2014 and studies might use another option that slightly irritates the skin to keep the test \u201cblinded,\u201d Scott explained.",
      "And when there\u2019s already a proven vaccine for the same disease, it\u2019s unethical to test a new version against a placebo, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t always expect placebo-controlled trials,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that be communicated clearly to the public, but it\u2019s challenging especially when there\u2019s so much noise in social media and so much misinformation.\u201d",
      "The administration's promise of a new vaccine framework comes ahead of a Thursday meeting where FDA advisers will discuss updating COVID-19 shots for this fall and winter.",
      "The FDA\u2019s credibility has long rested on the independence of its scientific decisions. While the agency is led by a handful of political appointees, approval decisions are almost always handled by career scientists.",
      "But that standard appears to be shifting. FDA staffers were poised to approve Novavax\u2019s vaccine early last month but the decision was delayed by administration officials, including Makary, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss agency matters. The shot was approved late Friday with unusual restrictions.",
      "Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg \u2014 a political appointee serving as Makary's special assistant \u2014 was involved in the unprecedented demand that Novavax conduct a new clinical trial of its shot after approval, according to the people. The requirement came shortly after the agency's longtime vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign.",
      "Hoeg \u2014 along with Makary and Prasad \u2014 spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic criticizing the FDA\u2019s handling of booster shots, particularly in children and young adults. All three were co-authors of a 2022 paper stating that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more harm than benefit.",
      "Novavax isn\u2019t the only vaccine manufacturer already affected by changing attitudes at FDA. Earlier this month, Moderna pushed back the target date for its new COVID-and-flu combination vaccine to next year after the FDA requested additional effectiveness data.",
      "As the FDA\u2019s top official overseeing vaccines, Prasad is now in position to reverse what he recently called \u201ca number of missteps\u201d in how the FDA assessed the benefits and risks of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "He questioned how much benefit yearly vaccinations continue to offer. In a podcast shortly before assuming his FDA job, Prasad suggested companies could study about 20,000 older adults in August or September to show if an updated vaccine prevented COVID-related hospitalizations.",
      "There is \u201clegitimate debate about who should be boosted, how frequently they should be boosted and the value of boosting low-risk individuals,\u201d said Hopkins' Adalja. But he stressed that CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has the proper expertise to be making those decisions.",
      "And other experts say simply updating the strain that a COVID-19 vaccine targets doesn't make it a new product \u2014 and real-world data shows each fall's update has offered benefit.",
      "\"The data are clear and compelling\u201d that vaccination reduces seniors' risk of hospitalization and serious illness for four to six months, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher.",
      "Nor could that kind of study be accomplished quickly enough to get millions of people vaccinated before the yearly winter surge, said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief.",
      "\"You'd always be doing clinical trials and you'd never have a vaccine that was up to date,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted",
      "ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted. Voting equipment, it says, should not use ballots that include \u201ca barcode or quick-response code.\u201d",
      "Those few technical words could have a big impact.",
      "Voting machines that give all voters a ballot with one of those codes are used in hundreds of counties across 19 states. Three of them -- Georgia, South Carolina and Delaware -- use the machines statewide.",
      "Some computer scientists, Democrats and left-leaning election activists have raised concerns about their use, but those pushing conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election have been the loudest, claiming without evidence that manipulation has already occurred. Trump, in justifying the move, said in the order that his intention was \u201cto protect election integrity.\u201d",
      "Even some election officials who have vouched for the accuracy of systems that use coded ballots have said it\u2019s time to move on because too many voters don\u2019t trust them.",
      "Colorado\u2019s secretary of state, Democrat Jena Griswold, decided in 2019 to stop using ballots with QR codes, saying at the time that voters \u201cshould have the utmost confidence that their vote will count.\u201d Amanda Gonzalez, the elections clerk in Colorado\u2019s Jefferson County, doesn't support Trump's order but believes Colorado's decision was a worthwhile step.",
      "\u201cWe can just eliminate confusion,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s what I want -- elections that are free, fair, transparent.\u201d",
      "Whether voting by mail or in person, millions of voters across the country mark their selections by using a pen to fill in ovals on paper ballots. Those ballots are then fed through a tabulating machine to tally the votes and can be retrieved later if a recount is needed.",
      "In other places, people voting in person use a touch-screen machine to mark their choices and then get a paper record of their votes that includes a barcode or QR code. A tabulator scans the code to tally the vote.",
      "Election officials who use that equipment say it\u2019s secure and that they routinely perform tests to ensure the results match the votes on the paper records, which they retain. The coded ballots have nevertheless become a target of election conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cI think the problem is super exaggerated,\u201d said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cI understand why it can appeal to certain parts of the public who don\u2019t understand the way this works, but I think it\u2019s being used to try to question certain election results in the past.\u201d",
      "Those pushing conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election have latched onto a long-running legal battle over Georgia's voting system. In that case, a University of Michigan computer scientist testified that an attacker could tamper with the QR codes to change voter selections and install malware on the machines.",
      "The testimony from J. Alex Halderman has been used to amplify Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, even though there is no evidence that any of the weaknesses he found were exploited.",
      "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has defended the state's voting system as secure. In March, the judge who presided over Halderman's testimony declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s voting equipment but said the case had \u201cidentified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s election executive order is being challenged in multiple lawsuits. One has resulted in a preliminary injunction against a provision that sought to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.",
      "The section banning ballots that use QR or barcodes relies on a Trump directive to a federal agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which sets voluntary guidelines for voting systems. Not all states follow them.",
      "Some of the lawsuits say Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to direct the commission because it was established by Congress as an independent agency.",
      "While the courts sort that out, the commission\u2019s guidelines say ballots using barcodes or QR codes should include a printed list of the voters\u2019 selections so they can be checked.",
      "Trump\u2019s order exempts voting equipment used by voters with disabilities, but it promises no federal money to help states and counties shift away from systems using QR or barcodes.",
      "\u201cIn the long run, it would be nice if vendors moved away from encoding, but there\u2019s already evidence of them doing that,\u201d said Pamela Smith, president of the group Verified Voting.",
      "Kim Dennison, election coordinator of Benton County, Arkansas, estimated that updating the county's voting system would cost around $400,000 and take up to a year.",
      "Dennison said she has used equipment that relies on coded ballots since she started her job 15 years ago and has never found an inaccurate result during postelection testing.",
      "\u201cI fully and completely trust the equipment is doing exactly what it\u2019s supposed to be doing and not falsifying reports,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot change a vote once it\u2019s been cast.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s Luzerne County, voting machines that produce a QR code will be used in this year\u2019s primary. But officials expect a manufacturer\u2019s update later this year to remove the code before the November elections.",
      "County Manager Romilda Crocamo said officials had not received any complaints from voters about QR codes but decided to make the change when Dominion Voting Systems offered the update.",
      "The nation\u2019s most populous county, Los Angeles, uses a system with a QR code that it developed over a decade and deployed in 2020 after passing a state testing and certification program.",
      "The county\u2019s chief election official, Dean Logan, said the system exceeded federal guidelines at the time and meets many of the standards outlined in the most recent ones approved in 2021. He said postelection audits have consistently confirmed its accuracy.",
      "Modifying or replacing it would be costly and take years, he said. The county\u2019s current voting equipment is valued at $140 million.",
      "Perhaps nowhere has the issue been more contentious than Georgia, a presidential battleground. It uses the same QR code voting system across the state.",
      "Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a lead plaintiff in the litigation over the system, said her group has not taken a position on Trump's executive order but said the federal Election Assistance Commission should stop certifying machines that use barcodes.",
      "The secretary of state said the voting system follows Georgia law, which requires federal certification at the time the system is bought. Nevertheless, the Republican-controlled legislature has voted to ban the use of QR codes but did not allocate any money to make the change \u2014 a cost estimated at $66 million.",
      "Republicans said they want to replace the system when the current contract expires in 2028, but their law is still scheduled to take effect next year. GOP state Rep. Victor Anderson said there is no realistic way to \u201cprevent the train wreck that\u2019s coming.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Experts say there is low vaccine uptake and people are not accessing treatments.",
      "More than five years after the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in the United States, hundreds of people are still dying every week.",
      "Last month, an average of about 350 people died each week from COVID, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "While high, the number of deaths is decreasing and is lower than the peak of 25,974 deaths recorded the week ending Jan. 9, 2021, as well as weekly deaths seen in previous spring months, CDC data shows.",
      "Public health experts told ABC News that although the U.S. is in a much better place than it was a few years ago, COVID is still a threat to high-risk groups.",
      "\"The fact that we're still seeing deaths just means it's still circulating, and people are still catching it,\" Dr. Tony Moody, a professor in the department of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at Duke University Medical Center, told ABC News.",
      "The experts said there are a few reasons why people might still be dying from the virus, including low vaccination uptake, waning immunity and not enough people accessing treatments.",
      "Low vaccine uptake, waning immunity",
      "During the 2024-25 season, only 23% of adults aged 18 and older received the updated COVID-19 vaccine as of the week ending April 26, according to CDC data.",
      "Among children, just 13% of them received the updated COVID vaccine over the same period, the data shows.",
      "Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist and president and co-director of the Atria Research Institute -- which focuses on disease prevention -- said there are likely not enough people receiving the vaccine, which is contributing to the number of weekly COVID deaths.",
      "However, for those who have received the vaccine, some may not be developing a proper immune response.",
      "\"There are some people who may be genetically inclined to not respond well to the vaccine. That's the topic I have studied with other viral vaccines,\" Poland told ABC News. \"The more common issue is that people are immunocompromised and can't respond well.\"",
      "Additionally, Poland said that immunity from COVID-19 vaccines wanes over time, increasing the likelihood of being infected.",
      "This is why the current recommendation for those aged 65 and older is to receive two doses of the updated COVID vaccine six months apart.",
      "\"Another reason for death due to COVID is being elderly, being what we call immunosenescent, where you do not have the immunologic ability to respond the same way you did in your 30s and 40s,\" Poland said. \"On top of it, if you do get infected by the time you're in your 70s, 80s, there is some \u2026 accumulating co-morbidity.\"",
      "CDC data shows that those aged 75 and older currently have the highest rate of COVID-19 deaths at 4.66 per 100,000.",
      "Not accessing COVID treatments",
      "Currently, there are treatments for COVID-19 patients in the form of antiviral pills, including molnupiravir from Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Paxlovid from Pfizer.",
      "Both treatments must be started within five days of COVID symptoms appearing and are given twice daily for five days, with Merck's being four pills each time and Pfizer's being three pills each.",
      "There is also remdesivir, an intravenous medication that must be started within seven days of COVID symptoms appearing.",
      "\"I do think that we don't necessarily make use of the tools that we have on hand in the best way possible,\" Moody said. \"I've certainly talked to people who have gotten medications when they got COVID and they made a huge difference. \u2026 The trials' data would definitely suggest that the drugs are effective.\"",
      "\"I do think that we may not be using the drugs as effectively, or in as many people as it might help,\" he continued.",
      "Moody said it's possible some COVID patients are coming down with symptoms but are not going to the doctor until their symptoms become severe. Alternatively, some people are not undergoing COVID testing when they have symptoms and, therefore, are missing COVID diagnoses.",
      "\"I'm sure that there are people who are infected who are not being detected [and not being] treated,\" Moody said, but he added that not everyone needs to be tested regularly and that just high-risk people should test more frequently.",

    "story": [
      "The judge cites the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.",
      "Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs may be able to survive a legal challenge, thanks in part to a Japanese zipper company that sued the Nixon administration 50 years ago.",
      "Earlier this week, a federal judge in Florida nominated by Donald Trump suggested the president has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs -- basing his ruling on the precedent from a 1970s court case -- but stopped short of issuing an order affirming the president's right to impose sweeping tariffs.",
      "In a largely technical ruling issued on Tuesday, U.S. Judge T. Kent Wetherell II transferred one of the first lawsuits challenging Trump's tariffs to a different federal court while also weighing in on the legality of the controversial tariffs. Florida-based planner company Emily Ley Paper sued over the tariffs in April, asking Wetherell to invalidate them because Trump lacks the power to impose tariffs himself.",
      "According to the judge, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 gives Trump the authority to set tariffs for reasons other than raising revenue. Wetherell wrote that Trump's justification for the tariffs -- both stemming the flow of illicit drugs into the country and resolving a trade imbalance -- is sufficient to satisfy the terms set by Congress.",
      "\"This is a civil action commenced against the United States and it 'arises out of' a federal law\u2014IEEPA\u2014so the dispositive question framed by the parties' filings is whether IEEPA 'provid[es] for \u2026 tariffs,'\" he wrote. \"Defendants contend that it does; Plaintiffs contend that it doesn't. The Court agrees with Defendants ...\"",
      "The decision is at best a symbolic victory for the Trump administration, which is fending off a half dozen lawsuits challenging the legality of the recent \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
      "Judge Wetherell ultimately decided to transfer the case from a federal court in Florida to the Court of International Trade in New York, meaning that, despite his favorable view of the tariffs, he won't be the one deciding the case.",
      "But the decision marks the first time a federal judge has suggested Trump's imposition of tariffs falls within his authority as president, offering a positive sign that the Trump administration may find a receptive audience at the Court of International Trade. During two hearings over the last week, judges at the Court of International Trade have wrestled with the same question about Trump's authority.",
      "The question comes down to the interpretation of the 1970s law that Trump used to impose his tariffs. The IEEPA gives the president the right to \"regulate\" imports but does not explicitly mention tariffs. Lawyers challenging the tariffs have argued that Trump's interpretation of the law oversteps his authority by treading into an issue controlled by Congress, but the Trump administration has pointed judges to a court decision related to the IEEPA's legal predecessor -- the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 -- to guide the way.",
      "Back when President Richard Nixon confronted the country's 1971 economic crisis with steep tariffs on Japanese goods, a zipper company based in Japan called Yoshida sued Nixon over the tariffs.",
      "The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the predecessor to the Court of International Trade, sided with the government and held that the TWAE gives the president the power to impose tariffs.",
      "According to Wetherell, the same reasoning would apply 50 years later to the IEEPA, meaning Trump has the power to impose tariffs without the help of Congress. \"The reasoning in Yoshida is persuasive, and the Court sees no reason why it would not apply to IEEPA because the operative language of IEEPA is identical to the operative language in TWEA,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Despite losing its legal battle, Yoshida remains in business today. Now operating under the name YKK, it produces more zippers than any other company in the world.",

      "Trump hosted the black-tie event in a personal capacity, the White House said.",
      "Calling them \"pioneers,\" President Donald Trump praised the top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin at an exclusive black-tie dinner Thursday as protesters outside the event chanted and displayed signs blasting the gala as a pay-for-play event.",
      "Two hundred and twenty cryptocurrency traders, including many from overseas, pumped tens of millions of dollars into Trump's meme coin to gain admission to the gala through a contest that awarded invitations to the top investors -- with at least some of the funds flowing directly into the Trump family's coffers.",
      "Among those spotted arriving for the event at Trump's private golf club outside Washington were Lamar Odom of the NBA and \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" fame, controversial cryptocurrency mogul Justin Sun, and Kendall Davis, an Austin-based cryptocurrency investor, who told ABC News that he \"came here to advocate for things to be done right in the crypto space.\"",
      "The top 220 holders of Trump's meme coin -- a type of digital currency that's often based on an internet meme -- collectively spent upwards of $140 million for a seat at the table on Thursday, according to an analysis by the data analytics firm Nansen. According to CNBC's reporting of blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis' data, 58 crypto wallets had made millions from their Trump coin investments as of May 6 -- while roughly 764,000 crypto wallets had lost money.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the gala was not a White House event and that the president was attending in a personal capacity. The White House did not release a list of the event's attendees.",
      "Protesters outside the event -- which included Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. -- chanted slogans and displayed signs reading \"Stop Trump's Crypto Corruption\" and \"America is not for sale\" as attendees made their way into the venue.",
      "Trump, addressing attendees at the dinner, said that he always puts the country \"way ahead of the business\" and added, \"You can't say that about Hunter Biden and Joe Biden,\" according to social media posts.",
      "On the topic of cryptocurrency, Trump attacked the previous administration and touted his own administration's support of crypto.",
      "\"The Biden administration persecuted crypto innovators, and we're bringing them back into the USA where they belong. They were fleeing. They were leaving our country,\" Trump was seen saying in a social media video posted by an attendee.",

      "\"The second day Trump made the announcement about the dinner, I bought a bunch of tokens,\" he said. The attendee said he didn't have anything specific he wanted to hear from Trump, but that he wanted to attend the dinner because \"I just think to have opportunity to come to an event like this is very rare.\"",

      "Attendee Bryce Paul, in a video he posted to social media, likened Trump's meme coin gala to crypto's \"Iwo Jima\" moment -- where attendees would be \"raising the flags, behind the enemy lines, right here in the swamp of D.C.\"",
      "\"I'm just one of 220 people that are invited,\" Paul said. \"There's no media, there's no recording, there are no plus-ones. It's just truly some of the most influential figures in crypto, in policy, and of course, the man himself.\"",

      "Trump criticized the company's choice to build more iPhones in India.",
      "President Donald Trump on Friday threatened 25% tariffs on Apple unless the company shifts iPhonemanufacturing to the United States, saying he disapproves of the company's decision to move part of its supply chain to India.",
      "\"I have long ago informed [CEO] Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone\u2019s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" Trump said in a social media post.",
      "But a U.S.-bound relocation of Apple's supply chain is highly unlikely, industry analysts told ABC News prior to Trump's latest remarks, pointing to the time and expense necessary to overhaul production -- as well as the ongoing cost of higher wages commanded by workers in the U.S.",
      "In theory, the U.S. could host final assembly of Apple products like the iPhone, but even that would take several years and result in higher prices for shoppers, who may then turn to cheaper alternatives, some analysts said.",
      "\"Anything is possible, provided you have a long enough timeframe and don't care about profitability,\" Avi Greengart, lead analyst at research firm Techsponential, told ABC News.",
      "\"It's an incredibly global supply chain. If you want to move it to the U.S., you're talking about many years, possibly decades,\" Greengart added.",
      "Trump last month exempted phones, computers and chips from so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed on China-made goods, which at that time amounted to a 125% levy. The move also excluded such products from a 10% across-the-board tariff imposed on nearly all imports.",
      "The policy change provided major cost savings for Apple, which produces about 90% of its smartphones in China.",
      "\"I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook, recently, and that whole business,\" Trump told reporters at the Oval Office days after the exemption took effect.",
      "Last week, Trump temporarily slashed the reciprocal tariffs on China from 125% to 10% as the U.S. and China hold trade negotiations. China still faces 20% tariffs over its role in the fentanyl trade, bringing total levies on Chinese goods to 30%.",
      "On an earnings call earlier this month, Cook said the company had shifted production of iPhones sold in the U.S. to India as a means of avoiding high tariffs.",
      "\"The majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin,\" Cook said.",
      "However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this month in an interview with Fox News that Trump's vision for ushering in a \"golden age\" for America involved enticing manufacturers to open factories and build in the United States. And, he explained, tariffs play into that strategy.",

      "\"We're going to have huge jobs in manufacturing. You've heard the president talk about trillions and trillions of factories being built in America,\" he said in the interview on May 11. \"Those are construction jobs, starting now, and then those products will not have tariffs on them.\"",
      "Cook noted the company already manufactures some components stateside.",
      "\"During calendar year 2025, we expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year. We also source glass used in iPhone from an American company,\" Cook said. \"All told, we have more than 9,000 suppliers in the US across all 50 states.\"",
      "Still, U.S.-based manufacturing makes up a small share of the company's supply chain \u2013 and any major expansion would take years and carry significant costs, analysts said.",
      "Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush who tracks the tech industry, said last month that it would take three years and cost $30 billion for Apple to shift 10% of its supply chain to the U.S. The price of a U.S.-made iPhone could rise as high as $3,500, Ives said.",
      "\"Price points would move up so dramatically it's hard to comprehend,\" Ives added, describing the notion of a U.S.-made iPhone as a \"nonstarter.\"",
      "The price of an iPhone 16 Pro would jump 25% alone, due to added U.S. labor expenses, Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan told clients last month in a note shared with ABC News. Such a price hike, which excludes for instance the added cost of factory construction, would bring a $999 smartphone to about $1,250.",
      "A small share of consumers would buy a U.S.-made iPhone even after a significant price hike, but the \"vast majority\" would opt for cheaper alternatives, Ben Bajarin, analyst at research firm Creative Strategies, told ABC News.",
      "The upward pressure on prices as a result of high U.S. labor costs would render domestic manufacturing nearly impossible, presenting Apple with a dilemma, Bajarin said.",
      "\"Production will never happen in the U.S. -- unless we have absolute, fully automated assembly, which completely defeats the purpose because humans won't be doing the jobs,\" Bajarin added.",

      "\"A hotbed of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators.\u201d",
      "Columbia University was cited for violating federal civil rights law by allegedly \"acting with deliberate indifference towards student-on-student harassment of Jewish students\u201d since the Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights said.",
      "This is the Trump administration's latest action taken against prominent universities. On Thursday, the Trump administration barred Harvard University from allowing international students to enroll at the university -- a move the university said is not legal -- because they have \"turned their once-great institution into a hotbed of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.",
      "HHS alleged that Columbia violated Title VI, which prohibits those receiving federal financial assistance from discriminating in its programs and activities on the basis of race, color, or national origin -- including discrimination against individuals based on their actual or perceived Israeli or Jewish identity or ancestry.",
      "The notice, both from HHS and the Department of Education, \"articulates extensive factual findings that span a period of over 19 months in which the University continually failed to protect Jewish students,\u201d the government said in its announcement. \u201cThe findings are based on information and documents obtained during the investigation, including witness interviews; examination of written policies and procedures; reliable media reports that contemporaneously capture anti-Semitic incidents and events at Columbia University; and reports from Columbia University\u2019s own Task Force on Antisemitism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe findings carefully document the hostile environment Jewish students at Columbia University have had to endure for over 19 months, disrupting their education, safety, and well-being,\u201d said Anthony Archeval, Acting Director of the Office for Civil Rights at HHS. \u201cWe encourage Columbia University to work with us to come to an agreement that reflects meaningful changes that will truly protect Jewish students.",
      "The government said that Columbia University failed to take several actions, including failing to establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism until the summer of 2024, failure to abide by its own policies and procedures when responding to Jewish students\u2019 complaints as well as governing misconduct against Jewish students and not investigating or punishing vandalism in its classrooms.",
      "\u201cWe understand this finding is part of our ongoing discussions with the government. Columbia is deeply committed to combatting antisemitism and all forms of harassment and discrimination on our campus,\" Columbia University said in a statement of Friday morning. \"We take these issues seriously and will work with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education to address them.\u201d",
      "In March, the university agreed to a list of demands from the Trump administration after it canceled $400 million worth of grants and contracts to the institution due to \"continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students,\" according to a statement from the Trump administration that month.",
      "\"Among them were exerting tighter controls over the university's Middle East Studies department and examining campus activities since the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel.",
      "In a statement from March 19, interim president Katrina Armstrong said: \"Antisemitism, harassment, and discrimination of any kind are unacceptable and imperil both our sense of community as well as our very academic mission.\"",

      "New Jersey is set to hold its gubernatorial elections this year, with hotly contested primaries set for next month -- and many experts are saying the high-stakes race could be a harbinger for the mood of the country ahead of 2026's critical midterm elections.",
      "\"This is going to be the first real test for the potential Democratic backlash against the Trump administration. We've seen a little bit from special elections that Democratic voters are motivated to turn out. Does that continue going forward in the fall in New Jersey?\" Daniel Bowen, a political science professor at The College of New Jersey, told ABC News.",
      "Brigid Callahan Harrison, the chair of the Political Science and Law Department at Montclair State University, told ABC News that the race might not only be a \"bellwether\" for how voters feel about President Donald Trump and the upcoming midterms, but that it could indicate both how partisan allegiances are shifting in New Jersey and the strength of Trump's endorsement of Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli.",
      "Harrison points to Kamala Harris' small margin of victory in New Jersey, too. Harris won New Jersey by around 6 percentage points in 2024; then-Vice President Joe Biden won the state by about 16 percentage points in 2020.",
      "At stake in the race are also issues in New Jersey such as immigration enforcement and sanctuary cities, and the cost of housing and general affordability -- issues that have divided and animated Americans around the country and that are set to take center stage in the midterms as well.",
      "Democrats contend with a crowded field",
      "The Democratic primary features six figures hoping to succeed incumbent and term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and to keep the governorship blue.",
      "Polling shows that U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who represents the state's 11th Congressional District, is leading the pack. Sherrill's experience as a former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot and network of political supporters from a previous run for Congress work in her favor, Harrison said.",
      "Another Democratic candidate, Josh Gottheimer, has represented New Jersey's 5th Congressional District since 2017. The former political operative is widely seen as a moderate. Similar to other candidates, Gottheimer is positioning himself as ready to take on Trump. He has also framed himself as being the best one to tackle affordability in the state.",
      "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was an educator in Newark Public Schools and a member of the city council before being elected mayor for the first time in 2014. He was arrested earlier this month while joining members of Congress at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Newark. Trespassing charges against Baraka have since been dismissed.",
      "Steven Fulop was first elected mayor of Jersey City in 2013. The ex-Goldman Sachs investment banker and former Marine has overseen population growth, increased development and municipal reforms.",
      "Steve Sweeney, a former ironworker who served as New Jersey's state Senate president for more than a decade, spent two decades as a lawmaker in that chamber before losing to a Republican in 2021. He has touted his strong support from unions and experience as a legislator.",
      "Sean Spiller, the president of the New Jersey Education Association -- the state's largest teacher's union -- has pointed to his experience as the former mayor of the city of Montclair as evidence that he is able to take on issues such as affordable housing and investing in childcare.",
      "As the June 10 primary gets closer, experts say they're all facing some of the same headwinds. After New Jersey eliminated its old primary ballot design, which used to allow most county parties to give preferential placement to their endorsed candidates, candidates now must focus more on their own get-out-the-vote operations, Harrison said.",

      "Experts said the presidential results might not necessarily indicate how competitive the gubernatorial race will be. Bowen said that New Jersey's off-cycle gubernatorial elections often show voters largely voting against the incumbent party in power in the White House, although he added that Republicans also see the race as intertwined with Democratic incumbent Murphy finishing up his time in office.",
      "Still, most of the Republican candidates have been eager to align themselves with Trump.",
      "Trump has endorsed the Republican front-runner Ciattarelli in the race that the president wrote is being \"closely watched by the entire World.\"",
      "Ciattarelli has been involved in local politics for decades, serving various roles including councilman and state assemblyman. He has had his sights on governor since 2017, where he ran for the first time but lost the primary. Ciattarelli succeeded in clinching the Republican nomination in 2021, but ultimately lost to Murphy.",
      "Ciattarelli, who says his top priority is making the state more affordable, has shifted his stance on Trump over the years. In 2015, he issued a statement calling Trump \"out of step with American values\" and \"not fit\" to be president. But he now supports the president, and endorsed Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Trump, recently wrote on his social media platform that Ciattarelli, \"after getting to know and understand MAGA, has gone ALL IN, and is now 100% (PLUS!)\"",

He has acknowledged his previous comments about Trump, too, but compared himself to Vice President JD Vance -- who at one point also did not support the president but is now vice president under Trump.",
      "Ashley Koning, the director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, told ABC News that Trump's endorsement could help encourage undecided Republican voters to favor Ciattarelli.

      "Still, some of Bramnick's positions reflect stances similar to Trump's. In addition to branding himself as the \"toughest candidate on immigration,\" Bramnick also seeks to end sanctuary state policies in New Jersey, and introduced the \"New Jersey Laken Riley Act,\" which intends to align the state's law with Trump's legislation.",

      "A new Alabama study of hurricane-affected homes sends a clear message to insurers and homeowners nationwide: climate-resilient construction methods can protect homes, and save a lot of money.",
      "The first-of-its-kind analysis, released this week, reviews thousands of insurance claims linked to Hurricane Sally, which struck Alabama\u2019s coast in 2020 with wind speeds up to 105 miles per hour. Homes retrofitted or built to Fortified standards, a voluntary construction code created by the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Building and Home Safety (IBHS) for wind and rain mitigation saw significantly fewer and less costly claims.",
      "If every impacted house in Mobile and Baldwin counties had met Fortified standards, insurance companies could have spent 75% less in payouts, saving up to $112 million, and policyholders could have paid up to 65% less in deductibles, saving almost $35 million, according to the study.",
      "The results show \"mitigation works and that we can build things that are resilient to climate change,\u201d said Dr. Lars Powell, director of the Center for Risk and Insurance Research at the University of Alabama\u2019s Culverhouse School of Business, which led the study with the Alabama Department of Insurance.",
      "Across the United States, insurance markets are buckling under the pressure of more frequent and expensive climate events, and federal support is shrinking for resilience projects that could reduce that damage. Officials and researchers involved with the study say it proves Alabama's proactive approach to the challenge \u2014 mandatory, sizable insurance discounts for those who use Fortified and a grant program to help them afford it \u2014 could be a national model for increasing insurability and safety.",
      "IBHS created Fortified to strengthen buildings against storm damage based on decades of research at its facility, where it uses a giant wind tunnel to pummel model houses with rain, hail, and wind up to 130 miles per hour.",
      "\u201cWe are having record breaking year after record breaking year of disasters and insured losses, and we have been searching for meaningful ways to reduce the severity and the frequency of those losses,\u201d said Fred Malik, managing director of the Fortified program.",
      "The three levels of designations \u2014 Fortified Roof, Silver and Gold \u2014 employ methods like improving roof fasteners, using impact-rated doors and windows, and more securely anchoring walls to their foundation. The program requires third-party verification of work.",
      "About 80,000 homes across 32 states now have Fortified designations, with over 53,000 in Alabama.",
      "The state began looking for ways to improve storm outcomes after Hurricane Ivan in 2004 jolted the state\u2019s insurance market. \u201cIvan was absolutely devastating,\u201d said Alabama Insurance Commissioner Mark Fowler. \u201cOur market was going crazy, insurers were leaving.\u201d",
      "It became the only state to implement mandatory minimum insurance discounts for Fortified homes, currently as much as half off the wind portion of homeowners\u2019 premiums. It also launched the Strengthen Alabama Homes incentive program, offering grants of up to $10,000 for homeowners retrofitting their houses to Fortified standards.",
      "The state has doled out $86 million for 8,700 Fortified retrofits since 2015. Fowler credits the initiative with also catalyzing demand for new Fortified construction and incentivizing contractors and inspectors to learn the standards.",
      "\u201cIt worked like gangbusters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the market substantially stabilized.\"",
      "Hurricane Sally offered researchers their first chance to assess the program\u2019s benefits in a real storm. \u201cIt really was a prototypical storm that anybody who lives on the hurricane coast is liable to see in any given year,\u201d said Malik.",
      "They collected insurance data on more than 40,000 houses in the affected area \u2014 a total insured value of $17 billion.",
      "Fortified construction reduced claim frequency by 55% to 74%, depending on the designation level, and loss severity by 14% to 40%. Despite representing almost one-quarter of the policies studied, Fortified homes accounted for only 9% of claims.",
      "They even fared better than houses built to similar codes but without the official designation, likely due to the program\u2019s more stringent verification requirements.",
      "\u201cIt really does start to bring home that there is value for everybody involved,\u201d said Malik. \u201cThere\u2019s value for the insurers, there\u2019s value for the homeowner.\u201d",
      "Fortified doesn't address all types of hurricane losses. Nearly half the claims in the study were from fallen trees, which require separate mitigation strategies.",
      "The enhanced standards do add cost: between 0.5% to 3% more for new construction, and 6% to 16% for retrofits. But the longterm benefits have spurred even disaster recovery nonprofits like Habitat for Humanity, Team Rubicon and SBP to use Fortified, often with the philanthropic support of insurers like Travelers and Allstate.",
      "\u201cHelping disaster-impacted homeowners build back smarter with storm-resilient construction and IBHS Fortified standards helps break the cycle of disaster and loss,\u201d said Thomas Corley, chief operating officer at the New Orleans-based nonprofit SBP, which has built 671 homes to Fortified standards in nine states.",
      "The potential insurance discounts also help recovering families by lowering their monthly expenses and boosting confidence that they can keep affording their homes. \u201cFor low-income families, this could mean the difference between upward mobility or years of financial instability after a disaster,\u201d said Corley.",
      "Alabama is expanding its grant program to three new counties this year. Fowler said he hopes the results encourage more insurance companies to offer wind protection on coastal homes, and that adoption will spread to less hurricane-prone areas still susceptible to severe weather.",
      "The approach has caught the attention of other states seeking resilience solutions. Fowler spoke before a California legislative committee last month in support of the California Safe Homes Act, a proposed bill that would fund grants for fire-safe roofing and defensible space to protect from wildfires.",
      "\u201cNatural disasters like windstorms, earthquakes, or wildfires will come no matter what we do,\u201d he told the committee. \u201cThat means you must find ways to build stronger before the event so you will have less damage after the event. It\u2019s actually a pretty simple concept.\u201d",

      "The alternative music community is in mourning after a private jet hit a power line in foggy weather early Thursday and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood",
      "NEW YORK -- The alternative music community is in mourning after a private jet hit a power line in foggy weather early Thursday and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood, killing multiple people on board.",
      "Among them was the groundbreaking music executive Dave Shapiro, a pillar of his music scene, and Daniel Williams, a former drummer for the popular Ohio metalcore band The Devil Wears Prada. Also killed were two employees of Shapiro's Sound Talent Group agency: Kendall Fortner, 24, and Emma Huke, 25.",
      "Both Williams and Shapiro served as success stories for their respective rock music scenes \u2014 proof that these subcultural sounds had real mainstream appeal.",
      "Williams' band, which had two releases reach the Top 10 of the Billboard 200, was a client of Sound Talent Group. He co-founded the company in 2018 with fellow agents Tim Borror and Matt Andersen, who previously worked at the Agency Group and United Talent Agency.",
      "Sound Talent Group\u2019s roster focused on bands in and across pop-punk, metalcore, post-hardcore and other popular hard rock sub-genres \u2014 such as Sum 41, Pierce the Veil, Parkway Drive, Silverstein, I Prevail \u2014 plus pop acts like the '90s brother-boy band, Hanson, best known for their song \u201cMMMBop,\u201d and \u201cA Thousand Miles (Interlude)\u201d singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton.",
      "The post-hardcore band Thursday called Shapiro, 42, an inspiration \u201cwho despite achieving success never forgot the scenes and the communities they came from.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words how much this man meant to so many of us,\u201d Pierce the Veil, which has been performing for nearly two decades including a sold-out concert this week at New York's Madison Square Garden, said in a tribute on the social platform X.",
      "The World Alive, a band signed on Shapiro's label, said he was among \u201cthe most influential and positive forces in our music scene and beyond. And Dan was one of the most influential and positive forces behind the kit.\u201d",
      "Shortly after punk rock entered the cultural zeitgeist in the late \u201970s, it inspired musical sub-movements fueled by its \u201cdo-it-yourself,\u201d community-minded ethics: hardcore punk begat post-hardcore, metalcore, emo and so on. Across decades, these music genres evolved in sound and scope, moving from underground popularity at concerts held in garages and basements to real mainstream fame, while refusing to abandon its independent ethos.",
      "Thomas Gutches, who manages Beartooth and Archetypes Collide, recalled a time when now-popular bands like The Devil Wears Prada were getting their start playing in \u201cDIY shows\u201d in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, in which you could see 10 bands perform for $5.",
      "Shapiro was \u201csingle-handedly developing this next wave of bands that are coming in,\u201d Gutches said. \u201cHe was able to take those bands, package them together and put them on a larger scale. ... He took a risk in being like, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m going to go and take them to that next level.'\u201d",
      "These artists reached a kind of apex in the 2000s and 2010s. Once-obscure bands that had found audiences on early online social media platforms like MySpace, at the mall goth haven Hot Topic, or in the pages left-of-center publications like \u201cAlternative Press\u201d became MTV staples, celebrities in their own right.",
      "Although many of these acts played similar-yet-different music \u2014 think of the blast beats of metalcore and the palm-muted power chords of pop-punk associated with the Vans Warped Tour \u2014 they were brought together by a shared punk rock spirit. And for the last few decades, these tight-knit groups have proven to be the dominant force in alternative rock, according to Mike Shea, founder of \u201cAlternative Press,\u201d who used the word \u201ccommunity\u201d to describe the scene.",
      "Shea said Shapiro was \u201cvital\u201d in bringing these punk rock subcultures to the masses.",
      "\u201cIn this music industry, there are just too many people ripping people off and using people,\u201d he said. \u201cDave was not like that. He was a beautiful soul, and beautiful person, a guiding force, just someone who would end up being an inspiration for so many people. And he will continue to be an inspiration.\u201d",
      "And it was not only musicians but also many booking agents, band, and tour managers and promoters that got their big breaks because of Shapiro, Gutches said.",
      "The bands Shapiro represented are many of the most popular of their genre and scene, like the Grammy-nominated Sum 41 or the platinum-selling Pierce the Veil.",
      "That also includes The Devil Wears Prada, one of the best-known metalcore bands of the last few decades, celebrated for their ability to marry melodic punk rock with metallic detouring. When Williams \u201cwas in the band, that's when they broke out,\u201d Shea said.",
      "Gutches said Williams captivated audiences at shows with his drumming as much as a band's front man does: \u201cDaniel was putting on a show from his style of playing.\u201d",
      "The tributes will continue for both, Shea said, as more and more artists reveal the impact Williams and Shapiro had on their lives.",
      "Case in point: \u201cThere is no single person more responsible for my identity as a professional adult than Dave Shapiro,\u201d metalcore band Issues bassist Skyler Acord said via Instagram.",
      "His band coined a phrase they would use when things got heated \"to remind us to chill out and try to understand each other,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cWe'd say, \u2018Do it for Dave.\u2019\u201d",

      "Murakami, known for his smiling rainbow-colored flower icon, intentionally layered light-hearted themes with historical events linked to trauma, he told The Associated Press.",
      "The art explores the impact of trauma on people and culture, said Ed Schad, curator and publications manager at contemporary art museum The Broad in Los Angeles.",

One flower is wiping a tear from its eye, while another appears to be a zombie. One has blood dripping from its mouth. One appears to be in awe watching fireworks.",
      "Though there are no obviously direct visual references to historical events, the museum said the art can be seen through the lens of three events in Japanese history: the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States during World War II, the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, leading to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, and the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "Former Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo says he wishes he had moved faster to change the culture of his department before the murder of George Floyd, which happened five years ago Sunday",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Former Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo vividly remembers receiving a call around midnight from a community activist. The caller told him to watch a video spreading on social media of a white officer pinning a Black man to the ground, despite his fading pleas of \u201cI can't breathe.\u201d",
      "The dying man was George Floyd. The officer was Derek Chauvin. And Arradondo was the city's first Black police chief.",
      "\u201cIt was absolutely gut-wrenching,\u201d Arradondo, 58, recalled in an interview ahead of the fifth anniversary of Floyd's murder.",
      "What he saw conflicted with what his own people had told him about the deadly encounter, and he knew immediately it would mean changes for his department and city. But he acknowledged he didn't immediately foresee how deeply Floyd's death would reverberate in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "\u201cI served for 32 years,\" he said. \"But there's no doubt May 25th, 2020, is a defining moment for me in my public service career.\u201d",
      "The video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, pinning him to the pavement outside a convenience store where Floyd had tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Chauvin maintained the pressure for 9 1/2 minutes despite pleas from onlookers to stop, even after an off-duty firefighter tried to intervene and another officer said he couldn't find a pulse.",
      "Arradondo sat for the interview in a public library that was heavily damaged in the unrest that followed Floyd's death. It's on Lake Street, a major artery that saw some of the worst destruction, a street that he says still bears \u201cremnants of the pain and anger of what occurred five years ago.\u201d",
      "Just down the block, there's the empty shell of a police station that was torched during the riots. And within sight is a Target store and a Cub Foods supermarket that were looted. Storefronts remain boarded up. While some businesses were rebuilt, empty lots sit where others did not.",
      "Arradondo still stands by his and Mayor Jacob Frey's decision to abandon the Third Precinct and let it burn. Protesters breached the building, and police \u2014 who were spread thin \u2014 didn't have the resources to hold it. So he ordered his officers to evacuate.",
      "\u201cDuring the most significant crisis we\u2019ve ever experienced, arguably in the state, when it\u2019s life or death, I\u2019ve got to go on the side of keeping people alive and safe,\u201d he said.",
      "Arradondo subsequently helped launch an overhaul of policing in the city despite a resistant police culture and a powerful officers union. He testified against Chauvin in his 2021 murder trial, a rare breach of the \u201cblue wall\u201d that traditionally protects officers from being held accountable for wrongdoing.",
      "Five years on, Arradondo, who retired in 2022, said he believes law enforcement agencies nationwide have made progress on police accountability \u2014 albeit incremental progress \u2014 and that police chiefs and sheriffs now move faster to hold officers responsible for egregious misconduct.",
      "Arradondo was promoted to chief in 2017, and his elevation was greeted with hope among local African Americans who affectionately called him \u201cRondo.\u201d But his department had a reputation for being too quick to use force and many were angry about police killing young Black men in Minnesota and beyond.",
      "Arradondo said he wishes he had made more changes to the police department before Floyd was killed.",
      "\u201cI would have pushed harder and sooner at trying to dismantle some of the toxic culture that allowed that indifference to exist that evening, on May 25th, 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly would have invested more time elevating the voices in our community that had been pleading with police departments for decades to listen to us and change.\u201d",
      "Arradondo just published a book, \u201cChief Rondo: Securing Justice for the Murder of George Floyd,\u201d that explores leadership, justice and race, the broader impacts of policing, and the challenges of working within a flawed system. He closes it with a letter dedicated to Floyd's daughter, Gianna.",
      "\u201cI never had an opportunity to meet Gianna, but I wanted her to know that, even though I was not out there that evening, at that intersection when her father was pleading for help, that I heard him, and I was going to do everything I could to bring him justice,\u201d he said.",
      "He wanted to say the words that she has not heard from the four former officers who were convicted for their roles in George Floyd's death:",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry for your father being taken from you.\u201d",

      "The chain of islands celebrated by singer Jimmy Buffett in his odes to tropical escapism is surrounded by water, jutting out 120 miles southwesterly from Florida's mainland to Key West with the Gulf and Atlantic Ocean on either side.",
      "The archipelago historically has been known for its quirky and libertarian inhabitants who revel in the islands' hedonistic, artistic and outdoorsy lifestyle. In recent years, it also has become a haven for the wealthy.",
      "Overseeing safety for the more than 80,000 inhabitants of the Conch Republic \u2014 the nickname for the islands after denizens declared a tongue-in-cheek secession from the United States in the early 1980s \u2014 is Shannon Weiner, director of emergency management for Monroe County, Florida.",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1, and the county has some new weapons this season, including a brand-new emergency operations center and a new seawater desalination water treatment plant. The county also relies on surveillance flights from hurricane-hunting aircraft from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for information about how to prepare.",
      "But, the potential for a catastrophic storm like Hurricane Irma in 2017 is always at the back of residents' minds. The Category 4 storm made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds up to 132 mph (209.2 kph), destroying around 1,180 homes and seriously damaging another 3,000.",
      "Weiner recently talked to the Associated Press about the upcoming hurricane season. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "___",
      "Weiner: Our entire island chain is surrounded by water. We have more water than we do land mass. Being uniquely situated between the two large bodies of water makes us very vulnerable. We see storms early, sometimes in their formation \u2014 storms that come across the Atlantic and then storms that develop in the south, in the Caribbean Sea. We tend to be in their path, and so we get a lot of storm practice here in Monroe County.",
      "Weiner: The weather service is a good partner, and the field offices, from what they were telling us and what they\u2019re hearing here, everyone is secure. They are not expecting or anticipating any cuts to the (Florida Keys) field offices. So, of course, going into hurricane season, we're really happy to hear that.",
      "Weiner: The Keys had not had a storm of that magnitude or size since the early 20th century. People tend to get complacent. It\u2019s human nature, right? They\u2019re not as worried. They\u2019re not as prepared. We were very fortunate with Irma in that we had plenty of days\u2019 notice to evacuate. But when we came home and saw the devastation, it was an eye-opener. Being an island chain, we had unique challenges bringing logistics in to help us recover.",
      "Weiner: Usually, they tend to heed that advice. We are constantly reminding people to be prepared and how important it is in our county to evacuate because the Florida Keys, the entirety of the island chain, is a storm surge zone. People here tend to be pretty savvy when it comes to storms, and throughout the entire Keys, the bigger concern is storm surge rather than wind. We say, \u201cHide from the wind and run from the water.\u201d",
      "Weiner: The city of Key West is an incredibly resilient community. There\u2019s a lot of history there. But there is also a lot of older architecture there. There\u2019s a lot of wooden homes, and for them to receive a storm, a direct impact of a major magnitude, that would be devastating for them. That is what keeps me up at night \u2013 a Category 4 or 5 storm hitting Key West.",
      "Weiner: Because it\u2019s beautiful here. It really is an island paradise. Being surrounded by a national marine sanctuary is amazing. I think everyone that lives here, we all live here for that reason. Because we appreciate the environment and the marine life and love the water. And so it\u2019s worth it. You make sure that you\u2019re prepared, and you have a plan if you need to go. And you go somewhere safe, and you come back, and you just put it back together.",

      "WASHINGTON -- It was just past 3 a.m., a few hours before the House vote on President Donald Trump's top priority in Congress, his \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson was rushing through the Capitol halls with his security guards and aides in tow. For a moment, he paused.",
      "Would you like to see the prayer room? he asked an Associated Press reporter.",
      "The question was in response to another question about his leadership style: whether his religion, his Christian faith, had been guiding him through the tumultuous process.",
      "\u201cThis is like a cathedral at night,\u201d he said, walking toward an almost-hidden door. \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful thing in the Capitol.\u201d",
      "He punched in the key code and stepped inside.",
      "The room, transformed in the 1950s, sits just off the suite of second-floor offices of the House speaker, centered in the Capitol, on its west end closest to the National Mall.",
      "\u201cBeen here a lot this week, right there on my knees,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cJust praying. ... That\u2019s what the founders did.\u201d",
      "As Wednesday night had melted into Thursday morning, none other than George Washington, the first president himself, watched over the room, his tall figure bent on one knee in the stained-glass image high above a small altar.",
      "\u201cIn times of great challenge, they got on their knees and they sought divine guidance, and that\u2019s what we do,\u201d Johnson was saying. \u201cBecause I\u2019m convinced that God\u2019s given us a chance to save this great republic.\u201d",
      "Johnson is a conservative Christian and among the more outwardly religious of House speakers. He was an accidental choice to lead Republicans, selected after his GOP colleagues ousted their previous speaker almost two years ago. When Johnson emerged as the pick, Republicans gathered around him and prayed. He considers himself a \u201cservant\u201d leader.",
      "Determined to push Trump\u2019s bill to House passage, the speaker set his intention. He created a self-imposed deadline, Memorial Day, that seemed overly optimistic. And he just kept moving forward, despite robust opposition from Democrats and skeptics within his own GOP ranks.",
      "As the deadline neared, he did not let up. He prayed.",
      "\u201cI feel like I have sort of a vision of where we\u2019re supposed to go, and you just set the course and you just patiently get everybody there,\u201d he explained.",
      "The speaker is sometimes in a question-answering mood. A conversation unfolded.",
      "Aren\u2019t you afraid of flopping? he was asked.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really have fear,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I know that we have to accomplish this mission in order to save the country.\u201d",
      "The speaker was explaining how this is \u201cthe greatest nation\" and his own belief in its \"foundational principles.\u201d",
      "\"And what I think we're trying to do here is restore them,\u201d he said. \u201cPiece by piece, that\u2019s what we do here every day.\u201d",
      "But your legislation is being criticized, hammered for doing so many things. People will lose access to Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "The Congressional Budget office estimates that under proposals in the bill, some 8.6 million people will no longer have health care, and 3 million a month will stop receiving the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re counting the people the work requirements are going to apply to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would be, would be choosing, you know, not to work.\u201d",
      "But some of the people \u2014 particularly older, single men \u2014 may not be able to find work or go back to work.",
      "The new 80-hours-a-month work requirements or community service would be for able-bodied adults without dependents through age 64, with various exceptions. Some parents of children older than 7 would also need to fulfill the work requirement to receive SNAP food stamp assistance.",
      "\u201cWe have finite resources,\" he said. \"So the vulnerable populations are who we\u2019re trying to take care of.\u201d",
      "Do you worry that\u2019s counter to your own beliefs?",
      "\u201cWe are helping people,\u201d he said. For an able-bodied man to work, \"it's good for his own personal dignity. It's good for his purpose. It's a win-win-win.\"",
      "The debates in Congress come during a time of great soul-searching in the United States and the world. People are divided as ever, politically and economically, yet also yearning for a sense of community and togetherness that seems to be slipping further out of reach.",
      "House Democrats, who have fought Johnson and his party every step of the way in opposing what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill,\u201d were not about to cede any moral ground to Republicans or to Trump.",
      "\u201cThis is the United States of America \u2014 the wealthiest country in the history of the world. It is indecent to rip food out of the mouths of children and everyday Americans,\u201d House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during his own lengthy floor speech ahead of the vote.",
      "Before invoking the Gospel of Matthew 25:35-40, Jeffries said Congress could do better than this \u201cunconscionable\u201d and \u201cun-American\u201d bill.",
      "\u201cI do believe that there are people of faith on both sides of this chamber,\u201d said Jeffries, of New York.",
      "\u201cJesus talks about the importance of standing up for the least, the lost, the left behind, the poor, the sick, the afflicted, the homeless, the people who are confined, strangers in a foreign land,\" he said. \u201cIt cannot be the case that one goes to synagogue or goes to the mosque \u2014 or one goes to church, as I do \u2014 but one goes to church to pray on Sunday and then comes to Washington, D.C., to prey on the American people the rest of the week.\"",
      "All of that would come hours later, spoken as the bill was on its unstoppable path toward passage. For now, at this late moment, Johnson's reflections were drawing to an end. He was shutting the prayer room door behind him.",
      "So how did you do it? How did you get your Republicans to fall in line?",
      "\u201cJust a lot of patience,\" Johnson said.",
      "What about your meetings with Trump at the White House?",
      "That would be for another day, he indicated. With the room closed, the speaker of the House had shared the keycode so others could seek out prayer in the Capitol if needed. He headed around the corner, through the side halls of the Capitol, back to his office.",

      "A federal judge has denied the Trump administration\u2019s request that she stay her May 19 ruling that returned control of the U.S. Institute of Peace back to its acting president and board",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday denied the Trump administration\u2019s request that she stay her May 19 ruling that returned control of the U.S. Institute of Peace back to its acting president and board.",
      "In a seven-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell said the government did not meet any of the four requirements for a stay, including a \u201cstrong showing\u201d of whether its request could succeed on the merits.",
      "Howell reiterated her finding that the Institute is not part of the executive branch and is therefore beyond President Donald Trump\u2019s authority to fire its board. She added that the firings also did not follow the law for how a board member of the Institute might be removed by the president.",
      "Most of the board was fired in March during a takeover of the Institute by the Department of Government Efficiency. That action touched off the firing of its acting president, former ambassador George Moose, and subsequently most of the staff. The organization's headquarters, funded in part by donors, was turned over to the General Services Administration.",
      "In her ruling May 19, Howell concluded that the board was fired illegally and all actions that followed that were therefore \u201cnull and void.\u201d",
      "In Friday's ruling Howell also rejected the government\u2019s argument that the organization had to fall into one of the three branches of government and since it does not legislate, nor is it part of the judicial branch, it must be part of the executive branch. \u201cAs the Court has previously pointed out, other entities also fall outside of this tripartite structure,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Howell also said that the government did not \u201cdescribe any cognizable harm they will experience without a stay, let alone an irreparable one.\u201d However, \u201cas plaintiffs explain, every day that goes by without the relief this Court ordered, the job of putting (USIP) back together by rehiring employees and stemming the dissipation of USIP\u2019s goodwill and reputation for independence will become that much harder.\u201d",
      "Moose reentered the headquarters Wednesday without incident along with the organization's outside counsel, George Foote.",
      "The White House was not immediately available for comment. In requesting the stay the government also requested a two-business-day stay to allow for an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Howell denied that request.",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered further restrictions on how the press operates at the Pentagon",
      "Bedeviled by leaks to the media during his short tenure, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a series of restrictions on the press late Friday that include banning reporters from entering wide swaths of the Pentagon without a government escort \u2014 areas where the press has had access in past administrations as it covers the activities of the world's most powerful military.",
      "Newly restricted areas include his office and those of his top aides and all of the different locations across the mammoth building where the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Space Force maintain press offices.",
      "The media will also be barred from offices of the Pentagon's senior military leadership, including Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, without Hegseth's approval and an escort from his aides. The staff of the Joint Chiefs has traditionally maintained a good relationship with the press.",
      "Hegseth, the former Fox News Channel personality, issued his order via a posting on X late on a Friday afternoon before a holiday weekend. He said it was necessary for national security.",
      "\u201cWhile the department remains committed to transparency, the department is equally obligated to protect (classified intelligence information) and sensitive information, the unauthorized disclosure of which could put the lives of U.S. service members in danger,\u201d wrote Hegseth.",
      "The Pentagon Press Association expressed skepticism that operational concerns were at play \u2014 and linked the move to previous actions by Hegseth\u2019s office that impede journalists and their coverage.",
      "\u201cThere is no way to sugarcoat it. Today\u2019s memo by Secretary Hegseth appears to be a direct attack on the freedom of the press and America\u2019s right to know what its military is doing,\u201d it said in a statement Friday night. \u201cThe Pentagon Press Association is extremely concerned by the decision to restrict movement of accredited journalists within the Pentagon through non-secured, unclassified hallways.\u201d",
      "Hegseth also said reporters will be required to sign a form to protect sensitive information and would be issued a new badge that more clearly identifies them as press. It was not clear whether signing the form would be a condition of continued access to the building.",
      "Two months ago, the department was embarrassed by a leak to The New York Times that billionaire Elon Musk was to get a briefing on the U.S. military's plans in case a war broke out with China. That briefing never took place, on President Donald Trump's orders, and Hegseth suspended two Pentagon officials as part of an investigation into how that news got out.",
      "The Pentagon was also embarrassed when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently included in a group chat on the Signal messaging app where Hegseth discussed plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen. Trump's former national security adviser, Mike Waltz, took responsibility for Goldberg being included and was shifted to another job.",
      "The administration has taken several aggressive actions toward the press since Trump took over, including FCC investigations into ABC, CBS and NBC News. Restrictions imposed on The Associated Press' access to certain White House events earlier this year led to a court battle that is ongoing.",
      "The White House has also increased access for conservative media that are friendly to the president. Nevertheless, a study released earlier this month found that Trump had more frequent exchanges with reporters during his first 100 days in office than any of his six predecessors.",
      "Hegseth, however, has been far less available. He has yet to speak to the press in the Pentagon briefing room. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell has held only one Pentagon press briefing since Jan. 20. The Pentagon has taken other steps to make it more difficult for reporters, including taking office space away from eight media outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and NBC.",

      "On the same day of last month's proclamation allowing commercial fishing in the monument, Trump issued an order to boost the U.S. commercial fishing industry by peeling back regulations and opening up harvesting in previously protected areas.",
      "The monument was created by President George W. Bush in 2009 and consists of about 500,000 square miles (1.3 million square kilometers) in the central Pacific Ocean. President Barack Obama expanded the monument in 2014.",
      "A week after the April 17 proclamation, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service sent a letter to fishing permit holders giving them a green light to fish commercially within the monument's boundaries, even though a long-standing fishing ban remains on the books, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Honolulu.",
      "The first longline fisher started fishing in the monument just three days after that letter, according to Earthjustice, which has been tracking vessel activity within the monument using Global Fishing Watch.",
      "The Department of Justice declined to comment Friday.",
      "The lawsuit noted that commercial longline fishing, an industrial method involving baited hooks from lines 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) or longer, will snag turtles, marine mammals or seabirds that are attracted to the bait or swim through the curtain of hooks.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by as the Trump administration unleashes highly destructive commercial fishing on some of the planet\u2019s most pristine, biodiverse marine environments,\u201d David Henkin, an Earthjustice attorney, said in a statement. \u201cPiling lawlessness on top of lawlessness, the National Marine Fisheries Service chose to carry out President Trump\u2019s illegal proclamation by issuing its own illegal directive, with no public input.\u201d",
      "Designating the area in the Pacific Ocean to the south and west of the Hawaiian islands as a monument provided \u201cneeded protection to a wide variety of scientific and historical treasures in one of the most spectacular and unique ocean ecosystems on earth,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The lawsuit added that allowing commercial fishing in the monument expansion harms the \u201ccultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, educational, recreational, and aesthetic interests\u201d of a group of Native Hawaiian plaintiffs who are connected genealogically to the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific.",

      "YEAR/ALBUM: 1992, \u201cHuman Touch\u201d",
      "BACKSTORY: An expression of sardonic rage at the emptiness and hopelessness that the unremitting feed of cable TV had brought to the world. This is less political and more social, though it reflected some of the disillusionment of the age about the brain rot of popular culture. It came months before Michael Douglas\u2019 anger-management-failure movie \u201cFalling Down\u201d depicted an enraged man losing it and tearing a swath through Los Angeles because of the stresses of modern culture.",

      "YEAR/ALBUM: 2007, \u201cMagic\u201d",
      "BACKSTORY: A twist on the old-fashioned warning song, written from the vantage point of the future. (\"We're livin' in the future, and none of this has happened yet.\") This was a commentary on a post-9/11 America that \u2014 as the song suggests \u2014 is headed in a bad direction. Oblique but devastating, particularly with such somber words against an upbeat melody reminiscent of his early work, it suggested there was still time to correct course. Which touches on a frequent Springsteen theme: possibility amid the hardship and challenge.",

When suspicion later turned toward Worrell's husband, he fled the U.S. to live in Costa Rica with the couple's live-in nanny.",

      "The recent jailbreak in New Orleans followed decades of dysfunction in the city's jail system and recent warnings that conditions were ripe for catastrophe",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- In the city that care forgot, the party had made its way into the prison.",
      "More than a decade before the recent New Orleans jailbreak, the city's lawless lockup went viral in a series of videos showing inmates chugging Budweiser, snorting drugs, gambling with handfuls of cash and ejecting bullets from a handgun.",
      "\u201cYou can get what you want in here,\u201d an inmate boasted without a supervisor in sight. \u201cMedication. Pills. Drugs. Heroin.\u201d",
      "The jaw-dropping footage fueled a sweeping 2013 court order intended to reform one of the most violent jails in the country \u2014 a decaying emblem of the crime and corruption that have long plagued New Orleans.",
      "A dozen years and tens of millions of dollars later, much of that makeover remains an aspiration despite oversight from a federal judge and the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "The city\u2019s correctional chaos reached a new nadir last week when a lone civilian guard monitoring the facility stepped away to get food, allowing 10 inmates to yank open a faulty cell door, remove a toilet and escape through a hole in the wall where steel bars had been cut away. No one noticed the men scaling a fence and sprinting across an interstate around 1 a.m. Hours passed before the public or even law enforcement was notified.",
      "Five of the fugitives remained on the loose Friday as some 200 federal, state and local officers searched for them.",
      "The dysfunction dates back generations and continued even after the 2015 opening of the state-of-the-art Orleans Justice Center, billed as a $150 million panacea when it replaced its seemingly-cursed predecessor. There were major issues with the building from the outset, including a lack of supervision and adequate housing for mentally ill inmates.",
      "\u201cNow we\u2019ve got a jail with 900 cameras, but that\u2019s cold comfort if no one is watching them,\u201d said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission, a New Orleans-based watchdog group.",
      "\u201cThe inmates-gone-wild videos from years back don\u2019t even approach this,\" Goyeneche added. \u201cIf the sheriff or anyone was thinking about terminating the jail consent decree, this escape has ended any serious discussion about that.\"",
      "Conditions for catastrophe had been ripe for months. An independent jail monitor warned of \u201cextremely inadequate\u201d staffing levels and dangerously lax supervision \u2014 both factors in a jailbreak that exposed figurative and literal holes in security. At the same time, court records show the number of \u201cinternal escapes\" within the jail has skyrocketed over the past two years, underscoring jailers' inability to govern the nearly 1,400-inmate population.",
      "\u201cToo often the failure to follow policy is blamed on the lack of staff or training,\u201d the monitors wrote in a report. \u201cNeither is an acceptable excuse.\u201d",
      "Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson initially deflected blame for the jailbreak, implying without evidence that it was politically motivated as she runs for reelection. Appearing before the City Council several days later, she accepted \u201cfull accountability\u201d for the \u201cfailures.\u201d",
      "She told the City Council she needs millions of dollars to fix \u201coutdated surveillance, aging infrastructure, blind spots in supervision and critical staffing shortages.\u201d The council pushed back, saying the jail had received substantial injections of taxpayer dollars without sufficient oversight.",
      "Perhaps most startlingly, Hutson warned she \u201ccannot guarantee\u201d inmates would not be left unattended in the future.",
      "\u201cThe jail is the same today as it was a week ago, the same as when we submitted our 2024 budget request, and the same as it has been for years,\u201d Hutson said in a statement.",
      "The escape has drawn new attention to deplorable jail conditions that have persisted for decades in New Orleans, a history of neglect that stands out even in a state long associated with overincarceration. The situation became so dire in 2016 that Hutson's predecessor, Marlin Gusman, was stripped of control of the jail as part of a deal to avert federal receivership.",
      "\u201cI think it's gotten worse,\u201d said Ricky Peterson, who recalled inmates roaming the facility \u201cat their own leisure\u201d when he was jailed about a decade ago.",
      "\u201cAs time progressed, it started going down and down and down,\u201d added Mario Westbrook, 48, who was jailed around the same time on gun possession and marijuana charges. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to go through those type of conditions.\u201d",
      "In 1970, a federal judge declared the overcrowded Orleans Parish Prison to be unconstitutional, saying conditions amounted to cruel and unusual punishment and \u201cshock the conscience as a matter of elemental decency.\u201d A later lawsuit alleged that female inmates were shackled during childbirth. Suicides and in-custody deaths abounded, including the fatal beating of a man by two deputies in 2004.",
      "Then as now, the sheriff accused the city of chronically underfunding the jail, while city officials countered the lockup was most afflicted by incompetent management.",
      "Hurricane Katrina in 2005 wrought unspeakable havoc at the jail, as inmates found themselves stranded in chest-high water and the lockup lost power.",
      "A 2009 Justice Department report warned of \u201ccalculated abuse\u201d by deputies who would beat inmates so frequently they developed a code of ordering an inmate to \u201ctie his shoes\u201d when they wanted to brawl.",
      "A major landmark came in 2013 when a class-action lawsuit resulted in the consent decree, a detailed plan for overhauling jail policies, reducing violence and improving inmate medical treatment.",
      "That litigation unearthed the viral jailhouse videos, which also included a 2009 clip of an apparently escaped inmate cavorting on the city's famed Bourbon Street for what the Justice Department described as \u201can evening of leisure.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe conduct in the video may have occurred several years ago,\u201d the Justice Department said at the time, \u201cbut the policies, practices and culture that enabled the outrageous conduct remain relevant.\u201d",

      "Shapiro, who is Jewish, is viewed as a potential White House contender for the Democratic Party in 2028.",

      "Balmer has not entered a plea.",
      "Balmer has been held without bail since turning himself in to state police after the April 13 fire. Klatt has said he would be evaluated to see if he is competent to stand trial.",
      "Balmer\u2019s mother and brother say he suffers from mental illness, something that Balmer denied in one brief court appearance. Authorities say Balmer expressed hatred for Shapiro.",

    "summary": "John Mauceri had a complicated health history, but his sudden swelling and fatigue left his team of doctors stumped.",
    "story": [
      "Conductor John Mauceri is no stranger to health struggles. He was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2017, then chronic lymphocytic leukemia and interstitial lung disease in 2019. Medication treated the conditions and sent the cancer into remission, but he has remained on the lookout for recurrence.",
      "In December 2023, Mauceri, then 78, contracted COVID-19. He struggled to climb the stairs and developed a \"troublesome\" cough. He went to the emergency room at NYU Langone, where he has previously received medical care. An X-ray found viral pneumonia and severe lung disease. Doctors removed three liters of liquid from his right lung. The only relief, he said, was that there was no trace of cancer. He left the hospital about a week later.",
      "Within weeks, new symptoms quickly emerged. First, his left ankle swelled. Then the swelling continued up his leg. As the weeks passed, the swelling entered his abdomen and inched down his right leg. At one point, Mauceri was gaining a pound every day. He was also dealing with fatigue and shortness of breath. He couldn't conduct.",
      "\"I was wearing somebody else's body, at least from my waist down. I couldn't wear normal clothes,\" Mauceri said. \"Putting shoes on was hard. I couldn't walk through my house.\"",
      "No one on his care team could identify what was causing the symptoms.",
      "\"I had an oncologist, I had a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist. I had a lot of doctors, and they all thought it was somebody else's domain,\" Mauceri said.",
      "Searching for a diagnosis",
      "Dr. Adam Skolnick, a cardiologist at NYU Langone and one of Mauceri's doctors, said the team first looked for more common causes for the swelling. Mauceri underwent MRIs and other tests. An exam found his lymph system was working normally. Cardiac catheterization, where a thin tube is guided through the heart, found no signs of heart disease. There were no signs of blood clots, cancer recurrence or other likely conditions.",
      "Meanwhile, the swelling was beginning to strain Mauceri's body, putting him at risk of multi-organ failure.",
      "While studying the images of Mauceri's heart, Skolnick began to form a theory. But \"the only definitive way to fully diagnose and treat Mr. Mauceri would be through surgery to open the chest,\" the doctor said.",
      "What is pericardial constriction?",
      "Skolnick thought Mauceri might have pericardial constriction, which occurs when the sac around the heart, or the pericardium, is thickened by scarring. That prevents the heart from fully opening. It can create pressure, resulting in swelling in the legs and abdomen.",
      "It's a rare condition that is usually acquired because of a prior illness, Skolnick said, including viral infections like COVID-19.",
      "Since there are no tests that look at the pericardium specifically, Mauceri would have to undergo open-heart surgery to confirm the diagnosis. The condition would also be treated in that same surgery. After Mauceri's care team eliminated all other possible options, they decided it was time to go into the operating room in June 2024.",
      "Mauceri was nervous about the prospect but it seemed like his only option.",
      "\"There was no alternative,\" he said. \"I said, 'Well, let's just do it.'\"",
      "A high-risk surgery",
      "Dr. Eugene Grossi, a cardiothoracic surgeon and leader of NYU Langone Heart's robotic surgery team, performed Mauceri's surgery. When he opened the conductor's chest, he found that Mauceri's \"heart was trapped\" inside a thick shell of scarring. Typically, the pericardium is like a paper bag. Mauceri's was like shoe leather, Grossi said.",
      "\"You don't think about it, but your lungs expand with every breath you take. Your chest wall opens. Your lungs expand. The heart does also, because it has to be able to accept the blood that's coming back from your arteries and veins. And his was just trapped,\" Grossi explained. That entrapment leads to fluid retention, creating swelling, Grossi said.",
      "Under the scarring, Mauceri's heart was functioning well. With the diagnosis made, Grossi and the surgical team had to scrape the pericardium and attached scar tissue carefully off the heart. Removing the pericardium creates no lasting health issues, but the procedure, called a pericardiectomy, is a delicate one.",
      "\"It's almost like the heart is a hard-boiled egg, and we're peeling off the shell,\" Grossi said.",
      "Mauceri's procedure went smoothly, his doctor said. Once the pericardium was removed, Mauceri's urine output bag began to fill, proving to the surgeons that the pressure was off and blood was pumping smoothly.",
      "\"Every day is a miracle\"",
      "After Mauceri was released from the hospital, he quickly began losing weight. He said he feels like he's in the best shape he's been since college.",
      "\"This is extraordinary because not only did I survive it, but I'm stronger than ever as a result of it,\" Mauceri said.",
      "His health struggles didn't end immediately. Shortly after the heart surgery, he was hospitalized again for a blockage of the small intestine. That was quickly treated, again at NYU Langone, but it slowed his recovery. It wasn't until December 2024, more than a year after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, that Mauceri was able to conduct an orchestra again.",
      "Mauceri conducted back-to-back performances in London and Paris, getting used to being onstage again. In May, he traveled to Japan to conduct in Tokyo. The 13-hour flight and long performance days felt like the first test of his endurance after his illnesses, he said. The performance was a raging success.",
      "Mauceri said he has no plans to slow down now that he's back to work. In between spending time with his family in New York City, he plans to travel the country for other concerts, including at the Hollywood Bowl in September, shortly after his 80th birthday.",
      "\"I was conducting as if I wasn't on the cusp of being 80 anymore,\" he said. \"I was allowed to do that because my doctors gave me this added time in my life where I can do that. So every day is a miracle. Every day I'm grateful for what they did.\"",

      "Legendary musicians Stevie Nicks, Rod Stewart and Sting were expected to join Joel at different points on the tour.",
      "What is normal pressure hydrocephalus?",
      "Normal pressure hydrocephalus, or NPH, is a brain condition that occurs when fluid builds up inside or around the brain, disrupting certain brain-related functions.",
      "Cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions the brain and spinal cord, is the type of fluid that builds up. Typically, your body makes just enough of this fluid each day and absorbs that same amount, according to Johns Hopkins, but sometimes too much fluid can build up, leading to NPH.",
      "\"If that increases abnormally, it can build up in these chambers, called ventricles, in the brain,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook explained. \"And that can cause pressure on normal brain tissue.\"",
      "As a result, he said, people with the condition may experience symptoms including \"trouble thinking, trouble walking and trouble with urinary incontinence,\" though not every patient will have all the same symptoms.",
      "\"Usually, it just comes out of the blue. We really don't know why,\" LaPook said.",
      "An MRI brain scan can detect the issue, and medical experts say it is usually treatable. The treatment typically involves a surgical procedure to implant a shunt in order to drain the fluid. LaPook said he recently had a patient who was treated this way, \"and now he's feeling perfectly fine.\"",

      "Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer who was working on the Western movie \"Rust\" when the film's cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, was killed in an on-set shooting in 2021, was released from prison Friday, 13 months after her involuntary manslaughter conviction, New Mexico officials said.",
      "In March 2024, Gutierrez-Reed\u00a0was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter\u00a0in connection with Hutchins' death, and sentenced to 18 months in prison the following month. At the time, she was acquitted of a second charge of evidence tampering.",
      "The Parole Board of the State of New Mexico granted Gutierrez-Reed parole Friday, according to a parole certificate provided to CBS News.",
      "That parole runs through May 23, 2026. \u00a0Her certificate said she is required to follow the conditions set forth by the board, some of which include electric monitoring, following a curfew, and either getting a job or enrolling in school.",
      "Gutierrez-Reed was paroled to Arizona and ordered to report there immediately, according to the certificate.",
      "She received the maximum penalty for her part in the October 2021 tragedy when actor Alec Baldwin discharged live rounds\u00a0from a prop gun on the movie set during a rehearsal, killing Hutchins and wounding the film's director, Joel Souza, a tragedy which shook the Hollywood community. Several experts said the death of Hutchins, who had a young son, was entirely preventable.",
      "Prosecutors cited Gutierrez-Reed's lack of contrition during the trial as one reason to impose the maximum sentence. During her sentencing, she said she was \"young and naive\" when she started working on \"Rust.\"",
      "\"Your honor, when I took on 'Rust,' I was young and naive. But I took my job as seriously as I knew how to,\" Gutierrez-Reed told the judge. \"I beg you, please, don't give me more time. The jury has found me in part at fault for this horrible tragedy, but that doesn't make me a monster. That makes me human.\"",

    "summary": "Eight people were found guilty of robbing Kim Kardashian in Paris in 2016. Two defendants were acquitted.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 After a monthlong trial, eight of the 10 people accused of robbing billionaire celebrity Kim Kardashian\u00a0in Paris in 2016 were convicted on Friday.",
      "The ringleader and seven other people involved in the heist were found guilty, but will not return to prison. The court acquitted two defendants who were accused of handing out information about Kardashian's whereabouts.",
      "Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, 69, the ringleader, was handed the heaviest sentence of eight years imprisonment. Five of those years are a suspended sentence. Due to time already served in jail, he will not return to detention.",
      "Three others who were accused of the most serious charges \u2014 Yunis Abbas, Didier Dubreucq and Marc-Alexandre Boyer \u2014 each got seven years, five of them suspended. Like Khedache, they will not return to detention. Dubreucq, 69, was absent from the sentencing as he is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",
      "Prosecutors had called for the four to face 10-year sentences. The chief judge, David De Pas, said the ages of the defendants \u2014 the oldest is 79 and some others are in their 60s and 70s \u2014 weighed on the court's decision not to impose harsher sentences that would have sent them to jail. Boyer, 35, is the only young person involved in the crime.",
      "\"It would have been unjust to take you to prison this evening,\" De Pas said. He said the nine years between the robbery and the trial were also taken into account in the sentencing.",
      "Still, he said that Kardashian had been traumatized by the robbery in her hotel.",
      "\"You caused harm, even if you didn't strike physically and blood was not spilt,\" De Pas said. \"You caused fear.\"",
      "Kardashian was in Paris for Fashion Week in October 2016, staying in a discreet hotel in the center of the city. In emotional four-and-a-half-hour testimony 10 days ago, she told the Paris court she \"absolutely\" believed she was going to be \"raped and killed\" when one of the armed, masked robbers grabbed her leg and pulled her toward him as she lay on her bed wearing just a bathrobe.",
      "She was bound with zip ties and duct tape and locked in the bathroom while the robbers searched her room for the expensive jewelry they said they had seen on social media posts by the woman they recognized only as \"the rapper's wife\" \u2014 a reference to her then-husband Kanye West.",
      "Kardashian, who was not present for the sentencing, said in a statement that she was \"deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice\" in the case. In court, lawyers for Kardashian said the reality star was \"satisfied\" with the verdict.",
      "\"The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family,\" she said in her statement. \"While I'll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all.\"",
      "The 10 accused have been known in France as les papys braqueurs, or the \"Grandpa robbers,\" because of their ages. Some arrived in court in orthopedic shoes and Khedache, now deaf and largely mute, leaned on a cane. Khedache and Abbas, who previously admitted to their parts in the robbery, apologized to Kardashian and the court before their sentencing and conviction.",
      "In a scribbled note to the court, Khedache offered \"a thousand apologies.\" He also apologized to his son, Harminy A\u00eft Khedache, 38, who was a driver for the gang that night. Khedache's DNA, found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece of jewelry ever recovered.",
      "Abbas, 71, who had already apologized directly to Kardashian for contributing to the trauma she said she lives with daily, told the court: \"All I have to say is to apologize to you again; I'm sorry for what I may have done.\"",
      "He was suspected of being the lookout for the gang, stationed outside the luxury residence known as the No Name hotel.",
      "Khedache's son Harminy, 38, accused of having been a driver for the gang that night, was given a five-year sentence, with four of those years suspended.",
      "The only woman in the dock, Christiane Glotin, 79, former companion of Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, who was accused of being the gang's \"secretary,\" was given a four-year suspended sentence.",
      "Fran\u00e7ois Delaporte, charged with being an accomplice, was handed a three-year suspended sentence. Marc Boyer, father of Marc-Alexandre Boyer, was fined $5,700 on weapons charges.",

      "The clock gathered itself together with a whirring of gears and struck a series of blurry notes. Nine o'clock, I was thinking; but no, it turned out to be ten. I'd been sitting there in a sort of stupor, evidently. I stood up and hung my purse in the closet, but then outside the window I saw some movement on the other side of the curtain, some dark and ponderous shape laboring up my front walk. I tweaked the curtain aside a half inch. Max, for God's sake. Max with a duffel bag slung over one shoulder, and a bulky square suitcase dangling from his left hand.",
      "I went to the front door and opened it and looked out at him through the screen. \"What on earth?\" I asked him.",
      "\"You're home!\" he said.",
      "\"Yes ...\"",
      "\"Debbie is at something called a Day of Beauty.\"",
      "\"Right,\" I said.",
      "\"But she knew ahead I was coming. I told her I was coming. I get there and no one's home. I call her cell phone and she says she didn't expect me so early.\"",
      "\"Why did you come so early?\" I asked him.",
      "\"I wanted to beat the rush. You know what Fridays are like on the Bay Bridge.\"",
      "All the more reason not to live on the other side of it, I could have pointed out. I opened the screen door for him and reached for his suitcase, but it wasn't a suitcase; it was some kind of animal carrier. Square patch of wire grid on the end and something watchful and alert staring out from behind it gleaming-eyed. Max moved the carrier away from me a bit and said, \"I've got it.\"",
      "\"What is it?\"",
      "\"It's a cat.\"",
      "\"A cat!\"",
      "\"Could I come in, do you think?\"",
      "I retreated and he lumbered in, out of breath, shaking the floorboards. Max was nowhere near fat, but he was weighty, broad shouldered; he always gave the impression of taking up more than his share of room, although he was not much taller than I was. In the years since we'd divorced he had grown the kind of beard that you're not quite sure is deliberate; maybe he'd merely forgotten to shave for a while. A short gray frizzle with a frizzle of gray hair to match, and he seemed to have given up on his clothes; generally he wore stretched-out knit tops and baggy khakis. I hoped he'd brought a suit for the wedding. You never could be sure.",
      "\"Couldn't you have just left your cat at home with food and water?\" I asked, following him through the living room. \"I mean, it's already bad enough that you're staying with Debbie yourself. In the middle of her wedding preparations, for God's sake!\"",
      "\"She said it would be fine if I stayed,\" Max told me. \"She said it wasn't a problem.\"",
      "\"Okay, but then to add a cat to the mix ... Cats do very well on their own. They almost prefer it, in fact.\"",
      "\"Not this one,\" he said. He set the carrier on my kitchen counter. \"This one is too new.\"",
      "\"It's a kitten?\"",
      "\"No, no, it's old.\"",
      "\"You just said\u2014\"",
      "\"It's an elderly female cat who belonged to a very old woman, and now the woman has up and died and the cat is in mourning,\" he told me.",
      "There was a lot I could have asked about this, but it didn't seem worth the effort. I leaned closer to peer at the cat. \"Does Debbie know you're bringing it?\" I asked him.",
      "\"Now she does.\"",
      "I waited.",
      "\"It's complicated,\" he said. He blotted his face on his shoulder. \"I phoned her; I said, 'Where are you?' She says she's at a Day of Beauty. 'Did you leave a key out someplace?' I asked her, and she says no, but she'll be home in a few hours. 'A few hours!' I say. 'I can't wait a few hours! I've got a cat here!' She says, 'A what?' Then she hits the roof. Tells me I can in no way bring a cat to her house, because Kenneth is allergic.\"",
      "\"He is?\" I said.",
      "\"Deathly allergic, is how she put it.\"",
      "\"But ... Kenneth doesn't live there,\" I said.",
      "\"Don't kid yourself,\" Max told me. \"You know he stays over a lot, and besides, he does plan to live there after the wedding.\"",
      "\"Well, sure, after the wedding.\"",
      "\"'Deathly' allergic, Gail. As in, if he walks into a house where a cat has left a smidgen of dander behind, even if the cat is long gone he'll need a respirator.\"",
      "\"A respirator!\"",
      "\"Or whatever you call those things that asthmatics have to carry around with them.\"",
      "\"You mean an atomizer,\" I said.",
      "\"No, not an atomizer; a what's- it. A vaporizer, maybe?\"",
      "I thought it over.",
      "\"At any rate, that's what Debbie claimed. She claimed that even if he's just standing next to her and she has cat dander on her sweater, he will start choking up and he'll need a ...\"",
      "We both stood there, considering.",
      "The cat said, \"Hmm?\"",
      "We looked over at the carrier.",
      "\"Anyhow,\" Max said, and he unfastened the two latches and lifted the lid. Instead of stepping out, the cat hunched lower and stared up at me. A gray-and-black tabby with a chunky face. \"So I couldn't think where to go except here,\" Max said. \"I knew where you hide your key. It didn't occur to me that you would be home on a weekday.\"",
      "\"Yes, well ...,\" I said. And then I told the cat, \"Hey there.\" She squared her eyes at me.",
      "\"What's her name?\" I asked Max.",
      "\"I don't know.\"",
      "\"What? How could you not know?\"",
      "\"I'm just the fosterer,\" he told me. \"I volunteer at this shelter where they need people to foster animals until they can be adopted. Ordinarily it's kittens, batches of feral kittens that need domesticating first, but this one's a senior citizen. I'm thinking of naming her 'Pearl,' at least for as long as I have her around.\"",
      "\"Pearl!\"",
      "\"On account of her color.\"",
      "\"You can't name a cat 'Pearl.'\"",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"Cats are so bad at language,\" I told him. \"They're not the least bit like dogs. Cats just get your general tone, and 'Pearl' has a tone like a growl.\"",
      "\"It does?\"",
      "\"So does 'Ruby.' So does 'Rhinestone.'\"",
      "\"Aha!\" Max said. \"See there? Everything turns out for the best.\"",
      "\"It does?\" I said. \"What are you talking about?\"",
      "\"You can advise me on cat lore,\" he said. \"Plus you might even decide to adopt her; who knows?\"",
      "\"Max,\" I said, \"sometimes I wonder if you understand the least little thing about me.\"",
      "\"But you love cats! You used to have that homely little calico cat. And this one's accustomed to older women.\"",
      "\"Thanks,\" I said.",
      "\"'Older,' I said. Not 'old.'\"",
      "\"I do not want a cat in any way, shape, or form,\" I told him. \"What do you think of 'Mary?'\" he asked. \"Or 'Carol.' How about that?\"",
      "\"Forget it, Max,\" I said. Then I added, \"And you want to steer away from the r sound. An r is a growl, straight out.\"",
      "\"Oh, right. Yes. Thank you.\" He paused. \"How about 'Lucy'?\" he said.",
      "\"Forget it, I told you.\"",
      "He sighed.",
      "\"Maybe you could drop her off at a shelter here in Baltimore,\" I said. \"I mean, surely they wouldn't refuse her.\"",
      "\"We're not allowed to just dump our charges any-old-where,\" he told me. \"No, I'd better keep her here at your house, and then take her back to Cornboro if you really don't want her.\"",
      "\"I most emphatically do not want her,\" I said. Then, \"Nor do I want a houseguest.\"",
      "\"Yes, but, see, there's dander all over my clothes now. I can't possibly go back to Debbie's, even without the cat.\"",
      "\"In fact, I wonder if you should come to the wedding, even,\" I said. \"Just think if Kenneth starts choking during the vows.\"",
      "This was pure mischief, on my part. I seriously doubted that Kenneth would choke; he'd always struck me as a sturdy type of guy.",
      "But Max looked stricken. He said, \"Not attend my own daughter's wedding?\"",
      "\"Well, you could maybe wear a raincoat,\" I said. \"Or one of those hazmat suits.\"",
      "The kitchen phone rang. We both glanced over at it. It rang again, and then a third time. \"Aren't you going to get that?\" Max asked me.",
      "But I was thinking it might be Marilee, and sure enough, after my outgoing message Marilee came on and asked, \"Gail? Are you there?\"",
      "This was why I still had an actual, physical answering machine: there were too many people I might not feel like talking to.",
      "\"Because we really need to discuss this,\" Marilee said. \"Could you pick up, please?\"",
      "Max wrinkled his forehead at me.",
      "\"Ignore that,\" I told him.",
      "\"What's going on?\"",
      "\"Nothing's going on.\"",
      "\"Okay ...\"",
      "The answering machine clicked off, and I turned back to the cat. I briefly closed my eyes at her. Cats take that as reassurance; to them it's like a smile. Then I looked off in another direction. I heard a rustle, and when I slid a glance sideways I saw her unfolding herself from the carrier by degrees and stepping gingerly onto the counter. \"A little weight problem,\" I murmured.",
      "As if to demonstrate, she landed on the floor with a noticeable thud.",
      "\"I think it's from stress,\" Max said. \"Apparently she'd been alone for some time before anyone realized her owner had died.\"",
      "I made a sympathetic tsking sound.",
      "\"What's up with Marilee?\" Max asked. He'd never been very good at minding his own business. I said, \"Nothing's up with Marilee.\"",
      "The cat was heading into the living room now, so I made a big show of following her. She paused to sniff at the fringe on the rug and then padded over to an armchair and sprang into it, more nimbly than you might expect.",
      "\"What does she want to discuss?\" Max asked, trailing after me.",
      "I gave up. I said, \"She's retiring in the fall and she wants the board to hire this other person in her place, this Nashville person. And the Nashville person is asking to bring in her own assistant. So I'm thinking I should just quit before they fire me.\"",
      "\"Excellent,\" Max said.",
      "I turned to look at him.",
      "\"Your great talent is for teaching; you know that,\" Max said. \"Dealing with all the kids who are scared to death of math.\"",
      "\"You're forgetting that teachers make no money, though,\" I told him. \"Why else did I put in all that hell time getting my master's degree?\"",
      "\"So? Now that Debbie's finished law school, you can go back to doing what you're good at.\"",
      "\"It's not that simple,\" I told him.",
      "Still, it was nice of him to say that I was good at something. But then he changed the subject. \"Guess I might as well bring in the cat supplies,\" he said. And he went on outside, leaving the front door open behind him even though the air conditioning was on.",
      "I turned back to the cat. She was a bread-loaf shape in the armchair now with her front paws folded beneath her, and when she saw me looking at her she shut her eyes lazily and then opened them again.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China.",
      "Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks.",
      "Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",
      "Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.",
      "Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a \"significant increase\" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.",
      "\"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson said that, so far, too few U.S. sequences have been reported of NB.1.8.1 to be included in the agency's\u00a0variant estimates\u00a0dashboard.",
      "While authorities in Hong Kong say there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.",
      "Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.",
      "Preliminary data from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.",
      "\"A more predictable pattern\"",
      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",
      "\"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",

    "summary": "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify medical exceptions under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S.,",
    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify\u00a0medical exceptions\u00a0under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., putting the GOP-backed proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "But the proposal is still a pivot for Texas\u00a0Republicans, who for years have defended the law as written in the face of legal challenges and pleas for clarity from medical providers.\u00a0Democrats, meanwhile, have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.",
      "The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It also defines a \"life-threatening\" condition as one capable of causing death.",
      "Senate Bill 31\u00a0passed 129-6 and needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Abbott, who has signaled support for the measure.",
      "North Texas doctor has mixed feelings toward the bill",
      "Three years ago, Dr. Austin Dennard traveled outside Texas for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She later testified in a lawsuit about how the state's near-total ban on abortion put her health at risk.",
      "Dennard's feelings are mixed about the bill, which does not list specific medical conditions or include fatal fetal anomalies as exceptions.",
      "\"What is broadly now known among practicing physicians in Texas is that abortions are illegal,\" said Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas. \"Undoing that broad understanding is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Moves to clarify medical exemptions",
      "Lawmakers in at least nine states with abortion bans have sought to change or clarify medical exceptions that allow doctors to perform an abortion if the mother's life is at risk since Roe v. Wade was overturned\u00a0nearly three years ago, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Supporters of these bills have said they have the potential to save lives. Critics, including some abortion rights groups, have questioned whether they make state abortion laws easier to understand.",
      "In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year vetoed a bill that GOP lawmakers touted as bringing clarity to that state's near-total abortion ban, saying it would not protect pregnant women. Republican lawmakers later overrode his veto.",
      "Last year, South Dakota released a video for physicians that outlined examples of acceptable medical emergencies, which received criticism from abortion rights supporters for not being specific enough.",
      "\"I think these bills are trying to get at the reality that exceptions are really hard to comply with,\" said Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "Still, Texas Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes, an architect of the state's abortion ban, said the new bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors.",
      "\"One of the most important things we want to do is to make sure that doctors and hospitals and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is,\" Hughes said.",
      "Navigating exceptions under abortion bans",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Dennard and a group of women who said they were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications that threatened their lives and fertility. The court ruled that the state's laws were clear in allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.",
      "Texas' efforts underscore the challenges abortion opponents have had to navigate regarding medical exceptions, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion politics in the U.S.",
      "Judges have put enforcement of Utah's abortion ban on hold in a case over exceptions, for example, and they struck down two Oklahoma bans over medical exceptions \u2013 though most abortions in that state remain illegal.",
      "For abortion opponents, Ziegler said, it's tricky to craft legislation that does two different things.",
      "\"Can you provide clear guidance as to when medical intervention is justified without providing physicians discretion to provide abortions they don't think are emergencies?\" Ziegler said.",
      "Texas may advance other anti-abortion laws",
      "Texas' ban prohibits nearly all abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and doctors can be fined up to $100,000 and face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an abortion illegally.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton's office has filed criminal charges against a midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions and is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",
      "Texas Republicans are also advancing efforts to make it a civil offense to mail, deliver or manufacture abortion pills, expanding on a 2021 law that allows private individuals to sue others whom they suspect are helping a woman obtain an abortion.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-covid-vaccine-mrna-heart-side-effects-warning-label/",
    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 12:32:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The FDA is requiring COVID vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna to update their warnings about the possible risk of myocarditis and pericarditis.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is telling Pfizer and Moderna to expand the warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines about the risk of a possible heart injury side effect linked to the mRNA shots, primarily in teen boys and young men, citing findings from a study published last year and new agency data.",
      "Orders to expand the warnings were posted Wednesday by the FDA, in letters dated April 17 to Pfizer and BioNTech about their Comirnaty vaccine and Moderna about its Spikevax vaccine.",
      "Both vaccines previously carried warnings about how the risk of the heart side effects \u2014 which doctors call myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) \u2014 looked to be higher in young men, generally within the first week after vaccination. While the earlier labels specified ages 18 to 24 years old for Moderna's vaccine and 12 to 17 years old for Pfizer's, the new warning will apply to males ages 16 to 25 for both vaccines.",
      "\"Following administration of the 2023-2024 Formula of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the highest estimated incidence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" the FDA says in the new blanket warning it will require for both vaccines.",
      "The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA says.",
      "The new warnings ordered by the FDA add that the \"highest estimated incidence was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" with a rate of 38 cases per million.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously described rates of myocarditis and pericarditis as rare after COVID-19 vaccination.",
      "CDC officials told the agency's vaccine advisers last month that acute myocarditis \"tends to resolve quickly\" after vaccination, and no increased risk had been seen in data from recent seasons in people 12 to 39 years old.",
      "It is unclear whether Pfizer or Moderna disputed the order. They had \"within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter\" to try to rebut the demand. Spokespeople for Moderna and Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Americans deserve radical transparency around the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines and the FDA is delivering on their promise to do just that. Moderna and Pfizer should take steps to ensure that individuals are aware of COVID vaccine-related adverse events resulting in myocarditis and pericarditis,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News in an email. Nixon did not explain why the letters were posted more than a month after they were written.",
      "They appeared on the FDA's website hours ahead of a hearing organized by the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on \"how health officials downplayed and hid myocarditis and other adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.\"",
      "Aaron Siri, an attorney who worked closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the past to call on the FDA to pull COVID-19 and other vaccines and vet nominees during the transition, is among the witnesses.",
      "The FDA says the warnings were spurred by new data from the agency's safety surveillance system and results published in October from scientists following up with people who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis.",
      "Talks about this kind of safety labeling change began before the ouster of the FDA's previous top vaccines official, Dr. Peter Marks, multiple people familiar with the situation said, but had not yet been finalized as officials wrestled with how to accurately present the findings. Marks left the FDA on April 5.",
      "Scientists in that study followed up with people who had faced chest pain and elevated amounts of troponin in their blood, a protein that usually signals some kind of heart damage. They were predominantly young adolescent males.",
      "\"While their clinical course was nearly always mild with a low prevalence and extent of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury was common,\" the scientists wrote in the study, which was co-authored by FDA officials.",
      "Similar to what the study described, the FDA's new warning also says that the heart MRI findings showed \"improvement over time in most people.\"",
      "\"It is not known if these heart MRI findings might predict long-term heart effects of myocarditis. Studies are underway to find out if there are long-term heart effects in people who have had myocarditis after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,\" the FDA said.",

    "summary": "FDA advisers are set to meet Thursday to decide on updates for this fall's COVID shots.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration says it has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and others at higher risk of severe disease, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "\"I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters,\"\u00a0Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's new top vaccines official, said in a video posted by the agency announcing the change.",
      "Details of the new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in\u00a0an article\u00a0published by The New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.",
      "Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.",
      "Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.",
      "\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.",
      "Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday that these guidelines are essentially taking away the option to get a booster for some.",
      "\"Up until now, people have been opting, do they want to (get a booster), do they not? Now, if you're under 65, you may not be able to get an updated booster,\" she said. \"They are requiring clinical trials that, quite frankly, because of how long it takes, how expensive they are, it's very unlikely that they would happen in time for an updated booster for those younger age groups.\"",
      "While requiring these clinical trials may seem like a more evidence-based approach, Gounder said she's skeptical.",
      "\"There's a little double speak going,\" she said, adding typically, there would be a publicly shared systematic review of all vaccine data ahead of a change like this. \"What you got here was a two and a half page paper, which was really a policy opinion piece, in the New England Journal of Medicine in a town hall meeting. Normally, when you have a big change like this at the FDA, this is done much more transparently.\"",
      "The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency's outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has greenlit those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.",
      "That is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease \u2014 a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.",
      "But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.",
      "\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.",
      "\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.",
      "Prasad said interim results from some of the studies could be ready \"by next calendar year.\"",
      "Pfizer said it is \"evaluating the details shared today\" and is in ongoing talks with the FDA. The company said its shots had been administered to over a billion people, including kids, showing favorable safety data.",
      "\"We stand by the science behind the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and continue to believe that broad vaccination programs are an essential tool for helping to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and severe disease, including death,\" Pfizer spokesperson Steven Danehy said in a statement.",
      "Moderna spokesperson Chris Ridley said they \"appreciate the FDA's clear guidance and remain committed to working with the Agency to provide the data they need to ensure access for Americans.\"",
      "A Novavax spokesperson declined to comment. Novavax earned a narrow FDA approval over the weekend for its COVID-19 vaccine, which was limited to seniors as well as adults and adolescents with at least one underlying condition.",
      "While U.S. health care providers are usually allowed to administer vaccines with FDA approval \"off-label\" outside the limits laid out by the agency, a narrower approval can affect access and limit insurance coverage for the vaccinations.",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to release a report Thursday on how pesticides and other issues may be linked to childhood chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",
      "Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use.",
      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",
      "Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup \u2014 made from the chemical glyphosate \u2014 was causing cancer.",
      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\"",
      "Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release.",
      "Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines.",
      "\"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week.",
      "What power does RFK Jr. have over pesticides?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals.",
      "Studies into pesticides like glyphosate to inform the EPA's limits often come from the federal health agencies within HHS.",
      "For example, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program published results in 2023 suggesting that glyphosate is \"unlikely\" to be genotoxic, which had been one of the main ways international experts previously suspected it might cause cancer.",
      "Results from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in 2022 found that diet was likely a factor in how much glyphosate people were being exposed to, based on urine samples taken in adults and children.",
      "Through the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy also has authority over how glyphosate levels in food are tracked and the EPA's limits are enforced.",
      "The last round of published sampling by the FDA in 2022 found that 54 samples of human food had detectable amounts of glyphosate out of 731 analyzed. Corn and beans were among the most frequent detections.",

      "Before the surgery, a CT scan showed that Rappaport's kidneys were \"unremarkable. No suspicious masses, stones, or hydronephrosis,\" according to the lawsuit. Rappaport did not consent to the removal of her left kidney, documents state.",
      "She stayed in the hospital until May 25, 2022 due to complications following the removal of the kidney, the suit says. She also now requires continued treatment, including dialysis, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit claims the doctor committed medical malpractice and medical battery. The lawsuit accuses him of breaching his duty of care he owed Rappaport and causing permanent, irreversible injury.

      "News of the Neurological Disorders and Stroke scientists losing their jobs was previously reported by The Transmitter.",
      "The laid-off scientists include Richard Youle. Youle, who has served at the NIH since 1978, carries the title of distinguished investigator, a designation reserved for the agency's most preeminent researchers. He was the winner\u00a0of the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2021 for his research into Parkinson's disease.",
      "A scientist familiar with Youle's work, who spoke anonymously fearing retaliation, praised his research as a \"fundamentally important\" breakthrough for the field. Youle's results had paved the way for researchers to find new treatments for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, the NIH said in its news release.",
      "One source at the NIH said Youle had received four job offers after news of the layoffs broke last month. Three were for positions outside the United States. While Youle has told others that he has no interest in leaving the U.S. for now, the source said it shows that \"the world is ready to pounce and take our top scientists if we don't fix this.\"",

Sibley, Kenton Swartz, Susan Wray and Ling-Gang Wu \u2013 were also laid off at NINDS, according to records shared with CBS News. A senior associate scientist at NINDS, Silvina Horowitz, got a layoff notice as well, the records show.",
      "Among the scientists who have received major recognition for their work in recent years include Wu, who was selected for a prestigious award in February from the Biophysical Society for his ongoing research on how neurons communicate and function. Sibley was recognized in 2023 by a pharmacology society for \"seminal contributions\" to understanding dopamine receptors in the brain.",

There are some people who were scientists that were doing IT or administration, who did lose their jobs. But in terms of working scientists, our policy was to make sure none of them were lost and that that research continues,\" Kennedy said.",
      "NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and senior leaders within the department were made aware weeks ago about the layoffs, multiple sources told CBS News. Bhattacharya and others previously said that they were mistakes and would be reversed soon.",
      "Weeks have passed since those assurances were made to the scientists. Multiple sources said the scientists have yet to receive any letters revoking their \"reduction in force\" or \"RIF\" notices, or an explanation for why moves to reverse their layoffs never occurred.",
      "That is unlike similar layoffs that were revoked weeks ago at the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the department, which officials completed in the days ahead of Kennedy's testimony to Capitol Hill.",
      "When asked about the employment status of NIH and NIOSH scientists who received reduction in forces notices, a spokesperson for the department pointed back to Kennedy's remarks at the Senate hearing about the layoffs.",
      "Kennedy's claim that no working scientists were fired has drawn disdain in recent days from other laid-off scientists at multiple health agencies beyond the NIH.",
      "For example, while some of the laid-off employees at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were restored ahead of Kennedy's hearing, researchers in the agency's Health Effects Laboratory Division remain off the job. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also lost many scientists in its National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for an array of work ranging from lead poisonings to illness outbreaks on cruise ships. CDC labs investigating outbreaks of viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases were also eliminated, after all the scientists were laid off.",
      "\"Perhaps he is unaware that his RIFs have gutted scientists and front-line public health workers at CDC, the very people he vowed to protect,\" one laid-off CDC official told CBS News.",
      "Some within the NIH said they believed that the scientists would be reinstated after the research agency faced a second round of layoffs, which employees had been told were to compensate for scientists that needed to be reinstated to their positions.",
      "Around 200 employees at the NIH were laid off, including staff at the National Cancer Institute and Office of Research Facilities. Officials said the cuts wiped out multiple teams responsible for contracting work to conduct emergency maintenance around the NIH's campuses and oversee laboratory safety.",
      "The NIH's acquisitions office was also gutted by those layoffs, according to an email to lab managers shared with CBS News, leaving the agency's supply center with \"little to no capacity for new work\" to obtain supplies for researchers.",

      "Publix recalled 4-ounce Greenwise Pear, Kiwi, Spinach & Pea Baby Food pouches sold at more than 1,400 stores.",
      "The pouches were produced by Bowman Andros, a French company with a manufacturing plant in Mount Jackson, Virginia, according to the company's website. Publix issued the voluntary recall on May 9, but it wasn't added to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recall list until late Thursday.",

      "In 2023, state health officials investigated reports of lead poisoning in four children who consumed WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fannie-mae-freddie-mac-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Sat, 24 May 2025 08:15:01 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says he'll decide soon whether to take Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public \u2014 a move that was vocally sought by Trump ally Bill Ackman.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said this week he may take home lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, winding down 17 years of federal control over two central parts of the U.S. housing market \u2014 a move that was cheered on by Trump ally and noted Wall Street investor Bill Ackman.",
      "Ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 which guarantee trillions of dollars worth of mortgages \u2014 would be complicated, and critics say it's risky. A plan to do so in Mr. Trump's first term did not come to pass. But the president says he'll decide \"in the near future\" whether to try again, pointing to the firms' return to profitability since their 2008 government takeover.",
      "\"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing very well, throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social late Wednesday \u2014 prompting a double-digit rally in shares the next day of both Fannie and Freddie, which trade over the counter rather than on a major stock exchange.",
      "The idea of taking the two government-sponsored enterprises public has drawn some support for years, with advocates arguing Fannie and Freddie could function better if released from federal control. Releasing Fannie and Freddie could also benefit some investors who have bought shares in the firms over the years, betting on an eventual federal spinoff of the mortgage giants.",
      "One of the largest \u2014 and most vocal \u2014 is Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Fannie and Freddie over a decade ago. The firm is the biggest private holder of Fannie, at just over 115 million shares according to S&P Capital IQ data \u2014 worth over $1.2 billion at Friday's price. Ackman said in an earnings call Thursday that Pershing Square owns about 220 million shares in Fannie and Freddie combined.",
      "Other major holders of the two enterprises include Capital Research and Management Company, which has the largest known stake in Freddie ($350 million) and the second-largest stake in Fannie (over $1 billion), according to S&P Capital IQ. Paulson & Co., founded by billionaire John Paulson, also invested in Fannie and Freddie at one point, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 \u2014 though the size of its current stake is unclear.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was reelected last year, Ackman has publicly pushed on X to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, calling it a good deal for taxpayers that could generate as much as $300 billion for the government. In January, Pershing Square put together a presentation called \"The Art of the Deal\" that made the case in more detail.",
      "\"Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history. I am confident he will get it done,\" Ackman wrote on X in December.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced Wednesday he's \"giving very serious consideration\" to the idea, Ackman responded on X with a thumbs-up emoji. In Thursday's earnings call, Ackman said, \"[W]e're extremely encouraged by the president's announcement.\" Ackman also said Thursday the firm wasn't aware of any plans by the Trump administration to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship.",
      "Famous for his sharp-elbowed activist investing strategy and pandemic-era bets, Ackman has made waves in recent months for his political views. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2024 and has taken aim at the leadership of Harvard University over its handling of Israel-Hamas war protests.",
      "Skeptics of releasing Fannie and Freddie, like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have pushed back on the idea, warning it could benefit investors at the risk of disrupting the mortgage market.",
      "\"[The president] hasn't come to Congress with any kind of plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 and the last thing we need is to privatize them in a way that rewards Wall Street while driving up housing prices for people already struggling to buy homes,\" Warren, a Massachusetts lawmaker and the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to advance the President's mission of restoring the dream of homeownership for all Americans. Any actions under consideration will be carefully evaluated in a safe and sound manner to deliver on the President's historic agenda.\"",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square declined to comment to CBS News. FHFA \u2014 which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and why could they be privatized?",
      "The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 or, more formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \u2014 in the 20th century, with Fannie Mae dating back to the Great Depression. They essentially buy mortgages from lenders like banks and bundle them together into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors \u2014 a space known as the secondary mortgage market.",
      "The point of this work is to bring more money into the nation's residential lending system, making it easier for average families to buy a home. Fannie Mae describes itself as \"the backbone of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\"",
      "For decades, Fannie and Freddie were both publicly traded companies, though many observers believed they operated with an \"implicit guarantee\" that the government would step in if either company wobbled.",
      "But after a mortgage crisis sparked the 2008 recession, the Bush administration bailed out Fannie and Freddie and put them under federal conservatorship to save them from collapse. Since then, the FHFA has effectively controlled the two firms. That arrangement wasn't necessarily supposed to be permanent, but it has lasted for over a decade, with the two companies making billions in payments to the government.",
      "A push for the government to end its conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie has been brewing for years. Some critics view the firms as unfairly dominant in the mortgage industry and believe they fill a role that should be played by the private sector. Other supporters of privatization like Ackman argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers, partly because, in a holdover from the financial crisis, the government has the right to purchase almost 80% of both firms' shares.",
      "Opponents of privatization argue it could push up mortgage rates, especially if Fannie and Freddie are no longer viewed as backstopped by the government. How that plays out could depend on how the government decides to end the conservatorship, though, and whether it still offers some kind of guarantee. Credit agency Fitch Ratings said it would keep rating Fannie and Freddie's debt similarly to the U.S. government's debt if the firms maintain a federal backstop, but if not, they would be rated separately \u2014 and could slip if their market dominance shrinks.",
      "The risk of higher mortgage costs could be a major stumbling block in an era of elevated interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this year, \"anything that is done around a safe and sound release [of Fannie and Freddie] is going to hinge on the effect of long-term mortgage rates.\"",
      "In part for that reason, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note Friday that the firm expects the Trump administration to make changes to Fannie and Freddie at a \"slower and more deliberate\" pace than it has moved on other issues, like tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs may have impacted the stock market, but they did not result in immediate price hikes at Walmart or Dollar General. By contrast, the price of mortgages will respond to each recap and release development,\" Seiberg wrote. \"That makes the political cost more immediate and gives the President less room to alter positions as he has done on trade.\"",
      "In his first term, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department proposed ending Fannie and Freddie's conservatorship. While the first Trump administration ultimately didn't take this step, it made some changes to how the two institutions operate.",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square called releasing Fannie and Freddie the \"Unfinished Business of the First Trump Administration\" in its January presentation. The firm laid out a possible roadmap to turn Fannie and Freddie into independent publicly traded companies: It suggested holding initial public offerings by 2026 for Fannie and 2027 for Freddie, and then allowing the federal government to sell its stakes over five years.",
      "But it's unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 the Trump administration may pursue the idea. In his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, FHFA Director William Pulte said he believed that any end to government control of Fannie and Freddie needed to be \"extremely thoughtful.\"",
      "\"While their conservatorship should not be indefinite, any exit from conservatorship must be carefully planned to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market without upward pressure on mortgage rates,\" Pulte said.",

      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",

First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data. Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 14:49:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The massive budget bill passed by the House includes new tax breaks for tipped workers and those who get overtime.",
    "story": [
      "The massive Republican-backed budget bill \u2014 called \"one big, beautiful bill\" by President Trump \u2014 includes several new tax rules that could have a big financial impact on millions of workers who earn tips or overtime pay.",
      "While the heart of the bill is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, the legislation also includes several provisions that were part of the president's campaign last year, such as his vow to eliminate taxes on tipped income.",
      "The bill could deliver savings of about $1,700 for each tipped worker as well as employees who earn overtime, the House Ways and Means Committee said on May 20. But there are some restrictions in the bill that could limit the financial boon for these workers, with some policy experts saying that the tax breaks may not be as useful as they first appear.",
      "For instance, almost 4 in 10 tipped workers earn so little that they pay no federal income tax, according to the Brookings Institution. Consequently, the tax break is likely to provide a bigger helping hand to higher-paid tipped workers, while leaving some low-income workers behind.",
      "\"If your goal is to help the poorest service workers, this is probably not the way to do it,\" said Michael Lynn, a professor of services marketing at Cornell University whose research largely focuses on tipping and other consumer behavior.",
      "The 1,100-page bill, which squeaked through the House on Thursday by a single vote, will now go to the Senate, where more changes are likely. Here's what to know about the provisions as they now stand.",
      "How would the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision work?",
      "Called the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision within the House bill, the rule would create a new tax deduction that eliminates federal income taxes on tips for people who work in jobs that have traditionally received them.",
      "There are about 4 million people in the U.S. who work in tipped occupations, or about 2.5% of all U.S. workers, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The tax break includes some restrictions:",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.\u00a0Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.Tips must be reported to the employer and included on the worker's W-2 tax form.The provision would go into effect in 2025, but expire after 2028, making it a short-term tax break.\u00a0The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.",
      "Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.",
      "Tips must be reported to the employer and included on the worker's W-2 tax form.",
      "The provision would go into effect in 2025, but expire after 2028, making it a short-term tax break.",
      "The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "\"The tip exemption will significantly increase take-home pay for most tipped workers, many of whom are low- to middle-income taxpayers,\" the White House's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), a group that advises the president on economic issues, said in a report published earlier this month.",
      "The CEA's report estimates that the average take-home pay for tipped workers would increase by $1,675 per year under the provision.",
      "Would it help all tipped workers?",
      "No, because 4 in 10 tipped workers earn too little to pay federal income taxes, which means they wouldn't see any benefit. There's also a concern that some employers could reclassify some workers as tipped workers by arguing they would receive a tax break, according to Brookings.",
      "The minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 per hour, versus $7.25 an hour for non-tipped workers.",
      "One Fair Wage, an advocacy group representing service workers, criticized the measure, noting that the GOP bill also includes cuts to social safety net programs that many tipped workers rely on. \"It also slashes Medicaid, putting 1.2 million restaurant workers at risk of losing health care,\" One Fair Wage posted on social media.",
      "What about the Senate's No Tax on Tips Act?",
      "A separate, standalone bill called the No Tax on Tips Act, which is solely focused on giving a tax break to tipped workers, was passed by the Senate on May 20, with bipartisan support. That bill will now move to the House for a vote.",
      "The Senate bill offers similar benefits and restrictions as the \"one big, beautiful bill\" when it comes to taxes and tips, but with one major difference: The bigger GOP bill requires workers, as well as their spouses, to have a Social Security number.",
      "That requirement appears to be aimed at excluding some immigrants from tapping the tax break, while the Senate bill doesn't stipulate that taxpayers who claim this break, or their spouses, must have a Social Security number.",
      "Senator Jackie Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, urged lawmakers to pass the Not Tax on Tips Act arguing in a statement that the bigger GOP bill combines the tax break with cuts to vital programs like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "\"We shouldn't be forcing working families to choose between keeping their health care or keeping their tips, which is why we want this bipartisan bill on its own \u2014 on its own \u2014 not part of a harmful, extreme budget bill,\" Rosen said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.",
      "How does the \"No Tax on Overtime\" provision work?",
      "The GOP bill includes a tax break for workers who receive overtime, another one of Mr. Trump's campaign promises.",
      "About 8% of hourly workers and 4% of salaried workers receive overtime pay on a regular basis, according to the Yale Budget Lab. About 70% of salaried workers don't qualify for overtime pay, it noted.",
      "The legislation would enable workers to claim a deduction on their taxes for the amount they earned in overtime pay during the tax year, although there are some restrictions:",
      "Workers would need a Social Security number to claim the tax break, and if married, their spouses would also need a Social Security number.The tax break would go into effect in 2025 but expire after the 2028 tax year.",
      "Workers would need a Social Security number to claim the tax break, and if married, their spouses would also need a Social Security number.",
      "The tax break would go into effect in 2025 but expire after the 2028 tax year.",
      "But more guidelines about the provision would still need to be determined by the Treasury Department, according to tax firm Wolters Kluwer in a May 22 publication about the tax bill.",

      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 18 and 65, and those who do not have a child under the age of 7.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "The legislation also adds annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners: $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",

      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has promoted tariffs as a way to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, secure more favorable trade deals with other countries and advance the White House's other policies, such as curbing unauthorized immigration and trafficking of illicit drugs.",
      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing. That's because companies typically base the decision on where to locate factories more on factors including labor and energy costs, tax rates, political instability and the regulatory environment.",

    "summary": "A GOP tax-and-spending bill the House approved Thursday would slash federal Medicaid reimbursement for states that offer health coverage to immigrants without legal status.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's signature budget legislation would punish 14 states that offer health coverage to people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "The states, most of them Democratic-led, provide insurance to some low-income immigrants \u2014 often children \u2014 regardless of their legal status. Advocates argue the policy is both humane and ultimately cost-saving.",
      "But the federal legislation, which Republicans have titled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" would slash federal Medicaid reimbursements to those states by billions of dollars a year in total unless they roll back the benefits.",
      "The bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday and next moves to the Senate. While enacting much of Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, including big tax cuts largely benefiting wealthier Americans, the legislation also makes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid that congressional budget scorekeepers say will leave millions of low-income people without health insurance.",
      "The cuts, if approved by the Senate, would pose a tricky political and economic hurdle for the states and Washington, D.C., which use their own funds to provide health insurance to some people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Those states would see their federal reimbursement for people covered under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion cut by 10 percentage points. The cuts would cost California, the state with the most to lose, as much as $3 billion a year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Together, the 15 affected places cover about 1.9 million immigrants without legal status, according to KFF. The penalty might also apply to other states that cover lawfully residing immigrants, KFF says.",
      "Two of the states \u2014 Utah and Illinois \u2014 have \"trigger\" laws that call for their Medicaid expansions to terminate if the feds reduce their funding match. That means unless those states either repeal their trigger laws or stop covering people without legal immigration status, many more low-income Americans could be left uninsured.",
      "The remaining states and Washington, D.C., would have to come up with millions or billions more dollars every year, starting in the 2027 fiscal year, to make up for reductions in their federal Medicaid reimbursements, if they keep covering people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Behind California, New York stands to lose the most federal funding \u2014 about $1.6 billion annually, according to KFF.",
      "California state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, said Mr. Trump's legislation has sown chaos as state legislators work to pass their own budget by June 15.",
      "\"We need to stand our ground,\" he said. \"California has made a decision that we want universal health care and that we are going to ensure that everyone has access to health care, and that we're not going to have millions of undocumented people getting their primary care in emergency rooms.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's bill would devastate health care in his state.",
      "\"Millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,\" Newsom said.",
      "In his May 14 budget proposal, Newsom called on lawmakers to cut some benefits for immigrants without legal status, citing ballooning costs in the state's Medicaid program. If Congress cuts Medicaid expansion funding, the state would be in no position to backfill, the governor said.",
      "Newsom questioned whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for how they spend their own money and said his state would consider challenging the move in court.",
      "Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who helped spearhead a bill to cover children in his state regardless of their immigration status, said Utah needs to maintain its Medicaid expansion that began in 2020.",
      "\"We cannot afford, monetary-wise or policy-wise, to see our federal expansion funding cut,\" he said. Dunnigan wouldn't say whether he thinks the state should end its immigrant coverage if the Republican penalty provision becomes law.",
      "Utah's program covers about 2,000 children, the maximum allowed under its law. Adult immigrants without legal status are not eligible. Utah's Medicaid expansion covers about 75,000 adults, who must be citizens or lawfully present immigrants.",
      "Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a consumer advocacy organization, said the federal House bill leaves the state in a difficult position.",
      "\"There are no great alternatives, politically,\" he said. \"It's a prisoner's dilemma \u2014 a move in either direction does not make much sense.\"",
      "Slonaker said one likely scenario is that state lawmakers eliminate their trigger law then find a way to make up the loss of federal expansion funding.",
      "Utah has funded its share of the cost of Medicaid expansion with sales and hospital taxes.",
      "\"This is a very hard political decision that Congress would put the state of Utah in,\" Slonaker said.",
      "In Illinois, the GOP penalty would have even larger consequences. That's because it could lead to 770,000 adults' losing the health coverage they gained under the state's Medicaid expansion.",
      "Stephanie Altman, director of health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said it's possible her Democratic-led state would end its trigger law before allowing its Medicaid expansion to terminate. She said the state might also sidestep the penalty by asking counties to fund coverage for immigrants. \"It would be a hard situation, obviously,\" she said.",
      "Altman said the House bill appeared written to penalize Democratic-controlled states because they more commonly provide immigrants coverage without regard for their legal status.",
      "She said the provision shows Republicans' \"hostility against immigrants\" and that \"they do not want them coming here and receiving public coverage.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said this month that state programs that provide public coverage to people regardless of immigration status serve as \"an open doormat,\" inviting more people to cross the border without authorization. He said efforts to end such programs have support in public polling.",
      "A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted May 16-18 found that 47% of Americans approve of Mr. Trump's immigration policies and 45% disapprove. The poll found that Mr. Trump's overall approval rating has sunk 5 percentage points since he returned to office in January, to 42%, with 52% of Americans disapproving of his performance.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, enabled states to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 for an individual this year. Forty states and Washington, D.C., expanded, contributing to the national uninsured rate dropping to historic lows.",
      "The federal government now pays 90% of the costs for people added to Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion.",
      "In states that cover health care for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, the Republican bill would reduce the federal government's contribution from 90% to 80% of the cost of coverage for anyone added to Medicaid under the ACA expansion.",
      "By law, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover people who are in the country without authorization, except for pregnancy and emergency services.",
      "The other states that use their own money to cover people regardless of immigration status are Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, according to KFF.",
      "Ryan Long, director of congressional relations at Paragon Health Institute, an influential conservative policy group, said that even if they use their own money for immigrant coverage, states still depend on federal funds to \"support systems that facilitate enrollment of illegal aliens.\"",
      "Long said the concern that states with trigger laws could see their Medicaid expansion end is a \"red herring\" because states have the option to remove their triggers, as Michigan did in 2023.",
      "The penalty for covering people in the country without authorization is one of several ways the House bill cuts federal Medicaid spending.",
      "The legislation would shift more Medicaid costs to states by requiring them to verify whether adults covered by the program are working. States would also have to recertify Medicaid expansion enrollees' eligibility every six months, rather than once a year or less, as most states currently do.",
      "The bill would also freeze states' practice of taxing hospitals, nursing homes, managed-care plans, and other health care companies to fund their share of Medicaid costs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office said in a May 11 preliminary estimate that, under the House-passed bill, about 8.6 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034. That number will rise to nearly 14 million, the CBO estimates, after the Trump administration finishes new ACA regulations and if the Republican-led Congress, as expected, declines to extend enhanced premium subsidies for commercial insurance plans sold through Obamacare marketplaces.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, a priority of former President Joe Biden, eliminated monthly premiums altogether for some people buying Obamacare plans. They are set to expire at the end of the year.",

      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",

Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",

While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",

    "summary": "House Republican's budget bill would create $1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for babies born between January 2025 and January 2029.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration wants to kickstart wealth creation for American children by creating $1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for babies born during President Trump's second term in office.",
      "Originally called \"money account for growth and advancement,\" or \"MAGA\" savings accounts, the renamed accounts would be managed by banks or investment firms, and operate like traditional investment accounts.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed \"Trump accounts\" for newborns.",
      "What are they called?",
      "House Republicans on Wednesday submitted an amendment to Mr. Trump's domestic policy bill to ditch the original \"Maga\" acronym and rename the accounts \"Trump accounts,\" after the president himself.",
      "Who would get one?",
      "Every child born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025 and Jan. 1, 2029 with a Social Security number, and whose parents have Social Security numbers, would be automatically enrolled in the program. The U.S. Treasury would set up and fund the accounts.",
      "Madeline Brown, senior policy associate at the Urban Institute, said automatic enrollment is a key component of the proposed pilot program, given some adults' unfamiliarity with such investment vehicles. Some of the lowest-income families, who could most benefit from the boost, \"often don't know about these kinds of programs. There's a huge awareness gap,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Automatic enrollment is fundamental to improving the likelihood that it reaches the lowest-income families,\" she added.",
      "What would be in a \"Trump account\"?",
      "The government would contribute $1,000 to every eligible child's account, which would be invested in the stock market on their behalf. Families and third parties could also contribute up to $5,000 a year to a child's account.",
      "Sam Taube, investment expert at personal finance site Nerdwallet, said the proposed \"Trump accounts\" are similar to programs currently offered by a number of states, but the contributions aren't as generous. For instance Colorado's First Step program awards every newborn $100 in a 529 college savings account, plus a match of $500 a year for the first five years of savings, totaling up to $2,500 in gift contributions.",
      "What could the money be spent on?",
      "Accountholders would only be approved to be spend investment funds on prescribed costs, such as a down payment on a home, education-related expenses, or starting a small business. Use of the funds to pay for unapproved expenses would subject accountholders to penalties.",
      "But broadening the scope of approved expenditures would be even more beneficial to many families, Brown noted.",
      "\"When it comes to wealth building, we have to make sure the target sums that kids end up with at 18 are in line with the things we're saying you can use the money for,\" Brown explained.",
      "If lower-income accountholders' families can't contribute the additional $5,000 per year, the sum they would end up with as adults might not cover a down payment, for example.",
      "\"There are lots of different projections around what $1,000 can grow to with different interest rates, but it's not a down payment,\" she said. \"So unless additional contributions come from the community, the federal government or state governments, we're not likely to see these accounts grow to the sums that we're saying are qualified uses.",
      "When could the funds be withdrawn?",
      "Half of the funds could be withdrawn when a child turns 18, at which point the account's gains would be taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate, so long as the money were spent as directed. If the funds were used for other purposes, withdrawals would be taxed as income. A 10% penalty for misspending the money could also apply. Accountholders would have access to their full balances between the ages of 25-30 for approved purposes, and after 30, would be able to withdraw the funds for any purpose.",
      "Brown said she thinks improvements could be made to the way the program is structured, particularly around how account withdrawals are taxed. She noted that the lowest-income families would be the most likely to spend the funds on unapproved expenses, and face tax penalties.",
      "Most Americans can't afford a $1,000 emergency expense, according to a January report from Bankrate, making low-earners more likely to need to tap into the funds for surprise costs.",
      "\"They are the most likely to have to withdraw dollars for nonqualified expenses, and in doing so, they [would] receive a tax penalty. So there are ways to exempt emergency expenses, and that would be a fix,\" Brown said.",
      "Otherwise, she said, the upsides to the accounts are limited. \"There are other places you can save money where you won't have that tax penalty if you withdraw the funds early,\" Brown said.",
      "Taube of Nerdwallet noted that the proposed accounts' tax benefits are also questionable.",
      "\"Although they are advertised as tax-advantaged accounts, the way they work does not seem to be that different from how a taxable brokerage account would work,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That said, \"given the state of saving for children's future expenses in this country, the accounts do seem like they could help at least somewhat,\" Taube said.",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 15:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The largest buyers of $TRUMP will be rewarded with a private dinner with President Trump at his golf course in Virginia.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump's new tariffs started throttling freight traffic, the leader of trucking logistics firm Freight Technologies used an unorthodox method to try and get the president's attention.",
      "The California-based firm purchased $2 million worth of Trump Coin, the signature cryptocurrency backed by Mr. Trump. The president and his family launched Trump Coin days before he took office in January. Anyone can buy the cryptocurrency. An analytics firm says Mr. Trump's family and other backers have collected more than $300 million in transaction fees so far.",
      "Donald Quinby, Freight Technologies' chief financial officer, told CBS News that the purchase seemed like \"really the best platform for us to make a splash, to make some noise.\"",
      "\"With the Trump meme token, this was just an opportunity to really advocate for free and fair trade,\" Quinby said. \"I'm sure he likes to follow who's purchasing his coins.\"",
      "In April, the Trump family announced an \"intimate private dinner\" with the president at Mr. Trump's golf course in Virginia to reward the biggest buyers of Trump Coin, or $TRUMP. A leaderboard was created so buyers could compete with one another. Buyers eventually spent $140 million trying to secure access to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Some of the 220 leading buyers of $TRUMP received tickets to attend the dinner. Mr. Trump will also host a smaller reception for the token's top 25 holders. The guests are beneficiaries of a new opportunity to gain access and potential influence in a city with a long history of blending money and politics, experts said.",
      "\"This is really unprecedented,\" said Jessica Tillipman, a George Washington University law professor. \"This appears to be a president that could be potentially benefiting privately from something that he's doing out in the open.\"",
      "The White House pushed back hard on the notion that the gala dinner or the president's role in promoting the cryptocurrency crossed any ethical lines. Administration officials said they had not approved an initial plan suggesting top buyers of the meme coin product would receive a White House tour.",
      "\"This is a personal dinner that the president is attending on his personal time,\" a White House official told CBS News in a statement. \"The White House has absolutely nothing to do with it.\"",
      "Trump rewards cryptocurrency buyers",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is largely driven by social media buzz. They are not usually used in transactions, and are known for erratic price shifts. $TRUMP peaked at around $75 shortly after launch and plummeted to under $8 by April 2025, but soared in value after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced.",
      "Among the attendees of Thursday's dinner is Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire and the largest holder of Trump Coin. Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes, and is best known for creating the Tron blockchain. He was also the buyer who paid $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall by artist Maurizio Cattelan. Sun promptly ate the fruit.",
      "Sun was sued for fraud by the Biden administration for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" and paying celebrities to promote a crypto token his company created \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused the lawsuit as part of a broader Trump administration shift toward easing crypto enforcement.",
      "Sun also said his firm has invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. But the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency allows Sun, and other foreign buyers like him, to court access to power with little transparency.",
      "\"It's almost like the perfect kind of opaque structure for any type of foreign government or, you know, non-U.S. citizens who wanted to try to seek favor, curry favor with this particular administration,\" Tillipman\u00a0said.",
      "Experts raise concerns about conflicts of interest",
      "Tillipman compared the Trump family's foray into cryptocurrency to Hunter Biden's art sales during his father's administration.",
      "\"The argument was that [purchasers of Hunter Biden's artwork] could use it to influence\" then-President Joe Biden, she said.",
      "Like cryptocurrency, \"a lot of these types of transactions are by nature opaque because you don't know who's purchasing it. You don't know who the buyer is,\" Tillipman said. She noted that in effect, the Biden administration tried to distance the president from the transactions by saying information about the buyers and transactions would be kept secret by the gallery owner.",
      "Nonetheless, she said \"there were a lot of legitimate concerns associated with that particular dealing, as there was fear that it could be a back door to President Biden\" through a family member.",
      "\"The difference here is just the order of magnitude and the involvement of the president himself,\" Tillipman said. Hunter Biden's art netted him about $1.5 million by the end of his father's presidency, compared to the potentially far more lucrative Trump family crypto business.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" He and his eldest sons are also backing the\u00a0crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and cryptocurrency makes up about $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth, according to a\u00a0recent report.",
      "On Monday, the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. They tend to have fewer price fluctuations than meme coins, but allow for the same opacity in transactions. Some Democrats pushed back against the bill, citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings and calling for anti-corruption rules.",
      "\"This is corruption out in the open,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, on Thursday. \"The GENIUS Act will supercharge Donald Trump's ability to collect money from anybody who is seeking pardon, who wants tariff relief, who wants a criminal prosecution dropped.\"",
      "The White House has dismissed criticisms that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest.",
      "\"All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children, and I would argue, one of the many reasons that the American people reelected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Quinby found that buying the meme coin didn't immediately result in access to the president. Freight Technologies didn't make it to the leaderboard, but they are prepared to keep spending. The trucking company reported in public securities filings that their investment in $TRUMP could eventually reach $20 million, if that's what it takes to get Mr. Trump's attention. Even if they lose money on the market, Quinby thinks it was worth the risk.",
      "\"We thought the ability for us to get out there and advocate for the fair and free trade, we thought it was worth it,\" Quinby said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salt-deduction-cap-trump-big-beautiful-bill-tax-40000-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 15:03:01 -0400",
    "summary": "The budget bill passed by the House includes a provision to quadruple the state and local tax deduction, a boon for some homeowners.",
    "story": [
      "Some U.S. homeowners may soon get a sizable tax break thanks to the massive budget package that was passed by the House early Thursday.",
      "The legislation \u2014 dubbed the \u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 includes a provision that would lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000 from its current $10,000 limit. That could provide tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or who earn enough to have significant state income tax liabilities.",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced by Mr. Trump in his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to offset that legislation's tax breaks, such as its reduction in individual income tax rates. Prior to that law, there was no limit on how much in state and local taxes taxpayers could deduct from their federal income taxes.",
      "The unlimited SALT deduction had been criticized by some policy experts as mainly benefiting upper-income\u00a0homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But with real estate values surging in recent years, more homeowners around the U.S. are now getting socked with higher property taxes and bumping against the SALT deduction limit, prompting some lawmakers to call for changes to the $10,000 cap.",
      "The SALT deduction limit \"really eliminated a fairly significant deduction for most taxpayers in Massachusetts, especially given how high property taxes can be here,\" Boston tax attorney Dan Ryan told CBS News Boston.",
      "The backers of the new bill \"needed to keep Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California happy,\" which led to the negotiation for a higher SALT limit, he added.",
      "To be sure, the tax and spending bill could undergo more changes before it reaches President Trump's desk. The measure must now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already expressed opposition to certain aspects of the bill, such as Medicaid spending cuts.",
      "What is the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, and capped the deduction at $10,000 for both single and married couples. The provision covers state income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes.",
      "In 2017, the Treasury Department estimated that almost 11 million taxpayers in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey would forfeit\u00a0$323 billion in deductions\u00a0because of the new cap.",
      "Some lawmakers criticized the deduction limit for its marriage penalty, given that married couples are subject to the same SALT deduction threshold as single filers. Typically, tax provisions are more generous for married couples because they are designed to cover two individuals. For instance, the standard deduction for married couples is $30,000 in 2025, double the $15,000 standard deduction for single filers.",
      "What's changing with the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The House tax bill lifts the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, with the new threshold scheduled to take effect for the current 2025 tax year. An earlier version of the bill had proposed a $30,000 deduction limit, but some lawmakers pushed for a higher threshold to help more homeowners.",
      "The change was hailed by Republicans from high-tax congressional districts. Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said in a social media post that the increased SALT limit would ease \"the tax burden for middle-class and working families.\"",
      "\"This includes annual increases for inflation and income caps to ensure this is not a handout for the uber wealthy,\" Lawler added.",
      "The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000. Those who earn above that amount would face a phaseout, although the deduction wouldn't go lower than $10,000. Both the cap and the income limit would increase 1% per year over the next decade, according to a May 22 analysis from law firm Kutak Rock.",
      "Who could benefit from the higher SALT cap?",
      "People whose deductible expenses \u2014 including property taxes, state income taxes and mortgage interest \u2014 exceed their standard deduction could benefit from the higher SALT cap.",
      "For instance, a married couple would need those costs to surpass their 2025 standard deduction of $30,000 to take advantage of the higher SALT cap. That's because taxpayers typically claim whatever is higher \u2014 the standard deduction or their total itemized deductions \u2014 to maximize the amount they can tap to lower their federal tax liability.",
      "\"It will benefit homeowners, especially people who live in wealthier towns with higher property taxes, and higher income taxpayers,\" Ryan, the tax attorney, told CBS News Boston.",
      "High-income homeowners would be the most likely to qualify for the new deduction, with more than half of the benefit going to taxpayers making at least $400,000, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "How much would raising the SALT cap cost the U.S.?",
      "If adopted, lifting the SALT cap would result in the federal government forgoing more tax revenue, policy experts say.",
      "The $40,000 limit would result in a loss of nearly $334 billion in tax revenue over the next decade, when compared with keeping the $10,000 cap in place, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania nonpartisan group that analyzes the fiscal impact of policy.",
      "That adds to the cost of a bill that has been criticized by some experts\u00a0and lawmakers as introducing new tax breaks that could outstrip any savings in the legislation and trillions to the U.S. debt.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model \"has projected that America will face certain risk of a fiscal crisis within the next two decades, eroding household purchasing power, unless action is taken to reduce federal deficits,\" Kent Smetters, head of the group, said in a email after the House passed the budget package.",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 10:11:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Seniors are unlikely to get a break on paying taxes on their Social Security benefits, an issue that impacts more people each year.",
    "story": [
      "Republican-backed legislation approved Thursday morning by House lawmakers includes a number of\u00a0tax breaks promised by President Trump during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay. One tax break that isn't in the bill: Mr. Trump's\u00a0suggestion\u00a0last year that seniors shouldn't have to pay income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0while during an August campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
      "A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in President Trump's domestic policy bill that passed early Thursday following a dramatic all-night session.",
      "The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition. The proposed legislation, which spans more than 1,000 pages and includes a 42-page amendment with last-minute changes, would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions.",
      "The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said.",
      "Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the\u00a0Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained.",
      "\"Enhanced deduction for seniors\"",
      "Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.",
      "Called an \"enhanced deduction for seniors,\" it would be available to people who both itemize and those who take the standard deduction. That could help lower taxes for the roughly 56 million people in the U.S. who are 65 or older.",
      "But the new deduction for seniors is a limited-time break: It would be effective starting in the current 2025 tax year, but expire starting in the 2029 tax year, according to the legislation.",
      "The tax break also has an income threshold, with the full $4,000 deduction available to single filers who earn $75,000 or less and for married couples with annual incomes below $150,000. The deduction would be phased out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients \u2014 or about 27 million people \u2014 pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes\" on their benefits, Freese said.",
      "Social Security's fiscal outlook",
      "Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold.",
      "Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Those taxes directly support the Social Security and Medicare programs, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue,\u00a0according to the latest\u00a0annual report\u00a0from Social Security's board of trustees.",
      "Meanwhile, eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and of Medicare, the health insurance program for people 65 and older, according the Peter G. Peterson Institute, a think tank focusing on fiscal policy.",
      "Without that source of revenue, the trust fund for Social Security would be depleted in 2032, one year earlier than currently projected, while Medicare's trust fund would be depleted in 2030, six years earlier than forecast now, the group added.",
      "The result would be \"automatic cuts for millions of beneficiaries,\" the institute noted.",
      "Scrapping taxes on Social Security might sound appealing to many senior citizens in the near-term, but over the long term that would weaken the stability of the program, Freese said.",
      "\"We viewed it as a bait and switch,\" she said. \"You give some seniors a benefit upfront, but don't tell them that all seniors would run the risk of across-the-board cuts sooner than they would under current law.\"",

      "\"I have an opportunity to do something positive for my life,\" Badilla told CBS News. \"It feels great to be free.\"",
      "Freedom is especially meaningful to Badilla, who spent nearly a decade in federal prison for selling drugs from a housing project in New York City's Queens borough.",
      "\"The FBI agent had his gun pointed to my face,\" Badilla said of his arrest. \"...I didn't see the daylight for the next nine years.\"",
      "While in prison, Badilla earned his GED diploma. And while getting out of prison may have been the end of his sentence, it was the beginning of a different kind of struggle.",
      "\"When you come out of prison, you feel like all the doors are locked,\" Badilla said. \"Nobody wants to give you a job.\"",
      "Nationwide, six out of every 10 formerly incarcerated people are still jobless four years after getting out of prison, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Close to 70% will end up back in prison, according to numbers from the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, a problem called recidivism.",
      "Badilla said that while in prison, seeing \"a lot\" of ex-felons who were rearrested \"also helped me wake up.\"",
      "Following his release, Badilla entered the Commercial Driver's License Workforce Development Program, a pilot program that is a partnership between the New York City's Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice, and Emerge Career, a tech company, that trains formerly incarcerated people who are considered low-risk for trucking jobs. It helps them get a commercial driver's license and connects them with trucking companies in states across the U.S.",
      "For incarcerated people who participate in initiatives that combine education and job training, the odds of returning to prison drop by 43%, according to a 2013 study by the nonprofit research group RAND.",
      "\"When you put more barriers in somebody's pathway, they don't see a way to actually make an honest living and that doesn't benefit them, but it also really doesn't benefit society,\" Deanna Logan, director of the Mayor's Office for Criminal Justice, told CBS News. \"They paid their debt to society and now they need to come back.\"",
      "Logan said the trucking industry provides a promising on-ramp to the labor market while filling a critical need in the American supply chain.",
      "\"We looked at what was lucrative and accessible to people who are coming back from incarceration,\" Logan said. \"We don't have enough people who are skilled, and it's a very skilled profession...It gave [the formerly incarcerated] a really big opportunity to be part of the communities that they knew they did harm to.\"",
      "While the program may raise eyebrows for some New Yorkers who are skeptical of how their taxpayer dollars are being spent, Logan pointed to the impact of giving formerly incarcerated people a second chance to help drive the economy in their communities.",
      "\"If I have you incarcerated on Rikers, I have to pay for [the] facility, the officers, the food,\" she said. \"Whereas, when I take a person and give them opportunity, they pay taxes. So now, we as a society are getting taxpayer revenue from a person that is not in a box on a shelf.\"",

      "\"Our people are just looking for someone that believes in them and someone that can give them a legit chance,\" Orchingwa told CBS News. \"These are people that \u2014 for the most part \u2014 have not had a fair shot for being able to be successful and contributing citizens. They just need that one opportunity that's going to support them.\"",
      "In the 2024 fiscal year, 94% of participants in the training program graduated, according to data provided by Emerge Career. All of those graduates received job offers with an average starting salary of $75,000 per year, the company said.",
      "Since the trucking program launched, 260 formerly incarcerated people have completed it.",
      "Orchingwa emphasized that the training program provides its participants with more than just a paycheck, but a sense of purpose.",

    "summary": "Federal judge strikes down government regulations requiring most U.S. employers to accommodate workers for abortions.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge David Joseph of the Western District of Louisiana was a victory for conservative lawmakers and religious groups who decried the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision to include abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed in December 2022.",
      "The EEOC's decision swiftly prompted several lawsuits and eroded what had been strong bipartisan support for the law designed to strengthen the rights of pregnant workers.",
      "Joseph, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations. His ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.",
      "Joseph sided with the plaintiffs' argument that if Congress had intended for abortion to be covered by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, \"It would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time.\"",
      "Mississippi and Louisiana have near-total bans on abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person or in cases of a rape that has been reported to law enforcement in Mississippi, and when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality in Louisiana.",
      "Bipartisan support for pregnant workers law",
      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support after a decade-long campaign by women's right advocates, who hailed it as a win for low-wage pregnant workers who have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job.",
      "The federal law applies to employers with 15 or more employees.",
      "While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from firing pregnant workers, the law did little to guarantee that women would receive accommodations they might need at work. As a result, many women were forced to keep working under unsafe conditions, or were forced to take unpaid leave by employers who refused to accommodate their needs.",
      "But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions. The EEOC's commissioners approved the rules in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with both Republican commissioners voting against it.",
      "Joseph vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a \"related medical condition\" of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand.",
      "\"Victory! A federal court has granted Louisiana's request to strike down an EEOC rule requiring employers to accommodate employees' purely elective abortions. This is a win for Louisiana and for life!\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press.",
      "A Better Balance, the advocacy group that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for passage of the law, condemned the ruling.",
      "\"This court's decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women's rights and reproductive freedom,\" A Better Balance President Inimai Chettiar said in a statement.",
      "EEOC adrift",
      "Wednesday's ruling comes as the Trump administration has moved to impose tumultuous changes at the EEOC that will almost certainly lead the agency to eventually rewrite the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regulations.",
      "President Trump fired two of the EEOC's democratic commissioners before their terms ended, paving the way for him to establish a Republican majority and make major policy changes on how to interpret and enforce the nation's workplace civil rights laws.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump's move left EEOC without the quorum needed to make key decisions, including rescinding or revising regulations. The president tapped an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida, Brittany Panuccio, to fill one of the vacancies. If she confirmed by the Senate, the EEOC will regain its quorum.",
      "Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who voted against the regulations because of the abortion provision, has said she will work to change them.",
      "Similar lawsuits challenging the abortion provision are underway, including one filed by 17 states, led by Tennessee and Arkansas. In February, an appeals court ruled that lawsuit could proceed, overturning a lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Justice Department had defended the EEOC against those lawsuits but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so under the Trump administration. The Justice Department did not reply to request for comment on Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Chettiar said the Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the ruling, adding to its significance.",
      "\"The impact of this is huge,\" Chettiar said in an interview with The Associated Press, calling the decision \"symbolic and a big signal of where the right is when it comes to the rights of women.\"",

Moody's on Friday highlighted the government's growing debt pile in its decision to\u00a0downgrade the U.S. credit rating. A weaker credit rating raises borrowing costs for the U.S.",
      "\"We do not think that the downgrade matters by itself,\" Bank of America strategists wrote in a report, \"but it has served as a wake up call for those investors who had been ignoring the ongoing fiscal discussion.\"",
      "Stocks were also feeling pressure from higher Treasury yields in the bond market, which can weigh on other types of investments. Bond prices have dipped because of concerns that a move in Congress to extend tax cuts could add trillions to the federal debt.",
      "\"The bulk of the bill simply extends existing [tax] rates rather than lowering them incrementally,\" Crisafulli said. \"In addition, there are some offsets that could financially harm lower-income Americans. Most important, the legislation is massively expensive and will add further to the debt/deficit at a time when both are already extremely unbalanced.\"",

    "story": [
      "West Point, N.Y. \u2013 President Trump used his first military commencement address since returning to office to congratulate the cadets at West Point for their achievements and take credit for the United States' military power.",
      "\"You will become officers in the greatest and most powerful Army the world has ever known,\" Mr. President said, \"And I know because I rebuilt the Army and I rebuilt the military, and we rebuilt it like nobody had ever rebuilt it before.\"",
      "Wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat, the Republican president also detailed the shift in U.S. foreign policy and military intervention, something he previously addressed during his trip to the Middle East earlier this month.",
      "\"For at least two decades, political leaders from both parties have dragged our military into missions,\" Mr. Trump said, accusing leaders in the past of sending soldiers into \"nation-building crusades to nations that wanted to do nothing with us.\" \"It was never meant to be. It wasn't meant to be.\"",
      "The last time the president gave a speech at the U.S. Military Academy came amid nationwide reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.

      "Five years later, West Point is complying with the second Trump administration's executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, programs in the military. In February, the U.S. military academy disbanded a dozen cadet clubs formed around race and gender, including the Asian-Pacific Forum Club, the National Society of Black Engineers Club, and the Society of Women Engineers Club.",

      "Mr. Trump also said that his administration achieved a new record in peacetime recruiting record.",
      "\"Today, morale in the Armed Forces is soaring to the highest levels in many decades after years of recruiting shortfalls, and we had years and years of recruiting shortfalls. And just last year was the worst of all, the last year of the Biden administration,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And right now, just less than a year later, we just set a brand new peacetime recruiting record.\"",
      "CBS News has found that military records show enlistments began rebounding from a pandemic slump long before Election Day. While numbers have continued to rise under Mr. Trump, experts say the so-called \"Trump Bump\" \u2014 a term used by Hegseth \u2014 is more likely the result of recruitment reforms introduced during former President Joe Biden's term.",
      "Mr. Trump's address comes a day after Vice President JD Vance, a Marine veteran, spoke at the U.S. Naval Academy and emphasized the administration's shift in foreign policy against forever wars and open-ended conflicts. No longer would the U.S. send the military on missions unless there was a \"specific set of goals in mind,\" he told the graduates.",
      "Ahead of Memorial Day, Vance also reflected on the sacrifice of service members. He shared the story of Major Megan McClung, 34, who served alongside him in Iraq and was killed by a roadside bomb.",
      "\"She was an officer I served with who was bright, tough and incredibly dedicated to her job,\" Vance said.",

      "The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge's order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely \"lacked any semblance of due process.\"",
      "Mexico has since returned him to Guatemala, where he is in hiding, according to court documents. An earlier court proceeding determined that the man, identified by the initials O.C.G., risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala, but he also feared returning to Mexico. He presented evidence of being raped and held for ransom there while seeking asylum in the U.S.",
      "Court documents stated the Guatemalan man said he was only told about his deportation to Mexico, essentially as it was happening and that he begged to speak to his attorney but was denied.",
      "\"No one has ever suggested that O.C.G. poses any sort of security threat,\" Murphy wrote. \"In general, this case presents no special facts or legal circumstances, only the banal horror of a man being wrongfully loaded onto a bus and sent back to a country where he was allegedly just raped and kidnapped.\"",
      "O.C.G. entered the U.S. in March 2024, without prior authorization, according to court documents. The man said he had asked for asylum, was denied an interview and was deported shortly thereafter to Guatemala. In April 2024, O.C.G. decided to try again and crossed Mexico where, he said, he was raped and held hostage until a family member paid ransom.",
      "In May 2024, he arrived in the U.S. and was referred to an asylum officer after expressing fear of return to Guatemala. The officer determined he had had a credible fear of persecution or torture and initiated withholding-only proceedings. Two days later, he was sent to Mexico, court documents show.",
      "A message seeking comment was left with the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Murphy's order adds to a string of findings by federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations. Those have included other deportations to third countries and the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran who had lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years working and raising a family.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. from a notorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House's claim that it couldn't retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him. Both the White House and the El Salvadoran president have said they are powerless to return him. The Trump administration has tried to invoke the state secrets privilege, arguing that releasing details in open court - or even to the judge in private \u2013 about returning Abrego Garcia to the United States would jeopardize national security.",
      "In his Friday ruling, Murphy nodded to the dispute over the verb \"facilitate\" in that case and others, saying that returning O.C.G. to the U.S. is not that complicated.",
      "\"The Court notes that 'facilitate' in this context should carry less baggage than in several other notable cases,\" he wrote. \"O.C.G. is not held by any foreign government. Defendants have declined to make any argument that facilitating his return would be costly, burdensome, or otherwise impede the government's objectives.\"",

    "summary": "On May 1, the Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter nearby, causing two planes to abort landings at D.C.'s Reagan National Airport.",
    "story": [
      "Military air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter as it neared the Pentagon on a flight that caused two commercial jets to abort their landings in early May at a Washington airport, the Army confirmed to CBS News Friday.",
      "An Army official confirmed that on May 1, the Pentagon tower lost contact with the Black Hawk helicopter for about 20 seconds as it was coming to land.",
      "FAA air traffic controllers at the airport aborted the landing of a Delta Air Lines Airbus A319 during the Black Hawk's initial flight toward the Pentagon because they realized both aircraft would be nearing the Pentagon around the same time, Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman, the head of Army aviation, told the Associated Press in an exclusive interview.",
      "Because of the 20-second loss of contact, the Pentagon's tower did not clear the Black Hawk to land, so the helicopter circled the Pentagon a second time. That's when air traffic controllers at the airport decided to abort the landing of a second jet, a Republic Airways Embraer E170, because they did not have a confident fix on the Black Hawk's location, Braman said.",
      "The Army said in a news release Friday evening that the cause of the lost contact with the Black Hawk is thought to be that a temporary antenna was in a location that did not maintain contact with the helicopter as it was coming in to land at the Pentagon. The Army said its initial review \"found no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic.\"",
      "Braman told the AP that the antenna was set up during construction of a new control tower and has now been moved to the roof of the Pentagon.",
      "The Army said the aircraft's location was continuously broadcast throughout its flight through its Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast (ADS-B) Out system.",
      "In initial reporting on the aborted landings, an FAA official suggested the Army helicopter was on a \"scenic route.\" But the ADSB-Out data, which the Army shared with the AP on Friday, shows the crew hewed closely to its approved flight path \u2014 directly up the I-395 highway corridor, which is called Route 5, then rounding the Pentagon.",
      "Reagan National Airport air traffic controllers had directed \"go-arounds\" for the two commercial aircraft \"out of an apparent abundance of caution,\" the Army said in its statement. The first go-around occurred before the Black Hawk arrived at the Pentagon helipad and resulted from \"an issue with sequencing of air traffic by DCA Tower,\" according to the Army, and the second occurred during the Black Hawk's subsequent traffic pattern and was based on \"conflicting positional data from legacy tracking systems.\"",
      "Braman said federal air traffic controllers inside the Washington airport also didn't have a good fix on the location of the helicopter. The Black Hawk was transmitting data that should have given controllers its precise location, but Braman said FAA officials told him in meetings last week that the data the controllers were getting from multiple feeds and sensors was inconclusive, with some of it deviating by as much as three-quarters of a mile.",
      "\"It certainly led to confusion of air traffic control of where they were,\" Braman said.",
      "The Black Hawk was not carrying any passengers.",
      "The aborted landings on May 1, first reported by the AP, added to general unease about continued close calls between government helicopters and commercial airplanes near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after a deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people.",
      "In March, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that helicopters would be permanently restricted from flying on the same route where the collision occurred. After the May 1 incident, the Army paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon as it works with the FAA to address safety issues.",
      "The FAA declined to comment on whether its controllers were unable to get a good fix on the Black Hawk's location because of their own equipment issues, citing the ongoing crash investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "The NTSB Chairman Jennifer Homendy told CBS News on Friday that the agency was not briefed on the Army's findings and only learned about them after reading the report from the Associated Press.",
      "\"The NTSB is leading this investigation,\" Homendy told CBS News. \"That is well known. It is disappointing \u2014 frankly, shocking \u2014 that the Army would choose to release what is clearly investigative information through a media exclusive rather than provide it directly to us.\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is pushing to have the agency modernize its air traffic control systems and equipment, which has failed controllers responsible for Newark Liberty Internal Airport's airspace at critical moments in recent weeks.",

      "President Trump said this week he may take home lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, winding down 17 years of federal control over two central parts of the U.S. housing market \u2014 a move that was cheered on by Trump ally and noted Wall Street investor Bill Ackman.",
      "Ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 which guarantee trillions of dollars worth of mortgages \u2014 would be complicated, and critics say it's risky. A plan to do so in Mr. Trump's first term did not come to pass. But the president says he'll decide \"in the near future\" whether to try again, pointing to the firms' return to profitability since their 2008 government takeover.",
      "\"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing very well, throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social late Wednesday \u2014 prompting a double-digit rally in shares the next day of both Fannie and Freddie, which trade over the counter rather than on a major stock exchange.",
      "The idea of taking the two government-sponsored enterprises public has drawn some support for years, with advocates arguing Fannie and Freddie could function better if released from federal control. Releasing Fannie and Freddie could also benefit some investors who have bought shares in the firms over the years, betting on an eventual federal spinoff of the mortgage giants.",
      "One of the largest \u2014 and most vocal \u2014 is Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Fannie and Freddie over a decade ago. The firm is the biggest private holder of Fannie, at just over 115 million shares according to S&P Capital IQ data \u2014 worth over $1.2 billion at Friday's price. Ackman said in an earnings call Thursday that Pershing Square owns about 220 million shares in Fannie and Freddie combined.",
      "Other major holders of the two enterprises include Capital Research and Management Company, which has the largest known stake in Freddie ($350 million) and the second-largest stake in Fannie (over $1 billion), according to S&P Capital IQ. Paulson & Co., founded by billionaire John Paulson, also invested in Fannie and Freddie at one point, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 \u2014 though the size of its current stake is unclear.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was reelected last year, Ackman has publicly pushed on X to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, calling it a good deal for taxpayers that could generate as much as $300 billion for the government. In January, Pershing Square put together a presentation called \"The Art of the Deal\" that made the case in more detail.",
      "\"Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history. I am confident he will get it done,\" Ackman wrote on X in December.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced Wednesday he's \"giving very serious consideration\" to the idea, Ackman responded on X with a thumbs-up emoji. In Thursday's earnings call, Ackman said, \"[W]e're extremely encouraged by the president's announcement.\" Ackman also said Thursday the firm wasn't aware of any plans by the Trump administration to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship.",
      "Famous for his sharp-elbowed activist investing strategy and pandemic-era bets, Ackman has made waves in recent months for his political views. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2024 and has taken aim at the leadership of Harvard University over its handling of Israel-Hamas war protests.",
      "Skeptics of releasing Fannie and Freddie, like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have pushed back on the idea, warning it could benefit investors at the risk of disrupting the mortgage market.",
      "\"[The president] hasn't come to Congress with any kind of plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 and the last thing we need is to privatize them in a way that rewards Wall Street while driving up housing prices for people already struggling to buy homes,\" Warren, a Massachusetts lawmaker and the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to advance the President's mission of restoring the dream of homeownership for all Americans. Any actions under consideration will be carefully evaluated in a safe and sound manner to deliver on the President's historic agenda.\"",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square declined to comment to CBS News. FHFA \u2014 which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and why could they be privatized?",
      "The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 or, more formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \u2014 in the 20th century, with Fannie Mae dating back to the Great Depression. They essentially buy mortgages from lenders like banks and bundle them together into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors \u2014 a space known as the secondary mortgage market.",
      "The point of this work is to bring more money into the nation's residential lending system, making it easier for average families to buy a home. Fannie Mae describes itself as \"the backbone of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\"",
      "For decades, Fannie and Freddie were both publicly traded companies, though many observers believed they operated with an \"implicit guarantee\" that the government would step in if either company wobbled.",
      "But after a mortgage crisis sparked the 2008 recession, the Bush administration bailed out Fannie and Freddie and put them under federal conservatorship to save them from collapse. Since then, the FHFA has effectively controlled the two firms. That arrangement wasn't necessarily supposed to be permanent, but it has lasted for over a decade, with the two companies making billions in payments to the government.",
      "A push for the government to end its conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie has been brewing for years. Some critics view the firms as unfairly dominant in the mortgage industry and believe they fill a role that should be played by the private sector. Other supporters of privatization like Ackman argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers, partly because, in a holdover from the financial crisis, the government has the right to purchase almost 80% of both firms' shares.",
      "Opponents of privatization argue it could push up mortgage rates, especially if Fannie and Freddie are no longer viewed as backstopped by the government. How that plays out could depend on how the government decides to end the conservatorship, though, and whether it still offers some kind of guarantee. Credit agency Fitch Ratings said it would keep rating Fannie and Freddie's debt similarly to the U.S. government's debt if the firms maintain a federal backstop, but if not, they would be rated separately \u2014 and could slip if their market dominance shrinks.",
      "The risk of higher mortgage costs could be a major stumbling block in an era of elevated interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this year, \"anything that is done around a safe and sound release [of Fannie and Freddie] is going to hinge on the effect of long-term mortgage rates.\"",
      "In part for that reason, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note Friday that the firm expects the Trump administration to make changes to Fannie and Freddie at a \"slower and more deliberate\" pace than it has moved on other issues, like tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs may have impacted the stock market, but they did not result in immediate price hikes at Walmart or Dollar General. By contrast, the price of mortgages will respond to each recap and release development,\" Seiberg wrote. \"That makes the political cost more immediate and gives the President less room to alter positions as he has done on trade.\"",
      "In his first term, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department proposed ending Fannie and Freddie's conservatorship. While the first Trump administration ultimately didn't take this step, it made some changes to how the two institutions operate.",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square called releasing Fannie and Freddie the \"Unfinished Business of the First Trump Administration\" in its January presentation. The firm laid out a possible roadmap to turn Fannie and Freddie into independent publicly traded companies: It suggested holding initial public offerings by 2026 for Fannie and 2027 for Freddie, and then allowing the federal government to sell its stakes over five years.",
      "But it's unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 the Trump administration may pursue the idea. In his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, FHFA Director William Pulte said he believed that any end to government control of Fannie and Freddie needed to be \"extremely thoughtful.\"",
      "\"While their conservatorship should not be indefinite, any exit from conservatorship must be carefully planned to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market without upward pressure on mortgage rates,\" Pulte said.",

      "Four partners at Paul Weiss \u2014 including the high-profile Democratic attorney Karen Dunn \u2014 are departing the law firm, a spokesperson told CBS News, after Paul Weiss drew attention for striking a deal with President Trump to avoid targeting by the federal government.",
      "In addition to Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jessica Phillips and Jeannie Rhee are leaving the 150-year-old firm.",
      "\"On behalf of the firm, Paul Weiss is grateful to Bill, Jeannie, Jessica and Karen for their many contributions. We wish them well in all their future endeavors,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "It's not clear if the four attorneys' departures from Paul Weiss are related to the firm's agreement with Mr. Trump.",
      "Dunn co-chaired Paul Weiss's litigation department, where she is known for representing high-profile clients like Apple and Google. She's also known for her longstanding role in Democratic politics, and has helped lead debate preparations for Democratic candidates for over a decade \u2014 including for former Vice President Kamala Harris last year, The New York Times reported.",
      "Rhee \u2014 who served as managing partner of Paul Weiss's office in Washington, D.C. \u2014 previously worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election. Isaacson and Phillips served as litigators at the firm, according to their bios on Paul Weiss's website.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the four departing attorneys for comment.",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump targeted Paul Weiss with an executive order that sharply limited how the firm could interact with the government, seeking to revoke staff members' security clearances and cut off any federal contracts. The move was part of a wider gambit to punish the president's foes in the legal community, which he claims have \"played an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles.\"",
      "The president's executive order criticized Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz, who previously worked on the team of Manhattan prosecutors that investigated Mr. Trump. It also took aim at the firm \u2014 and Rhee \u2014 for\u00a0taking on a pro bono case\u00a0involving the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, and criticized Paul Weiss' diversity, equity and inclusion policies.",
      "But that order was later rescinded by Mr. Trump, who said Paul Weiss had agreed to a litany of compromises, like auditing its hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono legal services on causes that both the firm and the Trump administration agree upon.",
      "The apparent deal between the president and Paul Weiss \u2014 along with similar deals struck by other law firms threatened by Mr. Trump \u2014 proved controversial in the legal community.",
      "Some other law firms chose to sue the administration, arguing the orders were unconstitutional. Judges have struck down Mr. Trump's orders against the firms Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block \u2014 with one federal judge on Friday saying Mr. Trump's Jenner & Block order was unconstitutional and resembled a \"screed\" at some points.",

    "story": [
      "Detroit \u2014 When the National Guard has to be called out for an ice storm, as was the case in Northern Michigan at the end of March, the situation is dire.",
      "At the time, meteorologists couldn't forecast just how much of the region would be encased in ice.",
      "\"While it [the forecast] showed devastating ice, it ended up still being worse than expected,\" said Ahmad Bajjey, CBS News Detroit's chief meteorologist.",
      "Up to 1.5 inches of ice accumulated across large portions of Northern Michigan, knocking down power lines, blocking roads, and damaging homes and businesses. Last month, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer requested federal disaster aid.",
      "Bajjey said he was working without National Weather Service data he usually counts on.",
      "\"We couldn't get true real-world data as often as needed,\" Bajjey said.",
      "At least 13 of nearly 100 balloon sites were cut or reduced when the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0took aim at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration earlier this year.\u00a0  Two of them, one in Michigan and another in Wisconsin, left gaps in data.",
      "Those gaps could have helped during the March ice storm, as well as last week, when dangerous thunderstorms and tornadoes hit Wisconsin, meteorologists say.",
      "There have also been cuts in places like the Rocky Mountains in the western U.S. and \"Tornado Alley\" in the central U.S., where storms get started and move east. One balloon site was also eliminated in the Florida Panhandle\u00a0just days before the start of the Atlantic hurricane season.",
      "For the past 100 years of U.S. weather forecasting, there's no better substitute to weather balloons, meteorologists say. \u00a0 Associate professor of meteorology Dr. John Allen teaches future meteorologists at Central Michigan University. He also studies how artificial intelligence can improve forecasts.  \u00a0 But he says the data received from weather balloons is irreplaceable. He showed CBS News a device used to communicate with a weather balloon.",
      "\"So what this device is doing is reporting back every couple of seconds as we look through the whole column of the atmosphere,\" Allen said.",
      "His research in AI cannot make up for a lack of air pressure and moisture data collected by balloons.",
      "\"If we have clouds, satellites really don't tell us much about what's actually happening,\" he said, explaining why weather balloons are essential and their data cannot be duplicated by satellites or radar.",
      "In a statement to CBS on News Friday, a NOAA spokesperson defended NWS forecasting.",
      "\"The National Weather Service is committed to delivering accurate, timely, and life-saving forecasts despite speculation,\" the spokesperson said. \"Through strategic transformation, staff reallocation, and updated service standards, NWS is ensuring resilience and continuity of mission-critical functions. Reports suggesting otherwise are false and disrespectful to the many weather scientists who work tirelessly to produce the best weather data in the world.\"",
      "In the meantime, some meteorologists like Bajjey say they have no choice but to make do with new limitations.   \"This is about public safety,\" Bajjey said. \"It's every single forecast, every warning, every alert, and every update. And this is where it comes from.\"",
      "In an open letter published earlier this month, five living former NWS leaders issued a warning about the impact of staffing and program cuts to the NOAA.",

      "Some NSC staff are moving elsewhere inside the administration, but not all, the sources said. Aides were informed of some of the changes in a meeting at the White House on Friday afternoon.",
      "Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser Andy Baker is taking a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser, as is White House deputy chief of staff Robert Gabriel. Both will be deputies at NSC, three sources said. Baker will continue serving as a Vance aide, according to a White House official.",
      "About 20 people have been informed so far that they are on administrative leave, sources said. Some of the reassignments don't take place until next week, one source said.",
      "Among those leaving the NSC: Eric Trager, who had been handling the Middle East; Alex Wong, principal deputy national security adviser, who is shifting elsewhere in the administration; and Andrew Peek, who handled European matters.",
      "The NSC's communications team is also dissolving as part of the restructuring. Requests for comment were referred to the White House press team.",
      "Axios reported on some of the changes earlier Friday.",
      "\"It's terrible. Less people means less control of the bureaucracy. The key is getting people who are loyal not less people,\" one former member of the National Security Council said.",

      "\"Arguably what the NSC has done best in the last 40 years is build the post-9/11 security state and carry out the Iraq and Afghanistan wars \u2014 all of which is deeply unpopular on a bipartisan basis now,\" the former member said. \"Couple that with a Clinton-era failure to effectively manage the end of the Cold War and recognize the rise of stateless terrorism, the track record really doesn't look good.\"",
      "The sudden changes came three weeks after Rubio took over the national security adviser role, replacing Mike Waltz, who was pushed out of the post and nominated as ambassador to the United Nations. That move was driven by a perception that Waltz didn't vet staff enough, a lack of fit between Waltz and the rest of the team, and Waltz's involvement in setting up a Signal group chat that inadvertently included a reporter, CBS News reported at the time.",
      "It's the latest upheaval at Mr. Trump's NSC. Last month, at least a half dozen staffers were fired shortly after right-wing media personality Laura Loomer accused them of being insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump, CBS News previously reported.",

      "The sources said the CBP teams would also include members of the agency's Office of Field Operations, which oversees legal entry points into the U.S., and Air and Marine Operations, a specialized law enforcement unit with maritime and aerial assets.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 16:42:49 -0400",
    "summary": "It is Harvard's second suit against the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign students, hours after the Ivy League school challenged a decision by administration officials that targeted its enrollment.",
      "U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs agreed to grant Harvard's request for immediate relief and set a hearing for May 29, during which she will consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction in the case. Her order blocks the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.",
      "Her brief order said the temporary order is \"justified to preserve the status quo pending a hearing.\"",
      "The judge's intervention came hours after Harvard filed a federal lawsuit over the\u00a0Trump administration's decision to bar it from enrolling foreign students, calling it unconstitutional retaliation for defying the White House's political demands. It is the school's second suit against the Trump administration.",
      "In the lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Boston, Harvard said the government's action violates the First Amendment and will have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",
      "\"With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\" Harvard said in its suit.",
      "Harvard enrolls almost 6,800 foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Most are graduate students and they come from more than 100 countries.",
      "The school had said it planned to file for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out the move, which the department announced on Thursday. It accused Harvard of creating an unsafe campus environment by allowing \"anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators\" to assault Jewish students on campus. It also accused Harvard of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, contending the school had hosted and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024.",
      "The White House lashed out at the judge's ruling Friday.",
      "\"The American people elected President Trump \u2013 not random local judges with their own liberal agenda \u2013 to run the country,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. \"These unelected judges have no right to stop the Trump Administration from exercising their rightful control over immigration policy and national security policy.\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the action against Harvard will \"serve as a warning\" to other universities.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its governance over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to combat antisemitism. He said Harvard would not budge on \"its core, legally-protected principles\" over fears of retaliation. Harvard has said it will respond at a later time to allegations first raised by House Republicans about coordination with the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "The threat to Harvard's international enrollment stems from an April 16 request from Noem, who demanded that Harvard provide information about foreign students that might implicate them in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation.",
      "Noem said Harvard can regain its ability to host foreign students if it produces a trove of records on foreign students within 72 hours. Her updated request demands all records, including audio or video footage, of foreign students participating in protests or dangerous activity on campus.",
      "\"The government has claimed that its destructive action is based on Harvard's failure to comply with requests for information from the US Department of Homeland Security. In fact, Harvard did respond to the Department's requests as required by law,\" Garber said in a statement Friday to members of the Harvard community.",
      "\"The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body,\" he said.",
      "\"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,\" Garber said.",
      "An earlier suit from the university challenged more than $2 billion in federal cuts imposed by the Republican administration. That suit came after weeks of escalation between the Trump administration and Harvard, which had rejected the administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard, while Mr. Trump had suggested the IRS strip Harvard of its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.",
      "The lawsuit, which Burroughs is also overseeing, alleged the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding and claimed that the withholding of funds is \"part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "China's government said Friday that the Trump administration's move to ban foreign students from Harvard would harm the United States' international standing. Chinese students make up a large part of Harvard's international student population, with 1,203 coming from China in 2024.",
      "Some of Harvard's sports teams would be virtually wiped out by the Trump administration's decision. Large portions of the men's rowing and squash and women's soccer and golf rosters list international hometowns on the school's website. Sportico reported last month that 21% of the players on Harvard athletic rosters for the 2024-25 season had international hometowns.",

    "summary": "A district court judge had ordered DOGE to turn over information to a government watchdog group about its operations and personnel.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted Friday lower court orders that required the White House's Department of Government Efficiency to turn over information to a government watchdog group as part of a lawsuit that tests whether President Trump's cost-cutting task force has to comply with federal public records law.",
      "Roberts issued a temporary administrative stay of two orders entered by a federal district court in Washington, D.C., which directed DOGE to turn over records related to it operations and personnel and required its acting administrator, Amy Gleason, to sit for a deposition.",
      "The chief justice's order allows the Supreme Court more time to consider the Trump administration's request for emergency relief, which was filed with the high court earlier this week. Deadlines set by the district judge required DOGE to turn over documents by June 3 and for Gleason's deposition to be completed by June 13.",
      "The dispute before the court stems from a Freedom of Information Act request made by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington that sought information about DOGE, its operations and personnel. The watchdog group went on to file a federal lawsuit based on that FOIA request, and, as part of the suit, sought categories of information through the discovery process about DOGE's activities since President Trump took office.",
      "Among the information CREW is seeking is a deposition with Gleason, who the White House has said is the acting administrator of DOGE; a list of federal contracts or grants that DOGE personnel recommended for cancellation; and the names of all current and former DOGE employees, as well as details of their employment and who oversees them.",
      "The watchdog group has argued that DOGE wields \"substantial independent authority,\" which makes it a de facto agency that is subject to FOIA and the Federal Records Act. But the Justice Department disagrees and asserts that DOGE is a presidential advisory body that makes recommendations to the president and federal agencies on matters that are important to Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "The district court granted most of CREW's request for information, including deposing Gleason. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper found that DOGE is likely subject to FOIA and said that the task force's actions demonstrate that it has \"substantial authority over vast swathes of the federal government.\"",
      "A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., declined to halt the district court's discovery order, finding that it is \"narrow\" and appropriate.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order establishing DOGE when he returned to the White House for a second term. The task force is leading his initiative to shrink the size of the federal government. That plan has included large-scale layoffs at federal departments, and the shuttering of several agencies, though the efforts have been the focus of legal wrangling.",
      "The president has repeatedly said that Elon Musk, the billionaire leader of Tesla and SpaceX, is the head of DOGE, though Justice Department lawyers have\u00a0said in court filings\u00a0that he is not an employee of the task force and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "Questions about Musk's role with DOGE led the White House to\u00a0declare Gleason\u00a0as its acting administrator. She worked as a senior adviser to the U.S. Digital Service, the precursor to DOGE.",

      "The total cost of Homan's security \u2014 with roughly $500,000 in salaries for agents plus airfare, hotel bills and other travel expenses for his protective bubble \u2014 adds up to around $1 million per month for the Trump appointee, another administration official said.",
      "Homan declined to comment on Friday.",
      "\"DHS ensures our leaders are safe and protected,\" Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News Friday, citing \"dangerous rhetoric\" from politicians and activists surrounding the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts that result in an increase in assaults and doxxing, exposing someone's identifying information online.",
      "\"We will continue to take measures to ensure Mr. Homan and his family are safe,\" McLaughlin added. The Department of Homeland Security declined to confirm the cost.",
      "Homan is trailed by a rotating detail of special agents from DHS's investigative arm, known as Homeland Security Investigations or HSI, according to one of the sources, who added that roughly 30 agents trade off to provide round-the-clock protection to Homan. That would add up to about $12 million by year's end.",
      "The protection for Homan \u2014 which includes a security detail at his home, when he drives to his offices in the White House West Wing and at Immigration and Customs Enforcement's D.C. headquarters, or when he is out in public \u2014 is paid for by DHS.",
      "Homan, one of the faces of Mr. Trump's pledge to conduct the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, has drawn threats from those who want to cause him harm, two of the sources familiar with his situation said.",
      "Homeland Security Investigations has performed an intelligence threat assessment to gauge the risk to the border czar.",
      "The question is whether he needs as much security as he has requested, said three of the sources, who requested anonymity in order to speak about sensitive security matters.",
      "One administration official described the personnel and money funneled to Homan's security detail as \"extravagant,\" adding they \"sucked resources away from other senior leadership, including other cabinet members.\"",
      "The border czar at times travels in a four-vehicle motorcade \u2014 more cars than the two-car package cabinet members typically use.",
      "During the Biden administration, the Trump campaign asked for protection for Homan but it was rejected, according to multiple sources.",
      "Not every administration official who deals with public criticism is granted government-paid security.",
      "The expense for officials with protection usually hits the higher range if they're required to travel for their job.",
      "The details for former Trump national security advisers John Bolton and Robert O'Brien, who were guarded by the U.S. Secret Service under the Biden administration, cost about $12 million a year, records show. During Mr. Trump's first term, U.S. Marshals Service protection for Education Secretary Betsy Devos ranged annually from about $5 million to just under $8 million.",
      "Homan frequently appears on television and in other media interviews, increasing his public profile \u2014 and he doesn't mince words when it comes to the administration's views on illegal immigration. He has argued for arresting U.S. citizens who knowingly harbor people who are in the country illegally or impede law enforcement efforts, and has called for drug cartels, which he said have an influence in southern border states, to be \"wiped off the face of the earth.\"",
      "In November, Homan said that he began receiving death threats soon after Mr. Trump announced he'd appoint him to be border czar. He told Fox News' \"Fox and Friends\" in February that he requires around-the-clock protection. \"I got state troopers around my house 24-7 right now because of death threats,\" Homan said.",

      "The White House says the orders the president approved Friday will help ensure American energy dominance and provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to the country. The four\u00a0nuclear energy\u00a0executive actions the president signed Friday will speed up nuclear reactor testing at Department of Energy laboratories and expedite applications, officials said. The orders will also clear a path for the Department of Energy and the Pentagon to build nuclear reactors on federally owned land, overhaul the Nuclear Reactor Commission and encourage uranium mining and enrichment.",
      "\"The first tranche of EOs relates to nuclear energy where President Trump is taking truly historic action to usher in the American nuclear renaissance,\" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, in a call with reporters Friday morning.",
      "Nuclear energy accounts for roughly one-fifth of the nation's power.",

      "\"Energy security is national security,\" said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, adding that troops need reliable energy.",
      "Kratsios said the U.S. has been the world leader in nuclear innovation in the past, but that in the last three decades, has only started and built two reactors.

And, after an all-night session, the measure, entitled the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" squeaked through by a single vote.",
      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 18 and 65, and those who do not have a child under the age of 7.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "The legislation also adds annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners: $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

    "story": [
      "The House Republicans' campaign arm is focusing a new advertising campaign on Democrats from politically risky seats who voted against the GOP's sweeping effort to cut taxes and pass Medicaid work requirements, setting the stage for what may prove to be one of the biggest political messaging clashes of next year's midterms.",
      "Republicans in Washington are attempting to use their control of Congress and the White House to put in place major conservative agenda items sought by President Trump and his allies through one massive piece of legislation, titled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\" The House GOP's narrow passage of Mr. Trump's agenda earlier this week has set off a struggle between Republicans and Democrats to sway voters about the impact of the bill that is widely expected to play a large role in the 2026 midterm elections, where control of the House will be decided.",
      "In a statement about the advertising campaign, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella said the campaign arm \"will make sure voters don't forget how [House Democrats] betrayed working families.\"",
      "The round of digital advertisements places a particular emphasis on the tax portion of the Trump agenda bill, which continues key parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was the centerpiece of his first term in office. Plans show the ads will target 25 House Democrats and make the argument that by opposing this week's bill, the Democrats voted \"for the largest U.S. tax hike in generations.\" Of those 25 districts, 13 are seats where a Democrat won the House contest while Mr. Trump carried the district in the presidential race.",
      "Republicans' best chance at padding their narrow majority next year could come in places that had some of the closest Congressional races in the entire country during the 2024 presidential election, including a California seat where the Democratic candidate ousted a Republican incumbent by less than 200 votes. Other areas closely watched by the GOP that are also the subject of the latest ad campaign include two Democrat-held seats in the red state of Ohio, districts Mr. Trump won in the battleground states of North Carolina and Michigan, as well as seats that could prove to be competitive in New York, New Jersey and New Mexico.",
      "Yet while many House Republicans in Washington are cheering the legislation, Democrats see ample political liabilities for their opponents. Democratic leaders view the House as the party's best chance at quickly winning back power in Washington during Mr. Trump's presidency, given the perils an incumbent president's party routinely faces in a midterm election and the small number of seats it would likely take to flip control of the chamber.",
      "The GOP's targeting of Medicaid in particular has quickly been seized on by the left as a major campaign issue, as Democrats charge the Republican agenda's changes imperil healthcare for millions of people.",
      "\"America cannot afford the Republican tax scam. Now that vulnerable Republicans are on the record voting for it, this betrayal of the American people will cost them their jobs in the midterms and Republicans the House Majority come 2026,\" Washington Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, said in a statement earlier this week.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 11:01:46 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has overseen a wide-ranging effort to restructure the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday continued to block the Trump administration from moving forward with its plans to lay off thousands of government workers at more than 20 federal agencies, providing federal employees a lifeline as a legal challenge to President Trump's bid to restructure the federal government moves forward.",
      "The preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston covers 21 federal agencies and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency and prevents them from implementing reductions-in-force, placing employees on administrative leave and proceeding with job cuts that are already in motion.",
      "The judge, who sits on the federal court in San Francisco, also barred agencies from implementing any orders by the Elon Musk-led DOGE to cut programs or staff in connection with an executive order signed by President Trump in February that seeks to transform the executive branch. The agencies affected include the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, as well as AmeriCorps and the Social Security Administration, among others.",
      "While Illston also granted retrospective relief by ordering federal agencies to rescind any reductions-in-force, or layoffs, issued under the president's February directive and to reinstate government workers who were put on administrative leave, she paused those components of her decision while the administration pursues an appeal.",
      "The Justice Department informed the court on Friday that it will be asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to review Illston's decision.",
      "In a 51-page ruling, Illston wrote that presidents do have the authority to seek changes to federal agencies, and nine presidents have over the last century sought to reorganize the executive branch \u2014 but only after obtaining approval from Congress.",
      "\"Presidents may set policy priorities for the executive branch, and agency heads may implement them. This much is undisputed,\" the judge said. \"But Congress creates federal agencies, funds them, and gives them duties that \u2014 by statute \u2014 they must carry out. Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a president may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.\"",
      "She said that the plaintiffs in the case, which are labor unions, nonprofit organizations and local governments, are likely to succeed on their claim that Mr. Trump's executive order usurps Congress's constitutional powers and exceeds his authority.",
      "\"Put simply, in this case, defendants want the court to either declare that nine presidents and twenty-one Congresses did not properly understand the separation of powers, or ignore how the executive branch is implementing large-scale reductions in force and reorganizations. The court can do neither,\" Illston wrote.",
      "Illston had issued a two-week temporary restraining order on May 9 that directed the Trump administration to pause its plans to lay off vast swaths of the federal workforce. That temporary order was set to expire Friday. Her preliminary injunction now extends the initial block on the administration's restructuring of the federal government as the case proceeds.",
      "The Trump administration already asked the Supreme Court earlier this month to allow it to move forward with its reductions-in-force, seeking emergency relief in a request that arose out of Illston's temporary restraining order. The high court has not yet acted on that bid, though the Justice Department will likely ask the Supreme Court to lift Illston's injunction.",
      "Mr. Trump's February executive order directed agencies to make plans to initiate \"large -scale\" reductions in force as part of his initiative to slash the size of the federal government. On the heels of the president's directive, the Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget issued a memo directing agencies to submit plans for two phases of job cuts, due March 13 and April 14.",
      "The Trump administration has said in filings that 40 reductions-in-force at 17 agencies were in progress but blocked by Illston's May 9 order. The plans target\u00a0thousands of federal workers, including up to 10,000 at the Department of Health and Human Services, 8,500 at the Energy Department and half of the workforce at the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. The Department of Veterans Affairs has said it intends to slash 83,000 positions.",
      "The reductions-in-force are separate from the mass terminations of probationary workers, who generally were in their positions for one or two years. But those firings, which took place in February, have also been the focus of lawsuits.",
      "Mr. Trump's government-shrinking efforts began shortly after he returned to the White House. The president created DOGE, a cost-cutting task force led by Musk, and his administration has taken steps to dismantle agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",

    "summary": "Mothers and relatives of the Venezuelan detainees in CECOT have been communicating about their loved ones in a WhatsApp group.",
    "story": [
      "On May 18, relatives of the Venezuelan migrant detainees in El Salvador's mega prison CECOT, announced to a WhatsApp group the death of Marlene Ramirez, a grandmother who raised one of the men currently detained there, Jonathan Mendoza Ramirez. Her family said she had died of a heart attack, unable to endure the emotional stress of not being able to communicate with her grandson. She could no longer take it, they said.",
      "Since the Trump administration in March removed a group of Venezuelan migrants alleged to be gang members to El Salvador for indefinite detention, a WhatsApp virtual community has come into being, made up largely of mothers of the detainees. The group grew one by one, as the mothers found out about their sons' whereabouts, largely from videos posted on social media by the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. The videos showed the Venezuelan men arriving from the U.S. in shackles, being frog-marched off the plane and into CECOT. Inside the prison, they were forced to kneel as their heads were shaved by guards.",
      "\"I can't recount these videos or else I fall into a serious depression,\" said Jetzy Arteaga, the creator of the WhatsApp group. Her son, Carlos Ca\u00f1izalez Arteaga, is one of the Venezuelan migrants\u00a0transferred to CECOT in March. \"I try to block them, so that I can go on about my day, but only a mother in this situation can understand why these images hurt so much.\" On days when she can't keep the images out of her thoughts, Arteaga says she can't get out of bed and turns to other mothers in the group chat.",
      "\"When one of us is down, we go to their house, run their errands and pick up their other kids from school,\" says Arteaga. \"They're all over Venezuela, and I understand that today, it might be them needing help, but tomorrow it might be me in the hospital.\"",
      "Arteaga created the group to communicate with other mothers because she says she needed answers. \"I was in a state of disbelief, and I was waiting for the U.S. government to say my son was transferred by mistake,\" said Arteaga. \"The U.S. is a country that follows their laws, and when their investigation concludes my son is not a gang member, they'll release him.\"",
      "Records that prove his lack of criminal gang activity in Venezuela, however, have not led to Carlos' release. The group says it has grown and now includes relatives of 170 of the migrant men detained in El Salvador.",
      "\"The first thing I do every morning is check the group chat, and we ask for updates and prayers,\" said Analia Burbano, whose nephew Victor Andres Ortega Burbano, is being held in CECOT. She says she constantly scrolls through social media to see if there are any updates or photos of her nephew in prison.",
      "Burbano says she is now speaking on behalf of her nephew because his mother is emotionally and physically unable to do so. \"Ever since she saw the video of Victor at CECOT, she fell into a depression, does not get up from bed, does not eat and cries every day,\" said Burbano. \"She is very frail.\"",
      "Burbano says her nephew's arrest and transfer came as a surprise, since Ortega had been granted Temporary Protected Status that allowed him to legally work in the U.S. According to immigration documents reviewed by CBS News, Ortega's TPS was approved for June 2024 through last month, in April.",
      "The group frequently makes trips to Miramar, Venezuela, to pressure officials to demand the release and deportation of the men back to their country. The chat serves as a venue to plan the next protest or opportunity to publicize the men's plight at events like those held by the United Nations.",
      "\"We all have our ups and downs, but through this process, we make sure that none of us let the negative thoughts linger for long,\" said Anyi Yohana Casares Jimenez, mother of Jason Alfredo Silva Casares. On March 13, Jimenez says she received the last call from her son, desperately asking her to send over documents proving he didn't have a criminal record in Venezuela. She never heard from him again.",
      "Jason showed up at the U.S. southern border in August 2024 after receiving an appointment through the CBP One app, but remained in detention because immigration agents were suspicious of his crown tattoo, according to his mother. \"There's not a day that I don't search social media for any new videos of him inside CECOT.\"",
      "The three mothers all claim their sons are not part of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, but they do fault the men's tattoos for causing their imprisonment.",
      "\"It was the argument I always had with my son,\" said Arteaga. \"I always asked what his need for a tattoo was.\" Her son tattooed his mother's name \"Jetzy\" on his wrist, a tattoo that now serves as evidence of gang affiliation, according to court documents.",
      "It's now been more than two months since these men were taken to El Salvador and the U.S. government continues to deport anyone who is in the country illegally after President Trump promised to deport \"the worst of the worst\".",
      "\"All we can do is trust that this nightmare will soon end,\" said Burbano.",

      "Peter Wang, a member of this year's West Point class, was just 15 years old when he was among the 17 killed in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. He was found dead in a third-floor hallway, wearing his Army JROTC uniform.",

      "For his actions, Peter was posthumously awarded the Medal of Heroism by the U.S. Army, the highest award given to Army JROTC and ROTC cadets whose performance \"involved the acceptance of danger and extraordinary responsibilities.\" Junior ROTC cadets Alaina Petty and Martin Duque, who were also killed during the shooting, also received the medal.",

      "The Trump administration has launched an operation to terminate the immigration court cases of certain migrants, in order to arrest them and place them in a fast-tracked deportation process instead, government officials and attorneys told CBS News.",
      "Lawyers and advocates this week reported arrests of migrants outside of immigration courthouses across the U.S., saying teams of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers had detained individuals whose cases in front of immigration judges had just been terminated at the request of the government.",
      "Two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News that ICE is conducting an operation to expedite the deportation of migrants with court hearings scheduled in the near future. It's the latest step taken by the Trump administration to dramatically ramp up immigration arrests across the country and fulfill what the president has promised will be the largest deportation campaign in American history.",
      "The operation involves ICE prosecutors asking immigration judges to terminate the court cases of certain migrants, so agents at the agency can instead arrest those individuals and place them in a more rapid deportation process known as \"expedited removal,\" the officials said.",
      "Unlike immigration court proceedings, which can take years to complete due to a massive backlog of 4 million pending cases, the expedited removal process allows officials to more quickly deport migrants, if their cases satisfy certain conditions.",
      "Migrants who lack proper documents and can't prove they have been in the U.S. for more than two years are eligible to be deported under expedited removal, without a court hearing.",
      "Historically, officials were only allowed to use expedited removal on unauthorized immigrants detained within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks. But the Trump administration vastly expanded its scope soon after taking office.",
      "Expedited removal can also be applied to unauthorized migrants who entered the U.S. with the government's permission at legal entry points, and there's no two-year entry limit for those cases. That would place the nearly 1 million migrants who entered the U.S. under a Biden administration program known as CBP One at risk of being targeted by the new ICE operation.",
      "While those placed in expedited removal can be deported without a hearing in immigration court, they are entitled to an interview with an asylum officer if they say they are afraid of being persecuted in their home country. If they pass those screenings, they get a chance to plead their case in immigration court.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin faulted the Biden administration for releasing many migrants with notices to appear in immigration court, instead of trying to deport them quickly through expedited removal.",
      "\"ICE is now following the law and placing these illegal aliens in expedited removal, as they always should have been,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "Leandro Ferrer, an immigration lawyer based in Phoenix, Arizona, said his clients, two Cuban migrants, appear to have been swept up in the ICE operation when they showed up to their immigration court hearing on Tuesday.",
      "\"There was a sense of relief when the government prosecutors moved to dismiss the removal proceedings,\" Ferrer recounted. \"This has always been, historically, a result that is highly sought after and either we try to win a case on the merits of an application or we try to dismiss the removal proceedings.\"",
      "But to his shock and dismay, Ferrer said ICE agents arrested his clients immediately after they left the courtroom.",
      "\"They did not provide identification, they did not have an arrest warrant, they did not make any attempt to establish whether or not they had committed a crime,\" Ferrer added. \"They just went in and took them.\"",
      "Ferrer said his Cuban clients entered the U.S. in 2022, after showing up to a legal entry point along the U.S.-Mexico border, hoping to request asylum.",
      "Even amid ICE's efforts to arrest some migrants after they show up to court, immigration lawyers said they are still strongly advising their clients against missing their hearings, as failure to do so could be grounds for judges to issue a deportation order.",
      "The ICE arrests at immigration courts were reported across the country in several cities with large immigrant populations, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas and Miami.",

      "Publicly available reports from the Defense Department confirm recruiters are currently meeting their goals for the year, but its monthly reports \u2014 only published online since 2016 \u2014 also show the services frequently adjust annual targets, making historical comparisons less meaningful.",
      "For example, after falling short of their goals in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 amid a tight job market, the Army cut its goal from 65,000 to 55,000 active-duty soldiers for the fiscal year 2024. After meeting that benchmark, it's aiming for 61,000 recruits this year. These shifting goal posts complicate claims of record performance.",
      "When measured by total recruits \u2014 the metric Mr. Trump appeared to explicitly reference \u2014 active military enlistments have risen year over year but remain below recent peaks.",
      "In March, the most recent month available, around 13,000 new people enlisted, an increase of nearly 50% over the prior year, but below the 15,000 recorded in March 2018, during Mr. Trump's first term. The figure includes all branches of the military except for the Coast Guard, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The highest monthly figure under Mr. Trump's second term so far was in January\u00a0\u2014 his inauguration month \u2014 when 15,597 recruits received basic training dates. That still trails the 16,800 recorded in January 2018 and 20,000 in August 2024 under Biden.",
      "Recruitment could surpass pre-pandemic levels by the end of fiscal 2025 in September, but it's too early to tell.",
      "And despite recent gains, enlistments remain well below levels achieved three decades ago. In 1990, over 220,000 enlisted in the active military. Those numbers declined after the end of the Cold War and haven't returned to that level, according to historic Defense Department data.",
      "Trump's false claim that recruitment fell to record lows during President Biden's last year",
      "Mr. Trump also claimed military enlistments fell to record lows during Biden's last year in office.",
      "\"Just about a year ago, it was a big story, front page of every paper all over the world, that nobody wanted to enlist in our military,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "That's false. Defense\u00a0data shows military recruitment began to recover after COVID-era declines in fiscal year 2023 and continued to grow in 2024. That year, 146,473 people signed active-duty contracts \u2014 about 12,000 more than the previous year.",
      "Mr. Trump has further suggested enlistment was at a record low right before news of his election. In fact, 10,993 people enlisted in October 2024, the last full month before Election Day, a 60% increase over the same month in 2023.",
      "Experts say recruitment reforms explain why recruitment has ticked up, despite longterm challenges",
      "Experts who study military enlistment say the continued improvements have more to do with changes in recruitment strategy and compensation than the change in commander-in-chief.",
      "Katherine Kuzminski of the Center for a New American Security credits Biden-era programs like the Army's Future Soldier Prep Course launched in 2022 and the Navy's Future Sailor Prep Course launched in 2023 for helping candidates struggling with enlistment requirements. In 2024, about 25% of the Army's enlistments came through a prep course.",
      "\"It's harder to convince someone to be interested in military service than it is to train them to a standard,\" Kuzminski said.",
      "Defense statistics show over 70% of American youths don't meet qualifications for military service because of rising rates of obesity, drug use, mental health issues, and difficulties meeting educational standards.",
      "Polls show interest in service has also declined in the last decade, and defense representatives have cited flagging trust in institutions, a shrinking population of veterans who serve as models of service, and the number of job options in the private sector, depending on the strength of the economy.",
      "To better compete with private sector offers, Congress approved a 14.5% pay increase for junior enlisted troops last December that took effect this year.",
      "\"It would benefit the DoD to publicly also recognize that they've made quite a few adjustments to the recruiting enterprise instead of the perception that's coming out that it's driven solely by partisan politics,\" Kuzminski said, \"Because I don't think that for most American youth that's the driving factor for their joining the military.\"",

    "story": [
      "When President Trump's new tariffs started throttling freight traffic, the leader of trucking logistics firm Freight Technologies used an unorthodox method to try and get the president's attention.",
      "The California-based firm purchased $2 million worth of Trump Coin, the signature cryptocurrency backed by Mr. Trump. The president and his family launched Trump Coin days before he took office in January. Anyone can buy the cryptocurrency. An analytics firm says Mr. Trump's family and other backers have collected more than $300 million in transaction fees so far.",
      "Donald Quinby, Freight Technologies' chief financial officer, told CBS News that the purchase seemed like \"really the best platform for us to make a splash, to make some noise.\"",
      "\"With the Trump meme token, this was just an opportunity to really advocate for free and fair trade,\" Quinby said. \"I'm sure he likes to follow who's purchasing his coins.\"",
      "In April, the Trump family announced an \"intimate private dinner\" with the president at Mr. Trump's golf course in Virginia to reward the biggest buyers of Trump Coin, or $TRUMP. A leaderboard was created so buyers could compete with one another. Buyers eventually spent $140 million trying to secure access to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Some of the 220 leading buyers of $TRUMP received tickets to attend the dinner. Mr. Trump will also host a smaller reception for the token's top 25 holders. The guests are beneficiaries of a new opportunity to gain access and potential influence in a city with a long history of blending money and politics, experts said.",
      "\"This is really unprecedented,\" said Jessica Tillipman, a George Washington University law professor. \"This appears to be a president that could be potentially benefiting privately from something that he's doing out in the open.\"",
      "The White House pushed back hard on the notion that the gala dinner or the president's role in promoting the cryptocurrency crossed any ethical lines. Administration officials said they had not approved an initial plan suggesting top buyers of the meme coin product would receive a White House tour.",
      "\"This is a personal dinner that the president is attending on his personal time,\" a White House official told CBS News in a statement. \"The White House has absolutely nothing to do with it.\"",
      "Trump rewards cryptocurrency buyers",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is largely driven by social media buzz. They are not usually used in transactions, and are known for erratic price shifts. $TRUMP peaked at around $75 shortly after launch and plummeted to under $8 by April 2025, but soared in value after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced.",
      "Among the attendees of Thursday's dinner is Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire and the largest holder of Trump Coin. Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes, and is best known for creating the Tron blockchain. He was also the buyer who paid $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall by artist Maurizio Cattelan. Sun promptly ate the fruit.",
      "Sun was sued for fraud by the Biden administration for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" and paying celebrities to promote a crypto token his company created \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused the lawsuit as part of a broader Trump administration shift toward easing crypto enforcement.",
      "Sun also said his firm has invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. But the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency allows Sun, and other foreign buyers like him, to court access to power with little transparency.",
      "\"It's almost like the perfect kind of opaque structure for any type of foreign government or, you know, non-U.S. citizens who wanted to try to seek favor, curry favor with this particular administration,\" Tillipman\u00a0said.",
      "Experts raise concerns about conflicts of interest",
      "Tillipman compared the Trump family's foray into cryptocurrency to Hunter Biden's art sales during his father's administration.",
      "\"The argument was that [purchasers of Hunter Biden's artwork] could use it to influence\" then-President Joe Biden, she said.",
      "Like cryptocurrency, \"a lot of these types of transactions are by nature opaque because you don't know who's purchasing it. You don't know who the buyer is,\" Tillipman said. She noted that in effect, the Biden administration tried to distance the president from the transactions by saying information about the buyers and transactions would be kept secret by the gallery owner.",
      "Nonetheless, she said \"there were a lot of legitimate concerns associated with that particular dealing, as there was fear that it could be a back door to President Biden\" through a family member.",
      "\"The difference here is just the order of magnitude and the involvement of the president himself,\" Tillipman said. Hunter Biden's art netted him about $1.5 million by the end of his father's presidency, compared to the potentially far more lucrative Trump family crypto business.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" He and his eldest sons are also backing the\u00a0crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and cryptocurrency makes up about $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth, according to a\u00a0recent report.",
      "On Monday, the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. They tend to have fewer price fluctuations than meme coins, but allow for the same opacity in transactions. Some Democrats pushed back against the bill, citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings and calling for anti-corruption rules.",
      "\"This is corruption out in the open,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, on Thursday. \"The GENIUS Act will supercharge Donald Trump's ability to collect money from anybody who is seeking pardon, who wants tariff relief, who wants a criminal prosecution dropped.\"",
      "The White House has dismissed criticisms that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest.",
      "\"All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children, and I would argue, one of the many reasons that the American people reelected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Quinby found that buying the meme coin didn't immediately result in access to the president. Freight Technologies didn't make it to the leaderboard, but they are prepared to keep spending. The trucking company reported in public securities filings that their investment in $TRUMP could eventually reach $20 million, if that's what it takes to get Mr. Trump's attention. Even if they lose money on the market, Quinby thinks it was worth the risk.",
      "\"We thought the ability for us to get out there and advocate for the fair and free trade, we thought it was worth it,\" Quinby said.",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 20:12:56 -0400",
    "summary": "With the 2025 hurricane season starting June 1, NOAA forecasters announced their prediction for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Ten days before start of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced their forecast for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year. The current outlook predicts a 60% chance of an \"above-normal\" hurricane season, with between 13 to 19 named storms. Six to 10 of those are expected to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes, forecasters said.",
      "They estimated there's a 30% chance of a \"near-normal\" season and a 10% chance of a \"below-normal\" season.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, releases its seasonal hurricane outlook each spring. It incorporates research from the Climate Prediction Center, the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, all branches of the agency.",
      "Acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham presented the findings during a news conference Thursday morning at the Jefferson Parish Emergency Operations Center in Gretna, Louisiana, just outside of New Orleans. They chose that location to commemorate the victims and destruction of Hurricane Katrina, 20 years after that storm devastated the area.",
      "In their remarks, Grimm and Graham each emphasized the technological developments that have allowed NOAA and the weather service to produce forecasts that are more accurate with each passing year.",
      "\"The United States is fortunate to have the worlds best scientists, meteorologists and computer modeling experts,\" said Grimm. \"These experts are constantly learning from current and past events.\"",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, there are a \"confluence of factors\" influencing the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the outlook said, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead. The agency may also release an updated hurricane forecast later in the season should their assessment change.",
      "NOAA's forecasting model, the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System or HAFS, is expected to undergo an upgrade that officials believe could increase the accuracy of storm tracking by about 5%.",
      "\"In my 30 years at the National Weather Service, we've never had more advanced models and warning systems in place to monitor the weather,\" said Graham in a statement. \"This outlook is a call to action: be prepared. Take proactive steps now to make a plan and gather supplies to ensure you're ready before a storm threatens.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "When researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team published their annual forecast earlier this spring, they also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",
      "Silvers and his team predicted there would be 17 named storms this season \u2014 tropical storms with sustained wind speeds of at least 39 mph. According to their forecast, nine of the storms will grow into hurricanes, with three developing into major hurricanes. That would place hurricane activity at roughly 125% of the seasonal average recorded between 1991 and 2020, according to their report.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said at the time.",
      "The Colorado State report largely attributed the higher activity expected this year to warm sea surface temperatures, which can essentially act as fuel for storms. But the findings also pointed to \"considerable uncertainty\" as to which phase of the ENSO cycle would coincide with the coming hurricane season.",
      "El Ni\u00f1o, the warmer half of the cycle, is often linked to conditions in a section of the equatorial Pacific that disfavor hurricanes, while La Ni\u00f1a, the colder inverse, is considered more conducive to hurricane formation. La Ni\u00f1a conditions ended shortly after CSU released its hurricane forecast and returned to \"neutral,\" a state that researchers said could be favorable for hurricanes to develop in the absence of El Ni\u00f1o.",

      "Since the 1970s, scientists have studied dark streaks seen on Mars' cliff sides and crater walls. The streaks tend to be hundreds of meters long. Some can last for a long time, while others are more short-lived. Those more short-lived slope streaks, called recurring slope lineae, or RSLS, tend to recur in the same areas from year to year, according to a news release announcing the study.",
      "Some scientists believe the streaks are proof of flowing water on the planet and could suggest the Red Planet is home to habitable environments. Others believe the streaks are caused by dry processes, like rock falls or wind gusts, and said the streaks only appear like liquid remnants because scientists are studying orbital images.",
      "Adomas Valantinas, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University, and Valentin Bickel, a researcher at Switzerland's University of Bern, used machine learning to study the streaks. The process cataloged more than 86,00 high-resolution satellite images of the slope streaks and RSLs. That created a first-of-its-kind global Martian map showing more than half a million such features.",
      "\"Once we had this global map, we could compare it to databases and catalogs of other things like temperature, wind speed, hydration, rock slide activity and other factors.\" Bickel said. \"Then we could look for correlations over hundreds of thousands of cases to better understand the conditions under which these features form.\"",
      "The analysis, published in Nature on Monday, found that the slope streaks were not \"generally associated with factors that suggest a liquid or frost origin,\" according to the news release. Such factors would include a specific orientation of slopes, high humidity or surface temperature fluctuations.",
      "What the study did find was that the slopes were more likely to form in places that had above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, likely pointing to a dry origin.

      "The results of the study cast doubt on claims that slope streaks could be signs of habitable regions. That means that researchers could send rovers or other spacecraft to explore the areas without contaminating the sites.",

      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States,\" he added.",
      "President Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House on Wednesday, according to a White House official. The official did not disclose what was discussed at the meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.",
      "Apple invests in India",
      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has promoted tariffs as a way to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, secure more favorable trade deals with other countries and advance the White House's other policies, such as curbing unauthorized immigration and trafficking of illicit drugs.",
      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing. That's because companies typically base the decision on where to locate factories more on factors including labor and energy costs, tax rates, political instability and the regulatory environment.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 09:00:42 -0400",
    "summary": "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
    "story": [
      "Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023. Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place \u2014 with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Last week, Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly's Education Committee, called phones \"a cancer on our kids\" that are \"driving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\"",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\"This is a not just an academic bill,\" Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \"This is a mental health bill. It's a public safety bill.\"",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "Teachers and administrators have long known cellphones were major distractions in learning: A\u00a02023 Pew survey showed 72%\u00a0 of high school teachers\u00a0view cellphones as a major problem in their classrooms. And U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has\u00a0issued an advisory\u00a0on the effects of social media on youth mental health.",
      "Aside from academic benefits, cellphone restrictions can assist with social development and creating community at the school, Kim Whitman a parent-turned-advocate told CBS News last year. Whitman, a co-founder of Phone Free, said if schools \"allow phones to be present it's hard for students to connect and create a sense of belonging.\"",
      "More focus on bans throughout school day",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \"a huge win.\"",
      "\"Teachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \"bell-to-bell\" bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group's political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\"That's often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\" Hoffman said.",
      "Some states want districts to set rules",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "Opposition from some parents, students",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\"It was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\"It is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\" Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "Most states provide no funding for laws",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\"Providing some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, most states have not.\"",

      "The FBI soon discovered Butler was a convicted felon with a history of robbing banks.",
      "Tom Manning: They figured out where he was staying \u2026 then the team that I work with set up surveillance.",
      "Butler and his fianc\u00e9e, Lisa Ramirez, lived in a house just a few miles from the bank.",
      "Tom Manning: Some of the people in the house were tellin' the police who was there, when they planned it",
      "Within days, detectives identified the two other men. Christopher Huggins \u2013",
      "Tom Manning: He was a big guy, maybe \u2014 maybe 6'4\" he's \u2026 gang ties.",

      "Tom Manning (in evidence room): In the glove compartment was a weapon \u2026 it's actually a BB gun \u2026 if you look at that in a stressful situation, that looks as real as it can get.",
      "Tracy Smith: What'd they find when they popped the trunk?",
      "Tom Manning: A plethora of evidence.",
      "Tracy Smith: All this.",
      "Tom Manning: All this. \u2026 They found the black bag that Michelle described the money being carried in, several pairs of black gloves \u2026 and a homemade ski mask.",
      "Tracy Smith: Oh, yeah. Look at the eyeholes there that they clearly cut themselves.",
      "Tom Manning: Michelle's credit cards were all found in the trunk of the vehicle \u2026 and then of course the money straps from the bank.",
      "Also in the trunk, that doorbell \"detonator\". And there was even more at the house.",
      "Tom Manning: They found all the ingredients to make the fake bomb. \u2026 There were broom handles, which were cut up into small dowels which actually were used in making the fake dynamite. \u2026 They also recovered the actual spray cans \u2026 Ramirez's fingerprint was on one of those cans.",
      "Tom Manning: It was crazy. I've never seen that much physical evidence left at a crime scene.",
      "Tracy Smith: They thought they'd gotten away with it.",
      "Tom Manning: Yeah.",
      "One thing investigators didn't find on Butler and Ramirez \u2013 any of the bank's $360,000. But after arresting Huggins that same day, they did recover $93,000 of the cash that he'd stashed away. Huggins confessed and said he'd already spent several grand on a trip to Vegas. The fourth suspect, Robert Ortiz, was on the lam.",
      "When authorities arrested him three months later in Wisconsin, Ortiz still had $32,000 of the bank's money and gave a full confession.",
      "Tracy Smith: Did Huggins and Ortiz's confessions corroborate each other?",
      "Tom Manning: Yes, very much so.",
      "Tracy Smith: So, did Huggins and Ortiz's confessions corroborate what Michelle had told investigators?",
      "Tom Manning: Yes, almost identical.",
      "Butler denied everything, even when confronted with direct evidence: his thumbprint on the fake dynamite sticks.",
      "DETECTIVE: We've got fingerprints that are yours that link you to the bank robbery.",
      "CHRISTOPHER BUTLER: I doubt that because I wasn't involved in the bank robbery.",
      "He tried to protect Ramirez.",
      "CHRISTOPHER BUTLER: Lisa wouldn't have been involved with that.",
      "But Ramirez was about to start talking. She admitted she was the female voice on the walkie-talkie.",
      "LISA RAMIREZ: That was me.",
      "DETECTIVE: That was you?",
      "LISA RAMIREZ: Mm-hmm.",
      "She even took credit for the idea to use fake dynamite and kidnap the bank manager.",
      "LISA RAMIREZ: I honestly know whose idea it was, about eight months ago.",
      "DETECTIVE: Who?",
      "LISA RAMIREZ: Jokingly, mine.",
      "Ramirez said they'd split the money three ways, but that her and Butler's share \u2013 more than $100,000 \u2013 had been stolen. And to everyone's surprise, she said Michelle was in on the plot.",
      "LISA RAMIREZ: Supposedly from what they had told me this Michelle lady was helping them.",
      "Tom Manning: We walked out of that thinking, \"OK, Lisa's the mastermind behind all this. And, is it possible Michelle's involved?\"",
      "Manning says, ultimately, he knew Michelle was innocent.",
      "Tom Manning: The first time I interviewed her, she had Breea with her. And \u2026 I saw that bond and relationship. And when she left, I went, \"She's not involved in this.\"",
      "But that wouldn't be enough in court. San Diego County Sheriff's detectives Rudy Zamora, Dale Martin and Randi Demers would have to rule Michelle out as a suspect.",
      "Rudy Zamora: Every time we pushed a button, she would react in a way \u2026 a true victim should.",
      "They recreated the dynamite packs and strapped them on Kimbra, Michelle and Breea.",
      "Dale Martin: She was very upset.",
      "And Michelle was emotional when asked to revisit the horrific details of the kidnapping.",
      "FBI VIDEO OF MICHELLE RENEE AT CRIME SCENE: And then they \u2014 I had to put her in there and they just shut the \u2014 shut the closet.",
      "Dale Martin: She was shaken up. I thought she was gonna have a nervous breakdown.",
      "Tracy Smith: When Michelle did those reenactments, were her story, Kimbra's story, and Breea's story consistent?",
      "Tom Manning: Yes. Completely consistent.",
      "In fact, investigators couldn't find any evidence Michelle was involved. Still, they worried as they took a deep dive into Michelle's life.",
      "Rudy Zamora: She was not our normal victim.",
      "Tracy Smith: What did they find out about Michelle's past?",
      "Tom Manning: She didn't hide anything.",
      "Including the fact that for years she had worked as a stripper.",
      "Michelle Renee: I'm not embarrassed or ashamed by any of that.",
      "Michelle says it was one of the choices she had to make for survival at a young age.",
      "Michelle Renee: I ran away at 15. \u2026 I worked really, really hard to get to where I was.",
      "With no high school diploma, she had climbed the corporate ladder all the way to regional vice president before taking the bank manager job to be home more with Breea.",
      "Tracy Smith: And while you were working at the bank, you were still dancing, still stripping for a while?",
      "Michelle Renee: I was for a while \u2026The money was really great.",
      "But more worrisome were things that went directly to Michelle's credibility.",
      "Tom Manning: She falsified resum\u00e9s \u2026 claimed she had various experience, various education which she didn't have.",
      "Tracy Smith: Bounced a check, filed for bankruptcy.",
      "Tom Manning: Right.",
      "Tracy Smith: That doesn't look good.",
      "Tom Manning: It doesn't look good. \u2026And if you're a defense attorney, you're lickin' your chops.",
      "ATTACKED AT TRIAL",
      "By spring of 2001, the suspects were in custody awaiting trial for kidnapping and bank robbery charges, but Michelle and Breea were still reeling from that night of terror.",
      "Michelle Renee: I could still hear them. I could still hear the sounds \u2026 I couldn't get it to turn off.",
      "Breea Renee: I just wanted to hide. I thought they were gonna find us. They were gonna kill us still.",
      "In June, Michelle decided to move Breea to Alaska to live with her grandmother.",
      "Michelle Renee: I was gonna fly her up there and get her to safety \u2026 I was gonna figure out what to do from there.",
      "After a few days, Michelle says she had an epiphany.",
      "Michelle Renee: To go back to San Diego and get rid of everything I could possibly get rid of and drive back to Alaska.",
      "With a dog, some cash, and a camcorder, in July she embarked on a 9-day drive to the Last Frontier.",
      "Tracy Smith: You had a deadline.",
      "Michelle Renee: I had a deadline. Breea's birthday was in nine days. And I'd promised her I'd be back before her birthday party.",
      "That's when Michelle and Breea say they began to heal.",
      "Tracy Smith: Did you feel safe in Alaska?",
      "Breea Renee: Safer \u2026 I could be a kid again.",
      "By the time they returned to San Diego a year later for the trial, Michelle says she was ready.",
      "Michelle Renee: There was so much evidence. There was no way I thought that this trial was gonna be anything but \u2026 slam dunk.",
      "Butler and Ramirez would be tried first.",
      "Tracy Smith: When her case came across your desk what did you think at first?",
      "Herb Weston: She's guilty.",
      "Tracy Smith: You thought she's guilty?",
      "Herb Weston: Well, yeah.",
      "Herb Weston, who represented Lisa Ramirez, had a problem. His client had confessed on camera.",
      "DETECTIVE: There was a female voice that came out on one of those walkie-talkies.",
      "LISA RAMIREZ: That was me.",
      "Herb Weston: If they play that tape, saying that she wasn't involved woulda been difficult.",
      "Weston proposed a plea deal, hoping to save Ramirez from a potential life sentence. But the prosecution turned him down.",
      "Tom Manning: We thought we would definitely get the key statements in that she was involved.",
      "But, since Ramirez had also implicated Butler, the judge ruled her entire statement inadmissible.",
      "Herb Weston: We now can at least argue to the jury that she wasn't involved.",
      "Without her confession, the case against Ramirez relied almost entirely on Michelle \u2014 a fact Manning was keenly aware of during his opening statement to the jury on June 3, 2002.",
      "Tracy Smith: You told the jury that this case was about credibility.",
      "Tom Manning: Right \u2026 Michelle's background was gonna be an issue \u2026 I knew there were issues \u2026 but I believed her.",
      "Tracy Smith: And you thought \u2026 the jury would believe her.",
      "Tom Manning: Right.",
      "But not if the defense had its way.",
      "Tracy Smith: What was your strategy going into trial?",
      "Herb Weston: My strategy was to beat the hell out of the victim and show all these inconsistencies that the victim is saying.",
      "Tom Manning: It got very confrontational.",
      "Michelle Renee: I was really, really pissed off.",
      "That played right into Weston's hand.",
      "Herb Weston: Angry witnesses don't come across as credible.",
      "Michelle Renee: I was treated like I was the criminal.",
      "During his cross-examination, Weston implied Michelle was lying about recognizing Lisa Ramirez' voice on the walkie-talkie.",
      "Herb Weston: Well, wait a minute, ma'am. I've looked at all this stuff. \u2026 isn't this the first time you've said that?",
      "In fact, he pointed out it wasn't in any of the FBI reports. But Michelle insists she told them.",
      "Michelle Renee: I did \u2026 I 100% did.",
      "And Manning says she identified Ramirez's voice to him before taking the stand.",
      "Tracy Smith: Does it bother you that Lisa actually admitted that that was her voice on the walkie-talkie? \u2026 the fact is it was Lisa.",
      "Herb Weston: But that's not the issue. \u2026 for me it made a great opening to attack her credibility.",
      "Weston then grilled Michelle about bait money \u2014 the traceable bills banks keep in their vaults to trap bank robbers.",
      "Tracy Smith: You didn't take the bait money.",
      "Michelle Renee: Did not take the bait money.",
      "Tracy Smith: Why not?",
      "Michelle Renee: They said \u2026 \"no funny money.\"",
      "Tracy Smith: \u00a0You say that's suspicious, that she must have been in on it.",
      "Herb Weston: Correct.",

USS F-1 sank in just 10 seconds, and only five of the sub's 24 crewmen were rescued. The sub was lost for nearly 60 years until it\u00a0 was located by a Navy deep submersible vehicle that was out looking for a jet fighter that crashed in 1972, the association said.",
      "\"It looked like a big ax had hit her,\" said Lt. Dave Magyar, the pilot of the submersible that spotted the USS F-1, according to a newspaper story from 1976. But a close-up survey was not possible given the depth of the submarine.",
      "Until now.",
      "With assistance from the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC) and the National Science Foundation, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution team dispatched a human-piloted submersible named Alvin as well as a remote underwater vehicle named Sentry to capture the close-up images.",
      "Using sonar systems on Sentry and the research vessel Atlantis, the team was able to successfully conduct meticulous surveys of the submarine.",
      "\"Once we identified the wreck and determined it was safe to dive, we were able to capture never-before-seen perspectives of the sub,\" said WHOI's Bruce Strickrott, the senior pilot who helped lead the expedition. \"As a U.S. Navy veteran, it was a profound honor to visit the wreck of the F-1 with our ONR and NHHC colleagues aboard Alvin.\"",
      "During the expedition, the team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed near the same area in 1950. Scientists released video and images of the aircraft, showing a severely damaged tail and a bent front propeller.",
      "The team conducted seven total dives and the advanced sonar systems were able to produce detailed maps of the submarine wreck site and surrounding seafloor. Scientists also used high-resolution cameras to capture close-up video of the wreck.",
      "Specialists then used all the data to stitch together \"photogrammetric models capable of providing precise measurements of the sub and the animals that have colonized its wreckage over the years.\"\u00a0 That allowed experts to reconstruct the F-1 submarine and produce stunning 3-D models of the wreck.",
      "After the dives, the team held a remembrance ceremony on board Atlantis, ringing\u00a0 a bell 19 times \u2014 one for each crew member lost at sea.",

    "story": [
      "Military air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter as it neared the Pentagon on a flight that caused two commercial jets to abort their landings in early May at a Washington airport, the Army confirmed to CBS News Friday.",
      "An Army official confirmed that on May 1, the Pentagon tower lost contact with the Black Hawk helicopter for about 20 seconds as it was coming to land.",
      "FAA air traffic controllers at the airport aborted the landing of a Delta Air Lines Airbus A319 during the Black Hawk's initial flight toward the Pentagon because they realized both aircraft would be nearing the Pentagon around the same time, Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman, the head of Army aviation, told the Associated Press in an exclusive interview.",
      "Because of the 20-second loss of contact, the Pentagon's tower did not clear the Black Hawk to land, so the helicopter circled the Pentagon a second time. That's when air traffic controllers at the airport decided to abort the landing of a second jet, a Republic Airways Embraer E170, because they did not have a confident fix on the Black Hawk's location, Braman said.",
      "The Army said in a news release Friday evening that the cause of the lost contact with the Black Hawk is thought to be that a temporary antenna was in a location that did not maintain contact with the helicopter as it was coming in to land at the Pentagon. The Army said its initial review \"found no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic.\"",
      "Braman told the AP that the antenna was set up during construction of a new control tower and has now been moved to the roof of the Pentagon.",
      "The Army said the aircraft's location was continuously broadcast throughout its flight through its Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast (ADS-B) Out system.",
      "In initial reporting on the aborted landings, an FAA official suggested the Army helicopter was on a \"scenic route.\" But the ADSB-Out data, which the Army shared with the AP on Friday, shows the crew hewed closely to its approved flight path \u2014 directly up the I-395 highway corridor, which is called Route 5, then rounding the Pentagon.",
      "Reagan National Airport air traffic controllers had directed \"go-arounds\" for the two commercial aircraft \"out of an apparent abundance of caution,\" the Army said in its statement. The first go-around occurred before the Black Hawk arrived at the Pentagon helipad and resulted from \"an issue with sequencing of air traffic by DCA Tower,\" according to the Army, and the second occurred during the Black Hawk's subsequent traffic pattern and was based on \"conflicting positional data from legacy tracking systems.\"",
      "Braman said federal air traffic controllers inside the Washington airport also didn't have a good fix on the location of the helicopter. The Black Hawk was transmitting data that should have given controllers its precise location, but Braman said FAA officials told him in meetings last week that the data the controllers were getting from multiple feeds and sensors was inconclusive, with some of it deviating by as much as three-quarters of a mile.",
      "\"It certainly led to confusion of air traffic control of where they were,\" Braman said.",
      "The Black Hawk was not carrying any passengers.",
      "The aborted landings on May 1, first reported by the AP, added to general unease about continued close calls between government helicopters and commercial airplanes near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after a deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people.",
      "In March, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that helicopters would be permanently restricted from flying on the same route where the collision occurred. After the May 1 incident, the Army paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon as it works with the FAA to address safety issues.",
      "The FAA declined to comment on whether its controllers were unable to get a good fix on the Black Hawk's location because of their own equipment issues, citing the ongoing crash investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "The NTSB Chairman Jennifer Homendy told CBS News on Friday that the agency was not briefed on the Army's findings and only learned about them after reading the report from the Associated Press.",
      "\"The NTSB is leading this investigation,\" Homendy told CBS News. \"That is well known. It is disappointing \u2014 frankly, shocking \u2014 that the Army would choose to release what is clearly investigative information through a media exclusive rather than provide it directly to us.\"",

      "This is the second baby food pouch recall because of potential lead contamination in two months. In March, Target recalled more than 25,000 packages of its store brand Good & Gather Baby Pea, Zucchini, Kale & Thyme Vegetable Puree because of elevated lead levels.",
      "North Carolina collaborates with the FDA to conduct routine testing of food products, officials said.",
      "In 2023, state health officials investigated reports of lead poisoning in four children who consumed WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree. Those findings led to the detection of a nationwide outbreak linked to the pouches, which were widely sold in Dollar Tree and other stores. Tests showed they contained lead at levels 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum recommended level, as well as chromium.",

      "Police chief Brian O'Hara, who was sworn in in November 2022, has been adamant about implementing changes from within that lead to safer streets and more positive interactions with Minneapolis police.",
      "Still, O'Hara said Floyd's death is still an \"open wound\" in the city. While police data shows shootings are trending down, Minneapolis is one of the few major cities where violent crime has not improved much since 2020, according to an analysis of the Major Cities Chiefs Association violent crime report. Crime in the city \"skyrocketed\" after Floyd's death and the protests that followed, O'Hara said, while \"the numbers of the police force just diminished.\"",
      "\"People have a very, very basic need to feel safe, and that has been taken away for a lot of people because of everything that's happened since,\" said O'Hara.",
      "The officer shortage continues to strain the department. In 2024, O'Hara told CBS News that the Minneapolis Police Department was short by about 200 officers.",
      "\"I go to these crime scenes. I've been standing there, boys, teenagers, men are dead in the street, and moms behind the crime scene tape wailing, and I'm going through my head thinking, 'We've had so many murders already this week, what happens if someone else dies?'\" O'Hara said. \"We don't have enough homicide investigators. I mean, it's been that critical at times. The urgency of the problem is real.\"",
      "Still, O'Hara is determined to make a difference with the resources he does have. He has focused on \"getting back to the basics\" and ensuring that \"everything we do revolves around both reducing crime while earning trust with the community.\"",
      "O'Hara has also worked to \"restore some pride in this profession\" to try to draw more officers back to the job, and tried to change the culture in the department. Minneapolis police have also adjusted arrest tactics and are working on community engagement and officer training.",
      "\"In my experience, the people who are here today are dramatically different from the impression that I had of this department in 2020,\" O'Hara said.",
      "Earlier this week, the Justice Department announced it was ending investigations of six police agencies and canceling consent decrees proposed for Louisville and Minneapolis. O'Hara\u00a0said that reform efforts will continue, even without the federal oversight. The Minneapolis City Council approved the consent decree in January.",
      "Minneapolis resident Omar Mohammed told \"CBS Saturday Morning\" that he was impressed with the changes he has seen over the past few years.",
      "\"The new chief did a great, great job, because what I see now is, before, police used to pull over everybody, the kids on the street, they used to use a lot of difficult stuff, you know?\" Mohammed said. \"A lot of big things changed, that's what I see.\"",

      "Boeing has reached a $1.1 billion deal with the Department of Justice that will allow it to avoid prosecution for two crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners that killed a total of 346 people.",
      "Boeing will be required to invest that money in improving the aviation giant's compliance, safety and quality program, while $445 million will be set aside to provide compensation for the families of the victims killed in the crashes, the Justice Department said.",
      "The agreement stems from the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in 2019. The deal will allow the company to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the\u00a0737 Max jetliner\u00a0before the crashes, according to court papers filed Friday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted Friday lower court orders that required the White House's Department of Government Efficiency to turn over information to a government watchdog group as part of a lawsuit that tests whether President Trump's cost-cutting task force has to comply with federal public records law.",
      "Roberts issued a temporary administrative stay of two orders entered by a federal district court in Washington, D.C., which directed DOGE to turn over records related to it operations and personnel and required its acting administrator, Amy Gleason, to sit for a deposition.",
      "The chief justice's order allows the Supreme Court more time to consider the Trump administration's request for emergency relief, which was filed with the high court earlier this week. Deadlines set by the district judge required DOGE to turn over documents by June 3 and for Gleason's deposition to be completed by June 13.",
      "The dispute before the court stems from a Freedom of Information Act request made by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington that sought information about DOGE, its operations and personnel. The watchdog group went on to file a federal lawsuit based on that FOIA request, and, as part of the suit, sought categories of information through the discovery process about DOGE's activities since President Trump took office.",
      "Among the information CREW is seeking is a deposition with Gleason, who the White House has said is the acting administrator of DOGE; a list of federal contracts or grants that DOGE personnel recommended for cancellation; and the names of all current and former DOGE employees, as well as details of their employment and who oversees them.",
      "The watchdog group has argued that DOGE wields \"substantial independent authority,\" which makes it a de facto agency that is subject to FOIA and the Federal Records Act. But the Justice Department disagrees and asserts that DOGE is a presidential advisory body that makes recommendations to the president and federal agencies on matters that are important to Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "The district court granted most of CREW's request for information, including deposing Gleason. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper found that DOGE is likely subject to FOIA and said that the task force's actions demonstrate that it has \"substantial authority over vast swathes of the federal government.\"",
      "A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., declined to halt the district court's discovery order, finding that it is \"narrow\" and appropriate.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order establishing DOGE when he returned to the White House for a second term. The task force is leading his initiative to shrink the size of the federal government. That plan has included large-scale layoffs at federal departments, and the shuttering of several agencies, though the efforts have been the focus of legal wrangling.",
      "The president has repeatedly said that Elon Musk, the billionaire leader of Tesla and SpaceX, is the head of DOGE, though Justice Department lawyers have\u00a0said in court filings\u00a0that he is not an employee of the task force and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "Questions about Musk's role with DOGE led the White House to\u00a0declare Gleason\u00a0as its acting administrator. She worked as a senior adviser to the U.S. Digital Service, the precursor to DOGE.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 14:49:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The massive budget bill passed by the House includes new tax breaks for tipped workers and those who get overtime.",
    "story": [
      "The massive Republican-backed budget bill \u2014 called \"one big, beautiful bill\" by President Trump \u2014 includes several new tax rules that could have a big financial impact on millions of workers who earn tips or overtime pay.",
      "While the heart of the bill is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, the legislation also includes several provisions that were part of the president's campaign last year, such as his vow to eliminate taxes on tipped income.",
      "The bill could deliver savings of about $1,700 for each tipped worker as well as employees who earn overtime, the House Ways and Means Committee said on May 20. But there are some restrictions in the bill that could limit the financial boon for these workers, with some policy experts saying that the tax breaks may not be as useful as they first appear.",
      "For instance, almost 4 in 10 tipped workers earn so little that they pay no federal income tax, according to the Brookings Institution. Consequently, the tax break is likely to provide a bigger helping hand to higher-paid tipped workers, while leaving some low-income workers behind.",
      "\"If your goal is to help the poorest service workers, this is probably not the way to do it,\" said Michael Lynn, a professor of services marketing at Cornell University whose research largely focuses on tipping and other consumer behavior.",
      "The 1,100-page bill, which squeaked through the House on Thursday by a single vote, will now go to the Senate, where more changes are likely. Here's what to know about the provisions as they now stand.",
      "How would the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision work?",
      "Called the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision within the House bill, the rule would create a new tax deduction that eliminates federal income taxes on tips for people who work in jobs that have traditionally received them.",
      "There are about 4 million people in the U.S. who work in tipped occupations, or about 2.5% of all U.S. workers, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The tax break includes some restrictions:",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.\u00a0Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.Tips must be reported to the employer and included on the worker's W-2 tax form.The provision would go into effect in 2025, but expire after 2028, making it a short-term tax break.\u00a0The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.",
      "Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.",

      "The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "\"The tip exemption will significantly increase take-home pay for most tipped workers, many of whom are low- to middle-income taxpayers,\" the White House's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), a group that advises the president on economic issues, said in a report published earlier this month.",
      "The CEA's report estimates that the average take-home pay for tipped workers would increase by $1,675 per year under the provision.",
      "Would it help all tipped workers?",
      "No, because 4 in 10 tipped workers earn too little to pay federal income taxes, which means they wouldn't see any benefit. There's also a concern that some employers could reclassify some workers as tipped workers by arguing they would receive a tax break, according to Brookings.",
      "The minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 per hour, versus $7.25 an hour for non-tipped workers.",
      "One Fair Wage, an advocacy group representing service workers, criticized the measure, noting that the GOP bill also includes cuts to social safety net programs that many tipped workers rely on. \"It also slashes Medicaid, putting 1.2 million restaurant workers at risk of losing health care,\" One Fair Wage posted on social media.",
      "What about the Senate's No Tax on Tips Act?",
      "A separate, standalone bill called the No Tax on Tips Act, which is solely focused on giving a tax break to tipped workers, was passed by the Senate on May 20, with bipartisan support. That bill will now move to the House for a vote.",
      "The Senate bill offers similar benefits and restrictions as the \"one big, beautiful bill\" when it comes to taxes and tips, but with one major difference: The bigger GOP bill requires workers, as well as their spouses, to have a Social Security number.",
      "That requirement appears to be aimed at excluding some immigrants from tapping the tax break, while the Senate bill doesn't stipulate that taxpayers who claim this break, or their spouses, must have a Social Security number.",
      "Senator Jackie Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, urged lawmakers to pass the Not Tax on Tips Act arguing in a statement that the bigger GOP bill combines the tax break with cuts to vital programs like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "\"We shouldn't be forcing working families to choose between keeping their health care or keeping their tips, which is why we want this bipartisan bill on its own \u2014 on its own \u2014 not part of a harmful, extreme budget bill,\" Rosen said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.",
      "How does the \"No Tax on Overtime\" provision work?",
      "The GOP bill includes a tax break for workers who receive overtime, another one of Mr. Trump's campaign promises.",
      "About 8% of hourly workers and 4% of salaried workers receive overtime pay on a regular basis, according to the Yale Budget Lab. About 70% of salaried workers don't qualify for overtime pay, it noted.",
      "The legislation would enable workers to claim a deduction on their taxes for the amount they earned in overtime pay during the tax year, although there are some restrictions:",
      "Workers would need a Social Security number to claim the tax break, and if married, their spouses would also need a Social Security number.The tax break would go into effect in 2025 but expire after the 2028 tax year.",

      "But more guidelines about the provision would still need to be determined by the Treasury Department, according to tax firm Wolters Kluwer in a May 22 publication about the tax bill.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 80 people have been killed in the latest round of Israeli strikes in Gaza \u2013 a death toll that doesn't include hospitals in the battered north that the Hamas-run Health Ministry said are now inaccessible.",
      "The dead over the past 24 hours included nine of a doctor's 10 children, horrified colleagues and the health ministry said.",
      "Alaa Najjar, a pediatrician at Nasser Hospital, was on duty at the time and ran home to find her family's house on fire, Ahmad al-Farra, head of the hospital's pediatric department, told The Associated Press.",
      "Najjar's husband was severely wounded and their only surviving child, an 11-year-old son, was in critical condition after Friday's strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, Farra said.",
      "The dead children ranged in age from seven months to 12 years old. Khalil Al-Dokran, a spokesperson for Gaza's Health Ministry, told the AP that two of the children remained under the rubble.",
      "Israel's military said in a statement that it struck suspects operating from a structure next to its forces and described the area of Khan Younis as a \"dangerous war zone.\" It said it had evacuated civilians from the area, and \"the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.\" Earlier Saturday, a statement said Israel's air force struck over 100 targets throughout Gaza over the past day.",
      "Gaza health officials, who don't differentiate between civilians and combatants, said the new deaths raise the war's toll to 53,901 since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel that sparked the 19 months of fighting. The ministry said more than 3,700 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel resumed the war in March to pressure Hamas to accept different ceasefire terms and release the remaining hostages.",

      "The renewed military action against Hamas has also included a blockade of Gaza and its more than 2 million residents since early March. This week, the first small number of aid trucks entered the territory and began reaching Palestinians. But they were far fewer than the about 600 trucks a day that had been entering during the ceasefire.",
      "President Benjamin Netanyahu's government has sought a new aid delivery and distribution system by a newly established U.S.-backed group, but the United Nations and partners have rejected it, saying it allows Israel to use food as a weapon and violates humanitarian principles.",

      "Israeli military accused of using Palestinians as human shields",
      "Seven Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers have also accused Israel's military of using human shields in Gaza, allegedly sending people into buildings and tunnels to check for bombs and gunmen, the AP is reporting. They said the practice, which is prohibited by international law, has become ubiquitous over 19 months of war.",
      "In March, CBS News reported similar allegations, including from an Israeli soldier whose account of the tactics used in Gaza raised some serious questions.",
      "\"We've burned down buildings for no reasons, which is violating the international law, of course,\" he told CBS News. \"\u2026And we used human shields as protection.\"",
      "Ayman Abu Hamadan told the AP he was held for 2 \u00bd weeks last summer by the Israeli military in northern Gaza, and the only time he wasn't bound or blindfolded was when he was forced into houses to make sure they were clear of bombs and gunmen.",

The Trump administration has been mulling over establishing a permanent U.S. military presence in the South American country.",
      "Noboa was first\u00a0elected as president in November 2023 at age 35, with little political experience. He unexpectedly entered the race and was elected to complete the term of his predecessor, Guillermo Lasso, who had dissolved the Assembly and stepped down to avoid impeachment.",
      "Noboa was re-elected on April 13 in a run-off against left-wing candidate Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez, who has made repeated allegations of electoral fraud.

      "There was no immediate indication of any political motive, and investigators were looking into whether the suspect may have been mentally ill, police spokesperson Florian Abbenseth said.",
      "A high-speed InterCity Express, or ICE, train with its doors open was still at the platform hours after the attack, but Abbenseth said that it was not a crime scene.",
      "Railway operator Deutsche Bahn said it was \"deeply shocked\" by the attack. Four tracks at the station were closed Friday evening, and some long-distance trains were delayed or diverted.",

    "summary": "Eight people were found guilty of robbing Kim Kardashian in Paris in 2016. Two defendants were acquitted.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 After a monthlong trial, eight of the 10 people accused of robbing billionaire celebrity Kim Kardashian\u00a0in Paris in 2016 were convicted on Friday.",
      "The ringleader and seven other people involved in the heist were found guilty, but will not return to prison. The court acquitted two defendants who were accused of handing out information about Kardashian's whereabouts.",
      "Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, 69, the ringleader, was handed the heaviest sentence of eight years imprisonment. Five of those years are a suspended sentence. Due to time already served in jail, he will not return to detention.",
      "Three others who were accused of the most serious charges \u2014 Yunis Abbas, Didier Dubreucq and Marc-Alexandre Boyer \u2014 each got seven years, five of them suspended. Like Khedache, they will not return to detention. Dubreucq, 69, was absent from the sentencing as he is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",
      "Prosecutors had called for the four to face 10-year sentences. The chief judge, David De Pas, said the ages of the defendants \u2014 the oldest is 79 and some others are in their 60s and 70s \u2014 weighed on the court's decision not to impose harsher sentences that would have sent them to jail. Boyer, 35, is the only young person involved in the crime.",
      "\"It would have been unjust to take you to prison this evening,\" De Pas said. He said the nine years between the robbery and the trial were also taken into account in the sentencing.",
      "Still, he said that Kardashian had been traumatized by the robbery in her hotel.",
      "\"You caused harm, even if you didn't strike physically and blood was not spilt,\" De Pas said. \"You caused fear.\"",
      "Kardashian was in Paris for Fashion Week in October 2016, staying in a discreet hotel in the center of the city. In emotional four-and-a-half-hour testimony 10 days ago, she told the Paris court she \"absolutely\" believed she was going to be \"raped and killed\" when one of the armed, masked robbers grabbed her leg and pulled her toward him as she lay on her bed wearing just a bathrobe.",
      "She was bound with zip ties and duct tape and locked in the bathroom while the robbers searched her room for the expensive jewelry they said they had seen on social media posts by the woman they recognized only as \"the rapper's wife\" \u2014 a reference to her then-husband Kanye West.",
      "Kardashian, who was not present for the sentencing, said in a statement that she was \"deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice\" in the case. In court, lawyers for Kardashian said the reality star was \"satisfied\" with the verdict.",
      "\"The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family,\" she said in her statement. \"While I'll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all.\"",
      "The 10 accused have been known in France as les papys braqueurs, or the \"Grandpa robbers,\" because of their ages. Some arrived in court in orthopedic shoes and Khedache, now deaf and largely mute, leaned on a cane. Khedache and Abbas, who previously admitted to their parts in the robbery, apologized to Kardashian and the court before their sentencing and conviction.",
      "In a scribbled note to the court, Khedache offered \"a thousand apologies.\" He also apologized to his son, Harminy A\u00eft Khedache, 38, who was a driver for the gang that night. Khedache's DNA, found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece of jewelry ever recovered.",
      "Abbas, 71, who had already apologized directly to Kardashian for contributing to the trauma she said she lives with daily, told the court: \"All I have to say is to apologize to you again; I'm sorry for what I may have done.\"",
      "He was suspected of being the lookout for the gang, stationed outside the luxury residence known as the No Name hotel.",
      "Khedache's son Harminy, 38, accused of having been a driver for the gang that night, was given a five-year sentence, with four of those years suspended.",
      "The only woman in the dock, Christiane Glotin, 79, former companion of Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, who was accused of being the gang's \"secretary,\" was given a four-year suspended sentence.",
      "Fran\u00e7ois Delaporte, charged with being an accomplice, was handed a three-year suspended sentence. Marc Boyer, father of Marc-Alexandre Boyer, was fined $5,700 on weapons charges.",

      "President Trump said Friday that Russia and Ukraine had carried out a large exchange of prisoners from their more than three-year war, while Ukrainian and Russian officials said the swap was ongoing but not yet complete. The details remained unconfirmed, but the swap appeared to be one of the few signs of any progress in international efforts to halt the fighting.",
      "\"A major prisoners swap was just completed between Russia and Ukraine,\" Mr. Trump said on his Truth Social platform. He said it would \"go into effect shortly,\" although it was not clear what that meant.",
      "A senior Ukrainian official familiar with the details of the swap told The Associated Press that the exchange was ongoing Friday morning but had not finished. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense later confirmed that the swap was underway, saying the two countries had exchanged 270 prisoners of war and 120 civilians, and that the process would continue in the coming days, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Both Russian and Ukrainian media outlets reported in recent days that a swap had been agreed for about 1,000 prisoners to be handed over by each side, but those overall figures were not confirmed by either government on Friday.",
      "Shamsail Saraliev, a senior Russian lawmaker and representative of the parliamentary coordination group on military operations, told the country's RBC\u00a0news agency on Thursday that it would be difficult to conduct a prisoner exchange with Ukraine involving as many as 2,000 prisoners in total in just a day, saying the process would likely take several days.",
      "\"This could lead to something big???\" Mr. Trump said in his post on Friday, apparently referring to international diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting. White House and National Security Council officials did not immediately respond to requests for further details.",

      "The prosecution has roughly six weeks to prove Diddy helmed a criminal enterprise used to sexually exploit women, including Cassie. Authorities charged Diddy with multiple counts of racketeering conspiracy,\u00a0sex trafficking\u00a0by force, fraud or coercion and transporting for prostitution in 2024.",
      "\"Week two of the Combs trial helped the prosecution corroborate Ventura\u2019s testimony through independent witnesses and establish the elements of sex trafficking and racketeering,\" former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Fox News Digital. \"The defense scored some points on cross-examination, but I think they\u2019re way behind.\"",

      "\"The defense is doing a great job at exploiting witness testimony to support their theory of the case and show that while Mr. Combs may be a \u2018bad actor\u2019 when it comes to domestic violence, etc. \u2014 something no one is condoning \u2014 the federal charges are unsubstantiated based on the testimony we have heard to date, in my opinion,\" attorney David S. Seltzer told Fox News Digital. \"While we cannot hear the testimony in real time because we are in Federal Court, I think the Government is not meeting their burden to date.\"",

      "\"To date, we have heard consistent testimony from several of the witnesses that Diddy was violent with Cassie Ventura, was controlling over her, instructed what to do in the \u2018freak offs\u2019 and was a jealous boyfriend, but none of this is sufficient to justify a criminal enterprise or a pattern of criminal conduct,\" Lovell, of The Lovell Firm, explained. \"Cassie\u2019s relationship can be as easily characterized as she was in love with Diddy, performed \u2018freak offs\u2019 because of her feelings for him and stayed with him for personal benefits such as furthering her career, developing connections, and being taken care of financially. Reasonable doubt looms very heavy in these first two weeks of trial.

      "On Thursday, the jury heard from rapper Kid Cudi \u2014 who testified that he had a romantic relationship with Diddy's ex, Cassie, in 2011. Kid Cudi testified that when Diddy found out about the relationship, he broke into the musician's home and later allegedly set fire to his car. However, there was no definitive evidence to prove Kid Cudi's claims.",
      "\"Ventura told Kid Cudi that Combs would hit and kick her, but Combs\u2019 lawyers elicited testimony that Cassie never said anything about sexual abuse, which is important,\" Rahmani, founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers, said. \"Kid Cudi broke up with Ventura because Combs was violent, and he was concerned for his own safety. He also said Ventura was playing both him and Combs. That\u2019s a central theory for the defense: that Ventura is a strong, independent woman who made her own decisions, including willingly participating in the swingers lifestyle.\"",

      "\"The government is trying to put the pieces together for a RICO charge, but so far the testimony of The Punisher and Kid Cudi did not help them,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"The Punisher, I believe, bolstered the defense position that all the activities were consensual, and that Cassie was a willing participant, stating he observed Ventura \u2018sighing or wincing\u2019 at Combs\u2019 repeated directions, he interpreted it \u2018as frustration\u2019 with the situation rather than unwillingness to participate. Furthermore, stating he believed their experiences were \u2018completely natural.\u2019 Kid Cudi\u2019s recount of decade-old allegations also assisted the defense, which was supported by the Judge sustaining an objection by the defense when it came to a speculative statement that Mr. Combs committed burglary and/or arson.\"",
      "\"The police in both those allegations could not connect Mr. Combs to the incidents, and the \u2018apology\u2019 by Mr. Combs years later, in my opinion, is not an admission to anything other than, sorry we had issues regarding Ms. Ventura,\" Seltzer added. \"The government put on a Homeland Security agent to show all the items seized in Mr. Combs\u2019 house. That tactic is a continuation of the government trying to paint Mr. Combs as a bad actor, someone the jury can convict because he is devious and reprehensible, but the testimony of the drugs, firearms and baby oil still do not support the charges.\"",

Combs was upset Cassie was in a relationship with Kid Cudi and Combs demanded that Cassie pay him $20,000. If Cassie refused, Combs said he would release two sex tapes of her and send someone to hurt her and Kid Cudi. Regina took out a home equity line to pay Combs the money.",

      "However, his subtle comedic timing and authenticity quickly made his character an icon of 1980s television.",
      "Wendt reunited with former \"Cheers\" cast members Ted Danson and Woody Harrelson last year on their \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" podcast, and the trio quickly began to reminisce about the shenanigans they got up to, which closely resembled the way their characters joked around with each other.",

      "Danson remembered that before Nicholas Colasanto, who played Coach on the show, died during the third season, his heart condition had left him forgetful, and he began to cover every surface of the set with his lines, including one about a friend who\u2019d died that read: \"It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s still here with us.\"",
      "He said the cast noticed the line the first time they came back to the set after Colasanto's death.",
      "\"I think we all basically burst into tears \u2018cause it was how we were all feeling. And then we would make a ritual, for the next four or five years, as we came down to greet the audience, everyone would touch the [line] \u2018It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s here with us.\u2019\"",

      "YUMA, ARIZONA \u2013 Republican attorneys general from 11 states visited the U.S.-Mexico border wall in remote Yuma, Arizona, this week touting a more than 90% decrease in illegal crossings since President Donald Trump began his second term.",
      "Their visit came a day before the House narrowly passed Trump\u2019s \"big, beautiful bill,\" which in part allocates $46.5 billion to revive construction of the wall, which at its current stage covers just a fourth of the approximately 1,900-mile-long stretch separating the United States from Mexico. In Yuma, a city of just 110,000 people, local officials briefed the Republican attorneys general of Kansas, Mississippi, Kentucky, South Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Alabama, Montana, Iowa and Indiana on how an average of 1,500 people were illegally crossing the border a day during the first six months of the Biden administration. That\u2019s dropped to about four daily illegal crossings since Trump took office.",
      "In addition to the border wall itself, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach -- chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association \u2013 told Fox News Digital the administration needs other \"force multipliers,\" especially with the task of carrying out the \"largest interior removal since the Eisenhower administration.\" He announced an additional three GOP states entered into 287(G) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which means local and state deputies and officers are trained to exercise federal law enforcement powers, including making immigration-related arrests, initiating removal processes, conducting investigations and tapping into ICE databases.",

      "\"The thing the Trump administration needs the most right now is force multipliers,\" Kobach said. \"Even if we doubled the number of Border Patrol agents at ICE stations, we still wouldn't have enough. This border wall, which I'm looking at, is one force multiplier at the border. The other big force multiplier is state and local law enforcement signing 287(g) agreements and then helping ICE in the interior. And that's where the red states are leading the way.\"",
      "South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said 540 kilograms of fentanyl and 850 kilograms of cocaine were trafficked into the Palmetto State originated from Mexican drug cartels. One kilo alone is enough to kill half a million people.",
      "\"This is the kind of stuff that keeps me up at night. I have two teenage kids in high school. When you hear about parents losing a kid in an overdose, it really strikes at your core. And so it's not just about law enforcement, it's about national security,\" Wilson told Fox News Digital. \"As a 29-year veteran of the Army, an Iraq war veteran. I think in terms of national security, as well as law enforcement. This right here, what happens here, President Trump's policies here have empowered local law enforcement and local and state prosecutors like myself to be able to more effectively combat the illicit activity, starting with Mexican drug cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua.\"",
      "Wilson said it\u2019s important to fortify a \"digital border,\" noting how Mexican drug cartels, Chinese nationals and other illicit criminal organizations launder the proceeds of human and drug trafficking and other crimes using platforms such as WeChat. Wilson has partnered with North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, and attorneys general from four other states in a bipartisan effort to target the Chinese app allegedly linked to the international fentanyl trade.",
      "The 11 Republican attorneys general in Yuma highlighted the importance of making the trip to the southern border despite their home states not directly bordering Mexico. Under the Biden administration, the Republicans argued that every state became a border state with the trafficking of fentanyl and other deadly drugs, as well as people across the border.",

      "\"Alabama may not be a border state, but we\u2019ve seen the cost of an open border \u2013 fentanyl deaths, rising crime. The difference now? It\u2019s not the law that changed, it\u2019s the leadership,\" Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said. \"Border encounters are down 93%, gotaways down 95%. That\u2019s the result of letting immigration enforcement do their jobs. We\u2019re no longer the last line of defense\u2014we\u2019re partners in restoring the rule of law.\"",
      "\"When federal officials can\u2019t do their jobs, every state becomes a border state\u2014even Indiana,\" Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said. \"We were the first non-border state to sue the Biden administration over its lawless immigration policies. Now, under new leadership, morale at the border has skyrocketed. I\u2019m here not just for our law enforcement, but for the teachers overwhelmed by the fallout, for the parents and professionals caught in a broken system. Enough is enough.\"",
      "A stop on the tour included seeing pallets of $2 million worth of border wall supplies paid for under Trump\u2019s first term that the Biden administration prevented federal contractors from erecting \u2013 something Kobach categorized as \"dereliction of duty\" and \"deliberate efforts to keep our border open.\" The Republican attorneys general also heard from the local hospital system, which incurred $26 million in unreimbursed care costs during a six-month period between December 2021 and May 2022 primarily due to treating migrants. At the peak of the crisis, approximately 350,000 illegal aliens crossed the border through the Yuma sector in a single year under the Biden administration.",
      "The surge caused $1.2 million in losses to three family farms in the region, as migrants camped out and defecated around crops. Local officials underscored the national food security risks given Yuma produces 2,500 semi-loads of leafy greens per day during peak season. The Marine Top Gun School brings thousands more U.S. Marines to Yuma every six months, but live-fire drills had to be shut down due to the surge in illegal crossings near ranges, local officials told the attorneys general, highlighting how military readiness was also impacted due to the Biden border crisis.",

      "\"Many of them were rotated down here to put in pretty lengthy shifts. I heard the challenges. They were very, very frustrated, and a lot put in retirements. We had a lot of agents who just flat quit because they were demoralized,\" Knudsen said, noting how Border Patrol agents who briefed the attorneys general in Yuma reported how the \"difference is absolutely night and day\" since Trump has returned to office with the amount of resources and support at their disposal.",

      "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with.",
      "Passwords are outdated, and it's time for both tech companies and users to move on. There, I said it. Like it or not, the weakest link in cybersecurity is anything that relies on human input. While organizations continue to invest in firewalls and endpoint security, the most persistent vulnerability remains the human password.",
      "The internet has long struggled with poor password practices, but a recent discovery highlights just how serious the problem is.",
      "Security researchers have uncovered more than 19 billion newly leaked passwords, collected from hundreds of breaches between April 2024 and April 2025. An astonishing 94% of these passwords were either reused, predictable or both.",

      "What you need to know",
      "Between April 2024 and April 2025, data from nearly 200 separate cybersecurity incidents became publicly available, as discovered by\u00a0Cybernews. These were not isolated events. They involved massive leak repositories including combolists, stealer logs and compromised databases. In total, over 3 terabytes of raw leaked data were analyzed, comprising more than 19 billion passwords. Only 6 percent of these, just over 1.1 billion, were unique.",
      "Among the most used passwords, \"123456\" appeared in over 338 million instances. Words like \"Password\" and \"admin\" followed close behind, despite years of public warnings. Such defaults often originate from devices like routers or enterprise tools, where they are rarely changed and frequently reused elsewhere.",
      "1.7 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED ON DARK WEB AND WHY YOURS IS AT RISK",
      "Personal names remain a common pattern as well. The name \"Ana\" appeared in nearly 179 million passwords, followed by countless other first names and name-based combinations. Pop culture, food, cities and even swear words were frequent themes. Words like \"Mario,\" \"love,\" \"pizza,\" \"Rome\" and various profanities were not just creative choices. They are now security liabilities.",
      "Even worse, attackers do not need to guess anymore. They have automation. Credential stuffing tools now run through billions of known passwords across hundreds of platforms, breaching accounts at success rates as high as two percent. That equates to thousands of compromised profiles, bank accounts, emails and cloud tools every single day.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "The bigger problem",
      "According to CyberNews researcher Neringa Macijauskaite, the core issue is not just weak passwords but how often they are reused. Only six percent of passwords are unique. For most users, security depends entirely on\u00a0two-factor authentication, if it is enabled at all.",
      "Most passwords fall between eight to 10 characters, with eight being the most common. Around 27 percent of them contain only lowercase letters and digits, making them highly vulnerable to brute force attacks. Less than 20 percent use a mix of cases and numbers, and only a small fraction includes symbols.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Despite widespread education efforts, user habits remain stagnant, but one positive trend has emerged. In 2022, only one percent of passwords used a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols. Now that figure has grown to 19 percent, likely driven by stricter password requirements across platforms.",

      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your password is stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links:\u00a0Infostealer malware is the root cause of why your password is out there. It often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "4. Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Unlike a search engine that simply points you to existing content, AI can generate entirely new ideas, images and text based on what you ask. It\u2019s more than a search box; it\u2019s a creative tool.

    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier has the latest on the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's partnership with the Gladstone Institutes for the \"Decoding Broken Hearts\" initiative on \"Special Report.\"",
      "Imagine having a tireless guardian watching over you during your subway commute. It notices every detail with steady focus, all with one goal in mind: keeping you safe on the subway.",
      "New York City's subway system is testing artificial intelligence to boost security and reduce crime. Michael Kemper, a 33-year NYPD veteran and the chief security officer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which is the largest transit agency in the United States, is leading the rollout of AI software designed to spot suspicious behavior as it happens.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How AI surveillance will work in the New York City Subway",
      "The AI system will analyze real-time camera feeds across subway platforms and train cars to detect unusual or potentially dangerous behaviors. Instead of identifying individuals, the technology focuses on behavior patterns that might signal trouble, such as erratic movements or confrontations. When the AI flags something suspicious, it can alert transit police to respond quickly, which could help prevent crimes before they escalate.",
      "Currently, about 40% of subway cameras are monitored live by staff. The AI aims to expand this coverage without needing additional personnel, which could enhance safety across the system. While details about the AI providers and full deployment timelines have not been shared, the MTA emphasizes that facial recognition technology will not be part of this system. This is intended to protect rider privacy.",

We do not yet know exactly which behaviors the system will flag or how effective it will be in practice. Perhaps more importantly, privacy advocates and civil liberties groups warn about potential biases in AI systems and the risk of false positives that could unfairly target certain groups.",
      "The MTA's decision to exclude facial recognition is a positive step, but ongoing transparency and oversight will be crucial. Michael Kemper's extensive experience leading the NYPD's Transit Bureau, where he helped reduce subway crime, adds credibility to the initiative.

Scammers often copy the names and logos of trusted brands, but the web address or page details may be off. Always double-check the URL for slight misspellings or extra characters and avoid clicking links in ads if you're unsure about their legitimacy.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true:\u00a0If an ad offers products at an unbelievable price or promises huge returns, pause and investigate before clicking. Scammers often use flashy discounts or urgent language to lure people in quickly. Take a moment to think before you act, and remember that if something sounds impossible, it probably is.",
      "3. Research the seller:\u00a0Search for reviews and complaints about the company or individual. If you can't find any credible information, it's best to avoid the offer. A quick online search can reveal if others have reported scams or had bad experiences, and legitimate businesses usually have a track record you can verify.",
      "4. Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0There are companies that can help remove your personal info from data brokers and people-search sites. This means less of your data floating around for scammers to find and use. While these services usually charge a fee, they can save you a lot of time and hassle compared to doing it all yourself. Over time, you might notice fewer spam calls, emails and even a lower risk of identity theft.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5. Never share sensitive information:\u00a0Don't enter your credit card or bank details on unfamiliar sites. If you're asked for personal information, double-check the legitimacy of the request. Scammers may ask for sensitive data under the guise of \"verifying your identity\" or processing a payment, but reputable companies will never ask for this through insecure channels.",
      "6. Keep your devices updated: Keeping your\u00a0software updated adds an extra layer of protection against the latest threats. Updates often include important security patches that fix vulnerabilities hackers might try to exploit. By regularly updating your devices, you help close those security gaps and keep your personal information safer from scammers and malware.",
      "7. Report suspicious ads:\u00a0If you see a scam ad on Facebook or Instagram, report it using the platform's tools. This helps alert others and puts pressure on Meta to take action. Reporting is quick and anonymous, and it plays a crucial role in helping platforms identify patterns and remove harmful content.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts:\u00a0Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions, especially after making online purchases. Early detection can help you limit the damage if your information is compromised, and most banks have fraud protection services that can assist you if you spot something suspicious.",
      "By following these steps, you can better protect yourself and your finances from online scams. Staying alert and informed is your best defense in today's digital world.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The mess with scam ads on Meta's platforms shows why it's important to look out for yourself online. Meta says it's working on the problem, but many people think it's not moving fast enough. By staying careful, questioning suspicious offers and using good security tools, you can keep yourself safer. Until the platforms step up their game, protecting yourself is the smartest move you can make.",

      "Removing your personal information from people-search sites can feel pretty overwhelming. There are hundreds of these sites in the U.S. alone. In fact, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse says there are over 500 companies that collect and sell personal information.",
      "At first, it might seem impossible to get your details removed from all of them. But here's the good news: You don't need to tackle every single site. Your information isn't on all 500-plus sites.",

      "First, find which people-search sites have your info",
      "The process will be easier if you have a list of people-search sites that have your personal information. Not only can you check them off as you go, but you'll also need a list for the last step. The easiest place to start is with a\u00a0free scan that some data removal services provide. These scans automatically check a ton of people-search sites for your personal information and send you a report. You can also search for your full name on Google. This will probably bring up a mix of results, including your social media profiles.",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR DATA YOURSELF? HERE'S WHY YOU'RE PROBABLY WRONG",
      "The bigger your online presence, the more search results you'll likely have to sift through to find the people-search sites. I recommend searching for your name together with other personal details, like your email, phone number or home address. For some reason, this is more likely to bring up people-search sites, different ones depending on the combination of personal details you try. You may not be able to find all the people-search sites that have your info like this, though. You should also check any state-specific people-search sites, like\u00a0StateofFlorida.com, and search all of the most popular people-search sites like:",

      "Follow the opt-out process for each site",
      "Every people-search site has its own opt-out process, but most of them will require you to do something like this:",
      "Find your listing:\u00a0You'll usually need to search for your name, phone number, address or email on the site.Submit a removal request:\u00a0Most sites have an online form where you can request removal. Look for links that say \"Opt-Out,\" \"Do Not Sell My Info\" or \"Privacy Rights,\" which are usually found in the website footer.Verify your request:\u00a0Most sites will send you a confirmation email with a link you'll need to click. Some ask for a phone call verification. A few people-search sites request documents, like a photo ID (I recommend avoiding sending sensitive documents unless absolutely necessary).

      "Many sites require email verification. Using your regular email can expose it to spam or further data collection. Creating a dedicated or alias email address just for these requests helps protect your primary inbox and keeps things organized. Also, using various email aliases makes it so you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone verification and a secondary number",
      "If a site requires phone verification, consider using a secondary number to avoid exposing your personal phone number. Services like\u00a0Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private. The process should take between five and 20 minutes for each site on your list, depending on how difficult they make it for you. But once you submit the request, removal is usually pretty quick. Your information should be off the site within 24 hours to a week, though it can sometimes take up to 30 days.",
      "Don't forget about Google search results",
      "People-search sites aren't the only places your info can pop up. Sometimes your personal info appears directly in Google search results, pulled from public records or other sites. If you find sensitive info in Google results, you can request removal through Google's own removal tools, especially if the info includes things like your Social Security number, bank account info or images you don't want to be public. This is a separate process, but it is worth doing alongside removing info from people-search sites.",

      "Keep in mind, this isn't a one-and-done deal",
      "Even after you remove your info, there's a good chance it'll show up again. People-search sites constantly scrape public records and other databases to refresh their listings. Some sites offer \"suppression lists\" you can add your name to, but it's not a perfect system. Small changes, like a slightly different address, a new phone number or a missing middle name, can slip past their filters and pop up as a \"new\" profile.",
      "The best way to stay on top of it is to set a reminder to recheck the main people-search sites every few months and repeat the opt-out process when needed. Maintaining a detailed tracker or spreadsheet with the sites you've contacted, dates and confirmation info can make this easier and help you avoid missing any sites.",

But even if you don't live in one of these states, you should still submit removal requests. Most people-search sites do not filter opt-out requests by state; they generally process any request they receive to avoid potential legal issues, regardless of your location.",
      "If this sounds like too much work, there's help",
      "Removing your data manually takes real time and commitment, especially since you have to keep doing it to stay off these sites. That's why many people turn to personal data removal services. Instead of going site by site yourself, a service can automatically send removal requests on your behalf, track the responses and re-request removals if your data reappears later.",

      "Manual removal is free and gives you full control, but it takes time and requires ongoing effort. Automated services cost money but save you time, handle rechecks and can catch new listings faster. Choose what best fits your budget and privacy needs.

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 16:07:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reports that healthcare information of more than 430,000 Ascension patients was exposed in a data breach.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how users can keep their genetic data safe amid DNA testing company 23andMe's bankruptcy sale.",
      "The state of cybersecurity in the healthcare industry worries me a lot. Healthcare organizations, whether nonprofit or for-profit, collect an enormous amount of data. And it's not just phone numbers, addresses or emails but also sensitive information like medical records, insurance details and more. This data is extremely valuable, which makes it a prime target for hackers.",
      "What's worse is that many healthcare institutions often neglect cybersecurity and treat it as an afterthought. In 2024 alone, an industry tracker recorded 1,160 healthcare breaches that exposed 305 million patient records. This marked a 26% increase compared to the previous year.",
      "Against this backdrop, Ascension, a Missouri-based Catholic health system with 142 hospitals and 142,000 employees, recently disclosed that a December 2024 breach exposed the personal and medical information of more than 430,000 patients.",

      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "According to\u00a0Ascension's breach notification letters, the compromise began on Dec. 5, 2024, when the network learned patient data\u00a0\"may have been involved in a potential security incident.\" By Jan. 21, 2025, its investigators had determined that Ascension had \"inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner,\" and that attackers likely stole data from that partner via a flaw in its software. In other words, patient records passed from Ascension into a third party's system and were then siphoned off by cybercriminals.",
      "The attackers gained a broad array of information. Impacted patients' demographic and financial details, names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, gender and Social Security numbers were exposed. Even more worryingly, the breach included clinical data from hospital stays, including physician names, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and procedure codes, medical record numbers and insurance details. This is the very data that criminals can exploit for fraud or identity theft.",
      "A healthcare worker typing on a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Timeline and involvement",
      "Ascension reported the breach to regulators via an HHS filing on April 28, 2025, which shows 437,329 patients affected. By comparison, the company had earlier disclosed the impact in state filings. For example, 114,692 Texas patients and 96 Massachusetts residents were individually notified of exposure. In response, Ascension is offering those affected two years of free identity monitoring services (credit monitoring, fraud consultation and identity theft restoration).",
      "For scale, Ascension is a major nonprofit health system, one of the largest in the U.S., operating 142 hospitals across North America. The company has not named the third-party partner, but its description fits a vendor whose secure file-transfer software was breached.",
      "The timing aligns with a series of\u00a0recent Cl0p ransomware attacks. Cl0p has publicly claimed responsibility for exploiting a zero-day flaw in Cleo's secure file-transfer products, stealing data from dozens of organizations worldwide. While Ascension itself was not directly hit by ransomware, its data might have ended up in that same attack campaign.",
      "Ascension's patients and employees are no strangers to data breaches. In May 2024, a\u00a0Black Basta ransomware attack compromised Ascension's own network. That incident, traced back to a single employee opening a malicious file, resulted in the exfiltration of data belonging to nearly 5.6 million people.",
      "The fallout was severe. Hospitals lost access to digital records, forcing clinicians to record vitals, medications and orders on paper. Elective procedures and some appointments were paused, and emergency services were redirected to unaffected facilities to avoid delays in care.",
      "We reached out to Ascension for a comment on our article but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Ascension data breach.",
      "1) Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, Ascension attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Ascension breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Ascension breach, including Social Security numbers and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports: Regularly check your credit reports through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6) Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7) Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Attackers have frequently targeted Ascension, but the company does not seem to be learning its lesson. If it were a one-off incident, it might be understandable. But how do you fail to strengthen cybersecurity after experiencing a nationwide blackout? Rather than being an isolated event, this breach feels like part of a larger pattern. The industry relies on complex vendor networks and outdated IT systems, while cybercriminals continue to exploit emerging vulnerabilities.",

      "Scammers are always coming up with new tricks. Just when you start feeling confident about spotting phishing emails, suspicious links and fake banking apps, they find a new angle. Lately, they have been getting more creative, turning to the built-in features of our phones to pull off their schemes. One of the latest targets is NFC, the technology behind tap-to-pay.",
      "It might seem harmless, but a new scam is using it in ways most people would never expect. An Android malware called SuperCard goes beyond just stealing your card details. It gives attackers the ability to use your card remotely for real transactions. And the worst part is that it all begins with something as simple as a text message.",

      "What makes SuperCard X different?",
      "SuperCard X stands out from other Android malware because of how it operates. As reported by\u00a0researchers at Cleafy, instead of stealing usernames, passwords or verification codes, it uses a method called NFC relay. This allows attackers to copy card data from a victim's device in real time and use it elsewhere to make payments or withdraw cash. The process does not require physical access to the card or knowledge of the PIN.",
      "The malware is offered through a Malware-as-a-Service model, which means different cybercriminals can use it in their own regions. This makes the threat more scalable and harder to contain. Unlike most banking trojans, SuperCard X is not focused on one specific institution. It targets any cardholder regardless of which bank issued their card.",
      "Another key difference is how stealthy the malware is. It uses minimal permissions and does not include extra features that would make it easier to detect. This lean approach helps it avoid detection by antivirus software and allows it to operate quietly on infected devices.",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",

      "The fraud begins with a message sent through SMS or WhatsApp. It pretends to be from a bank and warns the recipient about a suspicious transaction. The message includes a phone number and urges the person to call to resolve the issue. This is the first step in gaining the victim's trust.",
      "Once on the phone, the attacker poses as a bank representative and walks the victim through a fake security process. This may include asking them to confirm personal details or adjust settings in their mobile banking app, such as removing spending limits on their card.",
      "Next, the attacker asks the victim to install a mobile app that is described as a tool to verify the account or enhance security. In reality, this app contains the SuperCard X malware. After the installation, the attacker instructs the victim to tap their card against the phone. The malware then captures the NFC data from the card and sends it to a second phone controlled by the attacker.",
      "Using the copied data, the attacker can make contactless payments or make ATM withdrawals almost instantly. This method allows them to steal funds quickly and leaves little opportunity for banks or victims to intervene in time.",

      "1) Be cautious of suspicious texts and calls. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Fraudulent campaigns often begin with an SMS or call that seems to come from your bank. These messages usually claim there's suspicious activity on your account and urge you to click a link or dial a number to resolve the issue. However, this is a tactic used to gain access to your personal information. Always approach such messages with skepticism.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:\u00a0One of the key ways malware like SuperCard X spreads is through deceptive apps that victims are persuaded to install. These apps often look harmless, posing as tools for security or account verification. If you receive a link to download an app via SMS, email or messaging apps like WhatsApp, do not click on it. Instead, only download apps from trusted sources, such as the Google Play Store. Additionally, carefully review app permissions and avoid granting unnecessary access, particularly to sensitive data like NFC, location or personal contacts.",
      "3) Turn off NFC when not in use:\u00a0NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a useful feature that allows contactless payments and data exchanges. However, it can be exploited by attackers to capture your card information without you even realizing it. To minimize your risk of falling victim to NFC-based malware like SuperCard X, turn off NFC when you're not actively using it.",
      "On most Android devices, you can do this by going to \"Settings,\" then \"Connected Devices\" or \"Connection Preferences,\" where you\u2019ll find the NFC toggle. By disabling NFC, your phone won't transmit data wirelessly, which helps protect your payment card information from being stolen by nearby attackers.",
      "4) Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and cards:\u00a0If your device has come into contact with the SuperCard or anything similar, it\u2019s possible your banking details are already compromised. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to regularly check your transaction history for anything odd, like a small payment you don\u2019t remember making or a charge from a strange location could be a sign of misuse. If you spot anything suspicious, report it to your bank right away. It\u2019s also worth checking your credit reports every now and then to catch signs of identity theft before they snowball into bigger issues.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: If scammers have targeted you once, there's a higher chance they\u2019ll try again, especially if your personal details (like your phone number, address or email) are easily found online. Data removal services scan people-search sites and brokers, then request the removal of your info. This reduces your exposure and helps prevent future phishing or social engineering attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Contact your bank and freeze your cards:\u00a0If you think you\u2019ve tapped or handled a suspicious card, or if your phone acted strangely afterward, don\u2019t brush it off. Call your bank and let them know what happened. They can freeze your card to stop any unauthorized payments and issue a new one for added safety. You should also ask them to monitor your account more closely for a while. On top of that, place a fraud alert with a credit bureau so no one can easily open a new line of credit in your name.",
      "7) Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you've been targeted by a sophisticated scam like SuperCard X, there's a chance your personal information, not just your card data, may be at risk. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information, like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8) Report the scam to your national cybercrime authority: Whether or not you lost money, reporting the scam helps authorities track emerging threats and warn others. You can report such fraud to the FBI\u2019s\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center or the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. Your report could help catch the people behind the scam or at least shut down their infrastructure.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The SuperCard X malware campaign represents a significant shift in how cybercriminals are targeting individuals and financial institutions. By exploiting NFC technology and combining it with social engineering tactics, attackers have found a way to bypass traditional fraud detection systems. What's especially concerning is how quickly these attacks unfold, making them harder to detect before the damage is done. As this threat evolves, it's important for both consumers and institutions to recognize the potential risks of these multilayered fraud strategies.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on China\u2019s Zhiyuan unveiling the world\u2019s first tri-ducted wearable eVTOL with hands-free control.",
      "Have you ever imagined what personal flying could look like in the near future? China's Zhiyuan Research Institute, based in Hangzhou, is bringing that vision closer to reality. They just unveiled what they're calling the world's first tri-ducted wearable electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for individual use, and their recent demo flight is already sparking curiosity about the future of personal flight.",

      "Tri-ducted wearable eVTOL for individual use (Zhiyuan Research Institute) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's so special about this flying machine?",
      "The coolest thing about this eVTOL is its tri-ducted propulsion system. That means it has three powerful propellers, one on the left, one on the right and one in the back, all working together to keep the aircraft stable and efficient. This setup isn't just for show. It actually helps the vehicle fly smoother, cut down on noise and hover more reliably. It's the first time a manned aircraft has used this kind of design, which is pretty groundbreaking.",
      "Safety is a huge focus for the Zhiyuan team. They built in a one-click separation system that lets the pilot quickly detach from the aircraft and deploy a low-altitude parachute if something goes wrong. That way, the pilot can land safely even in an emergency, which is a big comfort for anyone flying solo.",
      "Flying this thing isn't just for experts. Zhiyuan developed a ground control system that helps keep things simple. The eVTOL can hover steadily and fly on its own without the pilot having to constantly control it, and it can make quick, agile moves when needed. The controls are designed to be easy to use, so even people without much flying experience can handle them.",
      "On the power side, the team created a new propulsion system with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. They used advanced ducted motor designs to make the whole thing more efficient. Plus, the flight control system can handle turbulent weather, so the ride stays smooth even when the air gets rough.",

      "What could you use this for?",
      "This wearable eVTOL isn't just a cool gadget. Zhiyuan sees it as being useful in all kinds of real-world situations. It could help with emergency rescues, maintaining electrical infrastructure or cleaning skyscrapers. It also has the potential for sightseeing and leisure flights, and it could be used for border patrol or customs inspections. With its versatility and easy controls, this aircraft could be a game changer for both professionals and adventure seekers.",
      "However, there is currently no official information on the commercial availability or price of Zhiyuan's tri-ducted wearable eVTOL. The aircraft has completed its first public demonstration, but details about when it will be available for purchase and at what cost remain undisclosed.",

      "ARE THESE AUTONOMOUS TRANSPORT PODS THE FUTURE OF SKY-HIGH COMMUTING?",
      "China's growing low-altitude economy",
      "This new eVTOL is part of a much bigger trend in China. The country is working hard to grow what it calls its \"low-altitude economy,\" which includes drones, eVTOLs and other aircraft that fly below about 3,280 feet. The government has made low-altitude aviation a priority and is promising support for commercial spaceflight and next-generation air mobility technologies. Experts estimate that this industry could be worth more than $137 billion by 2030 as these aircraft find more uses in areas like logistics, tourism and public services.",

Zhiyuan\u2019s tri-ducted wearable eVTOL is already up in the air, giving us a peek at what getting around might look like down the road. As these things become easier to use and more common, flying could end up being just another way we get from place to place, whether for work, emergencies or just for fun.",

      "Retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Daniel Gade, a wounded soldier who refused to let the enemy win and built a career helping other soldiers in the classroom, is now assisting veterans as they cope with returning to normal life while facing dark times and possibly suicide.",
      "The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) National Veteran Suicide Prevention annual report, released in December 2024, revealed there were 47,891 suicides among all U.S. adults in 2022, averaging just over 131 per day. The numbers included 17.6 veteran suicides per day.",
      "Gade, a two-time Purple Heart recipient, serves as a senior advisor for America\u2019s Warrior Partnership (AWP), which has a mission to partner with communities to prevent veteran suicide, while also helping communities figure out how to provide for their veterans.",
      "Through academic research with Duke University and other institutions, along with state and local agencies, AWP found that the veteran suicide rate is much higher than what is reported.",
      "BIPARTISAN BILL WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR MILITARY RECRUITS WITH MEDICAL ISSUES TO LAND DEFENSE JOBS",
      "Daniel Gade was injured while serving in the Army, and now he spends time helping wounded veterans find their place back in society, while helping to prevent veteran suicide. (America's Warrior Partnership)",
      "In fact, the research conducted by AWP and its partners shows the veteran suicide rate is actually higher, Gade said, because many deaths go unreported. The organization, he added, is conducting rigorous research that is getting to some of the root causes of veteran dislocation, a term Gade used because dislocation, or disconnectedness, is \"kind of a precondition for suicide.\"",
      "\"What they're looking at is the disconnectedness in order to better prevent suicide,\" he said. \"So, it's not about dumping money into crisis lines, because by the time somebody calls a crisis line, it's way too late. And for a lot of people, they never call a crisis line; they just go to the gun safe. And that's not good enough.\"",
      "Instead, the process is about building veterans back up and helping them find their place in society, a process Gade said he personally experienced.",
      "Gade joined the Army in 1992 at the age of 17. A year later, he was accepted into the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in New York. He graduated from the academy in 1997, becoming an armored officer in the Army. Seven years later, he was deployed to Iraq, where he was wounded twice.",

      "The first time he was wounded was in November 2004, when the tank he was in was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade. Gade said he was wounded mildly, though a young soldier next to him, Dennis Miller from La Salle, Michigan, was killed in the attack. Two months later, Gade was involved in another attack.",
      "\"I was hit by a roadside bomb, an IED [improvised explosive device] that caused me to lose my entire right leg. So, I'm a right leg, hip-level amputee,\" he said, adding that the wounds forced him to spend a year in the hospital. \"During that time\u2026 I had to find a way to rebuild myself.\"",
      "Rebuilding meant Gade had to rediscover who he was going to be professionally and personally. It also meant pondering the type of athletics he would be able to do and whether he would be able to provide for his family.",
      "\"All of those were really critical questions 20 years ago when I was trying to solve that problem, and since then, I\u2019ve had a great career,\" he said.",

      "\"I went from being sort of a user-level wounded warrior\u2026 to being at the very highest levels of government, you know, helping to formulate policy that would help wounded warriors,\" Gade said.",
      "Gade retired from the Army in 2017, spending the last six years of his service as a professor at West Point, which he calls \"a phenomenal place.\"",
      "After that, Gade dabbled in politics, making a run for the U.S. Senate in Virginia in 2020 as a Republican against Democratic Sen. Mark Warner. Gade ultimately lost, but he was able to join Glenn Youngkin\u2019s campaign for Virginia governor as an advisor, and when Youngkin won, Gade was tapped to serve as the commissioner of the Department of Veterans Services.",
      "\"I got to go back to my roots, kind of, serving veterans, which is what I\u2019ve done as a personal mission for many years now, basically since I became a wounded warrior back in 2005,\" Gade said.",

      "\"If you think about people in society who are disadvantaged\u2026 you always sort of think about, you know, minorities in the inner city or people born into a tough situation like that,\" Gade explained. \"But very few people know the plight of the American Indian.\"",
      "Gade grew up in North Dakota near a Sioux reservation. Like many Native American reservations, the people who live there suffer from poverty, alcoholism, dysfunctional families, divorce and many other issues.",
      "He explained that many people in the Navajo Nation \u2014 which AWP works with \u2014 join the military because they are patriotic, but also because they are searching for a way to escape and better themselves. Oftentimes, they go on to do great things in the military, Gade said, pointing to the Navajo Code Talkers, who used their native language to create secret codes during World War II.",

(America's Warrior Partnership)",
      "After serving their country, the tribal members return to their communities, but according to Gade, they bring back post-traumatic stress, physical injuries or other conditions that get laid on top of what were already tough economic and social conditions for them.",
      "\"America\u2019s Warrior Partnership, through its connectedness with the Navajo Nation, [is] taking sort of a whole-of-society approach,\" Gade said. \"It\u2019s not just helping police figure out how you divert somebody instead of arresting somebody. In some cases, you might want to offer them resources so they can escape that path themselves.\"",

      "While the VA reports a veteran suicide rate of about 17%, AWP found through Operation Deep Dive that the rate is almost double that.",
      "Gade said the difference came down to unreported suicides. For example, there may be a 25-year-old veteran who crashes a vehicle at midnight, but it is not known why he crashed the car. The coroner may just write the cause of death as a single-vehicle accident, but a deeper dive by Operation Deep Dive may look into the person\u2019s life. That same investigation may find the veteran was despairing, had just gone through a divorce or something along those lines.",
      "Another example where Operation Deep Dive may help is if someone has an overdose of a prescription medication prescribed by the VA. The coroner has to determine if it is accidental or suicide, and by doing a deep dive, the organization is finding that the deaths are more likely than not to have been self-harm or accidental self-harm, rather than just pure accidents.",

      "\"That\u2019s where the difference comes \u2014 it\u2019s expanding our definition of unnatural death to include these others,\" Gade said. \"And then you realize, oh, man, a whole lot of these are suicides and not just single-vehicle accidents.\"",
      "\"Every suicide is tragic, but every suicide, you know, suicide is a disease of despair,\" he added. \"What America's Warrior Partnership is doing is really trying to get at the roots of that and defeat suicide before it comes into somebody's life.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former FBI agent Jason Pack calls New Orleans jailbreak a calculated plan, not \"crime of opportunity.\"",
      "A retired FBI special agent is sounding the alarm after 10 inmates escaped from a New Orleans jail, with five remaining at large, saying this incident \"should get everyone's attention.\"",
      "\"This wasn\u2019t a complicated escape. Ten inmates got out through a hole behind a toilet. It took more than seven hours before anyone noticed they were gone,\" Jason Pack, a retired FBI special agent, said to Fox News Digital. \"That tells you a lot about what\u2019s going on inside that jail. Too few people on staff. Not enough oversight. And likely not enough working equipment or security checks.\"",
      "On Tuesday, an Orleans Parish Jail maintenance worker was arrested and charged in connection with the escape.",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill shared in a statement that Sterling Williams, 33, had been arrested and charged with 10 counts of principal to simple escape and malfeasance in office.",
      "LOUISIANA JAIL WORKER ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY HELPING 10 INMATES ESCAPE ORLEANS PARISH FACILITY",
      "Ten inmates escaped from the jail, according to authorities. (Orleans Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office/WVUE)",
      "\"Williams admitted to agents that one of the escapees advised him to turn the water off in the cell where the inmates escaped from,\" Murrill said in the statement. \"Instead of reporting the inmate, Williams turned the water off as directed, allowing the inmates to carry out their scheme to successfully escape.\"",
      "Pack said the inmates' choice to target a maintenance worker for help was a smart and calculated move.",
      "\"If you think about it, maintenance people are not really looked after there. They're kind of low-key, and they have keys to doors. They have access to utilities and panels, so it was pretty smart to target him on the part of the criminals,\" Pack said.",
      "He added that the prison escape was also not a \"crime of opportunity\" and had most likely been planned for some time.",
      "\"Inmates are resourceful when it comes to things on the inside. It's not out of the realm of possibility that they hatched this plan over a few days or a few weeks,\" Pack said.",
      "Additionally, Williams' arrest may not be the only one coming, Pack theorized, stating that this could be just the first initial wave of arrests as other employees had been suspended.",
      "\"It seems like these inmates are going to exploit any crack in the system they can. And sometimes the cracks will lead to pressure whether waiting or not for folks who are in vulnerable positions. And that seemed to be what happened here, enough so that he (Williams) was able to turn the water off, they were able to pull the toilet out and escape through the corridor there and out the back door,\" Pack said.",
      "\"And I think when we say jailbreak from now on, all of us are going to remember that video of the 10 people just fleeing out the jail.\"",
      "Pack added that \"the bigger issue is what allowed this to happen in the first place.\"",
      "\"That jail had just 36 officers working with over 1,000 inmates. That\u2019s not enough people to keep a place like that running safely. When staff are stretched that thin, it\u2019s easy for things to slip through the cracks. Most jails around the country are dealing with similar problems \u2013 low staffing, budget cuts and buildings that are falling apart,\" Pack said.",
      "The jail is only at 60% staffing, and at the time of the escape, four supervisors and 36 staff members were monitoring 1,400 inmates, authorities said.",
      "Law enforcement search for a fugitive that escaped a prison in New Orleans on Wednesday, May 21, 2025. (Chris Granger/The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate via AP)",

      "Corey Boyd, 19, who was briefly spotted last Friday hours after the jailbreak, was taken into custody Tuesday, the Louisiana State Police said. Boyd was originally jailed for second-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, aggravated battery and threatening a public official.",
      "However, the escapee who is considered most dangerous is Derrick Groves, 27, who remains at large.",

      "Louisiana State Police captured escaped inmate Gary C. Price. (X/@LAStatePolice)",
      "Pack said what makes this case more unique than other prison breaks is the number of convicts that escaped at once.",
      "\"It's very unusual to have a 10-person manhunt in a prison escape like this. These don't happen regularly. And when they do, it just shows you the danger that folks can risk close to the community and why corrections officers are an important part of the law enforcement team,\" Pack said. \"There is a nationwide shortage of correction officers around. They're low-paid and under-appreciated and it's a very difficult job dealing with inmates.\"",
      "Pack said the number one goal for law enforcement right now is getting the inmates \"back into custody quickly and safely.\"",
      "\"Some of them are facing serious charges, and when people are on the run, especially if they\u2019re scared, things can get dangerous fast. They might steal a car, break into a house, or hurt someone if they feel cornered. The longer this drags out, the more chance someone gets hurt,\" Pack said.",
      "The five fugitives still on the run are Groves, Jermaine Donald, 42, Antoine Massey, 33, Leo Tate, 31, and Lenton Vanburen, 27.",
      "Pack added that while it is unlikely any of the convicts fled the country, they would run into obstacles anywhere trying to run, as there are agencies nationwide and around the world assisting in locating them.",
      "\"You can't outrun the feds, and you can't outrun the FBI or the Marshals Service, because they have offices around the country and indeed, around the world,\" Pack said. \"So even if they do happen to make it to another country \u2013 I'm not suggesting that that's what's happened yet \u2013 but if they had to do that, the FBI and the Marshals and federal law enforcement have liaisons in other countries that are able to step in and help them even though they don't have jurisdiction there.",
      "\"So you can run, you can hide, but you can't hide forever. And just because this case may lose traction in the media, it's not going to lose traction with law enforcement.\"",

      "Pack added that having no incidents reported since the inmates escaped has been a \"miracle in itself.\"",
      "\"The fugitives get desperate out there and so when they feel the pressure, and they're feeling the heat, sometimes they act in desperation. So hopefully they'll continue not to. It's possible and likely that they have people on the outside that are helping them hide out in these matters,\" Pack said.",
      "\"Police don\u2019t want this to end with anyone getting injured, including the escapees. The goal is to find them, surround them, and bring them in without any drama,\" Pack continued. \"That\u2019s what officers train for. It\u2019s not about chasing headlines. It\u2019s about doing the job carefully and professionally, even when the public is watching.\"",

      "The ceremonies stand in sharp contrast to the federal wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of Brandon Lynch, 27, a year ago.",
      "One of the commendations, a \u201cGold Award for Uncommon Valor\u201d presented by the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police on May 1, 2024, was handed out two days before the family filed its suit against the officer, Conner Thompson, and the city of Olathe.",
      "In the complaint filed in the District of Kansas, Lynch\u2019s family claims Thompson \u201cunnecessarily escalated the situation\u201d and applied an \u201cunreasonable use of excessive force\u201d that failed to consider proper crisis intervention training.",
      "Details of the awards \u2014 the first of which was given to Thompson by the Kansas City Metropolitan Area Chiefs and Sheriffs Association in November 2023 \u2014 have not been previously reported. A detailed review of the awards shows that Thompson and his then-partner were honored for what police say occurred on the night Lynch was fatally shot, New Year\u2019s Eve in 2022.",
      "Specifically, the Metropolitan Area Chiefs and Sheriffs Association said the officers \u201cresponded to a disturbance\u201d at a home where a woman called to say her brother had assaulted her. Once at the home, the officers told the woman to wait outside while they entered and were confronted by the man, who was armed with a knife and Taser, the group\u2019s narrative of events said.",
      "When the man \u201ccontinued to be aggressive\u201d and did not obey orders, Thompson\u2019s partner attempted to use his department-issued\u00a0Taser on him, but it was \u201cineffective,\u201d the narrative said.",
      "\u201cThe suspect defied Thompson\u2019s commands and advanced towards both officers,\u201d the narrative said. \u201cRecognizing the suspect was in close proximity of the officers, Thompson fired his handgun at the suspect, striking him.\u201d",
      "\u201cDuring a tense situation, Thompson had the wherewithal to conduct life-saving measures,\u201d the narrative added.",
      "The version of events offered by the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police was similar.",
      "Neither narrative mentioned Lynch by name nor explained that a dispatcher had relayed to officers that Lynch was exhibiting a mental health crisis, as his sister had explained when she called 911. Nor did the narratives note that officers had had prior encounters with him at the home, including one time in which Thompson was in a \u201cphysical altercation\u201d with Lynch, according to the Johnson County prosecutors who investigated the shooting and determined \u201cthe officer properly used deadly force in this incident.\u201d",
      "A review of the \u201cvalor\u201d awards given to other officers by the Metropolitan Area Chiefs and Sheriffs Association that year show they were for actions such as saving suicidal people, helping a gunshot victim and assisting an infant who stopped breathing because of a respiratory virus.",
      "The law firm for Lynch\u2019s family, Cannezzaro Marvel LLC in Kansas City, Missouri, declined to comment about the suit or the officer being awarded for his actions on the night Lynch died.",
      "The president of the Metropolitan Area Chiefs and Sheriffs Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dennis Shaw, the executive director of the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police, said in an email that \u201cthe officer was cleared by the District Attorney,\u201d and the narrative the association shared \u201cwas presented to us for consideration.\u201d",
      "While the honor given to Thompson stood out in the awards ceremony, it\u2019s not unheard of for officers to receive commendations related to fatal shooting incidents.",
      "Narene Stokes, whose son, Ryan, was fatally shot by Kansas City, Missouri, police in 2013, recalled feeling \u201cbaffled, angry and confused\u201d when she learned the officers involved in his death were recognized with awards by a local police board for their actions. The award, however, was later rescinded.",

      "In Lynch\u2019s case, police bodycam video was made public when Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe announced that his office would not be charging the officer. \u201cLynch took the actions that caused his death,\u201d he said in May 2023, and \u201cthe officers reacted to the aggressiveness of Lynch throughout that episode.\u201d"

    "summary": "Texas is poised to become the second state to enact an across-the-board ban on social media for minors before its state legislative session ends.",
    "story": [
      "Texas is poised to become the second state to enact an across-the-board ban on social media for minors before its state legislative session ends in a little over a week.",
      "Advocates on both sides of the issue have said the bill would be the strictest state-level regulation yet on social media platforms if enacted. And it comes as other states across the country are considering similar restrictions amid fierce debates over free speech and whether these sorts of policies are the most effective way to achieve supporters' primary goal: improving young Americans' mental health.",
      "If enacted, Texas' bill would put in place vast new restrictions that explicitly bar every Texas resident under 18 years old from signing up for and using \u201ca social media platform.\u201d",
      "The legislation would require all social media platforms to verify the age of all people setting up an account. It would allow parents to request that the platforms delete their child\u2019s social media account \u2014 and require the companies to do so as well within 10 days. Violations are defined in the bill as \u201cdeceptive trade practices,\u201d meaning that they would be both punishable with fines from the state\u2019s attorney general and subject to lawsuits for financial damages.",
      "The Texas House has passed the bill and the state Senate is expected to as well. Andrew Mahaleris, a spokesperson for Gov. Gregg Abbott, a Republican, said that \u201csafety and online privacy for Texas children remain a priority\u201d for Abbott and that he would \u201cthoughtfully review any legislation sent to his desk that seeks to accomplish these goals.\u201d",
      "Such laws have run into major legal challenges by groups contending that such restrictions amount to free speech violations. And even many high-profile supporters of social media restrictions for minors say that bans for young people may not be the ideal policy solution.",
      "\u201cSomething needs to be done,\u201d said Dr. Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology strategy and integration for the American Psychological Association (APA). \u201cThese are things that we know don\u2019t fit with the adolescent brain \u2014 things like endless scroll and \u2018like counts.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cBut an age ban \u2014 that\u2019s like delaying the age of driving but not having any driver's ed,\u201d Prinstein added. \u201cWhy just delay the age and then send kids out for slaughter later?\u201d",
      "The APA has repeatedly urged legislators to be more aggressive in trying to protect adolescents\u2019 mental health, but have advocated for policies more tailored than age restrictions.",
      "A variety of states have recently plowed forward with social media bills centered around age. And all of them \u2014 including Texas' \u2014 have garnered bipartisan support.",
      "Most prominently, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, last year signed a bill prohibiting children younger than 14 from joining social media platforms, becoming the first state to enact such a ban. The law also required that teenagers who are 14 or 15 years old have a parent\u2019s consent before they join a platform.",
      "Florida's ban was allowed to stand after a federal judge in March ruled against requests to block the law, though the legal fight against it continues.",
      "The law reignited a battle among First Amendment and civil liberties advocates over whether such bans amount to restrictions on free speech.",
      "\u201cWe see this as a First Amendment issue, and, as these bills have generally been written, a serious First Amendment problem, because they essentially cut off an entire universe of information, of conversation from [young] people,\u201d said Vera Eidelman, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s\u00a0Speech, Privacy and Technology Project.",
      "Over the past two years, at least nine other states have enacted significant restrictions on the use of social media, including requiring parental consent or age verification. More broadly, lawmakers in 27 states have attempted this year to advance bills that in some way seek to address or regulate minors\u2019 use of social media, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "For example, the Nebraska Legislature approved a bill last week that would require parental consent for anyone under 18 to open a social media account. State House lawmakers in Connecticut last week narrowly approved a bill that would require the same.",
      "Minnesota lawmakers have debated several measures this year, including a tax on companies that mine data on the state's residents and proposed mental health warning labels for social media platforms.",
      "And last year, lawmakers in Georgia, Tennessee and Louisiana passed bills requiring parental consent for anyone under 16 to open a social media account.",
      "Many of these proposals have faced serious legal hurdles. And similar bills in previous years \u2014 including in states like Ohio, Arkansas and California \u2014 faced major legal challenges, with federal judges striking them down on the grounds of free speech violations.",
      "In addition, a social media curfew in Utah that banned the use of platforms for minors between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. enacted in 2023 was scaled down and replaced with more lenient restrictions last year after the original law faced a barrage of lawsuits.",
      "NetChoice, a tech trade group whose members include Meta, Google and X that is staunchly opposed to most social media regulations, has been involved in litigation in those three states and many others where lawmakers have passed legislation seeking to curb social media access to minors. And the group signaled it was poised to do so again with Texas\u2019 bill if it passes.",
      "Chris Marchese, NetChoice's director of litigation, called proposals like the one in Texas \u201ccensorship regimes masquerading as online safety laws\u201d",
      "Each bill, Marchese said in an email, \u201cputs the First Amendment rights of all Americans at risk, online and offline.\u201d",
      "Social media companies have said they\u2019ve made several changes to their platforms that help protect minors.",
      "Since 2023, Meta (the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) started showing teens a notification when they spend 20 minutes on Facebook; added parental supervision tools allowing parents to schedule breaks from their teens from Facebook; launched a new teen-centric product on Instagram allowing parents to help limit the content their kids see on the platform; began hiding more results in Instagram\u2019s search tool related to suicide, self-harm and eating disorders; and launched nighttime \u201cnudges\u201d that encourage teens to close the app when it\u2019s late.",
      "TikTok, over the last five years, has instituted a variety of age-restricted features for users under 18, including limits on direct messaging and livestreams \u2014 as well as by-default private account settings for users between 13 and 15. The platform also instituted in 2023 a 60-minute daily screen time limit for users under 18, and, two years earlier, restricted nighttime notifications for some teenagers. In addition, the platform offers parents certain controls over their kids\u2019 usage, including screen time management and what kind of content they are able to see.",
      "Spokespeople for Meta and TikTok declined to comment on bills limiting the use of social media platforms for young people. A spokesperson for X didn\u2019t respond to questions.",
      "The broader issue has also grabbed the attention of lawmakers in Washington, D.C. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, introduced earlier this year the Kids Off Social Media Act, which would ban social media platforms from allowing kids under 13 to create or maintain accounts. The bill, which would also require social media companies to delete the existing accounts of kids 13 and under, has seen little movement since being introduced in February.",
      "Meanwhile, federal lawmakers, following the lead of state legislatures, have also turned their attention in recent months to the growing movement to restrict the use of cellphones by kids and teenagers in schools.",
      "Last month, Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., introduced a bill that would deliver funding for school districts to explore putting in place such restrictions. That effort comes as an increasing number of states have enacted laws or considered bills to ban cellphones in schools."

    "summary": "All but the wealthiest consumers are opting to drive as gas and rental car costs stay lower than last year.",
    "story": [
      "Consumers aren\u2019t ready to ditch their travel plans despite growing economic gloom. But they are hunting for bargains \u2014 and hoping to find them on the open road.",
      "Some 53% of U.S. consumers are planning vacations this season, up from 48% a year ago, Deloitte researchers reported Tuesday. There\u2019s especially strong interest in brief but more frequent trips closer to home, including by car, as travelers take a \u201cmore frugal approach\u201d this year, the analysts said.",
      "Chris Narvaez, 45, had planned to visit London and Rome this summer. Airfares to Europe are down 8%, according to travel booking platform Hopper, but the New York City-based human resources director said he\u2019s \u201chitting the pause button\u201d on overseas travel.",
      "\u201cBetween new requirements for visas, the current administration, challenges with air traffic control and near misses at local airports, I don\u2019t feel as comfortable as I would getting on a plane,\u201d he said, referring to updated ID and entry rules along with increased customs stops. Instead, he\u2019ll stick to the East Coast \u2014 with jaunts to Woodstock, New York; Washington, D.C.; and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts \u2014 piling into the car with friends and his 15-year-old shepherd mix, Eli.",
      "Alexisa Humphrey, owner of Sugar and Spice Travels in Lebanon, Tennessee, said her customers are still venturing out. But like Narvaez, \u201cthey are doing shorter, more budget-friendly trips,\u201d she said, citing some of the same travel concerns. \u201cI have had clients cancel flights and drive or book a train instead.\u201d",
      "I have had clients cancel flights and drive or book a train instead.",
      "Alexisa Humphrey, owner of Sugar and Spice Travels, Lebanon, TN.",
      "Highway driving remains far more dangerous than commercial air travel or passenger rail, federal data shows. But recent air traffic control issues at Newark Liberty International Airport have spooked many travelers, Humphrey said. Travel volumes at the busy New Jersey airport are down 20% from this time last year, NBC News reported Tuesday.",
      "Cost is also a factor. While round-trip domestic flights are hitting three-year lows, according to Hopper, driving typically remains much more affordable. Gas is about 40 cents cheaper heading into Memorial Day than a year ago, according to AAA, which expects a record 45.1 million people to travel at least 50 miles from home over the long holiday weekend. That would mark a more than 3% jump since 2024 to hit the highest level in 20 years.",
      "U.S. consumers have been trimming their vacation budgets as price-hike headlines proliferate and economic sentiment tumbles to historic lows. Travelers told Deloitte in March that they were planning to spend an average of $3,987 on their main summertime trips, about 13% more than a year earlier. Just two weeks later, though \u2014 as frenzied tariff news rattled stock markets \u2014 that estimate shrunk to $3,471, less than 1% more than in 2024.",
      "Latisha Hunt, a real estate agent and Air Force veteran in Biloxi, Mississippi, is one of Humphrey\u2019s clients who recently adjusted her summer plans. She shortened a trip to Panama in early July from seven days to three and will drive 5\u00bd hours to Atlanta\u2019s airport rather than fly out of a smaller one closer to home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more affordable and allows me to better manage my overall experience,\u201d said Hunt, 39, who\u2019s also planning car trips in coming months to Alabama, Tennessee, Ohio and Michigan. \u201cI\u2019ll be staying with family and friends along the way, which helps keep costs low and adds a more personal, meaningful touch to each visit.\u201d",
      "Hunt will have plenty of company on the roads. Among drivers surveyed at the pump by gas station video network GSTV this winter, 56% said they planned to drive more on their summer vacations than they did last year; 54% reported choosing driving over flying to save money.",
      "Many summer road trippers are on tighter budgets. Bank of America researchers found driving to be the top mode of transport for lower- and middle-income vacationers this summer \u2014 preferred by at least 64% of each group, compared with less than 55% of high-earners.",
      "The good news is that rental car costs were down about 2.1% in April from the year before, according to federal data, and Hopper expects them to stay roughly flat with 2024 levels throughout the summer. But as major rental car operators have adjusted to slower demand, some \u2014 including Avis Budget Group and Hertz \u2014 are slashing their fleets, which could reduce vehicle selection.",
      "Car travelers may also need to budget extra for parking at airports and hotels, many of which tack on fees that can range from just a few dollars to $80 a day. Driver-friendly hotels along major highways and outside of urban areas frequently offer free daily parking, but overnight rates can still top $100 per night at high-demand lots.",
      "In fact, road trippers are a fast-growing slice of accommodation operators\u2019 business. Hotel parking revenues surged 18% between 2019 and 2024, according to real estate and investment firm CBRE. Hotel revenue overall grew less than 7% over the same period.",
      "\u201cThis should not be interpreted as more people driving to hotels,\u201d said Robert Mandelbaum, hotel research director at CBRE. \u201cIt is a combination of hotels charging more for parking and more hotels charging for parking that did not before Covid.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "At the heart of the murder charge against Karen Read is the weapon prosecutors say she used to kill her boyfriend \u2014 her 2021 Lexus SUV.",
      "Prosecutors spent much of the fifth week of the widely publicized retrial laying out the physical evidence that they say shows that Read drunkenly drove into Boston police officer John O\u2019Keefe, 46, and left him for dead outside the home of a law enforcement colleague on Jan. 29, 2022.",
      "Lead prosecutor Hank Brennan and Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally called a series of forensic specialists to bolster that theory.",
      "The defense, which has rejected those allegations, focused much of its attention on a single expert who examined a key piece of evidence \u2014 vehicle data \u2014 and subjected that expert to hours of interrogation-like questioning as attorney Robert Alessi sought to dismantle the analyst\u2019s contributions to the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying to understand your statement,\u201d an exasperated-sounding Alessi said at one point during cross-examination. \u201cIsn\u2019t it either you have a bachelor of science degree or you don\u2019t?\u201d",
      "Read, who is charged with second-degree murder, motor vehicle manslaughter while driving under the influence and leaving the scene of a collision causing death, has remained chatty with reporters throughout the proceedings and said after court Wednesday that she feels \u201cgreat\u201d about the case so far.",
      "She has maintained her innocence throughout her legal battle.",
      "Her first trial ended with a hung jury last summer. Her defense team has said that she was framed by former and current law enforcement officers and others who were at the home where O\u2019Keefe was found unresponsive early Jan. 29.",

      "How to watch the \u201cDateline\u201d episode \u201cThe Night of the Nor\u2019easter\u201d",
      "The defense has also said that the state trooper who led the investigation into O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death was biased and manipulated evidence. The trooper, who acknowledged sending unprofessional messages about Read but testified that his conduct did not affect the integrity of the investigation, was fired after an internal investigation found he violated agency rules.",
      "In court earlier this week, experts offered a flurry of technical, sometimes highly complex details about the physical evidence linked to Read\u2019s SUV: a strand of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s hair found on the Lexus\u2019 rear quarter panel; bits of red plastic discovered on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s clothes that could have been from the SUV\u2019s broken taillight.",
      "The vehicle data examined by Shanon Burgess, a digital forensic analyst, is central to the prosecution\u2019s case. Brennan has accused Read of reversing her Lexus into O\u2019Keefe in a hit that left him dead, and Burgess\u2019 analysis found that the SUV recorded a \u201cbacking event\u201d outside the home where he was found unresponsive shortly after 6 a.m.",
      "The defense spent hours grilling Burgess on everything from errors the expert acknowledged making in his analysis to the accuracy of his resume. At one point, the grueling back-and-forth prompted a startling admission from Burgess.",
      "Even though his curriculum vitae and LinkedIn profile state that he has a bachelor\u2019s degree in science from the University of Alabama, he has no more than an associate\u2019s degree, Burgess testified. He began pursuing a bachelor\u2019s in 2008, he said, but never completed the coursework.",
      "When Alessi pressed Burgess to explain the misstatements, he attributed them to \u201cerrors\u201d and \u201cmisinterpretations.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut you would agree those errors or misinterpretations have been in existence for some time?\u201d the defense attorney responded.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cI\u2019m being made aware of them now.\u201d",
      "At another point, Alessi pressed Burgess on what the defense lawyer described as a series of errors the expert made while analyzing three chips from Read\u2019s SUV. In a document Burgess provided to the prosecution in October, Alessi said, the expert asserted that a previous analysis used in the case was incomplete because it did not capture all of the data from the chips.",
      "In fact, Alessi said, it was Burgess who erred by making mistakes in his data conversion method. He confused megabits for megabytes, Alessi said, and gigabits for gigabytes. (Eight of the former equals one of the latter.)",
      "\u201cThe entire foundation of your proposal was based on a fundamental misinterpretation of the difference between a computer bit and a computer byte, correct?\u201d the defense lawyer said.",
      "\u201cNo, not the entire thing,\u201d Burgess responded.",
      "\u201cWell certainly a part of it was, correct?\u201d Alessi said.",
      "\u201cCorrect,\u201d Burgess said.",
      "\u201cSince you wrote that, have you learned the difference between a bit and a byte?\u201d the lawyer asked.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always known the difference between a bit and a byte,\u201d Burgess said.",
      "Later, Alessi questioned Burgess about what he described as discrepancies between two reports he wrote in the case. The first, submitted in January of this year, sought to reconstruct the events of Jan. 29, 2022, using vehicle data. The second, submitted earlier this month \u2014 after Read\u2019s retrial had already begun \u2014 was a supplemental report that sought to \u201cclarify\u201d parts of the initial document, Burgess said.",
      "On the stand, Alessi asked him to explain one of those discrepancies in the supplemental report. On direct examination, Alessi said, Burgess told the prosecutor that he\u2019d submitted the document on his own initiative in an effort to respond to a \u201cmisleading\u201d claim that he later said came from a defense expert.",
      "But the report itself stated the opposite, Alessi pointed out. In the document\u2019s first line, which Alessi read in court, Burgess said he was submitting the additional analysis at the prosecutor\u2019s request.",
      "\u201cWhich is it?\u201d Alessi asked.",
      "\u201cThis is a holdover, so a copy and paste from my original report,\u201d Burgess responded.",
      "\u201cDo you cut and paste important information from one report to the other without checking it for accuracy?\u201d Alessi asked.",
      "\u201cI copy and paste certain portions,\u201d Burgess said.",
      "\u201cYou didn\u2019t review it this time, though, did you?\u201d Alessi said.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Burgess responded. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was significant.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 24 May 2025 11:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Marines and airmen with pseudofolliculitis barbae, the skin condition more commonly known as razor bumps, could be expelled from the service if the condition persists.",
    "story": [
      "Air Force veteran Ed Anderson can\u2019t recall any time past puberty when he didn\u2019t get razor bumps after shaving his face. His coarse facial hair would often cause painful inflammation and itchy bumps as it grew back.",
      "Anderson, now 70, remembers requesting a shaving waiver when he entered the service in 1975, allowing him to bypass the military\u2019s requirements for men to be clean-shaven. For him and other Black airmen, the waivers became a symbol of unity.",
      "\u201cIt was seen as an identifier of solidarity with other Black GIs having that shaving waiver,\u201d\u00a0 Anderson said.",
      "The military as a whole began issuing these waivers in the 1970s, with the Navy taking the strongest approach in 1970 to allow the elective wearing of beards to address medical conditions. But the policies of the different branches have changed multiple times since then.",
      "Now, a new U.S. Marine Corps grooming policy that affects people with curly or coarse hair is drawing ire from critics who say it targets Black men. The guidance, issued in March, states that a diagnosis of pseudofolliculitis barbae, or PFB, a skin condition more commonly known as razor bumps or ingrown hairs, could lead to a service member\u2019s expulsion from the branch if the issue persists. The U.S. Air Force also updated its guidance on PFB earlier this year, saying shaving waivers will expire 90 days after an airman\u2019s next annual health assessment. But the requirements for those who may still qualify for a waiver remain unclear.",
      "The condition affects up to 60% of Black men, according to the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology, a far higher rate than for any other group.",
      "Anderson said he sees the move as yet another example of \u201congoing attacks\u201d on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the federal government.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mostly soldiers of color who are impacted by this,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see this as a productive and effective means of retaining and recruiting troops.\u201d",
      "The latest policy change under Brig. Gen. David R. Everly marks a reversal from a 2022 policy that barred Marines from being kicked out of the service solely for the skin condition. In the last three years, service members were able to obtain temporary or permanent shaving waivers, or \u201cno shave chits,\u201d once it was determined that their PFB couldn\u2019t be treated by topical medications.",
      "Dermatologists around the country who treat people with the condition say the latest policy change seems to be unnecessary.",
      "\u201cThis is so targeted and intentional,\u201d said Chris Adigun, a board-certified dermatologist based in North Carolina.",
      "PFB \u201ccan affect only the way hair follicles appear,\u201d said Adigun, \u201cand does not affect the body systemically in any way.\u201d",
      "Under the new guidance, which the message says will best position Marines for \u201cwarfighting capability,\u201d service members with PFB are now required to undergo a medical evaluation within 90 days. If their condition does not improve within a year under a four-part treatment plan, they could be separated from the branch at the discretion of their commanding officer.",
      "Critics, however, call it an outdated policy rooted in discrimination.",
      "An active military dermatologist, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said the move has \u201cnothing to do with readiness.\u201d",
      "\u201cOn its face it\u2019s a racist policy, because this is a condition that impacts African Americans and other people of color predominantly just by the nature of hair growth on the face,\u201d they said, adding that it also \u201ccreates a huge administrative burden on a patient.\u201d",
      "It remains unclear how many Marines would be affected by the policy as the branch said it does not track how many members have shaving exemptions for PFB. Black service members make up 18% of all active-duty Marines, according to data from the Marine Corps Gazette, a professional journal by members of the service. The branch itself does not keep racial demographic data on its members, a Marines spokesperson said.",
      "Military leaders say the change returns service members to grooming standards that ensure \u201cmaximum war readiness,\u201d according to the mandate.",
      "\u201cOur priority is to ensure the health and resilience of our Marines while maintaining our warfighting capability,\u201d said Maj. Jacoby Getty, a spokesman for the Corps\u2019 Manpower & Reserve Affairs, an office tasked with acquiring and retaining talent. \u201cThese updates ensure consistency in the management of medical conditions while reinforcing our commitment to returning Marines to full compliance whenever possible.\u201d",
      "Adigun noted the policy\u2019s history as a point of contention dating back to the 1970s, which led to social uproar among Black service members who had long argued against its efficacy.",
      "U.S. military leaders have long maintained that service members need to be clean-shaven, both to maintain a professional appearance and to ensure the proper fit of airtight gas masks, despite little evidence that links PFB or facial hair to poor gas mask fit.",
      "A study published in the Journal of Military Medicine in 2021 found little evidence that short beards interfered with the seal of a gas mask. A study in 2018 found that pilots with beards more than a foot long were able to maintain an airtight seal on their masks in a simulated cabin depressurization test.",
      "Medical experts say PFB is improved by not shaving at all or shaving with clippers that don\u2019t give a close shave, which allows the hair to remain above the skin surface after it is cut. Another option is laser hair removal. But for many Marines, the military dermatologist said, this permanent option for what many see as a temporary job is not a viable choice.",
      "An analysis published in the journal Military Medicine also found a link between shaving waivers and delays in promotion that disproportionately affects Black service members.",
      "This latest Marine policy change comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in March ordered a militarywide review of physical fitness and grooming standards.",
      "\u201cWe must remain vigilant in maintaining the standards that enable the men and women of our military to protect the American people and our homeland as the world\u2019s most lethal and effective fighting force,\u201d Hegseth said when announcing the order. The Department of Defense declined a request to comment on the latest guidelines.",
      "But, according to South Carolina-based dermatologist Lauren Ploch, standards that require clean-shaven faces are \u201crooted in institutional racism\u201d because they single out PFB for strict treatment. She questions why there are not similar rules for other skin conditions like cystic acne or dissecting cellulitis, which affects the scalp. There are regulations for treating these issues, but no specific policies that could lead to a service member\u2019s expulsion.",
      "\u201cIf one of these conditions is not a disqualifier, then PFB shouldn\u2019t be either,\u201d Ploch said.",
      "Dara Spearman, a board-certified dermatologist based in Indiana, said the potential for dismissal under the policy is \u201cdramatic.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiven the historic interactions between Black Americans and organizations with regard to grooming habits and requirements,\u201d Spearman said, \u201cit seems there may be other factors at play than whether a gas mask fits.\u201d",
      "Anderson, citing his years of service, said he believes he\u2019s well within his rights to challenge things he disagrees with.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always been a patriot,\u201d Anderson said, \u201cbut being a patriot also makes one qualified to question what\u2019s going on \u2014 not just to blindly accept and go along with everything.\u201d"

      "A man was arrested Friday after being accused of kidnapping an Italian tourist and torturing him for weeks inside a Manhattan home in a bid to steal the alleged victim\u2019s Bitcoin, according to officials, law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the investigation and a criminal complaint.",
      "The victim was able to escape the home and run for help Friday morning, the law enforcement sources said. John Woeltz, 37, was taken into custody that same day and was arraigned Saturday on one count each of second-degree assault, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a firearm, court records show.",
      "Law enforcement sources close to the investigation said Woeltz and the tourist, along with a third person, had been in business together for years. Police are still searching for the third business partner, who has not been publicly identified.",
      "The sources said Woeltz and the other person have allegedly gotten violent with the victim in the past, but never to this extent. They described the relationship between the three as very complex, and said it appears the victim was often picked on by the two men.",
      "An attorney for Woeltz declined to comment Saturday. A judge granted a request to hold Woeltz in custody during Saturday's arraignment. His next court date is Wednesday.",
      "Italian man was allegedly held and tortured for 17 days",
      "The tourist, a 28-year-old man visiting from Italy, met his alleged kidnapper on May 6, law enforcement sources said. That's when, they said, Woeltz took the younger man to a home he was renting in Nolita, a neighborhood in Manhattan.",
      "According to a criminal complaint, Woeltz and an unidentified \u201cunapprehended male\u201d kidnapped the victim, took his electronics and passport, and tortured him until he managed to escape weeks later.",
      "The pair tried to get the tourist to give them the password to his Bitcoin account so they could steal the electronic currency, and when he refused, they beat him, shocked him with electric wires and hit him in the head with a gun over the course of weeks, the complaint said.",
      "Woeltz and the other man allegedly pointed a gun at the victim\u2019s head multiple times, dangled him over the ledge of the top flight of stairs in the home and threatened to kill him if he did not reveal his password, according to the complaint, which also alleged the pair threatened to have his family killed.",
      "The tourist also told officials that the men tied his wrists and bound him to prevent him from moving, according to the complaint.",
      "Law enforcement sources added that the men urinated on the victim and put an Apple AirTag around his neck to ensure he did not escape.",
      "Upon his escape, the 28-year-old ran into a traffic agent who called police to the home on Prince Street. He told the agent he had been taken and held against his will and that he was repeatedly assaulted during his captivity, police said.",
      "The alleged victim was taken to a hospital in stable condition, police said. When he approached officers Friday, he was covered in cuts and bruises with marks on his wrists where he was bound, law enforcement sources said.",
      "Evidence found at suspect\u2019s Manhattan home",
      "Law enforcement sources said Woeltz is a prominent crypto currency trader from Kentucky, estimated to be worth around $100 million. The victim has an estimated worth of $30 million, they said.",
      "Woeltz had reportedly been renting out the Prince Street residence at a monthly rate of between $30,000 and $40,000, the sources said. An online listing for the home says it was last rented in March for $75,000.",
      "Law enforcement sources said there were cases of alcohol throughout the six-story residence, as well as stripper poles in the basement.",
      "Those sources said officers turned up multiple Polaroid pictures of the victim being tied up and tortured at the home. Investigators also reportedly recovered several torture items.",

      "Neighbor shocked by details of arrest",
      "Jennifer Crawford lives across the street from where the events unfolded Friday morning and saw Woeltz being arrested.",
      "\u201cI watched, like, the SWAT guys get out of the truck with their shields and everything and enter the building, and they were just starting to rope off the area and everyone\u2019s yelling. It looked like they were a little bit in a panic,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "She said she was shocked when she started learning more of the allegations.",
      "\u201cI just stood and froze,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot does go on here in New York. You can imagine, I\u2019ve seen a lot, but this is the most unusual thing I\u2019ve seen in 30 years in this neighborhood. I mean, that\u2019s just beyond what you can even describe or imagine.\u201d",
      "Crawford said she couldn\u2019t imagine the motive of someone with so much wealth committing this type of crime.",
      "\u201cAll that money in the world didn\u2019t do anything, it\u2019s not going to help him,\u201d she said. \u201cJust doesn\u2019t make sense, you know?\u201d",
      "On Saturday, hundreds of people passed by the townhome in Manhattan, some whispering about the details of the case. A few even took selfies in front of the home by the iron fence wrapped in police tape.",
      "Police officials and investigators were in and out of the house Saturday, several standing guard in the front and recommending to those passing by to Google the home address to learn more."

      "Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film (\"This Is Not a Film\") made in his living room, and another (\"Taxi\") set in a car.",
      "The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 at the festival held up Panahi's name to honor the director then under house arrest.",

Neon, which acquired \"It Was Just an Accident\" for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \"Parasite,\" \"Titane,\" \"Triangle of Sadness,\" \"Anatomy of a Fall\" and \"Anora.\"",
      "All those films were Oscar contenders and two, \"Parasite\" and \"Anora,\" won best picture.",
      "Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes, and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.",
      "\"It Was Just an Accident\" was inspired by Panahi's experience in jail. In it, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.",
      "\"The film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,\" Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. \"Art will always win. What is human will always win.\"",
      "The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes.",
      "Other winners at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival",
      "The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier's Norwegian family drama \"Sentimental Value,\" his lauded follow-up to \"The Worst Person in the World.\" Some had expected \"Sentimental Value\" to win the Palme, but Trier \u2014 whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve \u2014 still took a major prize.",
      "\"We live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,\" said Trier. \"And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.\"",
      "Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho's Brazilian political thriller \"The Secret Agent\" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for \"The Secret Agent\" showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, \"That was our wish.\"",
      "The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' \"I'm Still Here\" in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said the awards \"show that our country's cinema is second to none.\"",
      "The jury prize was split between two films: \u00d3liver Laxe's desert road trip \"Sir\u00e2t \" and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama \"Sound of Falling.\" Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for \"The Little Sister,\" Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama.",
      "The Belgian brothers Jean-Luc and Pierre Dardennes, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, \"Young Mothers.\" Cannes' award for best first film went to Hasan Hadi, for \"The President's Cake,\" making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.",
      "What else shaped Cannes this year",
      "Saturday's ceremony brings to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",
      "Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \"Can you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn't ship that way,\" said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \"The Phoenician Scheme\" at the festival.",
      "That was one of the top American films in Cannes, along with Spike Lee's \"Highest 2 Lowest,\" the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning\" and Ari Aster's \"Eddington.\""

      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d said Norris, who hadn\u2019t been on pole since the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.",

Of course, I\u2019ve got frustrated, I\u2019ve been unhappy, because that\u2019s normal,\u201d Norris added. \u201cIf you don\u2019t win, if you don\u2019t get pole, you\u2019re not going to be happy, especially when it\u2019s where you should be, it\u2019s what the objective is.\u201d",
      "Norris and Monaco local Charles Leclerc swapped the fastest times before Norris upped the pace again to take first by .109 of a second. Piastri was third.",
      "Norris\u2019 time of 1 minute, 9.954 seconds replaced a record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2019.",
      "It comes as Norris tries to cut into Piastri\u2019s 13-point standings lead and follows weeks of frustration in qualifying \u2014 sometimes from small mistakes, but also a dramatic crash in Saudi Arabia last month. Leclerc, who won the Monaco GP last year, was denied a fourth career pole at his home race.",
      "Leclerc said Monaco\u2019s slow and twisty layout allowed Ferrari to dodge some of the \u201ccompromises\u201d it\u2019s had to make with its setup at more varied tracks.",
      "Defending champion Max Verstappen, the winner of the Emilia-Romagna GP last week, was fifth for Red Bull after predicting Monaco\u2019s low-speed nature wouldn\u2019t suit his car, but starts fourth because of a penalty for Lewis Hamilton.",
      "Rule change makes for uncertain race",
      "Qualifying has typically been more important at Monaco than anywhere else on the F1 calendar. It\u2019s almost impossible to overtake on the narrow streets so grid position is vital.",
      "It could be a little different this time because drivers will be required to change tires at least twice during the race.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really knows what to expect,\u201d Piastri said.",
      "That rule change follows a dull race last year when an early red flag allowed all drivers to make their mandatory pit stop. The race finished with the top 10 all in the same order that they started the race.",
      "Hamilton penalized and Mercedes frustrated",
      "A radio mix-up cost seven-time world champion Hamilton, as he was dropped from fourth to seventh on the grid for getting in Verstappen\u2019s way.",
      "In the first part of qualifying, Hamilton was told by the Ferrari team that Verstappen was on a slower lap, when the Dutch driver was actually trying to set a competitive time.",
      "Hamilton was obliged to make way for the faster car, but the miscommunication meant the British driver was in Verstappen\u2019s way on the racing line, landing him a three-place grid penalty for impeding.",
      "Until then, Hamilton\u2019s fourth place seemed a strong recovery following a crash in practice which required a major rebuild of his Ferrari.",
      "It was a session to forget for Mercedes as its cars caused two red flags.",
      "George Russell is set to start 14th after his car broke down in the tunnel with a suspected electrical problem, causing a lengthy stoppage while it was pushed out of the way by a track marshal crew. His 18-year-old teammate Kimi Antonelli hit the wall and was 15th.",
      "Haas rookie Oliver Bearman qualified 17th but dropped to the back of the grid because of a 10-place penalty imposed on Friday for overtaking under red flags when practice was stopped."

      "Yet the \"Racing Capital of the World\" is eagerly and happily sharing the Memorial Day weekend stage with the Indiana Pacers and the Indiana Fever, two teams straight from the Hoosier State's lifeblood of basketball.",
      "The Pacers flags and Caitlin Clark jerseys are easy to see all over town, including Gasoline Alley a few steps from the speedway's famous Brickyard.",
      "Pacers & Racers weekend is in high gear.",
      "\"This is an epic weekend, an incredible opportunity to put Indianapolis on the minds of virtually every major sports fan on the planet,\" said Chris Gahl, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Visit Indy. \"Our initial research shows no other city in the U.S. has hosted this diverse level of major sporting events in such a short amount of time.\"",
      "It may be an anomaly nationally, but Indianapolis is built to thrive in this sort of spotlight.",
      "The city has hosted the Super Bowl, two NBA All-Star Games, multiple international and national championships and, of course, now the 109th running of the Indianapolis 500. And through every virtually twist \u2014 even an NCAA men's basketball tournament held entirely in and around Indy \u2014 the reviews have come back with races.",
      "The lineup",
      "On Saturday afternoon, Clark and the Fever host the defending WNBA champion New York Liberty in front of a sellout crowd early in a season with title hopes for a team boasting perhaps the biggest star in the league. An estimated 350,000 race fans are expected for Sunday's midday Indy 500 race, including the first sold-out grandstands since 2016. The weekend will be capped Sunday night when the Pacers host the New York Knicks for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals.",
      "It's the fourth time an NBA game has converged with race day, and the Pacers lost each of the first three \u2014 to the Knicks in 1999, to the Pistons in 2004 and to the Heat in 2013. They went on to lose all three series, too.",
      "The off-court, off-track stories such as the Team Penske cheating scandal, the WNBA investigation into alleged racial comments directed at Angel Reese after a Fever game and the call for international peace from Israeli-born, Russian-raised pole winner Robert Schwarzman have played into the buildup. Even the Oscar Mayer Wienermobiles came to town Friday.",
      "In a state where the greatest athletic feats often have been defined by auto racing or basketball, this weekend seems like a fitting marriage even to locals. Just ask IndyCar team owner-driver Ed Carpenter, a longtime Pacers fan and the stepson of former speedway president and CEO Tony George.",
      "\"I think it celebrates the city, the people that live here and the fans that make the pilgrimage to the race,\" he said. \"(Having the other events) just makes it that much more special.\"",
      "Carpenter hopes to attend Sunday night's game \u2014 even if he wins the 500 \u2014 and now finds himself surrounded in Gasoline Alley by a growing legion of crossover fans",
      "Six-time IndyCar Series champion Scott Dixon and three-time 500 winner Dario Franchitti attended Game 3 of the Indiana-Cleveland series. Former IndyCar driver and broadcaster James Hinchcliffe was there for Game 2 and the triumvirate of Kyle Kirkwood, Colton Herta and Marcus Ericsson went to Game 2 of the Indiana-Milwaukee series. Scott McLaughlin, a Knicks fans, has a wager on the series with Carpenter and may attend Sunday's game if he's not drinking the milk in victory lane.",
      "\"How'd that go?\" fellow driver Alexander Rossi asked after the Pacers' thrilling Game 1 victory on Wednesday.",
      "\"Real bad, we lost the unloseable,\" McLaughlin said. \"We had a good wager. I have to buy the equivalent -- if the Pacers win in six games -- if they win in seven, the bet is off, or I win -- I have to buy the equivalent up to 2500 bucks of his (coffee/java).\"",
      "Red carpet treatment",
      "The red carpet isn't just being rolled out for the Pacers and the racers. Film director Spike Lee is expected to be in his familiar spot inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse while his old foil, Reggie Miller, calls the game for TNT. It's unclear how many big wigs from the race will make the 15-minute drive (in good traffic) to the arena for the game. Two tickets to each event would cost you nearly $4,000.",
      "Kyle Larson, who is making his second attempt at a different kind of race day double \u2014 completing 500 miles at Indianapolis and 600 more in Charlotte's NASCAR nightcap \u2014 already has made that trip. He went to the Fever game Tuesday night.",
      "\"Outside the car, it's been crazier this year logistics-wise,\" Larson said. \"Going to New York and having a full day of media there and then flying back here. Going to the Fever game was fun.\"",
      "The interest and intrigue goes the other way, too.",
      "Three years ago, Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton made his IndyCar debut in a two-seater with Mario Andretti. Last weekend, Fever coach Stephanie White, an Indiana native, returned to the track while Fever center Aliyah Boston, the 2023 WNBA Rookie of the Year, got her first glimpse at the historic and vast 2.5-mile oval.",
      "\"Being on the track and kind of seeing how fast all the cars go, and to meet Colton was pretty dope,\" Boston said. \"The track is huge. Colton told us how many things could fit in the track and that's insane. You don't understand how big it is till you're there.\"",
      "Bottom line",
      "Gahl said hotels are virtually sold out in Central Indiana and everywhere from Lafayette to Bloomington, roughly one-hour drives from Indy; downtown, the average cost is about $550 per night with a three-night minimum and restaurant reservations are scarce. Local merchandisers are capitalizing, too, selling blue-and-gold shirts that read \"Zoom Baby,\" a play off the late Bob \"Slick\" Leonard's radio calls of \"Boom Baby\" for Pacers' 3-pointers.",
      "In the midst of so much going on in a 36-hour window, the Pacers, racers and the Fever are all following the same playbook: Ignore the distractions and celebrate this incredible weekend.",
      "\"You've got to enjoy the moment, let the excitement and pressure go, focus on the task at hand right in front of you,\" Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard said. \"It should be exciting and fun.\""

      "Brothers Olabingo and Abimbola Osundairo, who worked on the \u201cEmpire\u201d set, said they were paid by Smollett to stage the hate crime and testified against the actor during his trial.",
      "Smollett was found guilty on five counts of felony disorderly conduct in December 2021, and sentenced to 150 days in jail and 30 months\u2019 probation in March 2022, but the Illinois Supreme Court overturned the conviction in November 2024 over prosecutorial issues.",
      "The state high court ruled that Smollett should have never been charged in the first place after entering a nonprosecution agreement with the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Smollett has maintained his innocence over the years. He ended his post thanking his supporters."

    "summary": "Former Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo vividly recalls watching a video spreading on social media of a white officer pinning a Black man to the ground, despite his fading pleas of \"I can't breathe.\"",
    "story": [
      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Former Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo vividly remembers receiving a call around midnight from a community activist. The caller told him to watch a video spreading on social media of a white officer pinning a Black man to the ground, despite his fading pleas of \"I can't breathe.\"",
      "The dying man was George Floyd. The officer was Derek Chauvin. And Arradondo was the city's first Black police chief.",
      "\"It was absolutely gut-wrenching,\" Arradondo, 58, recalled in an interview ahead of the fifth anniversary of Floyd's murder.",
      "What he saw conflicted with what his own people had told him about the deadly encounter, and he knew immediately it would mean changes for his department and city. But he acknowledged he didn't immediately foresee how deeply Floyd's death would reverberate in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "\"I served for 32 years,\" he said. \"But there's no doubt May 25th, 2020, is a defining moment for me in my public service career.\"",
      "The video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, pinning him to the pavement outside a convenience store where Floyd was accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Chauvin maintained the pressure for 9 1/2 minutes despite pleas from onlookers to stop, even after an off-duty firefighter tried to intervene and another officer said he couldn't find a pulse.",
      "\"Remnants of pain and anger\"",
      "Arradondo sat for the interview in a public library that was heavily damaged in the unrest that followed Floyd's death. It's on Lake Street, a major artery that saw some of the worst destruction, a street that he says still bears \"remnants of the pain and anger of what occurred five years ago.\"",
      "Just down the block, there's the empty shell of a police station that was torched during the riots. And within sight is a Target store and a Cub Foods supermarket that were looted. Storefronts remain boarded up. While some businesses were rebuilt, empty lots sit where others did not.",
      "Arradondo still stands by his and Mayor Jacob Frey's decision to abandon the Third Precinct and let it burn. Protesters breached the building, and police \u2014 who were spread thin \u2014 didn't have the resources to hold it. So he ordered his officers to evacuate.",
      "\"During the most significant crisis we've ever experienced, arguably in the state, when it's life or death, I've got to go on the side of keeping people alive and safe,\" he said.",
      "Police reform",
      "Arradondo subsequently helped launch an overhaul of policing in the city despite a resistant police culture and a powerful officers union. He testified against Chauvin in his 2021 murder trial, a rare breach of the \"blue wall\" that traditionally protects officers from being held accountable for wrongdoing.",
      "Five years on, Arradondo, who retired in 2022, said he believes law enforcement agencies nationwide have made progress on police accountability \u2014 albeit incremental progress \u2014 and that police chiefs and sheriffs now move faster to hold officers responsible for egregious misconduct.",
      "Arradondo was promoted to chief in 2017, and his elevation was greeted with hope among local African Americans who affectionately called him \"Rondo.\" But his department had a reputation for being too quick to use force and many were angry about police killing young Black men in Minnesota and beyond.",
      "Arradondo said he wishes he had made more changes to the police department before Floyd was killed.",
      "\"I would have pushed harder and sooner at trying to dismantle some of the toxic culture that allowed that indifference to exist that evening, on May 25th, 2020,\" he said. \"I certainly would have invested more time elevating the voices in our community that had been pleading with police departments for decades to listen to us and change.\"",
      "Making amends",
      "Arradondo just published a book, \"Chief Rondo: Securing Justice for the Murder of George Floyd,\" that explores leadership, justice and race, the broader impacts of policing, and the challenges of working within a flawed system. He closes it with a letter dedicated to Floyd's daughter, Gianna.",
      "\"I never had an opportunity to meet Gianna, but I wanted her to know that, even though I was not out there that evening, at that intersection when her father was pleading for help, that I heard him, and I was going to do everything I could to bring him justice,\" he said.",
      "He wanted to say the words that she has not heard from the four former officers who were convicted for their roles in George Floyd's death:",
      "\"I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your father being taken from you.\""

      "Four of the six Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa and four in Minnesota will shut down in a year, the Midwestern affiliate operating them said Friday, blaming a freeze in federal funds, budget cuts proposed in Congress and state restrictions on abortion.",
      "The clinics closing in Iowa include the only Planned Parenthood facility in the state that provides abortion procedures, in Ames, home to Iowa State University. The others are in Cedar Rapids, Sioux City and the Des Moines suburb of Urbandale.",
      "Two of the clinics being shut down by Planned Parenthood North Central States are in the Minneapolis area, in Apple Valley and Richfield. The others are in central Minnesota in Alexandria and Bemidji. Of the four, the Richfield clinic provides abortion procedures.",
      "The Planned Parenthood affiliate said it would lay off 66 employees and ask 37 additional employees to move to different clinics. The organization also said it plans to keep investing in telemedicine services and sees 20,000 patients a year virtually. The affiliate serves five states \u2014 Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.",
      "\"We have been fighting to hold together an unsustainable infrastructure as the landscape shifts around us and an onslaught of attacks continues,\" Ruth Richardson, the affiliate's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Of the remaining 15 clinics operated by Planned Parenthood North Central States, six will provide abortion procedures \u2014 five of them in Minnesota, including three in the Minneapolis area. The other clinic is in Omaha, Nebraska.",
      "The affiliate said that in April, President Donald Trump's administration froze $2.8 million in federal funds for Minnesota to provide birth control and other services, such as cervical cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases.",
      "While federal funds can't be used for most abortions, abortion opponents have long argued that Planned Parenthood affiliates should not receive any taxpayer dollars, saying the money still indirectly underwrites abortion services.",
      "Planned Parenthood North Central States also cited proposed cuts in Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low-income Americans, as well as a Trump administration proposal to eliminate funding for teenage pregnancy prevention programs.",
      "In addition, Republican-led Iowa last year banned most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant, causing the number performed there to drop 60% in the first six months the law was in effect and dramatically increasing the number of patients traveling to Minnesota and Nebraska.",
      "After the closings, Planned Parenthood North Central States will operate 10 brick-and-mortar clinics in Minnesota, two in Iowa, two in Nebraska, and one in South Dakota. It operates none in North Dakota, though its Moorhead, Minnesota, clinic is across the Red River from Fargo, North Dakota."

      "Tra\u2019Von Johnson, 22, was found on Bennett Road in Amite City, just a few miles away from the Tangipahoa Parish Jail, which he escaped from on Thursday afternoon, the sheriff's office said in an update Friday evening. This was his second escape from the jail, according to the sheriff's office, which said he broke out of the facility \"a year ago this month.\"",
      "\"TPSO wants to thank, first and foremost, the community for standing with us in this effort,\" the sheriff's office said, adding that Louisiana State Police made the arrest.",
      "The sheriff's office shared a video of Johnson being taken back into custody and placed into a Louisiana State Police helicopter.",
      "Prior to his escape, Johnson was awaiting trial in Tangipahoa Parish Jail for his alleged role in a 2022 Hammond-area home invasion where a man was killed and his child was injured, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. He has since been charged with simple escape.",
      "Johnson has been taken to Angola, Louisiana, since he was recaptured, where he will await trial, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office did not clarify whether Johnson will be held at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola.",
      "Johnson and another inmate, Trevon Wallace, were able to escape the jail after an inmate in their dorm flooded a shower at around 4:15 p.m.",
      "\"During the clean-up, while several sections of exterior doors were open to push water out, an interior door was inadvertently opened less than a minute before the error was realized and it was closed again,\" the sheriff's office said. \"In those few seconds, Johnson and Wallace ran out of all of the doors to the yard.\"",
      "The sheriff's office released surveillance video of Wallace and Johnson running out to the yard before Wallace gives Johnson a boost over a perimeter fence. Wallace ran back to the jail building afterward, where he was intercepted by deputies who took him back to his cell.",
      "The deputies did not report the incident with the door, or Wallace's interception, to superiors, and failed to do a proper head count after finding him, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Just before 10 p.m., the sheriff\u2019s office received a call from a member of the public who asked if Johnson was still in custody. The person did not identify themselves, Sheriff Gerald Sticker said at a news briefing Friday afternoon.",
      "The realization of Johnson's escape prompted a lockdown at the jail and a search that lasted until around 3 a.m. Friday morning, according to Sticker. Johnson was eventually found Friday evening.",
      "\"At this time, it is not believed this was a planned escape, but rather, an opportunistic one that was compounded by a failure of jail staff to follow protocols put in place as preventative measures for escapes,\" the sheriff's office said. \"However, the current investigation into this incident does include looking into the person who called the jail and the inmate who caused the flooding to begin with.\"",
      "Wallace has since been charged with simple escape and principal to help someone escape, according to Sticker. Four members of the jail\u2019s staff were placed on administrative leave, he said.",
      "According to the sheriff's office, the jail \"is only able to staff one individual tasked with monitoring 60 cameras all at once while also opening doors as requested by deputies in and around the pods and dorms.\" Sticker said the sheriff\u2019s office has been working to address deficiencies at the jail, but it is \u201cstill a work in progress.\u201d"

Never in a million years expecting that to be this cultural thing.\u201d"

      "\"You start to sympathize with her,\" Fowler says. \"And I definitely, when reading the script, sympathized with Tiffany because it\u2019s back to that kind of teenage girl going through mental turmoil. You start seeing her as this real human, young woman.\"",

      "What does the end credit scene mean?",
      "Even though the film is on Netflix, stick around a little longer for an end credit scene. Although it's brief, fans of the \"Fear Street\" franchise will recognize the end credit scene ties the film back to the original trilogy.",
      "The end credit scene shows Nancy Falconer's dead body lying on the ground, blood oozing from her head. But then, the blood begins to form into the Witch's Mark \u2014 also known as the Devil\u2019s Mark from the original franchise.",
      "In the initial trilogy, the Witch's Mark was where Shadyside residents were sacrificed by the Goode family to Satan.",
      "Fowler calls this moment \"a nod to the curse\" from the original trilogy and a way for their film to \"pay homage\" to the origins.",
      "\"This film is its own thing,\" she says. \"You don't necessarily have to watch the first three to understand this film, but I think that they did such a good job of doing the subtle nod to the fact that Shadyside is a cursed town, and it's inescapable and it's still apparent.\"",
      "She adds that the end credits aren't the only \"Easter egg\" to the original trilogy. In fact, at the beginning of the film, there's a small shrine to everyone who died in the 1978 camp massacre, alluding to the events of the second film.",
      "Were the Falconers cursed?",
      "With that in mind, it begs the question: Was the Falconer family another victim of the curse of Shadyside?",
      "Strazza thinks so.",
      "\"I think there's something in the water,\" she says. \"I think that it's not a coincidence that these crazy people end up on the loose. Who knows who is connected to the Falconers in the past?\"",
      "Personally, Strazza thinks Tiffany \"sold her soul to the devil.\"",
      "One potential reason? Strazza pitches a search for \"forever beauty.\"",
      "\"That would be something the Falconers would be into,\" she adds."

      "\u201cFear Street: Prom Queen\" takes audiences back to the '80s for a prom night that goes from bodacious to, well, filled with bodies.",
      "The newest installment to the \"Fear Street\" franchise follows outsider Lori Granger (India Fowler) as she runs for her high school's prom queen, going up against popular girl Tiffany Falconer (Fina Strazza) and her friends.",
      "But on prom night, each girl nominated is picked off one by one, slasher style, by a serial killer.",
      "Eventually, Tiffany's dad (Chris Klein) is revealed to be the killer \u2014 one of them, at least. After the big reveal, the police take a shocked Tiffany and Lori home as Mrs. Falconer (Katherine Waterston) stays to answer more questions. Tiffany asks Lori to come inside as she doesn't want to be alone, and Lori obliges.",
      "But when Mrs. Falconer eventually gets home, she pulls out a knife and begins chasing both girls around the house. They hide in a closet as Tiffany freaks out over her parents both being psychotic killers.",
      "But the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Tiffany soon pulls out a knife and tries to kill Lori herself, revealing the final twist: All three Falconers were in on it together.",
      "Fina Strazza, who plays Tiffany in the film, tells TODAY.com that this ending wasn't initially in the script. At first, her character was completely innocent.",
      "\"The original version I read, Tiffany was not involved at all, and it was just the parents,\" she says. \"In the scene that I was doing for my audition,\u00a0she was just crying, and was like, 'Mom, how could you do this?'\"",
      "Then, in the final audition over Zoom, casting director Carmen Cuba and director Matt Palmer decided to test another layer to her character. They asked Strazza to improvise the scene as if she were the killer.",
      "\"I was a little bit put on the spot,\" she admits. \"I was a little nervous about that, because that\u2019s a big responsibility to take on in just one moment.\"",
      "\"I did a little something, and afterwards, Matt and Carmen were like, 'Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s kind of cool?' I was like, 'Yeah, it was awesome.' I guess it worked,\" she says. \"It landed me the part.\"",
      "Strazza says she's \"always loved horror movies\" and \"always wanted to play a killer.\"",
      "Strazza's co-star India Fowler, who played Lori Granger in the film, tells TODAY.com she has mixed feelings on the movie's ending. Part of her \"loves\" it because it's so \"shocking,\" but another part wishes the original ending could have made the cut. She says that part of her would have liked to see Tiffany and Lori form a friendship ... or even more.",
      "\"There's another side of me, which sort of thinks that Tiffany and Lori, there's a secret love affair going on,\" she says. \"And so, I have this kind of inward dream that there's a universe where Tiffany is innocent and actually she's expressing her love for Lori in a weird way.\"",
      "Fowler adds that Strazza was not alone in being directed to improvise certain moments. For the teens' dance battle, Strazza was taught classic '80s choreography, but Fowler was asked to improvise.",
      "\"Matt (Palmer) thought it was important that Lori didn't have any form of choreography,\" Fowler says. \"They really just said, 'Feel free to just be free and dance' ... That was just left up to me, which I quite liked.\""

The theme park has five different worlds with more than 50 new attractions, including the buzzed-about ride at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter\u2014Ministry of Magic.",
      "The premise takes place after Lord Voldemort has been defeated, and Dolores Umbridge is being put on trial. Guests enter a lift and soon after the ride begins, they are greeted by Harry, Ron and Hermione, all of whom are on their way to see Umbridge\u2019s trial. However, things take a turn when Umbridge escapes, and a quest to stop her before she does permanent damage ensues.",
      "Thought people can visit Epic Universe right now, it might take some time to actually get to the front of the line due to popular demand. To hold you over, TODAY.com got a sneak peek at Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry prior to its official opening.",
      "(Universal is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "The entrance",
      "The entrance to Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry is marked with a sign that reads \u201cMetrofloo\u201d over a tunnel-like opening. The Metrofloo is inspired by the Floo Network in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise, which is a mass transit system that lets wizards and witches travel to and from places including the Ministry of Magic, or the government of the British wizarding world.",
      "It\u2019s important to note that upon entering, there is a line for group riders and another line that combines single riders and a viewing-only experience of the Ministry of Magic atrium. In other words, you don\u2019t have to wait in the riders line in order to see the atrium.",
      "The Metrofloo",
      "After walking through the Metrofloo\u2019s tunnel, guests will come to an area with several entryways illuminated in green. Once they get the OK from a team member, guests can proceed through the opening as green smoke puffs around them, resembling that of floo powder (used in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise to transport wizards and witches.)",
      "Visitors then walk through a smaller tunnel until coming across a second entryway, which puffs out another round of green smoke.",
      "The Ministry of Magic atrium",
      "After getting through the second round of green smoke, visitors are officially in the atrium of the Ministry of Magic.",
      "Lined with thousands of subway tiles, the expansive tunnel leads to the Fountain of Magical Brethren, showing gold statues of a witch, a goblin and a house elf.",
      "A large moving poster toggles between a headline about Umbridge\u2019s trial, Umbridge herself and Kingsley Shacklebolt, an Auror (law enforcement official) for the Ministry of Magic.",
      "Another gold statue stands at the back of the atrium, which appears to depict a wizard pointing their wand up toward the sky.",
      "The queue",
      "While you may have to wait to board the ride, the queue sets the stage for the advantage that awaits. First, there\u2019s a room with reception booths and posters of wanted wizards hanging on the walls.",
      "In the Hall of Ministers, guests encounter a bust of the first-ever minister of magic, Ulick Gamp, interacting with the other moving pictures in the room.",
      "Perhaps the most notable room is Umbridge\u2019s regal office, where her belongings are scattered or thrown into packing boxes. Her house elf, Higgledy, sits atop her furniture \u2014 and it\u2019s certainly not the last you see of her.",
      "The lift and ride premise",
      "Once visitors arrive at the end of the queue, there are several lifts with two rows of seats awaiting guests.",
      "Once settled, the ride will take you to a motion simulator screen where Harry, Ron and Heroine greet riders on the way to see Umbridge\u2019s trial. However, a turn of events unfold as Umbridge escapes and a Death Eater comes to her aid. The rest of the journey sees the trio of best friends fight to capture Umbridge  and make sure justice is served.",
      "Post-ride souvenir",
      "Like many rides, a photo is taken during the experience and is available for purchase at the end. But instead a thematic frame, the picture is printed on the latest issue of The Daily Prophet. Extra, extra, read all about it!"

    "title": "What Happens at the End of 'Sirens'? Star Julianne Moore Explains",
    "link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/sirens-ending-explained-rcna208245",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 19:15:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Julianne Moore unpacks the ending to Netflix's \"Sirens\" and why she thinks her character Michaela winds up in a \"good place.\"",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"Sirens.\"",
      "Is Michaela Kell's mysterious lifestyle really a cult? The question that loomed over the five episodes of Netflix's \"Sirens\" is finally answered in the finale, which premiered on May 22.",
      "The resolution of an explosive weekend on a lavish New England island leaves no character unscathed, as the lives of the people in Michaela's orbit are completely upended.",
      "Julianne Moore, who stars as Michaela in the series, tells TODAY.com the series started as a look at the Greek myth of sirens \u2014 winged creatures, half-birds and half-women, with songlike voices capable of luring sailors at sea to their demise.",
      "\u201cWhy do we hear about the sirens from this perspective? We always hear about it from the sailors\u2019 perspectives, not from the sirens\u2019 perspective,\u201d Moore says. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, what are the sirens asking for? And in fact, why are they responsible and not the men?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe men are always saying, \u2018These women lured me in. These women made me crash my ship. These women made me throw my life away.\u2019 Suddenly, these men have no agency. They have no autonomy,\u201d she adds.",
      "Moore says it was the daughter of the series\u2019 showrunner, Molly Smith Metzler, who asked her mom the questions about Greek sirens that led her to write the play the series is based on.",
      "\u201cI think Molly wanted to incorporate that idea into the show, this idea of, \u2018What\u2019s their story?\u2019\u201d Moore says.",
      "What is 'Sirens' about?",
      "The five-episode Netflix series also stars Meghann Fahy as Devon, who travels to the island after being unable to reach her sister Simone, played by Milly Alcock, who is employed as Michaela's assistant.",
      "Devon's arrival on the island causes utter chaos in Michaela's perfectly precise and planned out life. The final episode starts at the end of the whirlwind weekend, as Michaela's annual gala is just beginning.",
      "Michaela has been preparing for the event with beloved assistant Simone by her side for months, but the party gets upended when Michaela decides to fire her hours before it's set to begin. The socialite discovered that her husband, Peter Kell (Kevin Bacon), kissed Simone \u2014 and had photographic evidence to prove his infidelity.",
      "While Simone insisted Peter came on to her and that she walked away after the kiss, the discovery came after Michaela found out Simone had been lying to her about her secret relationship with Peter's best friend Ethan (Glenn Howerton).",
      "Simone and Ethan did go public with their relationship earlier in the season, leading him to propose to her, but Simone turned him down. After the rejection, Ethan began to spiral, and he fell off of a cliff while fighting with Simone.",
      "How does 'Sirens' end?",
      "The beginning of Episode 5 starts with Ethan recovering in the hospital, and when he sees Simone in the room, he starts screaming and telling her to get out. Kevin sticks up for Simone, telling Ethan he needs to respect her.",
      "Moore says the series represents a push-and-pull of power dynamics between men and women. While it may look like Michaela is calling the shots, it\u2019s really Peter who is pulling the strings all along.",
      "\u201cPeter Kell has all the power because he has all the money, and this is very much about social and economic hierarchy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when you really peel it back, you realize the person making the decisions, if you go all the way up, is that billionaire.\u201d",
      "After Peter asks Michaela why she fired Simone, he sees Simone running down to the beach. He follows her, and he tells her that the end of her employment was his fault and that he would fix it. She says she has to tell him something, but the scene cuts away.",
      "The gala is in full swing back at the house as Devon confronts Michaela about the rumors she's a cult leader \u2014 and that she killed Peter's first wife \u2014 in front of all of the guests. Michaela shares that after Peter's divorce, his ex-wife had botched plastic surgery and became a recluse, shutting down all of the town gossip.",
      "After the confrontation, Peter approaches Michaela and asks to talk to her in private. He then tells her he wants a divorce after he claims she kept him from his children from his previous marriage. He also reveals that he had found the photo of him and Simone \u2014 and destroyed it.",
      "Moore says she thinks Devon's arrival on the island may have ignited the tension between Michaela and Peter, but adds their marriage was doomed no matter what.",
      "\"I think it was inevitable,\" Moore says. \"I think these kind of situations, particularly in marriages, if that\u2019s gonna happen, that\u2019s gonna happen. So it\u2019s not like Devon not coming would have changed anything. I think there would have been the same result.\"",
      "After Michaela storms out of the room, Simone walks down a set of stairs wearing an evening gown. Peter extends his hand, and walks her out \u2014 signaling that what they talked about down at the beach was starting a real relationship.",
      "As they walk into the gala, Simone sees Devon and fills her in that she's now with Peter, much to Devon's shock. Devon says she is going to go back to Buffalo to take care of their father, and the pair share a tearful goodbye when it's clear Simone is planning to stay on the island with Peter.",
      "Simone gets up and gives a toast to the gala's attendees, standing in Michaela's usual place. Devon gets on a ferry back to the mainland.",
      "On the ferry, she runs into Michaela and the pair have a heartfelt conversation about what's next for them.",
      "\"I think she\u2019s ready to get on with her life,\" Moore says of her character. \"In a sense, she\u2019s kind of back to herself. She\u2019s really back to someone who doesn\u2019t know what her future is, but she has agency, and she\u2019ll make decisions based on her own life and her own needs. So I actually think she\u2019s in a good place.\"",
      "The episode ends with a shot of Simone standing in front of Peter's home, looking out at what is now hers and thinking about all it took for her to get here \u2014 and what happened to the person who got in her way."

      "\u201cWe were there working for the Olympics last summer, and she sent me a text that said, \u2018Let\u2019s go have lunch,\u2019\u201d Willie tells TODAY.com, adding that Garten\u2019s publicist and book editor Kate Tyler tagged along. \u201cThe three of us tucked into a little corner of a tiny little restaurant in Paris, and I felt like I was walking through a dream.\u201d",
      "Willie says watching Garten in her element \u201cwas a real highlight,\u201d and he realized something about her at that table.",
      "\u201cWe sat there for a long time and just talked about life, and she is a really curious person,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re with her, it\u2019s almost never about her.

      "The pair of personalities, who enjoyed a kir royale and dessert platter onstage, have broken bread many times in the past. Garten has been a guest on Sunday TODAY in the past, where she spoke about her culinary journey and how she played a part in the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s love story with Prince Harry.",

      "\u201cShe was incredibly prepared. She had reams of notes and questions,\u201d he says, adding that he prides himself on being the first-ever guest on her show, which is now in its fifth season.",
      "\u201cHonest to God, I thought she was great,\u201d Willie continues, adding that her chill vibe made it feel like they were just having lunch at her house. \u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder of what it\u2019s like to be on that side of it, about making our guests comfortable so that they open up more, reveal and feel like it\u2019s a place where they can really share.\u201d"

      "Miley Cyrus revealed the medical condition that's behind her unique voice, and why it impacts her ability to go on tour.",
      "Cyrus shared more about her Reinke's edema diagnosis in an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe on May 21.",
      "\u201cI have the Reinke\u2019s edema, which is something that is called, it\u2019s abuse of the vocal cords,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cAnd being 21 and staying up and drinking and smoking and partying after every show does not help. But also in my case, it does not cause it. So my voice always sounded like this \u2014 it's a part of my unique anatomy.\u201d",
      "Reinke's edema, also known as polypoid corditis or vocal cord edema, is a voice disorder caused by the swelling of the vocal chords, and occurs when fluid builds up in the outer layer of the vocal chords, according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The disorder is most common in people with a long-term history of smoking, but people with chronic acid reflux, or a history of repetitive vocal trauma, like Cyrus, can also be affected.",
      "The \"Flowers\" singer went on to add that she also has a large polyp on her vocal chord, which she says has given her \"a lot of the tone and the texture\" that has made her who she is as a performer.",
      "\"But it's extremely difficult to perform with, because it's like running a marathon with ankle weights on,\" she said.",
      "Cyrus, 32, said that sometimes when she calls her mother, Tish Cyrus, at the end of the day, her mom tells her, \"Oh, you sound like you're talking through a radio.\"",
      "\"And that's how you know I'm really tired, because it creates that ultimate vocal fry,\" Cyrus said. \"And so I do have this blessing of a condition that I live with.\"",
      "Cyrus said that even though she has both Reinke's edema and the large polyp on her vocal chord, she doesn't have plans to remove the polyp.",
      "\"I'm not willing to sever it, because the chance of waking up from a surgery and not sounding like myself is a probability,\" she said.",
      "Cyrus told Lowe she plans a tour \"like every other week,\" but that her health and other factors play into her actually going on the road to perform.",
      "\"I want to do it, but it would have to be in a way that is sustainable for me in all the ways that we talked about, and then also with what I got going on,\" she said. \"Like, I don't lip sync. I sing live, and these songs are big.\"",
      "She referred to two songs on her upcoming record, \"Something Beautiful,\" which is set to drop on May 30.",
      "\"'End of the World' is a huge song, and 'More to Lose,' it's really strenuous, it's a big song. And so I don't write little songs,\" Cyrus said. \"And even if you listen to the past albums, like 'Party in the U.S.A.,' maybe, if you're in the audience and you're singing along, it's one thing, but when you've got the mic and you're performing, it's totally different.\"",
      "Cyrus also listed the logistics of traveling with a big crew, plus transporting the stage and lights, and needing to be able to play a certain amount of shows for it to \"mathematically make sense.\"",
      "\"So really, the problem for me with touring, is not only me, because this is about connecting with people around the world and using my music as a tool to heal,\" she said. \"I've always said, medicate a sick culture through these songs that I've created, or am creating. But the truth of it is is that touring, as much of it's an experience for the audience, it's a business for everybody else.\""

      "As the conclusion to \u201cSurvivor\u201d 48 began on Wednesday, May 21, there were only five castaways remaining: Eva Erickson, Kyle Fraser, Mitch Guerra, Joe Hunter and Kamilla Karthigesu.",

      "By the end of the three-hour Season 48 finale, just three castaways lasted to the Final Tribal Council: Kyle, Eva and Joe.",
      "After the jury members' votes were cast, Probst continued the divisive recent tradition of announcing the winner then and there.",
      "Kyle Fraser won \"Survivor\" 48, Probst revealed. Read on for how it all shook out.",
      "What happened during the 'Survivor' 48 finale?",
      "Following the blindside of Shauhin Davari in the penultimate episode, the final five returned to their Niu Nai camp to discuss Tribal Council. Eva and Joe thanked Kyle for tipping them off that Shauhin had turned on them, not realizing that Kyle and Kamilla concocted a plan to trick the duo into eliminating Shauhin.",
      "Kyle pointed out in his confessional that he was in a good spot, with the option of either sticking beside his strongest ally, Kamilla, or going to the final three with Eva and Joe. But, he still had more obstacles to tackle, like winning the next immunity challenge. He also worried about how Eva planned to play her hidden immunity idol.",
      "Meanwhile, Kamilla marveled at her lying abilities, adding that she planned to own all her deceptive game play if she made it to Final Tribal Council.",
      "But first, the players had to unlock a puzzle that would give them an advantage in the next challenge. Eva secured the advantage by cracking the code.",
      "At the next immunity challenge, which also included a pasta-filled reward, Probst welcomed the final five and explained that Eva's advantage allowed her to skip one of the ball toss sections. But despite the leg up, Kamilla pulled off the victory in a \u201cmassive comeback,\u201d as the host said.",
      "After Kamilla secured her spot in the final four, the other finalists had multiple conversations to decide who would join the jury as the next castaway voted out of \u201cSurvivor\" 48. Although the obvious choice seemed to be to get rid of Joe, Kamilla and Kyle contemplated eliminating Mitch instead. They were convinced that Mitch could make a better pitch to the jury if he made it to the end of the game.",
      "So when the second-to-last Tribal Council began, Mitch was a sitting duck. Kyle directly told Probst that Mitch's name was tossed around at camp. Mitch became emotional as he said it \"sucked\" knowing his game was over. But, he said he didn't have any regrets.",
      "With Mitch getting his torch snuffed, the final four journeyed to the Niu Nai camp, again, and celebrated.",
      "The next morning, the final four watched the sunrise together. In her confessional, Eva said she would take Joe to the end despite him being a strong competitor. Kamilla had a different plan for her other half in the game. She told Kyle she would select him to make fire against Joe. Kyle agreed with her thinking. As for Joe, he wanted to go to the end with Eva.",
      "For the final immunity challenge, Probst said the final four would have to\u00a0participate in a \"Survivor\" \"classic.\" The ball challenge, called \"Simmotion,\" which has appeared in multiple past seasons, required concentration and hand-eye coordination.",
      "After a close battle with Joe, Kyle became the last \u201cSurvivor\" 48 contestant to have the immunity necklace placed around his neck. He was also tasked with choosing which castaway would automatically join him in the finale, thus confirming the other two would have to participate in the fire-making challenge.",
      "Kyle upheld a promise he made before the challenge and told Joe he was taking him to the final three, meaning Eva and Kamilla had to make fire. While prepping for the challenge, Eva became overwhelmed. Joe offered to take her spot, but she declined. So, he sat with her and shared some tips to improve her fire-making skills.",
      "Before facing off, the jury looked stunned to learn that Kyle chose Joe. Each player then sat at their respective stations and began building their fires. Eva easily pulled off the victory, cementing her spot in the final three, as Kamilla struggled to get anything going.",
      "On Day 26, the last day of the season, Kyle, Joe and Eva enjoyed their breakfast feast as viewers heard the jury \u2014 Cedrek McFadden, Chrissy Sarnowsky, David Kinne, Star Toomey, Mary Zheng, Shauhin, Mitch and Kamilla \u2014 share what they hoped to hear at Final Tribal Council.",
      "As the sun set, Eva, Kyle and Joe made their way to Probst, ready to be grilled by the eliminated cast members.",
      "Probst advised them, \"Own your game and claim your victory,\" before the questions began.",
      "Multiple secrets were spilled, including Kyle revealing his true occupation as a lawyer and his undercover partnership with Kamilla.",
      "For their final pitches, Kyle said he was the most well-rounded player because he built strong relationships and played in the middle all season long. Joe spoke about being a 45-year-old firefighter and needing the money to take care of his family. Eva said  there has never been a player like her on the show and that she \"embodied\" the season by being \"unprecedented.\"",
      "After the votes were cast, Probst revealed that Kyle won, receiving five votes. Eva had two and Joe had one, marking a rare occasion in which all three finalists received votes at Final Tribal Council.",
      "All the jury members congratulated Kyle, and he toasted his fellow \"Survivor\" cast members with champagne."

    "summary": "The E.U. has pushed back against President Trump\u2019s latest threat to impose a 50% import tariff on all E.U. goods, warning trade must be built on \u201crespect.\"",
    "story": [
      "The European Union has pushed back against President Donald Trump\u2019s latest suggestion that he will impose a 50% import tariff on all E.U. goods, warning that trans-Atlantic trade must be built on \u201crespect, not threats.\u201d",
      "The rebuke came after Trump said in a Friday post on his Truth Social platform that trade negotiations with Brussels were \u201cgoing nowhere\u201d and suggested he would slap a 50% blanket duty on all European goods entering the U.S. starting June 1.",
      "It was just the latest bellicose remark from Trump and came amid a broader souring of relations between the two global powers that has seen months of distrust and economic sparring.",
      "The E.U., home to nearly 450 million people, is the world\u2019s largest trading bloc and one of Washington\u2019s top commercial partners. It exported more than $600 billion in goods to the U.S. last year while importing goods worth around $370 billion.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest broadside follows his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement of a 39% tariff on European goods, an idea he later walked back before he changed course again Friday with an even tougher stance.",
      "Stephen Moore, a former economic adviser to Trump, told the BBC that his former boss was expressing his frustration with the E.U.",
      "\u201cI think he was hoping that by now we would have the E.U. coming with some kind of deal on the table, and so far that hasn\u2019t come,\u201d he said, calling the 50% import tariffs a \u201cshot at the bow.\u201d",
      "E.U. Trade Commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said late Friday that \u201cE.U.-U.S. trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats,\u201d and that the bloc remains committed to securing \u201ca deal that works for both,\u201d following a call with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.",
      "While the E.U.\u2019s response signals a willingness to negotiate, discord has deepened between the bloc and its longtime trans-Atlantic ally over a return to the combative stance Trump took during his first administration, when he flew in the face of decades of cooperation and cast the E.U. as an economic rival.",
      "In 2018, Trump said \u201cnobody treats us much worse than the European Union\u201d and argued the bloc was designed to exploit the U.S. He repeated that claim this year, describing the E.U. as being \u201cformed in order to screw the United States.\u201d",
      "While the ideological architects of Trump's first administration such as Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro have also gone on record criticizing the union, many in Trump\u2019s current inner circle have shared those sentiments.",
      "Vice President J.D. Vance lashed out in February at European leaders at a security conference in Munich over issues ranging from free speech to migration and defense, dealing a sucker punch to the European view of America as a steadfast cultural ally.",
      "\u201cThe threat that I worry the most about vis-\u00e0-vis Europe,\u201d Vance said, \u201cis the threat from within \u2014 the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "That came after Elon Musk \u2014 the world\u2019s richest man, who also served as Trump\u2019s close adviser earlier in his second term \u2014 threw his support behind Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has called for Germany to leave the E.U.",
      "Underlying much of the second Trump administration\u2019s animosity toward Europe has been security funding, most prominently over the war in Ukraine.",
      "While the administration\u2019s view of the war in Ukraine has since softened, Vance has repeatedly opposed sending military aid to Kyiv, saying in February that \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d",
      "And in a Signal conversation between senior administration officials leaked in March, the vice president initially resisted U.S. strikes in Yemen, arguing he didn\u2019t want to \u201cbail Europe out,\u201d while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that Europe was treating America like a \u201csucker\u201d by relying on it for defense.",
      "While \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d\u2019s call for a \u201cdeal that works for both\u201d reflects the E.U.\u2019s characteristically restrained response to the Trump administration\u2019s jabs, Europe has been bracing itself for months for the possibility of a more distant economic relationship with the U.S. too.",
      "Earlier this month, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the bloc preferred to negotiate, \u201cbut not at any cost,\u201d before announcing more than $100 billion worth of possible retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods the following day.",
      "Europe also appears to be preparing for a future without America\u2019s guarantee of European security against Russia. Germany this week deployed a permanent military brigade beyond its borders for the first time since the end of World War II.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration issued orders Friday that it said would effectively lift sanctions on Syria, after President Donald Trump this month pledged to unwind the measures to help the country rebuild after a devastating civil war.",
      "The Treasury Department issued a general license that authorizes transactions involving the interim Syrian government led by President Ahmed al-Sharaa, as well as the central bank and state-owned enterprises.",
      "The general license, known as GL25, \u201cauthorizes transactions prohibited by the Syrian Sanctions Regulations, effectively lifting sanctions on Syria,\u201d the Treasury said in a statement.",
      "\u201cGL25 will enable new investment and private sector activity consistent with the President\u2019s America First strategy,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio also issued a 180-day waiver under the Caesar Act to ensure that sanctions do not obstruct investment and to facilitate the provision of electricity, energy, water and sanitation and enable humanitarian efforts, he said in a statement.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s actions represent the first step in delivering on the President\u2019s vision of a new relationship between Syria and the United States,\u201d Rubio said, adding that Trump had made clear his expectation that sanctions relief would be followed by action by the Syrian government.",
      "The White House said after Trump met Sharaa last week that the president asked Syria to adhere to several conditions in exchange for sanctions relief, including telling all foreign militants to leave Syria, deporting what he called Palestinian terrorists, and helping the U.S. prevent the resurgence of ISIS.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is providing the Syrian government with the chance to promote peace and stability, both within Syria and in Syria\u2019s relations with its neighbors,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "Syria welcomed the sanctions waiver early on Saturday, which the Foreign Ministry called a \u201cpositive step in the right direction to alleviate the country\u2019s humanitarian and economic suffering.\u201d",
      "Syria is keen on cooperating with other countries \u201con the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs. It believes that dialogue and diplomacy are the best path to building balanced relations,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.",
      "Most of the U.S. sanctions on Syria were imposed on the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and key individuals in 2011 after civil war erupted there. Sharaa led militias that overthrew Assad in December.",
      "The general license names Sharaa, formerly sanctioned under the name Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani, among the people and entities with whom transactions are now authorized. It also lists Syrian Arab Airlines, the Central Bank of Syria and a number of other banks, several state oil and gas companies and the Four Seasons Damascus hotel.",
      "Trump unexpectedly announced last week that he would lift the sanctions at the behest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, a major U.S. policy shift he made before meeting briefly with Sharaa in Riyadh.",
      "It is hoped that easing Syria sanctions will clear the way for greater engagement by humanitarian organizations working in Syria, encouraging foreign investment and trade as the country rebuilds. But the U.S. has imposed layers of measures against Syria, cutting it off from the international banking system and barring many imports, and the potential for sanctions on a country to return can chill private-sector investment.",
      "The U.S. first put the country on its list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1979 and since then has added additional sets of sanctions, including several rounds following the country\u2019s 2011 uprising against Assad."

      "Aid workers struggling to distribute a trickle of aid entering the besieged Gaza Strip are describing a logistical \u201cnightmare\u201d in the midst of a spiraling humanitarian crisis.",
      "\u201cWith this limited amount of aid, the humanitarian situation continues to get worse and worse,\u201d Dr. Amjad Alshawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, an umbrella group of Palestinian organizations, told NBC News on Wednesday. \u201cAt the same time, the Israelis are imposing restrictions on access to these supplies.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said humanitarian workers were able to pick up at least 90 truckloads of aid Wednesday night \u2014 but it was unclear whether that aid had been distributed as of Thursday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground described widespread frustration among Palestinians waiting to see whether more aid will flow into the enclave. Many charities have stopped or reduced their food offerings because of the scarcity of supplies and high cost of the rare goods available at markets.",
      "After lifting its almost three-month-long blockade of the entry of food, medicine and other aid into Gaza, Israel has allowed a trickle of supplies into the enclave in recent days amid mounting international pressure. Aid groups say it has also imposed a new set of rules on bringing in supplies, which they blame for logistical snarl-ups and a delay in food and medicine reaching those who need it.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military\u2019s liaison with the Palestinians, said Thursday that 198 trucks had entered Gaza, but did not specifically comment on the new procedures and referred NBC News to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for further comment, which it did not immediately provide.",
      "COGAT data suggested the majority of that aid has been food, with medicine and medical equipment making up a smaller share.",
      "Humanitarian groups have warned that the limited aid flowing in is a fraction of the amount needed, with an average of around 500 trucks a day entering in Gaza before the war, according to the British Red Cross.",
      "Despite that resumption, little if any aid entering Gaza had reached Palestinian civilians as of late Wednesday, with humanitarian groups saying that new procedures introduced by Israel have complicated an already tangled effort.",
      "Logistical 'nightmare'",
      "In a briefing Wednesday, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said that in one instance, the rules meant that, \u201cIsraeli authorities had only allowed our teams to go through one area that was highly congested, that we felt was insecure and where we felt looting was highly likely to take place, given the prolonged deprivation in Gaza.\u201d",
      "While Israeli authorities have not specifically laid out what the new rules involve, Dujarric said Tuesday that humanitarian workers were being required to offload supplies on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing and then reload them separately once teams inside Gaza were allowed to collect them.",
      "He noted that one team waited \"several hours\" for such a green light but was never able to transport the goods.",
      "Meanwhile, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, has found many of its trucks \u201cblocked for reasons that are sometimes unknown,\u201d its head of mission for the Palestinian Territories, Jean Guy Vataux, told NBC News in Jerusalem late Wednesday.",
      "While he added that some of the new procedures were \u201cput in place to avoid smuggling,\u201d the new system \u201cturns into a logistic nightmare for the agencies.\u201d",
      "'Malnutrition is growing'",
      "Meanwhile, \"malnutrition is growing\" in Gaza, Vataux said.",
      "An Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, report released earlier this month warned of the risk of famine if adequate access to food was not restored.",
      "The IPC snapshot warned that some 470,000 people in Gaza were facing \u201ccatastrophic hunger,\u201d while the entire population was experiencing food insecurity, the World Food Programme said. It further projected that an \u201calarming 71,000 children and more than 17,000 mothers\u201d would need \u201curgent treatment for acute malnutrition.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the U.N. clarified comments from its humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who had said some 14,000 babies were at risk of death within a short time frame. The body said that the same number of babies is facing severe malnutrition absent a significant and swift increase of aid into Gaza, with severe malnutrition posing the risk of death."

    "story": [
      "The phone call between President Donald Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin may not have achieved great strides on ending the war in Ukraine, but it did confirm one thing: The bromance is real. But a question is left hanging: What does this bonhomie actually deliver for the men in the Kremlin and White House?",
      "\u201cThe tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent,\u201d Trump said of his Russian counterpart after their two-hour conversation Monday, adding that Putin is a \u201cnice gentleman.\u201d Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov, meanwhile, said Trump and Putin called each other by their first names and \u201cneither of them wanted to end the conversation.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Putin commissioned a portrait of his American counterpart and delivered it to him. One of Trump\u2019s envoys, Steve Witkoff, told Tucker Carlson in March that the president was \u201cclearly touched\u201d by what he called a \u201cbeautiful\u201d portrait.",
      "Trump is not just seeking an end to the war in Ukraine, which Russia started by launching its large-scale 2022 invasion; in addition, he has made no secret of his desire to do lucrative deals with a Kremlin reintroduced to the international financial fold.",
      "In April he wrote on Truth Social that he was \u201chopeful Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,\u201d adding that \u201cboth will then start to do big business with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Before that happens, Trump and his team have suggested they want the war to end, something the president has made a clear political goal, having promised during his presidential campaign that it would take just 24 hours to secure, although he later told Time magazine that this was an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d",
      "His call with Putin appears to have brought that no closer to fruition, with a chasm still aching between Ukraine\u2019s willingness for a 30-day ceasefire and Russia\u2019s demand for Kyiv\u2019s effective surrender.",
      "It\u2019s not been a total love-in between the leaders of these former Cold War foes. Trump has expressed frustration with his Russian counterpart for continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians while negotiations to end the fighting are ongoing.",
      "And Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the White House is not asking the Senate to hold back on a bill that would slap a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, gas and other products.",
      "But one thing that Putin\u2019s personal connection with Trump does is buy him time, according to Mark Galeotti, director of the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "Putin has shown little desire for any sort of ceasefire that does not satisfy his maximalist goals. And right now his forces continue to make slow but steady battlefield advances in eastern Ukraine, according to independent monitors like the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War think tank.",
      "So, with negotiations at an impasse, Putin will be more than happy to delay any definite decision \u2014 on both American support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, Galeotti said.",
      "\u201cEvery week counts\u201d in this \u201cparticularly pivotal moment,\u201d Galeotti said. If his call with Trump delays making any decisions, then \u201cI think Putin will see it as a good job done,\u201d he said.",
      "As with its lack of detail on how the war might end, the call also provided little clarity on whether or when Trump and Putin might meet in person, something they have both suggested could happen. If and when this real-world t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate does take place, it will be harder for Putin to resist giving Trump something, according to Galeotti.",
      "The Russians are \u201ctrying to avoid giving anything because they are very, very hard-nosed negotiators,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they do meet in person, then Trump will have to leave with something.\u201d",
      "While no date for a meeting between the two leaders has been set, their longtime fondness has long caused widespread alarm across the West. Intelligence agencies see Putin as a foe who has challenged international norms through hybrid warfare such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against democratic institutions.",
      "Asked for a response to these criticisms, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in an email that \u201cunlike his predecessor, President Trump is willing to look anyone in the eye and negotiate deals that deliver peace.\u201d",
      "Kelly said that \u201cthanks to his leadership\u201d Russia and Ukraine \u201cwill begin ceasefire talks to stop the killing in the bloodiest European war since World War II.\u201d A date and venue for ceasefire talks has not been set.",
      "The American president\u2019s connection with Putin has roots at least as far back as 2013, when he visited Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant and pondered on Twitter whether Putin will \u201cbecome my new best friend?\u201d",
      "By 2015, before the two men had even met, Putin was heaping praise on Trump as a \u201ccolorful, talented person,\u201d something the American leader said was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d coming from the \u201chighly respected\u201d Russian leader.",
      "A year later, Trump openly urged Putin to influence the American presidential election, telling a rally in Doral, Florida, that \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d This was in the eyes of many observers an overt invitation for Russian intelligence services to hack into the account of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.",
      "Putin would indeed conduct a campaign to interfere, according to a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released in 2020.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the pair met on multiple occasions without any staff present, a highly unusual departure from standard protocol. But the Russian government would ultimately conclude that while the president himself was friendly, his administration was not. The Trump White House imposed sanctions and withdrew from a nuclear deal it said Russia wasn\u2019t respecting.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s second term looks like it could be a repeat.",
      "Asked about future opportunities for face-to-face diplomacy between himself Putin, Trump replied: \u201cWe have to meet. He and I will meet. I think we\u2019ll solve it, or maybe not.\u201d"

      "Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday for his revenge thriller \"It Was Just an Accident,\" handing the festival's top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years.",
      "Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film (\"This Is Not a Film\") made in his living room, and another (\"Taxi\") set in a car.",
      "The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 at the festival held up Panahi's name to honor the director then under house arrest.",
      "On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country.",
      "\"Let us join forces,\" said Panahi. \"No one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing.\"",
      "\"Let's continue to hope,\" he concluded.",
      "The win for \"It Was Just an Accident\" extend one of the most unprecedented streaks in movies: The indie distributor Neon has backed the last six Palme d'or winners. Neon, which acquired \"It Was Just an Accident\" for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \"Parasite,\" \"Titane,\" \"Triangle of Sadness,\" \"Anatomy of a Fall\" and \"Anora.\"",
      "All those films were Oscar contenders and two, \"Parasite\" and \"Anora,\" won best picture.",
      "Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes, and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.",
      "\"It Was Just an Accident\" was inspired by Panahi's experience in jail. In it, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.",
      "\"The film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,\" Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. \"Art will always win. What is human will always win.\"",
      "The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes.",
      "Other winners at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival",
      "The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier's Norwegian family drama \"Sentimental Value,\" his lauded follow-up to \"The Worst Person in the World.\" Some had expected \"Sentimental Value\" to win the Palme, but Trier \u2014 whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve \u2014 still took a major prize.",
      "\"We live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,\" said Trier. \"And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.\"",
      "Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho's Brazilian political thriller \"The Secret Agent\" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for \"The Secret Agent\" showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, \"That was our wish.\"",
      "The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' \"I'm Still Here\" in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said the awards \"show that our country's cinema is second to none.\"",
      "The jury prize was split between two films: \u00d3liver Laxe's desert road trip \"Sir\u00e2t \" and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama \"Sound of Falling.\" Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for \"The Little Sister,\" Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama.",
      "The Belgian brothers Jean-Luc and Pierre Dardennes, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, \"Young Mothers.\" Cannes' award for best first film went to Hasan Hadi, for \"The President's Cake,\" making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.",
      "What else shaped Cannes this year",
      "Saturday's ceremony brings to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",
      "Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \"Can you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn't ship that way,\" said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \"The Phoenician Scheme\" at the festival.",
      "That was one of the top American films in Cannes, along with Spike Lee's \"Highest 2 Lowest,\" the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning\" and Ari Aster's \"Eddington.\""

      "CANNES, France \u2014 A major power outage struck southeastern France on Saturday morning, disrupting traffic and briefly halting events at the Cannes Film Festival as the prestigious event prepared to hand out its top prize.",
      "Power was restored around 3 p.m., as music began blasting again from beachfront speakers. The end of the blackout was greeted with loud cheers from locals.",
      "Earlier, about 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department lost electricity after a high-voltage line fell Saturday morning, electricity network operator RTE said on X. The outage came hours after a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes overnight had already weakened the grid.",
      "Police have opened an investigation into possible arson.",
      "\u201cWe are looking into the likelihood of a fire being started deliberately,\u201d said a spokesperson for the French national gendarmerie.",
      "Cannes Film Festival organizers confirmed the outage affected the early activities of Saturday and said the Palais des Festivals \u2014 the Croisette\u2019s main venue \u2014 had switched to an independent power supply.",
      "\u201cAll scheduled events and screenings, including the Closing Ceremony, will proceed as planned and under normal conditions,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt this stage, the cause of the outage has not yet been identified. Restoration efforts are underway.\u201d",
      "Traffic lights in parts of Cannes and the surrounding city of Antibes stopped working after 10 a.m., leading to traffic jams and confusion in city centers. Most shops along the Croisette remained closed, and local food kiosks were only accepting cash. Train service in Cannes was also disrupted.",
      "Screenings at the Cineum, one of the festival\u2019s satellite venues, were briefly suspended, the festival added."

      "Less Brad Pitt, more Brad Pit Bull, the 25th annual Palm Dog awards in Cannes rolled out the red carpet Friday for the four-legged stars to get their flowers alongside their human colleagues, who were in town for this year\u2019s iteration of the film festival held in the French beach town.",
      "Under the Plage du Festival tent, humans sipped their wine while their furry co-stars soaked up the attention at the award ceremony, a pun on Cannes\u2019 famous Palme d\u2019Or, awarded to the director of the year\u2019s best feature film.",
      "This year\u2019s top dog was Panda, an Icelandic sheepdog who stole the show in \u201cThe Love That Remains,\u201d by director Hlynur Palmason. Panda is Palmason\u2019s dog in real life, but the victorious hound could hardly be accused of nepaw-tism after her central performance in the drama that explores a year in the life of a family following parental separation.",
      "With Panda unable to attend in person, she was granted perhaps the ultimate privilege of stardom \u2014 a double named Lola, who received the award on the winner\u2019s behalf and was pictured alongside children.",
      "Palm Dog jury member Wendy Mitchell said Panda was chosen for the grand prize because of how central she is to the family\u2019s life in the film, joining them on hikes, on car rides and at the mother\u2019s art studio.",
      "\u201cThere are so many great competitors this year, but this dog is at the heart of the film,\u201d Mitchell told Reuters.",
      "While the vagaries of being a film-famous canine meant that Panda couldn\u2019t be there to accept her award in person, she had her people send in a recorded video of her \u201caccepting\u201d the prize \u2014 a shiny red bandana stitched with the words \u201cPalm Dog 2025\u201d in golden thread.",
      "\u201cThe Love That Remains\u201d producer Anton Mani Svansson explained Panda \u201cdoesn\u2019t really know\u201d about the prize, saying of the dog\u2019s bandana that \u201cI guess she will feel good when she has gotten this around her neck.\u201d",
      "Past winners of the prestigious prize include Messi, the border collie from Justine Triet\u2019s \u201cAnatomy of a Fall,\u201d which in 2023 became the only movie to claim a Palm d\u2019Or and Palm Dog double. In 2019, a pit bull named Brandy owned by Brad Pitt\u2019s character in \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d secured the gong.",
      "But the Palm Dog wasn\u2019t the only prize on offer to furry thespians.",

    "story": [
      "Iranian and U.S. delegations wrapped up a fifth round of talks in Rome on Friday and signs of some limited progress emerged in the negotiations aimed at resolving a decades-long dispute over Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.",
      "Despite both Washington and Tehran taking a tough stance in public ahead of the talks on Iran's uranium enrichment, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said there was potential for progress after Oman made several proposals during the talks.",
      "\u201cWe have just completed one of the most professional rounds of talks... We firmly stated Iran\u2018s position... The fact that we are now on a reasonable path, in my view, is itself a sign of progress,\u201d Araghchi told state TV.",
      "\u201cThe proposals and solutions will be reviewed in respective capitals... and the next round of talks will be scheduled accordingly.\u201d",
      "A senior U.S. official said the talks lasted more than two hours and were both direct and indirect with Omani mediators.",
      "\u201cThe talks continue to be constructive \u2014 we made further progress, but there is still work to be done. Both sides agreed to meet again in the near future. We are grateful to our Omani partners for their continued facilitation,\u201d the official said.",
      "The stakes are high for both sides. President Donald Trump wants to curtail Tehran\u2019s potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could trigger a regional nuclear arms race and perhaps threaten Israel. The Islamic Republic, for its part, wants to be rid of devastating sanctions on its oil-based economy.",
      "Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said on X the talks between Araghchi and Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had ended \u201cwith some but not conclusive progress\u201d.",
      "Ahead of the talks, Araghchi wrote on X: \u201cZero nuclear weapons = we Do have a deal. Zero enrichment = we do NOT have a deal. Time to decide.\u201d",
      "Among remaining stumbling blocks are Tehran\u2019s refusal to ship abroad its entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium \u2014 possible raw material for nuclear bombs \u2014 or engage in discussions over its ballistic missile program.",
      "Diplomats have said reaching a concrete deal before the summer would technically be impossible given the complexities of an accord. In the meantime, a senior Iranian official involved in nuclear talks with the U.S. said \u201cif Washington drops its \u2018zero enrichment\u2019 demand, a political agreement is feasible.\u201d",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday that Washington was working to reach an accord that would allow Iran to have a civil nuclear energy program but not enrich uranium, while acknowledging that this \u201cwill not be easy\u201d.",
      "Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last say on matters of state, rejected demands to stop refining uranium as \u201cexcessive and outrageous\u201c, warning that such talks were unlikely to yield results.",
      "Iran says it is ready to accept some limits on enrichment, but needs watertight guarantees that Washington would not renege on a future nuclear accord.",
      "Trump in his first term in 2018 ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between major powers and Iran. Since returning to office this year, he has restored a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on Tehran and reimposed sweeping U.S. sanctions that continue to hobble the Iranian economy.",
      "Iran responded by escalating enrichment far beyond the 2015 pact\u2019s limits.",
      "Wendy Sherman, a former U.S. undersecretary who led the U.S. negotiating team that reached the 2015 agreement, earlier said that Tehran presents enrichment as a matter of sovereignty.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it is possible to get a deal with Iran where they literally dismantle their program, give up their enrichment, even though that would be ideal,\u201d she told Reuters.",
      "The cost of failure of the talks could be high. Iran\u2018s arch-foe Israel sees Iran\u2018s nuclear program as an existential threat and says it would never allow the clerical establishment to obtain nuclear weapons. Tehran says it has no such ambitions and the purposes are purely civilian.",
      "Israel\u2019s strategic affairs minister and the head of its foreign intelligence service, Mossad, were also due to be in Rome for talks with the U.S. negotiators, a source aware of the matter told Reuters.",
      "Araghchi said Thursday that Washington would bear legal responsibility if Israel attacked Iranian nuclear installations, following a CNN report that Israel might be preparing strikes."

      "Ukraine's capital came under a large-scale Russian drone and missile attack overnight and into early Saturday that left at least 15 people injured, according to Ukrainian officials. Explosions and machine gun fire were heard throughout Kyiv as many sought shelter in subway stations.",
      "The attack came hours after Russia and Ukraine began a major prisoner exchange of hundreds of soldiers and civilians, the first phase of a swap agreed on by the two sides at a meeting in Istanbul last week.",
      "The agreement was a rare moment of cooperation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the 3-year-old war.",
      "Russia attacked Ukraine with 14 ballistic missiles and 250 Shahed drones overnight, officials said, adding that Ukrainian forces shot down 6 missiles and neutralized 245 drones \u2014 128 drones were shot down and 117 were thwarted using electronic warfare.",
      "The Kyiv City Military Administration said it was one of the most massive combined missile and drone attacks on the capital.",
      "\u201cA difficult night for all of us,\u201d the administration said in a statement.",
      "The debris of intercepted missiles and drones fell in at least six city districts of the Ukrainian capital. According to the acting head of Kyiv's military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, six people required medical care after the attack and two fires were sparked in the Solomianskyi district of Kyiv.",
      "The Obolon district, where a residential building was heavily damaged in the attack, was the hardest hit. There were at least five wounded in the area, the administration said.",
      "Yurii Bondarchuk, a local resident, said the air raid siren \u201cstarted as usual, then the drones started to fly around as they constantly do.\u201d",
      "Moments later, he heard a boom and saw shattered glass fly through the air.",
      "\u201cThe balcony is totally wiped out, as well as the windows and the doors,\u201d he said, describing the damage to his apartment as he stood in the dark of the night, smoking a cigarette to calm his nerves while firefighters worked to extinguish the flames.",
      "The air raid alert in Kyiv lasted more than seven hours, warning of incoming missiles and drones.",
      "Kyiv's mayor, Vitalii Klitschko, warned residents ahead of the attack that more than 20 Russian strike drones were heading toward the city. As the attack continued, he said drone debris fell on a shopping mall and a residential building in Obolon district of Kyiv. Emergency services were headed to the site, Klitschko said.",
      "The prisoner swap on Friday was the first phase of a complicated deal involving the exchange of 1,000 prisoners from each side.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the first phase of the deal brought home 390 Ukrainians, with further releases expected over the weekend, which will make it the largest swap of the war. Russia's Defense Ministry said it received the same number of people from Ukraine.",
      "The swap took place at the border with Belarus, in northern Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The released Russians were taken to Belarus for medical treatment, the Russian Defense Ministry said.",
      "However, the exchange \u2014 the latest of dozens of swaps since the war began and the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians so far \u2014 did not herald a halt in the fighting.",
      "Battles continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.",
      "After the May 16 Istanbul meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan called the prisoner swap a \u201cconfidence-building measure\u201d and said the parties had agreed in principle to meet again.",
      "But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that there has been no agreement yet on the venue for the next round of talks as diplomatic maneuvering continued.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow would give Ukraine a draft document outlining its conditions for a \u201csustainable, long-term, comprehensive\u201d peace agreement, once the ongoing prisoner exchange had finished.",
      "European leaders have accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts while he tries to press his larger army's battlefield initiative and capture more Ukrainian land.",
      "The Istanbul meeting revealed that both sides remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting. One such condition for Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said it had shot down 788 Ukrainian drones away from the battlefield between May 20 and May 23.",
      "Ukraine's air force said Russia fired 175 Shahed and decoy drones, as well as a ballistic missile since late Thursday."

      "President Donald Trump threatened to slap European imports with a sweeping 50% tariff, writing online Friday that trade talks with regional leaders are \"going nowhere.\"",
      "In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he was \"recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\" That rate would be higher than the 39% Trump promised to hit the bloc with on April 2, the so-called \"Liberation Day\" of far-reaching tariffs he scaled back a week later.",
      "Just minutes earlier on Friday morning, Trump had also threatened Apple with a 25% tariff if it does not start producing iPhones in the United States \u2014 an outcome industry experts broadly see as a nonstarter. \"The concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale,\" the prominent tech analyst Dan Ives said in response.",
      "Later Friday, Trump was asked whether the European Union could do anything to avoid his 50% tariff threat. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"We're going to see what happens, but right now, it's going on in June 1, and that's the way it is.\"",

EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.\"",
      "The 27-member European Union and its predecessor organizations were formed at the urging of the United States to bolster security and economies on both sides of the Atlantic after World War II. The bloc is America's biggest trading partner,with the United States exporting more than $350 billion of goods and $238 billion of services there in recent years. The E.U. is also the largest source of U.S. imports, with the nation buying more than $550 billion worth of goods and more than $170 billion of services.",
      "Trump's early morning posts risked reigniting the trade war he started in April after it had cooled down somewhat in recent weeks. His administration had been speaking positively about ongoing trade talks, even though it has so far secured few concrete economic wins. The president has backed down from some of his most severe tariffs, sparking a comeback for U.S. and global markets.",
      "That rebound looked poised to reverse after Trump\u2019s posts, with stock indexes in Germany, France and Italy each dropping around 1.7%. The Stoxx 600, which tracks hundreds of stocks across Europe, dropped nearly 1%.",
      "U.S. stocks opened sharply lower, but ended the day off their worst levels. The S&P 500 fell for a fourth straight day, closing 0.7% lower, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1%. The Dow ended the day lower by 256 points, or 0.6%.",
      "A number of companies with major U.S. and E.U. operations also saw their shares fall. Deutsche Bank shares plunged 4%, carmakers BMW and Jeep-maker Stellantis each dropped 3.5%, and tech giant SAP fell 2%. Cosmetics firm L'Oreal slid more than 2%, and luxury goods conglomerate LVMH fell 3%.",
      "Trump has repeatedly assailed the European Union, calling it \u201cin many ways, nastier than China.\" On tariff rates and what the U.S. calls \"non-tariff barriers,\" Trump has said, \"They'll come down a lot. You watch.\" But the bloc has refused to alter its value-added tax, a frequent point of contention for Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other U.S. officials.",
      "Speaking on CNBC shortly after Trump's social media posts, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee noted: \"10% was going to be the highest tariff rate that we had on the world in 90 years. To go to 50% is a completely different order of magnitude.\"",
      "Goolsbee added that it would be \"really scary for the supply chain\" if businesses in his Midwest district, which includes auto hub Detroit, would see tariff rates as high as 50%.",
      "The E.U. has been bracing itself for months for the possibility that trade talks with the U.S. would fail. \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the European Commission\u2019s trade chief, said in early May that the bloc preferred negotiations, \"but not at any cost.\" He added: \"We therefore continue to prepare for every scenario.\" The following day, the E.U. announced more than $100 billion worth of possible retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "\"With the exception of the E.U., most [countries] are negotiating in very good faith,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday morning on Fox News. \"I would hope that this would light a fire under the E.U.\"",
      "In 2024, pharmaceutical products were the E.U.'s top export to the United States, with more than $90 billion crossing the Atlantic, followed by more than $45 billion of vehicles and automotive products. Telecom, information technology and scientific services were the top imports."

A member of the Ukrainian delegation called those conditions \"non-starters\".",
      "Trump, who has shifted U.S. policy from supporting Ukraine towards accepting some of Russia's account of the war, had said he could tighten sanctions on Russia if Moscow blocked a peace deal. But after speaking to Putin on Monday he decided to take no action for now.",

      "Kyiv says that is tantamount to surrender and would leave it defenseless in the face of future Russian attacks."

    "story": [
      "Germany has this week deployed a permanent military brigade beyond its borders for the first time since the end of World War II.",
      "The historic unit dispatched to the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, was inaugurated Thursday by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said during a military ceremony in the city that \u201cthe security of our Baltic allies is also our security.\u201d",
      "The groundbreaking German military decision is perhaps the most significant in a steady stream of moves by European nations to bolster defenses on NATO\u2019s eastern flank amid persistent security threats from Russia and President Donald Trump's insistence that Europe does more both to defend itself and pay for that defense.",
      "It also comes despite persistent efforts by the Trump administration to bring to an end the Kremlin's three-year-long war in Ukraine.",
      "Among Ukraine\u2019s European allies, the three Baltic nations of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia \u2014 linked to NATO\u2019s main territory only by a narrow corridor that stretches between Russia and its staunch ally Belarus known as the Suwalki Gap \u2014 are perhaps the most vulnerable to an expanded Russian assault.",
      "On Thursday, Merz said that \u201cRussia\u2019s aggressive revisionism\u201d since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 meant it could seek to redraw the broader map of Europe and not just that of Ukraine.",
      "Standing alongside Merz, Lithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da added that Russia and Belarus had already begun conducting military exercises on his country\u2019s border.",
      "The new German brigade on NATO\u2019s eastern flank will comprise a heavy combat unit of some 4,800 soldiers, hundreds of civilian staff, and 2,000 vehicles, including tanks. It will be headquartered in Rudninkai near Vilnius and is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2027.",
      "\u201cAnyone who threatens an ally must know that the entire alliance will jointly defend every inch of NATO territory,\u201d Merz said.",
      "Trump has been putting pressure on America's NATO allies to increase their military spending, previously accusing Germany and other European countries of \u201cfreeloading\u201d at Washington\u2019s expense and even going as far as implementing a temporary pause on military aid to Ukraine in March this year.",
      "It also marks a shift away from America's guarantee of European security against Russia that has been in place since World War II which has yielded U.S. hard and soft power throughout the continent and beyond.",
      "After his center-right Christian Democratic Union party won the German election in February, Merz said his \u201cabsolute priority\u201d was \u201cstrengthening Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the U.S.\u201d",
      "In line with Germany, other European front-line countries have begun upping spending in order to fortify their borders against Russia and Belarus. Earlier this month, Lithuania announced it would spend around $1.2 billion on its military, raising it to 6% of its annual gross domestic product.",
      "Neighboring Poland, meanwhile, recently allocated an additional $2.6 billion to the sector, raising it to 4.7% of its GDP this year.",
      "Despite American diplomats holding several rounds of bilateral negotiations with diplomats from Russia and Ukraine \u2014 Trump held an as-yet-fruitless phone conversation Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 the U.S. president has expressed frustration with his Russian counterpart continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians while negotiations to end the fighting are ongoing.",
      "Meanwhile, Putin said in a video conference with Russian government officials Thursday that his military had begun creating a \u201csecurity buffer zone\u201d along its border with Ukraine, a day after he visited the western Russian region of Kursk that Russia says its forces reclaimed from Ukraine earlier this month.",
      "Putin's latest move comes after Russian negotiators reportedly threatened during direct negotiations last week to seize the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv and Sumy if Ukraine did not agree to the Kremlin\u2019s demands that essentially amount to a surrender from Kyiv.",
      "The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, this week described the threat as a warning sign from Russia in a report.",
      "\u201cThis tactic suggests that Russia will make additional, more extreme territorial demands during war termination talks should Ukraine agree to Russia\u2019s ceasefire preconditions,\u201d it stated."
