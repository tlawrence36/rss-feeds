      "VENICE, Italy -- VENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Kathryn Bigelow tackles geopolitics in her new film \u201cA House of Dynamite,\u201d which has its world premiere on Tuesday at the Venice Film Festival.",
      "The film is about an imminent missile strike on the U.S., from an unknown aggressor, and how the White House responds.",
      "\u201cI grew up in an era when hiding under your school desk was considered the go-to protocol for surviving an atomic bomb,\u201d Bigelow said in her director\u2019s statement. \u201cToday, the danger has only escalated. Multiple nations possess enough nuclear weapons to end civilization within minutes. And yet, there\u2019s a kind of collective numbness \u2014 a quiet normalization of the unthinkable.\u201d",
      "She added that she wanted to make a film that confronts this paradox \u2014 \u201cto explore the madness of a world that lives under the constant shadow of annihilation, yet rarely speaks of it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s Bigelow\u2019s first film since the 2017 release of \u201cDetroit.\u201d Her most acclaimed films have been politically themed, from \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d for which she became the first woman to win the best director Oscar, to \u201cZero Dark Thirty.\u201d",
      "\u201cA House of Dynamite\u201d was written by former NBC News President Noah Oppenheim, who won best screenplay at the festival for \u201cJackie\u201d in 2016.",
      "\u201cA House of Dynamite\u201d is one of three Netflix films playing in competition, alongside Guillermo del Toro\u2019s classically gothic \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and Noah Baumbach\u2019s Hollywood drama \u201cJay Kelly.\u201d The streamer still doesn't have a best picture win in its arsenal, and Venice has proved itself to be a solid launching pad for awards hopefuls.",

      "The agency that oversees Voice of America and other government-funded international broadcasters says it's eliminating jobs for more than 500 employees",
      "WASHINGTON -- The agency that oversees Voice of America and other government-funded international broadcasters is eliminating jobs for more than 500 employees, a Trump administration official said. The move could ratchet up a monthslong legal challenge over the news outlets' fate.",
      "Kari Lake, acting CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, announced the latest round of job cuts late Friday, one day after a federal judge blocked her from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA director.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth had ruled separately that the Republican administration had failed to show how it was complying with his orders to restore VOA's operations. His order Monday gave the administration \u201cone final opportunity, short of a contempt trial\u201d to demonstrate its compliance. He ordered Lake to sit for a deposition by lawyers for agency employees by Sept. 15.",
      "On Thursday, Lamberth said Abramowitz could not be removed without the approval of the majority of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board. Firing Abramowitz would be \u201cplainly contrary to law,\u201d according to Lamberth, who was nominated to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan.",
      "Lake posted a statement on social media that said her agency had initiated a reduction in force, or RIF, eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees. She said the agency \u201cwill continue to fulfill its statutory mission after this RIF\u2014 and will likely improve its ability to function.\u201d",
      "\u201cI look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America\u2019s voice is heard abroad where it matters most,\u201d she wrote.",

So far we have not seen any evidence of that.\u201d",
      "In June, layoff notices were sent to more than 600 agency employees. Abramowitz was placed on administrative leave along with almost the entire VOA staff. He was told he would be fired effective Aug. 31.",
      "The administration said in a court filing Thursday that it planned to send RIF notices to 486 employees of VOA and 46 other agency employees but intended to retain 158 agency employees and 108 VOA employees. The filing said the global media agency had 137 \u201cactive employees\u201d and 62 other employees on administrative leave while VOA had 86 active employees and 512 others administrative leave.",
      "The agency also houses Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. The networks, which together reach an estimated 427 million people, date to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism.",

      "That was the trap that sunk the Danny DeVito-directed 1989 version \u201cThe War of the Roses\u201d and it's the same quicksand that makes the Jay Roach-directed \u201cThe Roses\u201d so unpleasant. Seeing a marriage implode with such ferocity, with both participants hoping to extract maximum hurt, is like having \u201cMarriage Story\u201d on MDMA.",

      "That, too, may be a funny way to describe a movie where bodies get brutalized, corpses accumulate and even the cat comes away with a limp. But \u201cCaught Stealing,\u201d a terrific caper starring Austin Butler as a Lower East Side man inadvertently drawn into a nightmarish crime world, is a period movie. It's set in 1998. And no amount of blood can detract from the overwhelming endearment Aronofsky has for '90s New York.",
      "Butler plays Hank Thompson: a former baseball player who can't play anymore; a bartender who, after some of the early events of the movie, can\u2019t drink anymore; and a devoted San Francisco Giants fan surrounded by Mets fans. As his not-quite girlfriend Yvonne ( Zo\u00eb Kravitz ) says, he's \u201ca good country boy\u201d who calls his mom in California every day. They end every call with \u201cGo Giants!\u201d",
      "Hank is far from the first regular guy to be ensnared in underground crime syndicates, but there are a number of things that distinguish \u201cCaught Stealing.\u201d First, his troubles stem, like they do for so many New Yorkers, from his neighbor. Russ (Matt Smith), the mohawked Brit punk who lives next door, rushes out to fly to London, and he leaves Hank his cat to take care of.",
      "Soon, though, a pair of Russian gang skinheads (Yuri Kolokolnikov, Nikita Kukushkin) are banging on Russ' door and quickly after, pummeling Hank, too. Their beating of Hank is unexpectedly brutal, and the first sign that \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d is going for something a little different. When Hank wakes up in the hospital, he's down a kidney and told he can't drink alcohol ever again.",
      "For Hank, it's not his first blush with alcohol-connected fatality. In flashbacks that replay as Hank's nightmares, we see him as a hotshot high-school baseball player, soon to be drafted into the pros. While drinking and driving, he careens off the road to avoid a cow, driving straight into a pole. His buddy is dead, and Hank's knee won't ever be the same.",
      "Meanwhile, the Russian mob interest continues to spiral, drawing in a police detective (Regina King, always good), the skinheads' boss, Colorado (Bad Bunny), and a pair of Orthodox Jewish brothers (Liev Schreiber and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio). The question that keeps coming up is whether Hank can hack it in this world. Is he a killer? He doesn't think so, even though he has killed. As King's detective says, \u201cI thought maybe you played real ball.\u201d",

      "For Aronofsky, little in his recent filmography ( \"The Whale,\" \u201cMother!\u201d) suggested that an \u201cAfter Hours\u201d-like New York odyssey was coming next from him. It's a little shaggy and you'll occasionally yearn for a bit more humor along the way. But \u201cCaught Stealing,\" based on Charlie Huston's 2004 novel, is a ride, foremost, in '90s nostalgia.",

That goes for places the movie rushes past, like Kim's Video and Shea Stadium, the Alphabet City bars of the film and the now-bygone concerns of cell phone minutes running low.

      "Late summer is always a funny time in movie theaters, but that goes especially for this year.

      "The director of the Van Gogh Museum is warning that the gallery may have to close if the Dutch government does not help to foot the bill for major maintenance",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Amsterdam museum that displays a priceless collection of works by one of the world's most popular artists, Vincent van Gogh, may have to close if the Dutch government doesn't help foot the bill for major repairs to its aging building, the museum's director said Thursday.",
      "Since its opening in 1973, nearly 57 million visitors have passed through the Van Gogh Museum to gaze at iconic works including one of his paintings of a vase of sunflowers as well as \u201cAlmond Blossom,\u201d \u201cThe Potato Eaters\u201d and a colorful depiction of his bedroom in the French town of Arles.",
      "But Director Emilie Gordenker says the original building, which is owned by the Dutch state, is in such poor condition it needs urgent and extensive repairs to keep its priceless collection and visitors safe.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t address the major maintenance that needs to happen, we will have to close,\" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. The New York Times first reported on her concerns on Wednesday.",
      "She said the 50-year-old building needs \"major maintenance,\u201d and two years of talks with the government have not resolved a dispute about how to pay for repairs expected to start in 2028, last three years and cost 104 million euros ($121 million).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now getting very urgent,\u201d she said.",
      "She said that during the renovation, the museum would be partly closed and would therefore earn less from ticket sales. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re asking them to do is to help us finance the basic maintenance,\u201d she said.",
      "The nearby Rijksmuseum shut down for years for a largescale renovation, but Gordenker says that kind of major facelift is not what the Van Gogh Museum is appealing for.",

      "In a written reaction, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science said that the museum receives an annual subsidy \u201csufficient to carry out the necessary maintenance. This position is based on extensive expert research commissioned by the Ministry.\u201d",
      "It said the museum objected to the subsidy decision last year and recently filed an appeal in a Dutch court that will be heard in February next year. \u201cIt is not unusual for parties to have a subsidy decision reviewed by the court,\u201d the ministry added.",
      "The dispute has its origins in a decision by Van Gogh\u2019s family to transfer a trove of his art \u2014 more than 200 paintings, 500 drawings and 900 letters along with works by contemporaries such as Paul Gauguin \u2014 to a foundation set up in 1962 to keep the collection together. In return, the government pledged to build and maintain a museum where the works could be displayed, the museum said in a statement.",
      "Gordenker argues that means the government should also help to fund the work the museum now needs.",

      "Lee Corso gets to experience that on Saturday.",
      "Corso makes his final appearance as part of ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d crew before No. 3 and reigning national champion Ohio State hosts top-ranked Texas.",
      "Since announcing his retirement earlier this year, Corso has received his share of acclaim and send-offs. He was honored at the ESPY Awards in July and received a standing ovation before boarding his flight in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gamut of different emotions. I\u2019m trying to stay in the celebratory lane this weekend,\u201d said GameDay analyst Kirk Herbstreit, who has sat next to Corso since 1996. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be emotional or sad when it\u2019s his last show.

      "\u201cAlmost everyone, no matter what they accomplish in our industry, sort of gets dragged out boots first. They don\u2019t really get a chance to say farewell,\u201d GameDay host Rece Davis said on Friday after a production meeting. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real blessing that we\u2019re able to give Lee his flowers on a day when he\u2019s feeling great, doing great, and excited for a game.\u201d",

      "Corso has worn 69 different schools\u2019 mascot headgear and has dressed up as Notre Dame\u2019s Fighting Irish leprechaun, the Stanford tree, and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. However, Brutus remains Corso\u2019s first love, wearing it 45 times.",

      "His final headgear pick will be on the field at Ohio Stadium. Besides airing across all of ESPN\u2019s networks, Fox Sports may show part of it. The final hour of both pregame shows will also take place in the Horseshoe.",

(AP) \u2014 Cardi B testified Wednesday that she didn't touch a security guard who alleges the rapper cut her face with a fingernail and spat on her in an altercation outside an obstetrician's office during the hip-hop star's not-yet-public first pregnancy.",
      "\u201cShe couldn\u2019t get a scratch from me because I didn\u2019t touch her,\u201d Cardi said on the stand in her second day of testimony in a Los Angeles County court.",
      "Ron Rosen Janfaza, lawyer for the plaintiff, Emani Ellis, asked her if she had been angry.",

      "She acknowledged that the argument got very heated \u2014 repeating in court much of the swearing the two did \u2014 and that they were chest-to-chest at one point, but said the fight never became physical.",
      "\u201cShe didn\u2019t touch me,\" Cardi said. \"She was going to touch me, but she didn\u2019t get to touch me.\u201d",
      "Cardi said she had been visiting Los Angeles doing promotional work in February 2018 around that year\u2019s NBA All-Star Game.

      "The obstetrician\u2019s office had been closed to other patients on a Saturday for her privacy.",
      "She said Ellis, a security guard for the building, followed her to her fifth-floor appointment. Cardi said she heard Ellis say her name into a phone and appeared to be filming her. Cardi feared Ellis would out the fact that she was pregnant.",
      "\u201cI told her, \u2018Why are you recording?\u2019\u201d Cardi testified, \u201cand she said, \u2019Oh my bad.' She practically apologized.'\u201d",
      "But the argument grew increasingly heated, she said.",
      "\u201cAs we were arguing she\u2019s backing me, she\u2019s walking into me,\u201d Cardi said.",
      "Both women are 32 years old and about the same height, but Cardi said Ellis was bigger than her.",

      "Guillermo del Toro rose to fame creating horror movies that will likely help shape the genre for generations to come",
      "SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Many fled when wildfires devastated Los Angeles earlier this year, but Guillermo del Toro rushed back in, determined to save his lifelong collection of horror memorabilia.",
      "It's the same loyalty that finds him making another tough decision to protect the items he loves like family: letting some of them go.",
      "Del Toro partnered with Heritage Auctions for a three-part auction to sell a fraction of a collection that is bursting at the seams. Online bidding for the first part on Sept. 26 started Thursday and includes over a hundred items, with more headed to the auction block next year.",
      "\u201cThis one hurts. The next one, I\u2019m going to be bleeding,\u201d del Toro, 60, said of the auction series. \u201cIf you love somebody, you have estate planning, you know, and this is me estate planning for a family that has been with me since I was a kid.\u201d",
      "Del Toro is one of the industry\u2019s most respected filmmakers, whose fascination with monsters and visual style will shape generations to come. But at his core, the Mexican-born horror buff is a collector. The Oscar-winner has long doubled as the sole caretaker of the \u201cBleak House\u201d \u2014 which stretches across two and a half Santa Monica homes nearly overflowing with thousands of ghoulish creatures, iconic comic drawings and paintings, books and movie props.",
      "The houses function not just as museums, but as libraries and workspaces where his imagination bounces off the oxblood-painted walls.",
      "\u201cI love what I have because I live with it. I actually am a little nuts, because I say hi to some of the life-size figures when I turn on the light,\u201d del Toro told The Associated Press, sitting in the dining room of one of the houses, now a sanctuary for \u201cHaunted Mansion\u201d memorabilia. \u201cThis is curated. This is not a casual collection.\u201d",
      "The auction includes behind-the-scene drawings and one-of-a-kind props from del Toro\u2019s own classics, as well as iconic works like Bernie Wrightson\u2019s illustrations for \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and Mike Mignola\u2019s pinup artwork for \u201cHellraiser.\u201d",
      "In January, del Toro had only a couple hours, his car and a few helping hands to save key pieces from the fires. Out of the over 5,000 items in his collection, he only managed to move about 120 objects. It wasn't the first time, as fires had come dangerously close to Bleak House twice before.",
      "The houses were spared, but fear consumed him. If a fire or earthquake swallowed them, he thought, \u201cWhat came out of it? You collected insurance? And what happened to that little segment of Richard Corben's life, or Jack Kirby\u2019s craft, or Bernie Wrightson\u2019s life?\u201d",
      "An auction, del Toro said, gives him peace of mind, as it ensures the items will land in the hands of another collector who will protect the items as he has. These are not just props or trinkets, he said, but \u201chistorical artifacts. They're pieces of audiovisual history for humanity.\u201d And his life's mission has been to protect as much of this history as he can.",
      "\u201cLook, this is in reaction to the fires. This is in reaction to loving this thing,\u201d del Toro told the AP.",
      "The initial auction uncovers who del Toro is as a collector, he said. Upcoming parts will expose how the filmmaker thinks, which he called a much more personal endeavor. The auction isn't just a \u201cpiece of business,\u201d for him, but rather a love letter to collectors everywhere, and encouragement to think beyond a movie and \u201clearn to read and write film design in a different way. That's my hope.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- It started with a friendship bracelet. It ended with an engagement ring. Taylor Swift, the pop superstar, and Travis Kelce, the football champion, are engaged.",
      "The fiances, both 35, announced the news in a joint post on Instagram on Tuesday. It is the latest chapter in the couple's love story, one that has spanned two years, two Super Bowls, an album announcement and the highest-grossing tour of all time.",
      "Here is a look at some of the major events in their relationship.",
      "It started, fittingly, with a friendship bracelet.",
      "It was way back in July 2023 that Kelce attended Swift\u2019s Eras concert at Arrowhead Stadium, where the Chiefs play.",
      "After, on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast with brother Jason Kelce, he professed to being disappointed \u2014 well, his word was \u201cbutthurt\u201d \u2014 that he couldn\u2019t meet Swift and present her with a bracelet with his phone number on it.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t meet anybody, or at least she didn\u2019t want to meet me, so I took it personal,\u201d he quipped. The podcast asked on Instagram: \u201cAnyone know how to get a bracelet to @taylorswift13? \u2026 asking for a friend.\u201d",
      "But by that September, Kelce was hinting his efforts had achieved some success. He declined to elaborate amid speculation, telling an interviewer: \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d",
      "Clearly, though, something was happening. Soon, Kelce revealed he\u2019d invited Swift to a game at Arrowhead. \u201cI threw the ball in her court,\u201d he said on another talk show.",
      "Swift took Kelce up on his offer, appearing for all the world to see at the Chiefs-Bears game, cheering next to his mom, Donna Kelce. The two left the stadium in Kelce\u2019s purple Chevelle \u201cgetaway car\u201d \u2014 forgive the pun, but Kelce himself used it.",
      "\u201cPretty ballsy,\u201d Kelce said a few days later of Swift\u2019s appearance, adding how much he loved seeing her cheer next to his mother.",
      "It was the launch of a long series of appearances by Swift at Chiefs games. There was some online angst over whether Swift was distracting from football \u2014 while the NFL itself capitalized on her fandom. A day after the flashy Los Angeles premiere of her \u201cTaylor Swift: Eras Tour\u201d movie, she was back at Arrowhead.",
      "And now it was time for Kelce to be the adoring fan. In November 2023, after a hiatus of two months, Swift brought her tour to Argentina, where she changed the lyrics of \u201cKarma\u201d to salute her beau. \u201cKarma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,\u201d she sang. Scott Swift, next to a beaming Kelce, applauded his daughter\u2019s new flame.",
      "When Time magazine announced its person of the year, few were surprised. In the Time interview, Swift spoke about her relationship.",
      "\u201cThis all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\u201d Swift said, adding that they\u2019d already been a couple before that first Chiefs game cameo.",
      "Soon after, things were heating up on the football field \u2014 meaning the Chiefs were heading to the Super Bowl. At the AFC championship game, the couple made it clear they were fine with whatever attention was coming their way. In the middle of the field in Baltimore, after the Chiefs beat the Ravens, Swift and Kelce kissed. \u201cI love you,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cSo much it\u2019s not funny.\u201d",
      "There was one game left. Fans wondered: How would Swift make it from her Tokyo shows to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas?",
      "\u201cThis week is truly the best kind of chaos,\u201d Swift posted on Instagram.",
      "Chaos indeed. In one week of February 2024, Swift attended the Grammys in Los Angeles, jetted to Tokyo for four concerts, then jumped back onto her private plane to make the Super Bowl with time to spare. To get there, she crossed nine time zones and the international dateline.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s rewriting the history books herself,\u201d Kelce said a day after the Grammys, where Swift had won album of the year for a record fourth time. \u201cI told her I\u2019ll have to hold up my end of the bargain and come home with hardware, too.\u201d",
      "And he did. The two kissed on the field again after the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers, Swift in her \u201c87\u201d necklace.",

      "Maduro\u2019s government typically supplies schools with frozen whole chickens and some combination of arepa flour, rice, pasta, beans, sardines, canned lunch meat, milk powder, lentils, salt and cooking oil. But teachers, cooks and administrators say what they receive is inconsistent and insufficient.",
      "And with little to eat at home, on the occasions when the scent of food wafts through school buildings, more students are asking for seconds.",
      "\u201cThere are some who, my goodness, they repeat two or three times. There are kids who eat a lot,\u201d Deyanira Santos, a cook at a 170-student school that hadn't received supplies in three weeks. \u201cThey have needs at home. ... \u2018I have already eaten. Can you give me one to go?\u2019 We put it in a container.\u201d",
      "At home, Chirino sorted through the clothing, accessories and linens she sells to neighbors and acquaintances. Her only income sources are the $70 a month she earns from her sales and a monthly government stipend of about $4. She spends it all on food.",
      "The weakening of the bolivar is the driver of Venezuela's currency crisis. When a currency quickly loses significant value, people\u2019s money buys less because prices \u2014 particularly of imported goods, like roughly half of Venezuela\u2019s food \u2013 constantly rise to match the exchange rate. It also has meant high inflation and stagnant wages.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s monthly minimum wage of 130 bolivars, or $0.90, has not increased since 2022, putting it well below the United Nations\u2019 measure of extreme poverty of $2.15 a day. Even with government stipends, many public sector workers survive on roughly $160 per month, while the average private sector employee earns about $237, according to the independent Venezuelan Observatory of Finances.",
      "The price of a basic basket of food has topped $500, according to the Observatory, an organization of economists \u2014 some of whom were detained this summer after high inflation data was published, as the government cracks down on dissent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more difficult every day for people to access food of a certain quality,\u201d said the Rev. Gilberto Garc\u00eda, whose Catholic church runs a soup kitchen. \u201cPeople eat, but they usually eat carbohydrates. And that\u2019s how people survive.\u201d",
      "Chirino warmed canned meat and served it with rice for dinner. Her adult daughter and toddler grandson joined them \u2014 more mouths to feed, but they were grateful to have even a small meal on the table.",
      "About a block away, people lined up outside the neighborhood convenience store.",
      "Chirino is among the many Venezuelans who say they're buying food almost exclusively at corner stores, where they can run up an account and walk over one, two, even three times a day. City residents also buy from public markets, but grocery store trips are rare.",
      "\u201cWe give credit to the neighbors who do pay back when they receive their paycheck or stipend,\u201d Diego Reverol, whose family owns a corner store, said, referring to a stipend state employees receive on the 15th of the month.",
      "Other government stipends are available to those who sign up for the ruling party-run subsidy program, but they're significantly smaller than those of state employees. The program also offers families the option to purchase a combination of food \u2013 the same as what's distributed to schools \u2013 monthly. However, most of the two dozen people in Falcon who spoke to AP said they'd not received the food since the spring.",
      "Yamelis Ruiz said her family's challenges are compounded by the loss of critical help from the World Food Program, which distributed food, refurbished school cafeterias and served meals after reaching an agreement with Maduro\u2019s government in 2021 to support the most vulnerable. WFP prioritized Falcon, with its massive sand dunes and mountain ranges that reach the Caribbean Sea, due to the population's particular problems with food insecurity.",
      "But citing funding challenges, the WFP this year has deeply cut its aid in Venezuela \u2014 Falcon included \u2014 and beyond. Ruiz said she had already stopped receiving monthly shelf-stable food rations from WFP when the organization further reduced the number of days it would feed kids and families at schools, to eight from 20.",
      "\u201cFood or medicines. Either I buy one thing or the other,\u201d said Ruiz, whose daughter has a congenital brain condition that requires costly treatment.",
      "Even as local and international nonprofits have been forced to shut down assistance efforts in Venezuela, Chirino's church still offers a weekly lunch at its soup kitchen.",
      "Chirino, a devout Catholic, feels blessed. She often attends Mass with her family before the meal, but on this day Juan felt too fatigued to make the service.",
      "The extent of hunger across the country is somewhat unknown. Dr. Huniades Urbina, a pediatrician and former director of Venezuela\u2019s largest public children\u2019s hospital, said that's in part because government-run hospitals have banned personnel from including malnutrition in patients\u2019 medical histories.",
      "Chirino sees that hunger every week in the faces of those lining up for food. Juan managed to get out of bed and to church just in time for this meal: an arepa stuffed with ground beef and plantains.",
      "More than 70 children sat, their chatty voices dwindling as they ate. Finishing in record time, dozens swarmed the counter where the volunteer cooks were ready to hand out leftovers. Some pushed; others raised their arms or stood on their tiptoes.",
      "\u201cMe, me, me,\u201d some yelled, angling for a second arepa.",
      "One boy hadn't bitten his yet when he noticed an empty-handed friend. Without hesitation, he split it in half. The boys shared, each done eating in less than a minute, and left.",
      "Chirino had refused to take an arepa. She didn't want to keep one from a hungry kid. But when most of the children were gone, a cook handed her one. She began eating alone, and soon Jos\u00e9 joined her. He reached for her plate, grabbing half the arepa and taking a few bites.",
      "Her son, too, was still hungry.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the upcoming fall and winter season",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators approved updated COVID-19 shots Wednesday but limited their use for many Americans \u2014 and removed one of the two vaccines available for young children.",
      "The new shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are approved for all seniors. But the Food and Drug Administration narrowed their use for younger adults and children to those with at least one high-risk health condition, such as asthma or obesity. That presents new barriers to access for millions of Americans who\u2019d have to prove their risk -- and millions more who may want to get vaccinated and suddenly no longer qualify.",
      "Additionally, Pfizer\u2019s vaccine will no longer be available for any child underage 5, after the FDA said it was revoking the shot\u2019s emergency authorization for that age group.",
      "Parents will still be able to seek out shots from rival drugmaker Moderna, the other maker of mRNA vaccines, which has full FDA approval for children as young as 6 months. But the company\u2019s Spikevax vaccine is only approved for children with at least one serious health problem.",
      "The revamped vaccines target a newer version of the continuously evolving virus and are set to begin shipping immediately. But it could be days or weeks before many Americans know if they\u2019ll be able to get one, with access dependent on various decisions by federal health advisers, private health insurers, pharmacies and state authorities.",
      "The new restrictions \u2014 previewed by FDA officials in May \u2014 are a break from the previous U.S. policy, which recommended an annual COVID-19 shot for all Americans 6 months and up.",
      "The approach reflects heightened skepticism about the ongoing risks of COVID-19 and the need for yearly booster shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who were both outspoken critics of wide-scale vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThe American people demanded science, safety, and common sense. This framework delivers all three,\u201d Kennedy wrote on social media.",
      "Kenned said Novavax's shot is only open to people 12 or older, not younger children \u2013 and under the same risk-based restrictions as are now in place for the Moderna and Pfizer options. It's the nation's only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "Some medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, have objected to the new limits, saying they may block vaccine access for families who want to protect their children. Last week, the group offered its own recommendations for kids, saying annual COVID shots are strongly recommended for children ages 6 months to 2 years and advised for older children.",
      "That differs from the latest guidance under Kennedy, which doesn\u2019t recommend the shots for healthy children of any age, but says kids may get the shots in consultation with physicians.",
      "Many countries have scaled back COVID-19 vaccinations in recent years, and some U.S. experts say the change makes sense here, given that nearly all Americans have some protection from previous vaccination or infection.",
      "But implementing the shift presents a number of logistical problems.",
      "Insurers typically base their vaccine coverage decisions on the recommendations of a panel of advisers to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but some say they will also look to medical professional groups, including the American Medical Association.",
      "Earlier this year, Kennedy dissolved the CDC panel and replaced its members with a number of doctors and researchers who have repeatedly questioned the safety of commonly used vaccines and ingredients. The panel is expected to meet in September, but no specific date has been set and no agenda released.",
      "Depending on the panel\u2019s advice, Americans underage 65 could be expected to provide documentation of a serious medical condition before they can get a shot. Complicating the rollout is the fact that pharmacists \u2014 who administer most COVID vaccines in the U.S. \u2014 typically aren\u2019t expected to collect that kind of information. And laws governing their ability to administer routine vaccinations vary by state, where pharmacists are licensed.",

      "If the latest vaccines aren\u2019t covered by their insurance, those patients could be required to pay $150 or more out of pocket if they want one. They might also have to find a doctor or other health professional willing to give the shot \u201coff label,\u201d or outside the use listed on the FDA label. Pharmacists may be reluctant to give vaccines off-label.",
      "The updated shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax target a coronavirus subtype named LP. 8.1, a recently dominant version of the virus that is closely related to some newly emerging cousins.",
      "All three shots were initially made available under the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization, an expedited process to quickly review vaccines and other countermeasures during the pandemic.",
      "Moderna received full FDA approval in July for children down to 6 months and says it should have enough supply to meet U.S. demand.",
      "In addition to revoking emergency use of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, the FDA also pulled authorization for several other therapies from the pandemic years, including convalescent plasma, which was used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients before the first antiviral drugs became available.",
      "COVID-19 vaccines do a good job preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, which remain a bigger risk for seniors and people with underlying health factors, including heart disease, lung disease and cancer.",

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors say Luigi Mangione, accused of killing the CEO of UnitedHealthcare on a Manhattan sidewalk, has inspired others to embrace violence over reasoned debate.",
      "As evidence of Mangione's growing influence, prosecutors cited the last month's deadly mass shooting at the National Football League headquarters.",
      "The prosecution outlined the threat in a filing late Wednesday on a procedural matter in federal court in Manhattan, where they plan to try to convince a jury that Mangione deserves death. No federal trial date has been set.",
      "Mangione, who pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges, was arrested five days after the Dec. 4 killing of CEO Brian Thompson. He is being held without bail in a federal jail in Brooklyn.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s the case for a lot of the students,\" said Nocera, who lives on the campus in St. Petersburg with her Border collie, Zuko. \"When I'm walking my dog, I often hear, \u2018Oh my god, hi, Zuko!\u2019 It's like I\u2019m not even there.\"",
      "Some colleges and universities around the country welcome pets in campus residences, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Stephens College in Missouri.",

For example, at Stephens College, the annual fee for a dog or cat is $220, for a cage- or aquarium-dwelling pet is $50 and free for fish.

      "New Zealand is to ease a ban on foreigners buying homes to allow wealthy investors access to its housing market and boost the economy",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 New Zealand will relax a ban on foreigners buying homes in the country to allow some wealthy overseas business investors a single high-value residential property purchase, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said Monday.",
      "The move partially reverses a ban introduced in 2018 by a previous government to cool a runaway housing market fueled by property speculation. Holders of a residency \u201cgolden visa\u201d reintroduced by Luxon\u2019s government in April will now be able to buy one home worth at least 5 million New Zealand dollars ($3 million).",
      "Luxon said the move balanced a desire to attract wealthy investors to the country with allaying house price fears. The change stops well short of a full reversal of the policy and would apply only to a small number of wealthy foreigners and a limited number of houses, he added.",
      "The visas, which were intended to draw overseas investors to the country's businesses, give residency to people investing a minimum NZ $5 million in New Zealand businesses over three years, or NZ $10 million over five years if the money is deposited in less risky investments.",
      "Some visa holders had been ineligible to buy property because they didn\u2019t live in New Zealand for at least six months of the year. That requirement will now be waived.",
      "Luxon\u2019s opponents decried the policy reversal Monday, saying it focused on attracting wealthy foreigners instead of solving domestic problems.",
      "\u201cMany Kiwis are already struggling to buy a home, and he has just made it worse,\u201d opposition Labour housing spokesperson Kieran McAnulty said. \u201cHomelessness is up, unemployment is up, and people cannot afford the basics at the supermarket.\u201d",
      "The government hopes reversing the ban for some will boost economic growth by luring wealthy foreigners to the country during a period of recession.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a safe haven in a very volatile and uncertain world,\u201d Luxon told reporters in Auckland on Monday, of his government\u2019s pitch to investors abroad. Those investors would create jobs, he said.",
      "Luxon denied the move would lift house prices which have fallen from a 2022 peak. He said applications so far for the residency visa that would allow a home purchase could result in up to NZ $1.8 billion in investment.",

The majority of those home (about 80%) are in the largest city, Auckland, with around 10% in the popular skiing and tourism destination of Queenstown, on the South Island, where wealthy foreigners have snapped up bolt holes before.",
      "The average cost of a home in July was NZ $767,250, according to figures from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand. In Auckland, the average cost was NZ $975,000.",
      "The ban on allowing foreigners to buy property, which was introduced during a housing affordability crisis, prompted debate about the extent to which foreigners had contributed to ballooning prices and shut out domestic first-time buyers. Figures at the time showed about 3% of New Zealand homes were being sold to foreigners, although the number rose to 22% in Auckland.",
      "Exceptions to the ban were made for Australians and Singaporeans under trade agreements.",
      "Support for the ban was bolstered by anecdotal tales, never well-substantiated, of wealthy foreigners building doomsday-style bunkers in the scenic Queenstown region.",
      "New Zealand, located in a remote part of the South Pacific, is a popular destination for migrants seeking distance from global tumult and applications to move there often increase during moments of turbulence, according to years of official data.",

      "His comments during a news conference come as the U.S. government this week is set to boost its maritime force in the waters off Venezuela to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels. The U.S. has not signaled any planned land incursion by the thousands of personnel being deployed. Still, Maduro's government has responded by deploying troops along its coast and border with neighboring Colombia, as well as by urging Venezuelans to enlist in a civilian militia.",
      "\u201cIn the face of this maximum military pressure, we have declared maximum preparedness for the defense of Venezuela,\u201d Maduro said of the deployment, which he characterized as \u201can extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\u201d",

      "Three amphibious assault ships \u2014 a force that encompasses more than 4,000 sailors and Marines \u2014 would be entering the region this week, a defense official told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to describe ongoing operations.",
      "The deployment comes as President Donald Trump has pushed for using the military to thwart cartels he blames for the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into U.S. communities and for perpetuating violence in some U.S. cities.",
      "On Monday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yv\u00e1n Gil, citing a United Nations report, told his counterparts in various Latin American countries that the deployment of U.S. maritime forces is built on a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d as 87% of cocaine produced in Colombia departs through the Pacific and traffickers attempt to move only 5% of their product through Venezuela. Landlocked Bolivia and Colombia, with access to the Pacific and Caribbean, are the world\u2019s top cocaine producers.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Plastic soy sauce bottles shaped like fish are tiny, cute and beloved by many sushi eaters. But in the state of South Australia, the decorative containers swam into a growing net of outlawed plastics.",
      "Officials enacted an unusually specific ban on the fish-shaped bottles beginning Monday, saying they were worse for the environment than other condiment containers.",
      "The state of 1.9 million was the first in Australia to institute the prohibition in an initiative to curb plastic waste. South Australia's government has annually added new items to its list of banned plastics, making the measures the country's most comprehensive.",
      "Singling out the fishy containers might seem unusually specific, but officials said the receptacles were particularly bad for the environment and could be mistaken by marine life for food when they reached the ocean.",
      "The tiny bottles were \u201ceasily dropped, blown away, or washed into drains,\u201d South Australia Deputy Premier Susan Close said in a statement.",
      "Even when the bottles landed in recycling bins, they were \"too small to be captured by sorting machinery and often end up in landfill or as fugitive plastic in the environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Instead, restaurants were required to use larger bottles, refillable condiment containers or what officials said were less harmful single-use alternatives such as sachets, squeezable packs or compostable vessels. The ban covered fish-shaped or rectangular containers that had lids, caps or stoppers and held less than 30 milliliters (1 ounce) of soy sauce.",
      "Other items banned beginning Monday included cutlery or straws attached to food items, such as the plastic-wrapped straws often connected to juice boxes.",
      "The move was the latest expansion of plastic elimination measures that began in 2009 when South Australia became the first state to ban single-use plastic shopping bags.",
      "Plastic cutlery, plastic straws and many forms of takeout packaging and single-use coffee cups have followed since a 2021 law change. Plastic balloon sticks, confetti and Q-Tips are among other items banned.",

      "For decades, Europe has relied upon the U.S. for its security among the stars. But the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, plus a commercial market that\u2019s growing exponentially, has prompted Europeans to rethink their approach.",
      "The state-owned Esrange Space Center in Kiruna, Sweden, is among the sites building out orbital rocket programs to allow Europe to advance in the global space race and launch satellites from the continent's mainland.",
      "\u201cThe gap is significant,\" said Hermann Ludwig Moeller, director of the European Space Policy Institute. \u201cI would argue that Europe, to be anywhere relevant in the next five to 10 years, needs to at least double its investment in space. And saying that it would double doesn\u2019t mean that it would catch up by the same factor, because you can expect that other regions will also continue to step up.\u201d",
      "Currently, Europe's only space base capable of launching rockets and satellites into orbit is in sparsely populated French Guiana, an overseas department of France in South America that's roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of the equator. Otherwise, Europe borrows NASA's Cape Canaveral in Florida.",
      "In March, Isar Aerospace launched the first test flight of its orbital launch vehicle from the And\u00f8ya Spaceport, another site that's part of Europe's efforts to expand its presence in space, on an island in northern Norway.",
      "While the rocket crashed into the sea 30 seconds after liftoff, the private German aerospace company had largely ruled out the possibility of the rocket reaching orbit on its first complete flight and deemed the short journey a success.",
      "Moeller believes a successful orbital launch from continental Europe could occur within the next year, though he won't guess where.",
      "Portugal, Spain, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom also are among the countries seeking to be part of Europe's spaceport portfolio.",
      "Elsewhere on Earth, India \u2014 active in space research since the 1960s \u2014 has launched satellites for itself and other countries and successfully put one in orbit around Mars in 2014. After a failed attempt to land on the moon in 2019, India became the first country to land a spacecraft near the moon\u2019s south pole in 2023 in a historic voyage to uncharted territory that scientists believe could hold reserves of frozen water. The mission was dubbed a technological triumph for the world\u2019s most populous nation.",
      "New Zealand also has a growing and active launch industry, and Australia is working to develop its commercial space industry.",
      "Esrange and And\u00f8ya date back to the 1960s and much of their space-bound appeal stems from their far-north geography on Earth.",
      "Esrange, for example, is owned and operated by the Swedish Space Corporation and based more than 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of the Arctic Circle. The space center's 30-plus antennas can more easily communicate with satellites orbiting the North Pole compared to infrastructure that\u2019s near the equator.",
      "Most important, perhaps, is its size. The base itself encompasses 6 square kilometers (2.3 square miles), where experts conduct Martian lander parachute tests, suborbital rocket launches and stratospheric balloon experiments.",
      "But its key selling point is Esrange's rocket landing zone: 5,200 square kilometers (2,000 square miles) of birch, pine and spruce trees spread north across the Swedish tundra, nearly to the Norwegian and Finnish borders.",
      "The territory is uninhabited besides the Sami Indigenous reindeer herders who sometimes pass through, and the space center alerts them before any tests occur. The emptiness of the landscape allows scientists to launch and easily recover material for further study.",

      "Europe currently, however, does not have the same capacities and has for decades banked on the U.S. for its security and defense. But U.S. Vice President JD Vance, during a speech in February at the Munich Security Conference, warned Europe against continuing to rely upon America and urged officials to \u201cstep up in a big way\u201d to provide for the defense of the continent.",

Musk's SpaceX and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 rocket company Blue Origin, among others, have proven that space isn't limited to governmental agencies like NASA, and that there's a lot of money to be made in the solar system.",

      "Thousands of voters in Guyana have participated in what many say is the South American country\u2019s most consequential election in decades",
      "GEORGETOWN, Guyana -- Thousands of voters in Guyana participated Monday in what many say is the South American country\u2019s most consequential election in decades given that whichever party wins will oversee $10 billion in annual revenue from offshore oil and gas production.",
      "In recent years, Guyana has transformed from a country traditionally dependent on gold, sugar, rice, bauxite and timber to one reaping the windfall of nearly 900,000 barrels of oil produced daily.",
      "The World Bank has noted that Guyana has the world's fastest growing economy with gross domestic product increases averaging around 15% annually in the past six years.",
      "ExxonMobil, which is leading an international consortium, has applications for four more oil fields as the promise of even greater revenue looms.",
      "Guyana\u2019s electoral commission printed ballots for six parties, but most in the diverse nation believe the election is a contest among the governing Indo-dominated People\u2019s Progressive Party of President Irfaan Ali; the Afro-supported main opposition A Partnership for National Unity; and upstart newcomer mixed-race party We Invest In Nationhood, led by U.S. government-sanctioned Guyanese businessman Azruddin Mohamed, who comes from one of the country\u2019s wealthiest families.",
      "For Ali, a 45-year-old urban planner, this is the most important election since independence from Britain in 1966, as he pleaded with voters to give \u201cme a second term.\u201d His party trumped A Partnership for Nation Unity in the 2020 elections.",
      "\u201cWe ask you to trust us once more to deliver greater, better, faster and more efficiently,\u201d Ali told jubilant supporters at a coastal rally late Saturday. \u201cWe have the experience, and you can trust us to lead you into the bright prosperous future ahead of us.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, A Partnership for Nation Unity, led by 68-year-old political scientist Aubrey Norton, has accused Ali\u2019s party of corruption, nepotism, harassment of opposition voices and alleged irresponsible use of oil sector revenues.",
      "\u201cOur aim is to restore decency in Guyana, to restore law and order, and to lift the people of Guyana out of poverty. We want to build a society that truly serves its people and ensures that every Guyanese benefits from our nation\u2019s oil wealth,\u201d Norton told a massive final rally.",
      "Evelyn Crawford, a 75-year-old retiree, said she voted for the opposition. The monthly state pension for people over 65 of some $200 a month is not enough for a country flush with oil money, she said.",
      "\u201cWhat they give us is way not enough. I would like to see that people are lifted out of poverty,\u201d she said as she left a voting center.",
      "A new party, We Invest In Nationhood, founded in late May, has been well received by first-time and younger voters like DeLinda Henry, an Indigenous mother of four from the western Mazaruni Region near Venezuela.",

      "\u201cThe shadows of Cold War mentality, bullying, are not dissipating, and there are new challenges that are increasing, not diminishing,\u201d said Xi, who has consistently spoken against what he calls a Cold War mentality, which is his way of referring to the tough approach to China by the U.S.",

The Senate\u2019s powerful blue ribbon committee resumed on Monday a separate inquiry, where senators grilled a private contractor who has denied any wrongdoing but faced intense questioning over her family\u2019s fleet of at least 28 luxury cars and SUVs.",
      "Rep. Elajiah San Fernando said that given the huge budget allocated for flood control infrastructure and water resource development in the Philippines, including more than 308 billion pesos ($5.4 billion) this year, the scale of the corruption could be \u201cof the grandest kind.\u201d",
      "Addressing construction companies, private contractors and politicians involved in anomalies or \u201cghost projects,\u201d San Fernando warned that Congress has \u201cno other objective but to see your heads rolling, to hold you into account and lock you up in jail.\u201d",
      "In July, back-to-back typhoons and seasonal monsoon downpours set off massive floods that affected millions of people, displaced more than 300,000 others, damaged nearly 3,000 houses and left extensive infrastructure and agricultural losses.

      "Under intense questioning, Discaya repeatedly denied that she and the nine construction companies she owned with her husband resorted to corruption and bribery to win contracts from the Department of Public Works and Highways. The department, which oversees the country\u2019s infrastructure projects, has been hounded by allegations of corrupt deals for years.",

      "A decline in foreign visitors traveling to the United States has stretched well into the summer",
      "LAS VEGAS -- For a few hopeful weeks this summer, a bright billboard on the major highway linking Toronto to New York greeted Canadian drivers with a simple message: \"Buffalo Loves Canada.\u201d",
      "The marketing campaign, which included a $500 gift card giveaway, was meant to show Buffalo's northern neighbors they were welcome, wanted and missed.",
      "At first, it seemed like it might work, said Patrick Kaler, CEO of the local tourism organization Visit Buffalo Niagara. More than 1,000 people entered the giveaway. But by the end of July, it was clear the city's reliable summer wave of Canadian visitors would not arrive this year.",
      "Buffalo\u2019s struggle reflects a broader downturn in international tourism to the U.S. that travel analysts warn could persist well into the future. From northern border towns to major hot spots like Las Vegas and Los Angeles, popular travel destinations reported hosting fewer foreign visitors this summer.",
      "Experts and some local officials attribute the trend that first emerged in February to President Donald Trump's return to the White House. They say his tariffs, immigration crackdown and repeated jabs about the U.S. acquiring Canada and Greenland alienated travelers from other parts of the world.",
      "\"To see the traffic drop off so significantly, especially because of rhetoric that can be changed, is so disheartening,\u201d Kaler said.",
      "The World Travel & Tourism Council projected ahead of Memorial Day that the U.S. would be the only country among the 184 it studied where foreign visitor spending would fall in 2025. The finding was \u201ca clear indicator that the global appeal of the U.S. is slipping,\u201d the global industry association said.",
      "\u201cThe world\u2019s biggest travel and tourism economy is heading in the wrong direction,\u201d Julia Simpson, the council\u2019s president and CEO, said. \"While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the U.S. government is putting up the \u2018closed\u2019 sign.\u201d",
      "Travel research firm Tourism Economics, meanwhile, predicted this month that the U.S. would see 8.2% fewer international arrivals in 2025, an improvement from its earlier forecast of a 9.4% decline but well below the numbers of foreign visitors to the country before the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThe sentiment drag has proven to be severe,\u201d the firm said, noting that airline bookings indicate \u201cthe sharp inbound travel slowdown\u201d of May, June and July would likely persist in the months ahead.",
      "Deborah Friedland, managing director at the financial services firm Eisner Advisory Group, said he U.S. travel industry faced multiple headwinds \u2014 rising travel costs, political uncertainty and ongoing geopolitical tensions.",
      "Since returning to office, Trump has doubled down on some of the hard-line policies that defined his first term, reviving a travel ban targeting mainly African and Middle Eastern countries, tightening rules around visa approvals and ramping up mass immigration raids. At the same time, the push for tariffs on foreign goods that quickly became a defining feature of his second term gave some citizens elsewhere a sense they were unwanted.",
      "\u201cPerception is reality,\u201d Friedland said.",
      "Organizers of an international swing dancing said an impression of America's hostility to foreigners led them to postpone the event, which had been scheduled to take place this month in the Harlem area of New York City.",
      "About three months into Trump\u2019s second term, international competitors began pulling out of the world finals of the International Lindy Hop Championships, saying they felt unwelcome, event co-producer Tena Morales said. About half of attendees each year come from outside the U.S., primarily from Canada and France, she said.",
      "Contest organizers are considering whether to host the annual competition in another country until Trump's presidency ends, Morales said.",

Marketing organization Destination DC said last week it planned to \u201ccounter negative rhetoric\" about the city with a campaign that would feature residents and highlight the \u201cmore personal side\u201d of Washington.",
      "U.S. government data confirms an overall drop-off in international arrivals during the first seven months of the year. The number of overseas visitors, a category that doesn't include travelers from Mexico or Canada, declined by more than 3 million, or 1.6%, compared to the same period a year earlier, according to preliminary figures from the National Travel and Tourism Office.",
      "As a tourist generator, Western Europe was down 2.3%, with visitors from Denmark dropping by 19%, from Germany by 10%, and from France by 6.6%. A similar pattern surfaced in Asia, where the U.S. data showed double-digit decreases in arrivals from Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines. Fewer residents of countries throughout Africa also had traveled to the U.S. as of July.",
      "However, visitors from some countries, among them Argentina, Brazil, Italy and Japan, have arrived in greater numbers.",
      "Neither did all U.S. destinations report sluggish summers for tourism.",
      "On eastern Wisconsin\u2019s Door Peninsula, which straddles Lake Michigan and Green Bay, a steady stream of loyal Midwest visitors helped deliver a strong summer for local businesses, according to Jon Jarosh, a spokesperson for Destination Door County.",
      "Many business owners reported a noticeable uptick in foot traffic after a quieter start to the season, Jarosh said, and sidewalks were bustling and restaurants were packed by midsummer.",
      "Executives from the major U.S. airlines said last month that American passengers booking premium airfares helped fill their international flights and that demand for domestic flights was picking up after a weaker than expected showing in the first half of 2025.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said it was gearing up for what is expected to be the busiest Labor Day weekend in 15 years. Bookings for U.S. airlines were up about 2% compared to 2024 for the long holiday weekend that started Thursday, aviation analytics firm Cirium said.",
      "As the summer winds down, though, the absence of foreign visitors in Buffalo was still visible, according to Kaler, the head of Visit Buffalo Niagara.",
      "Canada sent over 20.2 million visitors to the U.S. last year, more than any other country, U.S. government data showed. But this year, residents of Canada have been among the most reluctant to visit.",
      "In a major U-turn, more U.S. residents drove into Canada in June and July than Canadians making the reverse trip, according to Canada\u2019s national statistical agency. Statistics Canada said it was the first time that happened in nearly two decades with the exception of two months during the pandemic.",
      "In July alone, the number of Canadian residents returning from the U.S. by car was down 37% from the year before, and return trips by plane fell 26%, the agency said.",
      "As a result, Visit Buffalo Niagara shifted its marketing efforts this summer to cities like Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago. Amateur children\u2019s sporting events also helped fill the void left by Canadian tourists.",
      "\u201cWe will always welcome Canadians back when the time is right,\u201d Kaler said. \u201cI don\u2019t want Canadians to feel like we see them as just dollar signs or a transaction at our cash registers. They mean more to us that that.\"",

      "Kraft Heinz is splitting into two companies a decade after they joined in a massive merger that created one of the biggest food companies on the planet",
      "NEW YORK -- Kraft Heinz is splitting into two a decade after a merger of the brands created one of the biggest food companies on the planet.",
      "One of the companies, currently called Global Taste Elevation Co., will include shelf stable meals and include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, Kraft Heinz said Tuesday. The other, currently called North American Grocery Co., will include brands such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The official names of the two companies will be released later.",
      "Kraft Heinz said in May that it was conducting a strategic review of the company, signaling a potential split.",
      "The company in 2015 wanted to capitalize on its massive scale, but shifting tastes complicated those plans, with households seeking to introduce healthier options at the table. Kraft Heinz and other food producers have shifted offerings to follow that trend.",
      "\u201cKraft Heinz\u2019s brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\u201d Executive Chair Miguel Patricio said in a statement.",
      "The path to the merger of Kraft and Heinz began in 2013, when billionaire investor Warren Buffett teamed up with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz Co. At the time, the $23 billion deal was the most expensive ever in the food industry.",
      "3G was also behind the formation of Restaurant Brands International \u2014 a merger of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes \u2014 and Anheuser-Busch InBev. It\u2019s known for strict cost controls and so-called zero-based budgeting, which requires all expenses to be justified each quarter.",
      "The deal was intended to help Heinz, which was founded in 1869 in Pittsburgh, expand sales of its condiments and sauces on grocery store shelves. Heinz\u2019s new owners also set about cutting costs, laying off hundreds of workers within months.",
      "At the same time Kraft, based in Chicago, sought for a partner after a 2011 split from its snack division, which became Mondelez International.",
      "In 2015, Buffett and 3G decided to merge Heinz with Kraft. The merger created the 5th largest food and beverage company in the world, with annual revenue of $28 billion. Buffett and 3G each contributed $5 billion for a special dividend for Kraft shareholders.",
      "But the combined company struggled, despite layoffs of thousands of employees and other cost-cutting measures. Even at the time of the merger, many consumers were shifting away from the kinds of highly processed packaged foods that Kraft sells, like Velveeta cheese and Kool-Aid.",

    "story": [
      "Families that lost loved ones in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max jetliners may be getting their last chance to demand the American aerospace company\u2019s criminal prosecution",
      "Families who lost loved ones in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max jetliners may get their last chance to demand the company face criminal prosecution Wednesday. That's when a federal judge in Texas is set to hear arguments on a U.S. government motion to dismiss a felony charge against Boeing.",
      "U.S. prosecutors charged Boeing with conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with the crashes that killed 346 people off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia. Federal prosecutors alleged Boeing deceived government regulators about a flight-control system that was later implicated in the fatal flights, which took place less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019.",
      "Boeing decided to plead guilty instead of going to trial, but U.S. District Chief Judge Reed O\u2019Connor rejected the aircraft maker's plea agreement in December. O'Connor, who also will consider whether to let prosecutors dismiss the conspiracy charge, objected to diversity, equity and inclusion policies potentially influencing the selection of an independent monitor to oversee the company's promised reforms.",
      "Lawyers representing relatives of some of the passengers who died cheered O'Connor's decision, hoping it would further their goal of seeing former Boeing executives prosecuted during a public trial and more severe financial punishment for the company. Instead, the delay worked to Boeing's favor.",
      "The judge\u2019s refusal to accept the agreement meant the company was free to challenge the Justice Department\u2019s rationale for charging Boeing as a corporation. It also meant prosecutors would have to secure a new deal for a guilty plea.",
      "The government and Boeing spent six months renegotiating their plea deal. During that time, President Donald Trump returned to office and ordered an end to the diversity initiatives that gave O\u2019Connor pause.",
      "By the time the Justice Department\u2019s criminal fraud section briefed the judge in late May, the charge and the plea were off the table. A non-prosecution agreement the two sides struck said the government would dismiss the charge in exchange for Boeing paying or investing another $1.1 billion in fines, compensation for the crash victims' families, and internal safety and quality measures.",
      "The Justice Department said it offered Boeing those terms in light of \u201csignificant changes\u201d Boeing made to its quality control and anti-fraud programs since entering into the July 2024 plea deal.",
      "The department also said it thought that persuading a jury to punish the company with a criminal conviction would be risky, while the revised agreement ensures \"meaningful accountability, delivers substantial and immediate public benefits, and brings finality to a difficult and complex case whose outcome would otherwise be uncertain.\u201d",
      "Judge O'Connor has invited some of the families to address the court on Wednesday. One of the people who plans to speak is Catherine Berthet, whose daughter, Camille Geoffrey, died at age 28 when a 737 Max crashed shortly after takeoff from Ethiopia's Addis Ababa Bole International Airport.",
      "Berthet, who lives in France, is part of a group of about 30 families who want the judge to deny the government's request and to appoint a special prosecutor to take over the case.",
      "\u201cWhile it is no surprise that Boeing is trying to buy everyone off, the fact that the DOJ, which had a guilty plea in its hands last year, has now decided not to prosecute Boeing regardless of the judge\u2019s decision is a denial of justice, a total disregard for the victims and, above all, a disregard for the judge,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Justice Department lawyers maintain the families of 110 crash victims either support a pre-trial resolution or do not oppose the non-prosecution agreement. The department's lawyers also dispute whether O'Connor has authority to deny the motion without finding prosecutors acted in bad faith instead of the public interest.",

      "Boeing reached a settlement in 2021 that protected it from criminal prosecution, but the Justice Department determined last year that the company had violated the agreement and revived the charge.",
      "The case revolves around a new software system Boeing developed for the Max. In the 2018 and 2019 crashes, the software pitched the nose of the plane down repeatedly based on faulty readings from a single sensor, and pilots flying then-new planes for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines were unable to regain control.",

      "Nonprofits are increasingly using storytelling to connect with donors",
      "MIAMI -- Cindy Eggleton has always believed in the power of a story.",
      "But the CEO and co-founder of Brilliant Cities, a Detroit-based early childhood development nonprofit that supports learning in underserved communities, never expected someone to tell hers. And definitely not in a sleek documentary with a slick soundtrack and plenty of images of other Detroit institutions, such as General Motors, Diana Ross, and the historic Fox Theatre.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never been about me,\u201d said Eggleton, adding that participating in the \u201cNevertheless: The Women Changing the World\u201d documentary series on YouTube was her way of honoring her late mother, Geraldine, who inspired her to speak out and help others in their community.",
      "However, as they face an increasingly uncertain funding landscape, nonprofits are focusing more on storytelling in outreach to donors \u2013 both big and small \u2013 and raising production values for videos and podcasts.",
      "\u201cStorytelling is how we\u2019re able to draw people in and get them to connect to a deeper truth about themselves or about the world or a problem that needs to be solved,\u201d said Elevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina Jayaram Garcia. \u201cIt\u2019s connecting those issues back to you as a human and not saying, \u2018Well, that\u2019s their problem. That\u2019s all the way over there.\u2019 The story allows it to be human.\u201d",
      "The foundation launched the production house Elevate Studios earlier this year to tell more of those stories, Jayaram Garcia said. \u201cNevertheless: The Women Changing the World,\u201d Elevate Studios\u2019 first series, has already generated more than 3 million views on YouTube and will debut its second season in the summer of 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible to see the growth we\u2019ve had on YouTube and how it\u2019s resonated so quickly with so many people,\u201d Jayaram Garcia said. \u201cWe know we\u2019re on to something here.\u201d",
      "Philanthropic support of storytelling has been ongoing for decades, mostly through donors funding documentary projects. Open Society Foundations created the Soros Documentary Fund in 1996 before the Sundance Institute took it over in 2002, with the George Soros-backed nonprofit\u2019s continued monetary support. The Ford Foundation formalized its funding plans in 2011, creating its JustFilms program that still supports 25-30 documentary films annually. Earlier this month, Firelight Media, a New York-based nonprofit supporting documentary filmmakers of color, launched the Firelight Fund, which will offer directors $50,000 grants for their projects.",
      "But Lance Gould, founder and CEO of media strategy firm Brooklyn Story Lab, says what Elevate Prize Foundation and others are doing is different. He says it reflects both technological improvements that have lowered the cost of documentary storytelling and the rise of social media, which allows nonprofits to interact with donors directly.",
      "\u201cBeing able to tell your story well is paramount,\u201d said Gould, whose firm works with nonprofits to help them produce their own story-driven content. \u201cBut storytelling is not only about reaching viewers, it\u2019s also about having the right message for the right viewers.\u201d",
      "He suggests that nonprofits connect their work to larger initiatives like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 an ambitious list of 17 efforts from eliminating extreme poverty and hunger to guaranteeing every child a quality secondary education by 2030 \u2014 to attract more attention and support.",
      "Gould, who was previously executive editor of The Huffington Post and editor in chief of The Boston Phoenix, said \u201ceveryone can be their own media company at this point.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a point Nicole Bronzan, vice president of communications and content for the Council on Foundations, hopes is not lost in the push for more storytelling.",

      "In a Council on Foundations report released last year, \u201c A New Voice for Philanthropy: How Deeper Stories and Clearer Language Can Build Trust,\u201d researchers, including Bronzan, reported that people had positive attitudes toward foundations, but most didn\u2019t really understand how foundations worked. Bronzan said stories that provide more transparency about how donations are used and how those decisions are made help connect people to a nonprofit and its work.",

      "So far, that has been the case for Brilliant Cities, which saw an increase in donations after Eggleton\u2019s episode debuted on YouTube.",
      "\u201cWe have a funder who wants to increase his gift from $7,000 to $100,000,\u201d said Eggleton, whose nonprofit turns a neighborhood\u2019s vacant homes into community centers with family services ranging from tutoring to mental health support groups. She said new donors have also reached out. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of incredible.\u201d",
      "Though Brilliant Cities doesn\u2019t rely on federal funding for its services, Eggleton said government aid cuts have made a tough funding environment even tougher because the competition for non-governmental donations becomes even tougher.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s being told what\u2019s being taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are pulling at grant officers and individuals with stock market gains. I think it\u2019s more than the funding, though. I think it\u2019s about really recognizing how the world already feels so disconnected and now feels even more so.\u201d",
      "Storytelling, Eggleton said, helps reduce that. By focusing on female changemakers, Elevate Studios makes an even stronger point, she said, adding she\u2019s been quoting Spanish poet Antonio Machado \u2014 \u201cThere is no path/We make the path by walking\u201d \u2014 as she explains the power of the series.",
      "\u201cThis is the time that we really do need to figure out how we build empathy through stories and not necessarily saying, \u2018You\u2019re wrong or you\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just show the world what can be and what should be.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A month after Congress voted to strip public media of public money, PBS and NPR stations are working to cope \u2014 and survive",
      "NEW YORK -- Coping with a sudden loss in federal funding, PBS affiliate KSPS in Spokane, Washington, faced a surprise extra hurdle. Many of its contributing members \u2014 at one point almost half \u2014 lived in Canada, and they were withdrawing support out of anger at President Donald Trump's desire to make the country the 51st member of the United States.",
      "When Congress decided this summer to eliminate $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, it left some 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations, each with unique issues related to their communities and history, to figure out what that means.",
      "Many launched emergency fund drives and are heartened by the response. The national NPR and PBS networks are reducing expected dues payments, and a philanthropic effort focused on the hardest-hit stations is taking shape. No stations have shut down, but job and programming cuts are already beginning.",
      "In Spokane, KSPS has always tried to keep its requests for member donations separate from appeals for public funding. Not anymore. Congress left the station with a $1.2 million hole to fill, about 18% of its budget, and the station is using that as a pretext to seek help from listeners.",
      "\u201cWe have definitely seen some attrition from our Canadian members,\u201d said Skyler Reep, the station's interim general manager.",
      "Long suspicious of a liberal bent to public media news coverage, Republicans in Congress responded to President Donald Trump\u2019s wishes in July and eliminated funding for the systems. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes the funding, has taken steps to shut down.",
      "In some parts of the country, the answer to pleas for help have exceeded expectations. Public radio station WHQR in Wilmington, N.C. raised more than $200,000 in three days, filling a $174,000 hole and then some. It's a small community growing fast with an influx of retirees, many who depend on the station's news to learn about their new home, said general manager Kevin Crane.",
      "With $525,000 gone from its budget, Hawaii Public Radio has already raised $650,000 in an emergency fund drive. \u201cIt's a validation that what you're doing is essential to the community and is appreciated by the community,\u201d said Meredith Artley, president and CEO. The 2023 wildfires in Maui and their aftermath were covered steadily by Hawaii Public Radio news reporters.",
      "\u201cThe initial response in terms of support for both stations and the NPR network has been extraordinary,\u201d said Katherine Maher, NPR president. \u201cPeople did a lot of work leading up to the vote, in actions and calls. When that did not prove convincing, they turned to direct support.\u201d",
      "Stations across the country have stories that make them smile: the youngster from Florida who collected money for public stations in Alaska, sending a note written in crayon; the regular $300 donor who came in to PBS SoCal with a $100,000 check, one of three six-figure donations the station has received.",
      "Most stations aren't in areas with so many wealthy donors. Most station managers are like Jeff Hanks of PBS' LPTV in Lakeland, Minnesota. He lies awake wondering where he will find $1 million to pay for things like his station's nightly newscast, a primary news source for central and northern Minnesota.",
      "\u201cThese are extremely, extremely challenging times,\u201d Hanks said. \u201cWe're fighting hard every way we can.\u201d",
      "He knows membership donations won't make up for what is missing. Both PBS and NPR have taken steps to reduce the annual dues that stations pay for programming and other services. At PBS, it's an average 15% reduction, but needy stations get more \u2014 in one case, more than half of next year's dues will be forgiven, said PBS president Paula Kerger.",
      "NPR is encouraging donors in wealthier areas to adopt stations in poorer ones, perhaps in an area where a contributor has emotional ties.",
      "Public media leaders are also working with a group of philanthropists led by the Knight and MacArthur foundations that is hoping to raise some $50 million to support stations in areas hardest hit be the cuts. Ed Ulman, president and CEO of Alaska Public Media, which represents nearly two dozen radio and television stations in the largest state, said he'll be seeking money from this fund.",
      "Ulman said he's been buoyed by the response from Alaskans in their effort to raise $15 million through various sources by October. The services their stations provide is free, and citizens see its value.",

      "Some stations are already making the difficult decisions of cutting staff, In Spokane, for example, 12 of KSPS's 35 staff members have either been laid off, had their hours reduced or pay cut. Reep is also considering that future seasons of local shows like \u201cNorthwest Profiles\u201d or the arts showcase \u201cInland Sessions\u201d will have fewer episodes.",
      "Similar programming decisions are also being weighed on a national level. While several upcoming shows, like Ken Burns' six-part miniseries \u201cThe American Revolution\u201d scheduled for November, are completed, PBS will have to consider making shorter seasons of its series, Kerger said.",
      "\u201cWe're working very hard so that the public doesn't feel that there's a change,\u201d Kerger said.",
      "Between an increase in donations and \u201crainy day\u201d resources set aside, the initial impact of the government action may be minimized. But that brings its own worries: It's unlikely public media will be able to count on sympathy donors to the same extent in the future. And there's a risk that some politicians will feel the response proves that public support isn't necessary.",
      "The bigger reckoning may come a year from now, Kerger said. \u201cI am a realist,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\u201d",
      "The crisis is forcing some public stations to work together, searching for ways to share services in areas not before contemplated, in things like finances, management and programming, said Andy Russell, president and CEO of PBS SoCal. Public stations in Washington are meeting to see if they can get state financing.",
      "In Los Angeles, PBS SoCal has shared some of its templates for fundraising appeals with other stations. Several celebrities \u2014 people like Kerry Washington, Jack Black, Ziggy Marley, John Lithgow and John Leguizamo \u2014 have volunteered to film pitches, and the station is making them available nationwide, too, said Maura Daly Phinney, senior vice president for membership engagement and strategy.",

      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Miami\u2019s new faces made quick first impressions.",
      "At this time last year, Miami quarterback Carson Beck was at Georgia. Wide receiver CJ Daniels \u2014 he of the spectacular one-handed grab for a touchdown \u2014 was at LSU. Running back Marty Brown was at North Dakota State, game-winning-kicker Carter Davis was at Florida Atlantic and wide receiver Malachi Toney was in high school.",
      "They didn\u2019t waste any time making an impact for the Hurricanes, all playing big roles and combining to account for all of No. 10 Miami\u2019s scoring in its 27-24 win over No. 6 Notre Dame on Sunday night in the opener for both teams. The Hurricanes \u2014 who play host to Bethune-Cookman (0-1) on Saturday \u2014 likely will rise a bit in the AP Top 25 poll that comes out Tuesday.",
      "\u201cNow they know,\u201d Beck said. \u201cI tried to tell people, but they don\u2019t tend to believe what I say. That\u2019s fine. Actions speak louder than words.\u201d",
      "Beck passed for 205 yards and two touchdowns. Daniels and Toney had those scoring catches. Brown had Miami\u2019s lone rushing touchdown and Davis \u2014 who missed six of his last eight field-goal tries at FAU over the past two seasons \u2014 was 2 for 2 on those in his Miami debut, including the 47-yarder with 1:04 left that provided the final margin.",
      "He became the first Miami kicker to deliver a game winner against Notre Dame.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a first for a reason,\u201d Davis said.",
      "Brown shared team-high honors in carries with returnee Mark Fletcher Jr., both getting 15 handoffs from Beck. Brown's first Miami touchdown put the Hurricanes up 21-7 midway through the third quarter, and he got all six carries \u2014 for 22 hard-earned yards and two first downs that kept the clock moving \u2014 on the drive that set up Davis' winning kick.",
      "Brown had been part of big games before; North Dakota State won its 10th FCS national crown last season and he had what basically was the title-sealing TD run with 2:41 left in that 2024 championship game. On a bigger stage Sunday night, he looked right at home.",
      "\u201cI felt confident,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt was nothing new to me.\u201d",
      "Toney should still be in high school \u2014 he reclassified to be part of Miami's 2025 signing class. And he led the Hurricanes with six catches (on 10 targets) for 82 yards against the Fighting Irish, a team with what is generally considered to be an elite defense.",

      "The Hurricanes lost No. 1 overall draft pick Cam Ward to the NFL after he spent his lone Miami season rewriting the school's quarterback record book. The school's all-time receiving leader in Xavier Restrepo graduated, and all six receivers who had more than 10 catches in 2024 aren't on the 2025 roster. Running back Damian Martinez, who had team highs of 1,002 yards, 10 rushing TDs and 159 carries last year, also is gone.",
      "In the transfer portal era, big holes on rosters can be filled quickly and Miami excels in the portal. Beck was the biggest get, but the Hurricanes knew they needed players to catch his passes and Daniels \u2014 who started at Liberty, then went to LSU for 2024 and is now at Miami \u2014 was a huge part of the shopping spree there.",
      "\u201cI've been chasing CJ for two years,\u201d Cristobal said. \u201cEvery time he enters the portal, man, I miss him. We finally got him. And what a play he made. Unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Daniels was hurt when he got to Miami and needed time to recover from a foot injury. But he began making an immediate impact anyway, and what he did on Jan. 16 with nobody watching was probably just as critical as what he did on Aug. 31 with a sold-out stadium and national TV audience watching.",
      "Jan. 16 was the day that Beck walked into the Miami facility as a Hurricanes player for the first time. The first teammate he met Daniels. The click was immediate.",
      "\u201cWe looked at each other and we just knew that what we had was about to be special,\u201d Beck said. \u201cNever met the kid. Obviously, I'd heard of him, very talented. But it was just this look of respect and knowing we had the talent and the guys to do this.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The NFL has introduced several rule changes for the new season, including making last year's experimental kickoff permanent with some tweaks",
      "A new NFL season is set to begin with last year's experiment on the new kickoff becoming permanent with a new tweak and several other changes in rules and officiating.",
      "The league also will implement changes to the overtime rule for the regular season, expand replay assist, crack down on bad sportsmanship and use Hawk-Eye virtual measuring to replace the old-time chains to determine first downs.",
      "The league experimented with the so-called dynamic kickoff in 2024 in hopes of more returns while also making the play safer. Owners voted in April to make the change permanent while moving touchbacks on kicks that reach the end zone on the fly from the 30 to the 35, which is expected to lead to more kicks in play and more returns.",
      "There was no change in the tush push play that Philadelphia used so successfully on the way to winning the Super Bowl last season.",
      "Here\u2019s an explanation of some of the new rules that will be in place.",
      "The league was mostly pleased with the experimental kickoff put in place for 2024 that led to the rate of kickoff returns increasing from a record-low 21.8% in 2023 to 32.8% last season, while reducing the rate of injuries on what had been the game\u2019s most dangerous play.",
      "The rule made kickoffs more like scrimmage plays by placing the coverage players and blockers close together to eliminate the high-speed collisions that had contributed to so many injuries on the play. The league said the rate of concussions dropped 43% on returns, with a significant reduction as well in lower-body injuries.",
      "The problem last season was many teams still opted to kick the ball in the end zone because the touchback wasn\u2019t punitive enough. The average starting field position on a touchback was only 2.4 yards further than the average starting position after returns, which was the 27.6-yard line.",
      "By moving the touchback to the 35, the league projects that the return rate will rise to somewhere between 60% and 70%, with a similar increase in long returns, adding more excitement to the game.",
      "The league also approved a small tweak to how blockers on the return team are allowed to line up in the setup zone that could lead to longer returns.",
      "Teams returned just over 76% of kicks in the preseason, up from 70% in the 2024 preseason. But that number typically drops in the regular season when teams don't use kickoffs to evaluate players for spots at the end of the roster.",
      "Teams will still need to declare their intention to try an onside kick because of the different formation. But a new change will allow trailing teams to try one before the start of the fourth quarter after Kansas City had to kick deep while down 28 points in the final minute of the third quarter in the Super Bowl.",
      "Coverage players will also be allowed to line up one yard closer in hopes of increasing the rate of recovery from about 6% over the past three seasons to at least 10%.",
      "The league approved a proposal to make the regular season overtime more like the postseason, with both teams getting a chance at a possession, even if the team that gets the ball first scores a touchdown.",
      "The NFL added regular season overtime in 1974, adding a 15-minute sudden death period that ended on any score. In 2010, the rule was tweaked to a modified sudden death that required an opening possession touchdown to immediately end the game instead of only a field goal. That was in effect in both the regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Overtime then was shortened for the regular season to only 10 minutes in 2017. A rule change in 2022 for the playoffs only gave both teams the chance to score even with a touchdown on the opening possession.",

      "Aug 29, 5:22 PM",
      "Now that will be the case in the regular season, after the improved field position on kickoffs made winning in OT on an opening possession TD easier.",
      "According to Sportradar, six of the 16 overtime games last season ended on an opening-drive TD for the most overtime games ended on the first drive since the rule change went into effect in 2010.",
      "In all, teams that won the overtime toss won 75% of the time last season, according to Sportradar, and have a .606 winning percentage in overtime since it was cut to 10 minutes.",
      "The league kept the 10-minute overtime period instead of expanding it back to 15 minutes like was originally proposed by Philadelphia, which could lead to teams opting to go for 2 and a win if they match an opening-drive TD with one of their own since there might not be time for another possession.",
      "The NFL expanded its replay assist system to overturn objective calls if there was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence that a foul didn\u2019t occur. The calls could include facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles and tripping. Replay also would be able to overturn a roughing-the-kicker or running-into-the-kicker penalty if video showed the defender made contact with the ball.",
      "The league has been using replay assist in recent years to overturn obvious errors on aspects like whether a pass is caught or where the ball should be spotted without the referee needing to stop the game for a review.",
      "The Competition Committee says there\u2019s no interest in allowing replay assists to call penalties on plays missed by officials on the field.",
      "Referees will no longer use the chains to determine first downs, opting instead for a virtual measuring system. This won\u2019t eliminate the officials who manually spot the ball and use chains to mark the line to gain.",
      "The Hawk-Eye system consists of six 8K cameras for optical tracking of the position of the ball with the result shown on stadium scoreboards. The league estimates that measurements will take about 30 seconds \u2014 about 40 seconds fewer than the average with the chains \u2014 although it took longer at times in the preseason.",
      "The league is also emphasizing sportsmanship and cracking down on violent and sexually suggestive gestures this season.",
      "In April, the NFL expanded prohibited acts to include banning the \u201cnose wipe\u201d gesture that league executive Troy Vincent said is affiliated with gangs.",
      "The unsportsmanlike conduct rule now states: \u201cany violent gesture, which shall include but not be limited to a throat slash, simulating firing or brandishing a gun, or using the \u2018nose wipe\u2019 gesture, or an act that is sexually suggestive or offensive.\"",

      "It's the first time Osaka \u2014 who has been ranked No. 1 and now is seeded No. 23 \u2014 has made it this far at one of the four most important events in tennis since the Australian Open in early 2021. That was also the last time she won a Slam trophy.",
      "So far in her career, the 27-year-old Osaka has left with the championship every time she got past the fourth round at any major, something she did at Flushing Meadows on Monday with a dominant win against No. 3 seed Coco Gauff by a 6-3, 6-2 score in barely more than an hour.",
      "\u201cShe seems relaxed out there. ... She forced me to play how I did today,\" Gauff observed. \u201cRegardless (of) whatever form she\u2019s in, she\u2019s always a tough player, and I don\u2019t think anyone takes her for granted, regardless of where her \u2018form\u2019 is, especially on hard courts.\u201d",
      "Osaka is a four-time Grand Slam champion, always on that surface \u2014 winning in New York in 2018 and 2020, plus twice more at Melbourne Park \u2014 thanks to going a combined 12-0 in the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.",

      "Europe captain Luke Donald filled out his 12-man roster for this month\u2019s Ryder Cup with six players who helped the team win back the trophy in Rome two years ago",
      "European captain Luke Donald is bringing the same 12 faces \u2014 one different name \u2014 to the Ryder Cup with hopes of creating a new experience while getting the same outcome as when they dismantled the Americans two years ago in Rome.",
      "Donald filled out the rest of his 12-man team Monday with six captain's picks, all of whom contributed to a resounding victory at Marco Simone in 2023.",
      "There were no surprises. Donald asked Matt Fitzpatrick to play the last two weeks at the British Masters and European Masters, and he obliged by delivering a pair of top-six finishes. The former U.S. Open champion was the final picked Donald announced.",
      "The other choices were Shane Lowry, Jon Rahm, Sepp Straka, Viktor Hovland and Ludvig \u00c5berg. It's the first time Europe has returned 11 of the 12 players from a previous Ryder Cup team.",
      "The exception was Rasmus H\u00f8jgaard of Denmark, who qualified for the team in the final week. His identical twin, Nicolai, played on the team in Rome.",
      "The Ryder Cup has been increasingly difficult to win on the road \u2014 Europe's only victory on U.S. soil required the greatest comeback by a visiting team in 2012 at Medinah \u2014 and it figures to be especially difficult at Bethpage Black in New York, renowned for its hostile crowd.",
      "\u201cEven though we have a lot of continuity, this is a different animal,\u201d Donald said. \u201cWe understand how difficult it is.\u201d",
      "The matches are Sept. 26-28. Europe has a 12-9-1 record against the Americans dating to 1979, when continental Europe was added to what previously had been only Britain and Ireland.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re sitting in New York on the Sunday night with the Ryder Cup in our team room, I'll be a very happy man,\u201d said Lowry, one of five Europeans without a win this year.",
      "H\u00f8jgaard is the only Ryder Cup rookie for Europe, its fewest since Nicolas Colsaerts was the sole rookie at Medinah in 2012. That was by design, as it's far easier to bring in a newcomer before a home crowd. Europe had four rookies at Marco Simone.",
      "\u201cYou have to understand who you are playing against, what course you're playing and what the environment is going to be like,\u201d Donald said. \"Understanding all of that had a big factor in choosing the guys I did. They understand they can go head-to-head. I think they feel like they can compete with these guys.",
      "\u201cThat was significant in my thinking why they deserved to be on that team.\u201d",
      "The other five players who automatically qualified were Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood, Robert MacIntyre, Justin Rose and Tyrrell Hatton.",
      "Among those under consideration were Marco Penge with his two European tour titles this season and Matt Wallace, a runner-up at the European Masters on Sunday. He finished 12th in the standings and broke down while talking about his desire to play on the team.",
      "\u201cI called him 10 to 15 minutes after that emotional interview he did and I felt very emotional for him,\u201d Donald said. \u201cIt shows to me what the Ryder cup means to these guys.\u201d",
      "While the team is nearly the same, Donald said this will be a new Ryder Cup for Europe that could feature different partnerships and other \u201ctechniques\u201d to prepare for a road game. Most of his players will be at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth next week, and he plans a trip to Bethpage Black before Ryder Cup week.",

      "Experts say generative AI is set to transform the music world. However, there are scant details, so far, on how it's impacting the $29.6 billion global recorded music market, which includes about $20 billion from streaming.",
      "The most reliable figures come from music streaming service Deezer, which estimates that 18% of songs uploaded to its platform every day are purely AI generated, though they only account for a tiny amount of total streams, hinting that few people are actually listening. Other, bigger streaming platforms like Spotify haven't released any figures on AI music.",
      "Udio declined to comment on how many users it has and how many songs it has generated. Suno did not respond to a request for comment. Both have free basic levels as well as pro and premium tiers that come with access to more advanced AI models.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a total boom. It\u2019s a tsunami,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of Ohio University's School of Media Arts and Studies. The amount of AI generated music \u201cis just going to only exponentially increase\u201d as young people grow up with AI and become more comfortable with it, he said.",
      "Yet generative AI, with its ability to spit out seemingly unique content, has divided the music world, with musicians and industry groups complaining that recorded works are being exploited to train AI models that power song generation tools.",
      "Record labels are trying to fend off the threat that AI music startups pose to their revenue streams even as they hope to tap into it for new earnings, while recording artists worry that it will devalue their creativity.",
      "Three major record companies, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Records, filed lawsuits last year against Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. In June, the two sides also reportedly entered negotiations that could go beyond settling the lawsuits and set rules for how artists are paid when AI is used to remix their songs.",
      "GEMA, a German royalty collection society, has sued Suno, accusing it of generating music similar to songs like \u201cMambo No. 5\u201d by Lou Bega and \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville.",
      "More than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn, released a silent album to protest proposed changes to U.K. laws on AI they fear would erode their creative control. Meanwhile, other artists, such as will.i.am, Timbaland and Imogen Heap, have embraced the technology.",
      "Some users say the debate is just a rehash of old arguments about once-new technology that eventually became widely used, such as AutoTune, drum machines and synthesizers.",

      "For millennia humans have tried to scare wolves away from their livestock. Most of them didn\u2019t have drones.",
      "But a team of biologists working near the California-Oregon border do, and they're using them to blast AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d movie clips and live human voices at the apex predators to shoo them away from cattle in an ongoing experiment.",

      "\u201cWith what? I can't talk to people?\u201d co-star Adam Driver shouts back.",
      "Gray wolves were hunted nearly to extinction throughout the U.S. West by the first half of the 20th century. Since their reintroduction in Idaho and at Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s, they've proliferated to the point that a population in the Northern Rockies has been removed from the endangered species list.",
      "There are now hundreds of wolves in Washington and Oregon, dozens more in northern California, and thousands roaming near the Great Lakes.",
      "The recovering population has meant increasing conflict with ranchers \u2014 and increasingly creative efforts by the latter to protect livestock. They've turned to electrified fencing, wolf alarms, guard dogs, horseback patrols, trapping and relocating, and now drones. In some areas where nonlethal efforts have failed, officials routinely approve killing wolves, including last week in Washington state.",
      "Gray wolves killed some 800 domesticated animals across 10 states in 2022, a previous Associated Press review of data from state and federal agencies found.",
      "Scientists with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service developed the techniques for hazing wolves by drone while monitoring them using thermal imaging cameras at night, when the predators are most active. A preliminary study released in 2022 demonstrated that adding human voices through a loudspeaker rigged onto a drone can freak them out.",
      "The team documented successful interruptions of wolf hunts. When Dustin Ranglack, the USDA\u2019s lead researcher on the project, saw one for the first time, he smiled from ear to ear.",
      "\u201cIf we could reduce those negative impacts of wolves, that is going to be more likely to lead to a situation where we have coexistence,\u201d Ranglack said.",
      "The preloaded clips include recordings of music, gunshots, fireworks and voices. A drone pilot starts by playing three clips chosen at random, such as the \u201cMarriage Story\u201d scene or \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d with its screams and hair-raising electric guitar licks.",
      "If those don't work, the operator can improvise by yelling through a microphone or playing a different clip that's not among the randomized presets. One favorite is the heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch 's cover of \u201cBlue on Black,\u201d which might blast the lyric \u201cYou turned and you ran\u201d as the wolves flee.",

Patrols extended south to the Sierra Valley in August for the first time, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the wolves might become accustomed to the drones. Herders and wolf hunters in Europe have long deterred them with long lines hung with flapping cloth, but the wolves can eventually learn that the flags are not a threat.",
      "Environmental advocates are optimistic about drones, though, because they allow for scaring wolves in different ways, in different places.",
      "\u201cWolves are frightened of novel things,\u201d said Amaroq Weiss, a wolf advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cI know that in the human imagination, people think of wolves as big, scary critters that are scared of nothing.\u201d",
      "There are also drawbacks to the technology. A drone with night vision and a loudspeaker costs around $20,000, requires professional training and doesn't work well in wooded areas, making it impractical for many ranchers.",
      "Ranchers in Northern California who have hosted USDA drone patrols agree that they have reduced livestock deaths so far.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very appreciative of what they did. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a long-term solution,\u201d said Mary Rickert, the owner of a cattle ranch north of Mount Shasta. \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is that after some period of time, that all of a sudden they go, \u2018Wow, this isn\u2019t going to hurt me.

      "Online age checks are on the rise in the U.S. and elsewhere, asking people for IDs or face scans to prove they are over 18 or 21 or even 13. To proponents, they're a tool to keep children away from adult websites and other material that might be harmful to them.",
      "But opponents see a worrisome trend toward a less secure, less private and less free internet, where people can be denied access not just to pornography but news, health information and the ability to speak openly and anonymously.",
      "\u201cI think that many of these laws come from a place of good intentions,\u201d said Jennifer Huddleston, a senior technology policy fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. \u201cCertainly we all want to protect young people from harmful content before they\u2019re ready to see it.\u201d",
      "More than 20 states have passed some kind of age verification law, though many face legal challenges. While no such law exists on the federal level in the United States, the Supreme Court recently allowed a Mississippi age check law for social media to stand. In June, the court upheld a Texas law aimed at preventing minors from watching pornography online, ruling that adults don't have a First Amendment right to access obscene speech without first proving their age.",
      "Elsewhere, the United Kingdom now requires users visiting websites that allow pornography to verify their age. Beyond adult sites, platforms like Reddit, X, Telegram and Bluesky have also committed to age checks. France and several other European Union countries also are testing a government sponsored verification app.",
      "And Australia has banned children under 16 from accessing social media.",
      "\u201cPlatforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in November. The platforms have a year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced.",
      "To critics, though, age check laws raise \u201csignificant privacy and speech concerns, not only for young people themselves, but also for all users of the internet,\u201d Huddleston said. \u201cBecause the only way to make sure that we are age verifying anyone under the age of 18 is to also age verify everyone over the age 18. And that could have significant impacts on the speech and privacy rights of adults.\u201d",
      "The state laws are a hodgepodge of requirements, but they generally fall into two camps. On one side are laws \u2014 as seen in Louisiana and Texas \u2014 that require websites comprised of more than 33% of adult content to verify users' ages or face fines. Then there are laws \u2014 enacted in Wyoming or South Dakota \u2014 that seek to regulate sites that have any material that is considered obscene or otherwise harmful to minors.",
      "What's considered harmful to minors can be subjective, and this is where experts believe such laws run afoul of the First Amendment. It means people may be required to verify their ages to access anything, from Netflix to a neighborhood blog.",
      "\u201cIn places like Australia and the U.K., there is already a split happening between the internet that people who are willing to identify themselves or go through age verification can see and the rest of the internet. And that's historically a very dangerous place for us to end up,\u201d said Jason Kelley, activism director at the nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "What's behind the gates is determined by a \u201chundred different decision-makers,\" Kelley said, from politicians to tech platforms to judges to individuals who have sued because they believe that a piece of content is dangerous.",

      "While many companies are complying, verifying users' ages can prove a burden, especially for smaller platforms. On Friday, Bluesky said it will no longer be available in Mississippi because of its age verification requirements. While the social platform already does age verification in the U.K., it said Mississippi\u2019s approach \u201cwould fundamentally change how users access Bluesky.\u201d",
      "That's because it requires every user to undergo an age check, not just those who want to access adult content. It would also require Bluesky to identify and track users that are children.",
      "\u201cWe think this law creates challenges that go beyond its child safety goals, and creates significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms,\u201d the company said in a blog post.",
      "Some websites and social media companies, such as Instagram's parent company Meta, have argued that age verification should be done by app store owners, such as Apple and Google, and not individual platforms. This would mean that app stores need to verify their users\u2019 ages before they allow them to download apps. Unsurprisingly, Apple and Google disagree.",
      "\u201cBilled as \u2018simple\u2019 by its backers, including Meta, this proposal fails to cover desktop computers or other devices that are commonly shared within families. It also could be ineffective against pre-installed apps,\u201d Google said in a blog post.",
      "Nonetheless, a growing number of tech companies are implementing verification systems to comply with regulations or ward off criticism that they are not protecting children. This includes Google, which recently started testing a new age-verification system for YouTube that relies on AI to differentiate between adults and minors based on their watch histories.",
      "Instagram is testing a similar AI system to determine if kids are lying about their ages. Roblox, which was sued by the Louisiana attorney general on claims it doesn't do enough to protect children from predators, requires users who want to access certain games rated for those over 17 to submit a photo ID and undergo a face scan for verification. Roblox has also recently begun requiring age verification for teens who want to chat more freely on platform.",
      "Face scans that promise to estimate a person\u2019s age may address some of the concerns around IDs, but they can be unreliable. Can AI accurately tell, for instance, if someone is 17.5 or just turned 18?",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s less accurate for women or it\u2019s less accurate for certain racial or ethnic groups or for certain physical characteristics that then may mean that those people have to go through additional privacy invasive screenings to prove that they are of a certain age,\u201d Huddleston said.",
      "While IDs are a common way of verifying someone\u2019s age, the method raises security concerns: What happens if companies don't delete the uploaded files, for instance?",
      "Case in point: the recent data breaches at Tea, an app for women to anonymously warn each other about the men they date, speak to some of these concerns. The app requires women who sign up to upload an ID or undergo a scan to prove that they are women. Tea wasn't supposed to keep the files but it did, and stored them in a way that allowed hackers to not only access the images, but also their private messages.",

There were owl hoots, woodpecker pecks, coyote howls and tree frog ribbits. But no croaking from the invasive bullfrog, which has decimated the native red-legged frog population over the past century.",
      "It was another good day in his efforts to increase the population of the red-legged frog and restore an ecosystem spanning the U.S.-Mexico border. The efforts come as the Trump administration builds more walls along the border, raising concerns about the impact on wildlife.",
      "At 2 to 5 inches long (5 to 13 centimeters), red-legged frogs are the largest native frogs in the West and once were found in abundance up and down the California coast and into Baja California in Mexico.",
      "The species is widely believed to be the star of Mark Twain\u2019s 1865 short story, \u201cThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\" and their crimson hind legs were eaten during the Gold Rush. But as the red-legged frog declined in numbers, the bullfrog \u2014 with its even bigger hind legs \u2014 was introduced to menus during California's booming growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",
      "The red-legged frog population was decimated by the insatiable appetite of the bullfrogs and the disease the non-native species brought in, but also because it lost much of its habitat to drought and human development in the shape of homes, dams and more.",
      "Hollingsworth couldn't estimate the number of red-legged frogs that remain, but said they have disappeared from 95% of their historical range in Southern California.",
      "Robert Fisher of the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative Program searched for the frog for decades across some 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Los Angeles to the border. He found just one in 2001 and none after that.",
      "Scientists using DNA from red-legged frogs captured in Southern California before their disappearance discovered they were more genetically similar to the population in Mexico than any still in California.",
      "In 2006, Fisher, Hollingsworth and others visited Baja where they had heard of a small population of red-legged frogs. Anny Peralta, then a student of Hollingsworth at San Diego State University, joined them. They found about 20 frogs, and Peralta was inspired to dedicate her life to their recovery.",
      "Peralta and her husband established the nonprofit Fauna del Noroeste in Ensenada, Mexico, which aims to promote the proper management of natural resources. In 2018, they started building ponds in Mexico to boost the frog population that would later provide eggs to repopulate the species across the border.",
      "But just as they were preparing to relocate the egg masses, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Peralta and the U.S. scientists scrambled to secure permits for the unusual cargo and a pilot to fly the two coolers of eggs closer to the border. The rest of their journey north was by road, after the eggs passed a U.S. border guard inspection.",
      "Over the past five years, Hollingsworth and his team have searched for sounds to prove their efforts to repopulate ponds in Southern California worked.",
      "On Jan. 30, he heard the quiet, distinct grunting of the red-legged frog's breeding call in an audio flagged by AI.",

      "Herpetologists are building on the AI-powered tools already used to analyze datasets of bird sounds, hoping that it might help build audio landscapes to identify amphibians and track their behavior and breeding patterns, said Zachary Principe of The Nature Conservancy, which is working with the museum on the red-legged frog project. The tools could also help scientists analyze tens of thousands of audio files collected at universities, museums and other institutions.",

      "It could also help track the movement of the frogs, which can be difficult to find in the wild, especially because cold-blooded creatures cannot be detected using thermal imagery.",
      "The AI analysis of the pond audio has saved time for Hollingsworth and the others, who previously had to painstakingly listen to countless hours of audio files to detect the calls of the red-legged frog \u2014 which resembles the sound of a thumb being rubbed on a balloon \u2014 over the cacophony of other animals.",

      "A new study says climate change that has driven scorching temperatures and dwindling rainfall made massive wildfires in Turkey, Greece and Cyprus this summer burn much more fiercely",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Climate change that has driven scorching temperatures and dwindling rainfall made massive wildfires in Turkey, Greece and Cyprus this summer burn much more fiercely, said a new study released Thursday.",
      "The study by World Weather Attribution said the fires that killed 20 people, forced 80,000 to evacuate and burned more than 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) were 22% more intense in 2025, Europe\u2019s worst recorded year of wildfires.",
      "Hundreds of wildfires that broke out in the eastern Mediterranean in June and July were driven by temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (about 104 Fahrenheit), extremely dry conditions and strong winds.",
      "WWA, a group of researchers that examines whether and to what extent extreme weather events are linked to climate change, called its findings \u201cconcerning.\"",
      "\u201cOur study finds an extremely strong climate change signal towards hotter and drier conditions,\u201d said Theodore Keeping, a researcher at Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College in London.",
      "\u201cToday, with 1.3 degrees C of warming, we are seeing new extremes in wildfire behaviour that has pushed firefighters to their limit. But we are heading for up to 3 degrees C this century unless countries more rapidly transition away from fossil fuels,\u201d Keeping said.",
      "The study found winter rainfall ahead of the wildfires had dropped by about 14% since the pre-industrial era, when a heavy reliance on fossil fuels began. It also determined that because of climate change, weeklong periods of dry, hot air that primes vegetation to burn are now 13 times more likely.",
      "The analysis also found an increase in the intensity of high-pressure systems that strengthened extreme northerly winds, known as Etesian winds, that fanned the wildfires.",

      "Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.",
      "Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.",
      "Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.",
      "The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty major change,\u201d said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 state fiscal policy team, noting \u201cthe challenge in enacting something that\u2019s dramatically different for most drivers.\u201d",
      "Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.",
      "Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.",

      "The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn't have to pay supplemental registration fees.",

      "\u201cZohran obviously is very unique. He's way to the left, but then again, Cuomo and Adams, listen to the way they talk. They're Zohran-lite,\" Sliwa told The Associated Press. \u201cI will be the alternative.\u201d",
      "Even if he doesn't win, Sliwa might play the spoiler. While some Mamdani critics have urged Sliwa to drop out and throw his support behind someone with a better chance of beating the Democratic nominee, Sliwa says that isn't happening.",

      "If the crime stats won't paint the picture, Sliwa is happy to.",
      "As Sliwa spoke with a small gaggle of journalists on a street corner at a recent campaign stop, he illustrated an argument about the statistics by forming his hand into a gun \u2014 a \u201c9 millimeter,\u201d he said \u2014 and pointed it at his surprised spokesperson. \u201cBang, bang, bang, bang, bang!\" he said.",

    "summary": "Trump has shifted his admiration from Andrew Jackson to William McKinley",
    "story": [
      "Trump has shifted his admiration from Andrew Jackson to William McKinley",
      "WASHINGTON -- In his first term, Donald Trump's favorite president, other than himself, was Andrew Jackson, the hatchet-faced, self-made populist who relished turning Washington upside down.",
      "Now he's partial to the barrel-chested, unfailingly polite William McKinley, a champion of American expansionism as well as of tariffs, Trump's favorite second-term policy.",
      "Trump's shift, rather than merely swapping one infatuation for another, demonstrates how his mindset and priorities have evolved.",
      "The Republican president\u2019s admiration for McKinley fits with his current politics, which are different from when Trump first took office in 2017. A key political target for Trump back then was the elites, which his administration predicted might crumble in the face of a Jackson-like working class uprising.",
      "In his second inaugural address, Trump lauded McKinley as a \u201cnatural businessman\u201d who \u201cmade our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.\u201d",
      "Trump used a Day 1 order to restore the name of North America\u2019s tallest peak to Mount McKinley and he has repeatedly named-checked the 25th president more recently, while his weighty tariffs have left the world bracing for the kind of trade war not seen since the days of the McKinley Tariff Act of 1890.",
      "Jackson has hardly warranted a mention.",
      "\u201cIn the first term, well, McKinley was a fat cat,\u201d said H.W. Brands, a history professor at the University of Texas and author of \u201cAndrew Jackson: His Life and Times.\u201d \u201cSo, if you\u2019re going to be a populist, you\u2019re not going to be a McKinley.\u201d",
      "But Jackson, Brands noted, hated tariffs. \u201cSo, if tariffs are your thing, Andrew Jackson\u2019s not your guy anymore. You have to look around to find somebody whose name is connected to a tariff.\u201d",
      "The White House says the shift isn't a departure from Trump's first-term goals, but simply his leaning harder into new tools \u2014 in this case, tariffs \u2014 to achieve them.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has never wavered from his commitment to putting working-class Americans above special interests, and his channeling of President McKinley\u2019s tariffs agenda is indicative of how he is using every lever of executive power to deliver for the American people,\u201d said spokesman Kush Desai.",
      "Still, many of Trump's current top advisers are veterans of the financial sector eager to help the president bend the economic system to his will, rather than reshaping it from the bottom up.",
      "That's meant Trump focusing political ire on foreign countries and \u201cglobalists\u201d who embraced international free trade. He wants to impose a new economic order that puts U.S. interests first, and has settled on steep import taxes to get America's trading partners to negotiate more favorable deals \u2014 as the way to most efficiently do that.",
      "The president's Jacksonian impulses aren't all dormant. He imposed some first-term tariffs and now is shaking up Washington with his efforts to slash the federal workforce and stock the bureaucracy with loyalists. He's also prioritized antagonizing \u201celites\u201d at Ivy League universities and top law firms.",
      "In his rhetoric, Trump also has mythologized the power of tariffs, despite history telling a different story. Tariffs in the McKinley era, which loosely tracked the Gilded Age, led to more income for the federal government, but also a highly stratified society of haves and have-nots.",
      "But just as Jackson allowed first-term Trump \u2014 a magnate who had little in common with many working-class voters he wooed \u2014 to take up the mantle of modern populist, McKinley gives Trump an intellectual justification and historical precedent for his love of tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a vibe shift for sure,\u201d said Eric Rauchway, a history professor at the University of California, Davis, and author of \u201cMurdering McKinley: The Making of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s America.\u201d",

      "It's also an example of Trump taking policy actions to move the country in a certain direction \u2014 or simply declaring what he wants to be true \u2014 then working backward to come up with an argument on why his instincts were correct all along.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s relationship to history, and so many other things, is entirely transactional,\u201d said Daniel Feller, a professor emeritus at the University of Tennessee and former longtime editor of \u201cThe Papers of Andrew Jackson.\u201d",
      "Jackson was the founder of the Democratic Party, though many on the left now reject him for being a slaveholder who imposed the \u201cTrail of Tears\u201d on Native Americans. Orphaned at 14, Jackson taught himself the law and eventually became wealthy.",
      "Yet he created a political persona around advocating for everyday Americans. Trump, during his first term, referred to Jackson as the \u201cPeople\u2019s President.\u201d",
      "McKinley, who was assassinated in 1901, six months into his second term, was born in Niles, Ohio, outside Youngstown. He fought with the Union army and preferred throughout his political career to be called \u201cMajor,\u201d the Civil War honorary title he earned.",
      "As a congressman, McKinley was known as the \"Napoleon of Protection\u201d for promoting the 1890 Tariff Act, which sharply raised import taxes on thousands of goods in an effort to protect American producers when there was no federal income tax. It ultimately increased prices domestically, hurt U.S. exporters and helped spark the Panic of 1893, the worst economic downturn until the Great Depression.",
      "McKinley also represents a burst of American colonial expansion. He annexed Hawaii and oversaw the U.S. taking control of the Philippines. His administration also acquired new territories in Guam and Puerto Rico, established a military government in Cuba and sent troops to China.",
      "Today, Trump has talked about the U.S. invading Panama and Greenland, making Canada the 51st state and turning the Gaza Strip into the \u201cRiviera\u201d of the Middle East.",
      "In July, in comments about which of his predecessors got prime White House wall space, Trump mentioned \u201cthe Great Andrew Jackson.\u201d But he praised McKinley, saying that the U.S. \u201cwas the wealthiest\u201d from 1870 to 1913, when it was \u201can all-tariff country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had a couple of presidents that were very, very strong,\u201d Trump told his Cabinet then. \u201cMcKinley, I guess, more than anybody.\u201d",
      "On social media last week, a Trump aide posted a picture of a new, gold-framed portrait in the West Wing featuring Trump alongside McKinley, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, and Henry Clay, over the title \u201cThe Tariff Men.\u201d Lincoln used high tariffs for Civil War funding, Jefferson was a free-trade advocate but supported some tariffs to bolster domestic industries. Clay, as House speaker, helped pass a major tariff act in 1824.",
      "What Trump doesn't mention is that McKinley's tariffs helped cost the GOP its House majority in 1890, with McKinley himself among those defeated. He returned to Ohio, was elected governor and, despite going bankrupt over a bad investment in a tin plate company, won the White House in 1896.",
      "After that, though, Rauchway said, McKinley actually didn't push tariffs as much following his experience with them in Congress. Just before he was killed, McKinley also talked up the need for international trade.",
      "That didn't stop Trump, in announcing sweeping tariffs around the globe in April, from saying the U.S. had been \u201clooted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far.\u201d",
      "His championing of tariffs isn't totally new. In his first term, Trump ordered some higher import taxes on solar panels, washing machines and steel and aluminum imports. He also occasionally praised McKinley, then, as when he said in a 2019 speech that the 25th president \u201cwas very strong on protecting our assets, protecting our country.\u201d",
      "But Trump conceded in that same speech, \u201cI\u2019m totally off script.\u201d",
      "That's no longer the case. Trump continually promotes McKinley's place in history.",
      "\u201cMcKinley was a great president,\u201d Trump said during last month's Cabinet meeting. \u201cWho never got credit.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "Democrat Eric McWilliams doesn't approve of Donald Trump sending National Guard troops to cities like Washington, D.C. And he's certainly not supportive of most of the president's policies.",
      "But the 63-year old retired handyman and U.S. Navy veteran does praise Trump for one thing. \u201cWhen it comes to crime,\" he said, \u201cHe\u2019s alright. He's doing pretty good. How he\u2019s doing it is another matter.\u201d",
      "\u201cCrime is a big problem,\u201d he went on. \u201cAt least he is doing something.\u201d",
      "McWilliams' views reflect the thinking of a lot of Democrats, according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. It finds that while most disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue, a large majority, 68%, see crime as a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in large cities. That's despite the fact that statistics show crime, overall, is down across the nation, with some cities reporting 30-year lows.",
      "The findings underscore the challenge facing Democratic leaders. They must thread the needle between criticizing Trump's policies, which are deeply unpopular among their base, while at the same time not dismissing widespread concerns about safety, which are amplified in many news sources and in online forums like Facebook and the popular Nextdoor app.",
      "That could create a vulnerability for the party heading into next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "While Trump remains unpopular overall, the new poll finds his approach to crime has earned him high marks compared to other issues like the economy and immigration. About half of U.S. adults, 53%, say they approve of his handling of crime.",
      "The vast majority of Americans, 81%, also see crime as a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in large cities. That includes nearly all Republicans, roughly three-quarters of independents and nearly 7 in 10 Democrats.",
      "The issue is complex, though, even for those who are concerned. In interviews, participants who oppose Trump\u2019s unprecedented takeover of Washington, D.C.\u2019s police department and threats to expand his efforts to other cities expressed alarm, calling his actions anti-American and part of what they see as an effort to distract the public from issues the White House would prefer they ignore.",
      "They believe resources would be better spent investing in community policing, mental health services and passing meaningful laws to get guns off city streets.",
      "But many also bemoaned the state of public safety in the country, even if they said they felt safe in their own neighborhoods and acknowledged that violent crime is down after a pandemic-era spike. Several noted that they or their neighbors had been the victims of serious crimes and complained about what they felt was a lackluster police response.",
      "Brian Cornelia, 62, a retired foreman and lifelong Democrat who lives in Michigan, near Marquette, is displeased with the performance of both parties.",
      "\u201cDefund the police was nuts,\" he said. \u201cNow with Trump what he\u2019s doing, that\u2019s nuts too.\"",
      "He said that crime is \u201cnot at all\u201d an issue where he lives and \u201cdown all over,\" but nonetheless appreciates that Trump is doing something.",
      "\"Something is happening. We\u2019ll see if it helps or not, but it's better than not doing anything,\" he said. Either way, he said Trump had backed Democrats into a corner.",
      "\u201cIt's bad. How are you going to say you don't want crime to be dealt with?\" he said. \u201cIf you argue with him, what, you\u2019re soft on crime? It\u2019s a Catch-22.\"",
      "Even those who give Trump credit question his tactics.",
      "About 8 in 10 Democrats say it\u2019s \u201ccompletely\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d unacceptable for the president to seize control of local police departments, as he\u2019s done in Washington. And about 6 in 10 say it\u2019s unacceptable for the federal government to use the U.S. military and National Guard to assist local police.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t approve of national troops having authority over fellow Americans,\u201d said McWilliams, the Navy veteran. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t use our armed forces to patrol our own people. That turns it into an authoritarian state.\u201d",
      "McWilliams, who lives in White Hall, Pennsylvania, said crime \u201cis practically non-existent\u201d in his neighborhood, where he doesn't even lock his door. But he worries about the situation in nearby Allentown and across the nation, noting the deadly mass shooting this week at a Minneapolis church.",

      "Swimming is not advised at many beaches because of unsafe fecal contamination",
      "OGUNQUIT, Maine -- Thousands of Americans will head to beaches for one last summer splash this Labor Day weekend, but taking a dip might be out of the question: Many of the beaches will caution against swimming because of unsafe levels of fecal contamination.",
      "Beaches from Crystal River, Florida, to Ogunquit, Maine, have been under advisories warning about water quality this week because of elevated levels of bacteria associated with fecal waste. The advisories typically discourage beachgoers from going in the water because the bacteria can cause gastrointestinal illness, rashes and nausea.",
      "There have been closures this week at some of the country's most popular beach destinations, including Keyes Memorial Beach in the Cape Cod village of Hyannis in Barnstable, Massachusetts; Benjamin's Beach on Long Island in Bay Shore, New York; and a portion of the Imperial Beach shoreline near San Diego. Even on the pristine, white sand beaches of Hawaii, the Hawaii State Department of Health is warning of a high bacteria count at Kahaluu Beach Park on the Big Island.",
      "It's a longstanding and widespread problem. Nearly two-thirds of beaches tested nationwide in 2024 experienced at least one day in which indicators of fecal contamination reached potentially unsafe levels, conservation group Environment America said in a report issued this summer.",
      "The group reviewed beaches on the coasts and Great Lakes and found that 84% of Gulf Coast beaches exceeded the standard at least once. The number was 79% for West Coast beaches, 54% for East Coast beaches and 71% for Great Lakes beaches.",
      "The report also said more than 450 beaches were potentially unsafe for swimming on at least 25 percent of the days tested. A key reason is outdated water and sewer systems that allows contamination from sewage to reach the places where people swim, said John Rumpler, clean water director and senior attorney with Environment America.",
      "\u201cThese beaches are a treasure for families across New England and across the country. They are a shared resource,\u201d said Rumpler, who is based in Boston. \u201cWe need to make the investment to make sure that literally our own human waste doesn't wind up in the places where we are swimming.\u201d",
      "Other factors have also played a role in contaminating beaches, including increasingly severe weather that overwhelms sewage systems, and suburban sprawl that paves over natural areas and reduces the ecosystem's ability to absorb stormwater, Rumpler said.",
      "But many people plan to jump in the ocean anyway. Despite a two-day warning of elevated fecal indicator bacteria last month at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, beachgoer Yaromyr Oryshkevych was not concerned.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t expect to be in any kind of danger of fecal contamination,\u201d said Oryshkevych, a retired dentist. He said he didn\u2019t think Rehoboth was close enough to notable pollution to be concerned, and he expected the ocean\u2019s natural currents to take care of any problems with contamination in the area.",
      "Dana West, a federal worker visiting Rehoboth Beach, recalled an instance earlier this year where a dozen members of his vacationing party experienced gastrointestinal issues. The symptoms occurred after they went on a snorkeling excursion, an activity that increases the likelihood of swallowing seawater, off the coast of Isla Mujeres, Mexico.",

But as they return to Washington this fall after a monthlong August recess, they will have to find a way to work with Democrats \u2014 or around them \u2014 as a government shutdown looms.",

      "Congress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.",
      "The Trump administration's efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also complicate the negotiations. Republicans passed legislation this summer that rescinded about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress again on Friday that he will block $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid.",

The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won\u2019t move without him.",

      "\u201cEvery time I pull into my garage, I pinch myself,\u201d Colley said.",
      "Now, President Donald Trump wants to eliminate that grant, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, and House Republicans overseeing federal budget negotiations did not include funding for it in their budget proposal. Experts and state housing agencies say that would set back tens of thousands of future affordable housing developments nationwide, particularly hurting Appalachian towns and rural counties where government aid is sparse and investors are few.",

      "The HOME program, started under President George H. W.

      "The program has spent more than $38 billion nationwide since it began filling in funding gaps and attracting more investment to acquire, build and repair affordable homes, HUD data shows. Additional funding has gone toward projects that have yet to be finished and rental assistance.",
      "To account for the gap left by the proposed cuts, House Republicans want to draw on nearly $5 billion from a related pandemic-era fund that gave states until 2030 to spend on projects supporting people who are unhoused or facing homelessness.",
      "That $5 billion, however, may be far less, since many projects haven\u2019t yet been logged into the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's tracking system, according to state housing agencies and associations representing them.",

      "A late Tennessee sheriff who inspired a Hollywood movie about a law enforcement officer who took on organized crime killed his wife in 1967 and led people to believe she was murdered by his enemies, authorities in Tennessee said Friday.",
      "The finding will likely shock many who grew up as Buford Pusser fans and watched the 1973 \u201cWalking Tall\u201d movie that immortalized him as a tough but fair sheriff with zero tolerance for crime, authorities said.",
      "There is enough evidence that if then-McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser were alive today, prosecutors would present an indictment to the grand jury for the murder of Pauline Mullins Pusser, said Mark Davidson, the district attorney for Tennessee\u2019s 25th judicial district. Investigators also uncovered signs she suffered from domestic violence.",
      "Prosecutors worked with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which began reexamining decades-old files on Pauline's death in 2022 as part of its regular review of cold cases, agency director David Rausch said. Agents found inconsistencies between Buford Pusser's version of events and the physical evidence, received a tip about a potential murder weapon and exhumed Pauline's body for an autopsy.",
      "Authorities acknowledged the news may shock many who grew up as Buford Pusser's fans and watched the 1973 \u201cWalking Tall\u201d movie he inspired or the 2004 remake. Many officers joined law enforcement because of his story, Davidson said. The sheriff died in a car crash seven years after his wife's death.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about tearing down a legend. It is about giving dignity and closure to Pauline and her family and ensuring that the truth is not buried with time,\u201d Davidson said at a news conference streamed on Facebook. \u201cThe truth matters. Justice matters. Even 58 years later. Pauline deserves both.\u201d",
      "The case dates to Aug. 12, 1967. Buford Pusser got a call in the early morning hours about a disturbance. He reported that his wife volunteered to ride along with him as he responded. Buford Pusser said that shortly after they passed Hope Methodist Church, a car pulled up and fired several times into the vehicle, killing Pauline and injuring the sheriff. Buford Pusser spent 18 days in the hospital and required several surgeries to recover. The case was built largely on his own statement and closed quickly, Rausch said.",
      "During the reexamination of the case, Dr. Michael Revelle, an emergency medicine physical and medical examiner, studied postmortem photographs, crime scene photographs, notes made by the medical examiner at the time and Buford Pusser's statements and concluded that Pauline was actually more likely that not shot outside the car and then placed inside it.",

      "Signs of a decline in international students have unsettled colleges around the U.S., but some schools are especially vulnerable",
      "One international student after another told the University of Central Missouri this summer that they couldn't get a visa, and many struggled to even land an interview for one.",
      "Even though demand was just as high as ever, half as many new international graduate students showed up for fall classes compared to last year.",
      "The decline represents a hit to the bottom line for Central Missouri, a small public university that operates close to its margins with an endowment of only $65 million. International students typically account for nearly a quarter of its tuition revenue.",
      "\u201cWe aren\u2019t able to subsidize domestic students as much when we have fewer international students who are bringing revenue to us,\u201d said Roger Best, the university's president.",
      "Signs of a decline in international students have unsettled colleges around the U.S. Colleges with large numbers of foreign students and small endowments have little financial cushion to protect them from steep losses in tuition money.",
      "International students represent at least 20% of enrollment at more than 100 colleges with endowments of less than $250,000 per student, according to an Associated Press analysis. Many are small Christian colleges, but the group also includes large universities such as Northeastern and Carnegie Mellon.",
      "The extent of the change in enrollment will not be clear until the fall, Some groups have forecast a decline of as much as 40%, with a huge impact on college budgets and the wider U.S. economy.",
      "As part of a broader effort to reshape higher education, President Donald Trump has pressed colleges to limit their numbers of international students and heightened scrutiny of student visas. His administration has moved to deport foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian activism, and new student visa appointments were put on hold for weeks as it ramped up vetting of applicants' social media.",
      "On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said it will propose a rule that would put new limits on the time foreign students can stay in the U.S.",
      "The policies have introduced severe financial instability for colleges, said Justin Gest, a professor at George Mason University who studies the politics of immigration.",
      "Foreign students are not eligible for federal financial aid and often pay full price for tuition \u2014 double or even triple the in-state rate paid by domestic students at public universities.",
      "\u201cTo put it more dollars and cents-wise, if an international student comes in and pays $80,000 a year in tuition, that gives universities the flexibility to offer lower fees and more scholarship money to American students,\u201d Gest said.",
      "Ahmed Ahmed, a Sudanese student, nearly didn't make it to the U.S. for his freshman year at the University of Rochester.",
      "The Trump administration in June announced a travel ban on 12 countries, including Sudan. Diplomatic officials assured Ahmed he could still enter the U.S. because his visa was issued before the ban. But when he tried to board a flight to leave for the U.S. from Uganda, where he stayed with family during the summer, he was turned away and advised to contact an embassy about his visa.",
      "With the help of the University of Rochester\u2019s international office, Ahmed was able to book another flight.",
      "At Rochester, where he received a scholarship to study electrical engineering, Ahmed, 19, said he feels supported by the staff. But he also finds himself on edge and understands why other students might not want to subject themselves to the scrutiny in the U.S., particularly those who are entirely paying their own way.",

      "In recent years, international students have made up about 30% of enrollment at Central Missouri, which has a total of around 12,800 students. In anticipation of the hit to international enrollment, Central Missouri cut a cost-of-living raise for employees. It has pushed off infrastructure improvements planned for its campus and has been looking for other ways to cut costs.",
      "Small schools \u2014 typically classified as those with no more than 5,000 students \u2014 tend to have less financial flexibility and will be especially vulnerable, said Dick Startz, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "Lee University, a Christian institution with 3,500 students in Tennessee, is expecting 50 to 60 international students enrolled this fall, down from 82 the previous school year, representing a significant drop in revenue for the school, said Roy Y. Chan, the university\u2019s director of graduate studies.",
      "The school already has increased tuition by 20% over the past five years to account for a decrease in overall enrollment, he said.",
      "\u201cSince we\u2019re a smaller liberal arts campus, tuition cost is our main, primary revenue,\u201d Chan said, as opposed to government funding or donations.",
      "The strains on international enrollment only add to distress for schools already on the financial brink.",
      "Colleges around the country have been closing as they cope with declines in domestic enrollment, a consequence of changing demographics and the effects of the pandemic. Nationwide, private colleges have been closing at a rate of about two per month, according to the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association.",
      "The number of high school graduates in the U.S. is expected to decline through 2041, when there will be 13% fewer compared to 2024, according to projections from the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s governing board has raised alarms among economists and legal experts who see it as the biggest threat to the central bank\u2019s independence in decades",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve's governing board has raised alarms among economists and legal experts who see it as the biggest threat to the central bank's independence in decades.",
      "The consequences could impact most Americans' everyday lives: Economists worry that if Trump gets what he wants \u2014 a loyal Fed that sharply cuts short-term interest rates \u2014 the result would likely be higher inflation and, over time, higher borrowing costs for things like mortgages, car loans and business loans.",
      "Trump on Monday sought to fireLisa Cook, the first Black woman appointed to the Fed's seven-member governing board. It was the first time in the Fed's 112-year history that a president has tried to fire a governor.",
      "Trump said he was doing so because of allegations raised by one of his appointees that she has committed mortgage fraud.",
      "Cook has argued in a lawsuit seeking to block her firing that the claims are a pretext for Trump's true goal: Gaining more control over the Fed. A court may decide next week whether to temporarily block Cook\u2019s firing while the case makes its way through the legal process.",
      "Cook is accused of claiming two homes as primary residences in July 2021, before she joined the board, which could have led to a lower mortgage rate than if one had been classified as a second home or an investment property. She has suggested in her lawsuit that it may have been a clerical error but hasn\u2019t directly responded to the accusations.",
      "Trump and members of his administration have made no secret about their desire to exert more control over the Fed. Trump has repeatedly demanded that the central bank cut its key rate to as low as 1.3%, from its current level of 4.3%.",
      "Before trying to fire Cook, Trump repeatedly attacked the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting the short-term interest rate and threatened to fire him as well.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll have a majority very shortly, so that\u2019ll be good,\u201d Trump said Tuesday, a reference to the fact that if he is able to replace Cook his appointees will control the Fed's board by a 4-3 vote.",
      "\u201cThe particular case of Governor Cook is not as important as what this latest move shows about the escalation in the assaults on the Fed,\u201d said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins and former adviser to Powell. \u201cIn my view, Fed independence really now hangs by a thread.\u201d",
      "Some economists do think the Fed should cut more quickly, though virtually none agree with Trump that it should do so by 3 percentage points. Powell has signaled the Fed is likely to cut by a quarter point in September.",
      "The Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls \u2014 which it typically does when the economy falters \u2014 the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, growth, and hiring. When it raises the rate to combat the higher prices that come with inflation, it can weaken the economy and cause job losses.",
      "Most economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can take unpopular steps that elected officials are more likely to avoid. Economic research has shown that nations with independent central banks typically have lower inflation over time.",
      "Elected officials like Trump, however, have much greater incentives to push for lower interest rates, which make it easier for Americans to buy homes and cars and would boost the economy in the short run.",
      "Douglas Elmendorf, an economist at Harvard and former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said that Trump's demand for the Fed to cut its key rate by 3 percentage points would overstimulate the economy, lifting consumer demand above what the economy can produce and boosting inflation \u2014 similar to what happened during the pandemic.",
      "\u201cIf the Federal Reserve falls under control of the president, then we\u2019ll end up with higher inflation in this country probably for years to come,\u201d Elmendorf said.",

      "And while the Fed controls a short-term rate, financial markets determine longer-term borrowing costs for mortgages and other loans. And if investors worry that inflation will stay high, they will demand higher yields on government bonds, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.",
      "In Turkey, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan forced the central bank to keep interest rates low in the early 2020s, even as inflation spiked to 85%. In 2023, Erdogan allowed the central bank more independence, which has helped bring down inflation, but short-term interest rates rose to 50% to fight inflation, and are still 46%.",
      "Other U.S. presidents have badgered the Fed. President Lyndon Johnson harassed then-Fed Chair William McChesney Martin in the mid-1960s to keep rates low as Johnson ramped up government spending on the Vietnam War and antipoverty programs. And Richard Nixon pressured then-Chair Arthur Burns to avoid rate hikes in the run-up to the 1972 election. Both episodes are widely blamed for leading to the stubbornly high inflation of the 1960s and '70s.",
      "Trump has also argued that the Fed should lower its rate to make it easier for the federal government to finance its tremendous $37 trillion debt load. Yet that threatens to distract the Fed from its congressional mandates of keeping inflation and unemployment low.",
      "Presidents do have some influence over the Fed through their ability to appoint members of the board, subject to Senate approval. But the Fed was created to be insulated from short-term political pressures. Fed governors are appointed to staggered, 14-year terms to ensure that no single president can appoint too many.",
      "Jane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University, said there is a reason that Congress decided to create independent agencies like the Fed: They preferred \u201cdecisions that are made from a kind of objective, neutral vantage point grounded in expertise rather than decisions are that are wholly subject to political pressure.\u201d",
      "Yet some Trump administration officials say they want more democratic accountability at the Fed.",
      "In an interview with USA Today Vice President JD Vance said, \u201cWhat people who are saying the president has no authority here are effectively saying is that seven economists and lawyers should be able to make an incredibly critical decision for the American people with no democratic input.\u201d",
      "And Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, wrote a paper last year advocating for a restructuring of the Fed, including making it much easier for a president to fire governors.",
      "The \u201coverall goal of this design is delivering the economic benefits\u201d of an independent central bank, Miran wrote, \u201cwhile maintaining a level of accountability that a democratic society must demand.\" Trump has nominated Miran to the Fed's board to replace Adriana Kugler, who stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1.",
      "Trump has personally insulted Powell for months, but his administration now appears much more focused on the Fed\u2019s broader structure.",
      "The Fed makes its interest rate decisions through a committee that consists of the seven governors, including Powell, as well as the 12 presidents of regional Fed banks in cities such as New York, Kansas City, and Atlanta. Five of those presidents vote on rates at each meeting. The New York Fed president has a permanent vote, while four others vote on a rotating basis.",
      "While the reserve banks' boards choose their presidents, the Fed board in Washington can vote to reject them. All 12 presidents will need to be reappointed and approved by the board in February, which could become more contentious if the board votes down one or more of the 12 presidents.",
      "\u201cThe nuclear scenario is ... the reappointment of the reserve bank presidents and interfering with that, (which) would be the signal that things are truly going off the rails,\" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The federal criminal case against former Memphis police officers charged in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols has taken a shocking, unusual twist: Three of them are getting a new trial because a judge made comments after their convictions that raised questions of bias.",
      "On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sheryl H. Lipman ordered a new trial for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith. They were found guilty in October 2024 of obstruction of justice through witness tampering in the January 2023 beating of Nichols after he fled a traffic stop. Two other officers involved in the beating pleaded guilty and avoided trial.",
      "Lipman wrote that U.S. District Judge Mark S. Norris, who presided over the trial, raised \u201cthe risk of bias\u201d when he commented in May that at least one of the officers could be in a gang, and that gang may have been responsible for shooting his law clerk.",
      "Lipman's order also said an assistant U.S. attorney recalled that Norris told her shortly after the shooting that the Memphis Police Department was \u201cinfiltrated to the top with gang members.\u201d",
      "Norris recused himself from the case in June, just days before scheduled sentencings for the five officers. He has declined comment.",
      "If the case heads to trial again, defense attorneys, prosecutors, the officers and Nichols' family will have to relive the brutal beating and the grueling legal battle that has followed. It is unclear when a new trial would take place, again putting Memphis in the spotlight for a death that sparked a federal civil rights investigation into its police.",
      "Here is a look at the case, and what's next.",
      "On Jan. 7, 2023, officers yanked Nichols from his car and then pepper-sprayed and hit the 29-year-old Black man with a Taser. Nichols fled, and when the five officers, who also are Black, caught up, they punched, kicked and hit him with a police baton. Nichols called out for his mother during the beating, which took place steps from his home.",
      "He died in a hospital three days later.",
      "Video of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries. It prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis, nationwide protests and renewed calls for police reform.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith, along with Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., were fired. They were charged in state court with offenses including second-degree murder and in federal court with civil rights violations and obstructing justice.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith were convicted in federal court of trying to cover up the beating by failing to say that they or their colleagues punched and kicked Nichols and broke police department rules when they did not include accurate statements about what type of force they used.",
      "Bean and Smith were acquitted of more serious civil rights charges.",
      "Haley was found guilty of violating Nichols\u2019 civil rights by causing bodily injury and showing deliberate indifference to medical needs, and also conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.",
      "This May, Bean, Haley and Smith were acquitted of all state charges.",
      "Martin and Mills pleaded guilty in federal court last year to violating Nichols\u2019 civil rights by causing death and conspiracy to witness tamper. They did not stand trial in federal court.",
      "Martin and Mills also avoided a state court trial after reaching agreements to plead guilty.",
      "In her order, Lipman cited a notice by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office about Norris\u2019 reactions to his law clerk being shot during a car theft days after the federal trial ended. The clerk was staying at the home of another law clerk who had previously worked for Norris on the Nichols case, the notice said.",

      "Lipman has ordered lawyers to state what charges they believe need to be retried, and she set a Sept. 25 hearing.",
      "Charles Geyh, a law school professor at Indiana University and expert in judicial ethics, said it is already rare to get a new trial because of doubts that a judge could hear a case fairly. But Norris\u2019 broad comments make the scenario \u201chighly unusual,\u201d Geyh said.",
      "\u201cIn a case like this, it\u2019s rarer still where the judge steps back and generalizes about the police force and associates them with organized crime and gangs,\u201d Geyh said.",
      "David Raybin, a Nashville criminal defense attorney who has represented police officers, said there could be renewed plea bargaining, potentially for lower offenses, given that the three officers had been convicted on the lesser federal charges and acquitted in state court.",
      "\u201cThey may come to the table and say, \u2018Look, we want a deal, we want a better deal,\u2019 or whatever,\" said Raybin, who is not involved in the case. \"The prosecutors might say, \u2019Look, this case is snakebit. We maybe want to settle this case in some way.' \u201d",
      "Geyh said there\u2019s a \u201cvery real possibility\u201d Norris could publicly apologize.",
      "Geyh also said someone could file a disciplinary complaint. The process could lead to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals chief judge talking privately with Norris, who might agree to some corrective steps, Geyh said.",
      "Or the chief circuit judge could commission an investigative panel, with a judicial council potentially issuing up to a public reprimand, but likely nothing more severe, Geyh added.",
      "Norris already has been reassigned off other cases, including a $550 million lawsuit by Nichols\u2019 family against the five officers and the city of Memphis.",
      "Nichols' family members have not commented publicly on the new trial, and neither has their lawyer, Ben Crump.",
      "But throughout their ordeal, Nichols' relatives have expressed how difficult his death has been. During the trials, Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, and other relatives left the courtroom while jurors watched video of the beating.",
      "After the state court acquittals in May, Crump said: \u201cTyre\u2019s life was stolen, and his family was denied the justice they so deeply deserve. We are outraged, and we know we are not alone.\"",

      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has endorsed Derek Dooley for the Republican nomination for the Senate seat in 2026",
      "ATHENS, Ga. -- Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Saturday endorsed Republican Derek Dooley in Georgia's 2026 U.S. Senate race, arguing an outsider without congressional experience can best critique Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff's record.",
      "\u201cI'm a firm believer that we need a political outsider to do that, someone that can stay focused on his record, but also someone who has a vision for our state in the future,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cThat is not a politician.\u201d",
      "Kemp's choice of Dooley is hardly a surprise \u2014 he told other Republican candidates that he would back Dooley before the former University of Tennessee football coach even entered the race. But Kemp's appearance with Dooley on Saturday before a University of Georgia football game in Athens underlines the investment of Georgia\u2019s second-term governor in a political novice \u2014 along with Kemp spending on Dooley's behalf and detailing his closest political aides to run Dooley's campaign.",
      "Kemp agreed to back the 57-year-old Dooley after deciding not to run for the seat himself. Georgia Republicans are looking to topple Ossoff, considered the Senate\u2019s most vulnerable Democratic incumbent seeking reelection next year. The GOP field also includes U.S. Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, as well as activist Reagan Box.",
      "Dooley has focused on attacking Ossoff and backing President Donald Trump, tactics that unify Republicans. He argued Saturday that Ossoff's history of support for former President Joe Biden and his opposition to Trump disqualify him from another term.",
      "\u201cWhat's amazing is he wants to be our quarterback for the next six years,\u201d Dooley said. \u201cAnd where I come from, when you deliver results like that, your ass goes on the bench. So I'm looking forward to rolling up my sleeves. I'm going to earn the support every day from the people and Georgia and give this Senate seat back to them.\u201d",
      "But Dooley has a scant history in politics \u2014 he didn't vote in the 2016 and 2020 elections when Trump was a candidate. Still coaching at the time, Dooley has said he was too busy and distracted to vote. But Collins says that will repel Republicans whose votes are needed.",

      "Collins said that backing Trump\u2019s agenda in Congress won\u2019t be a \u201cliability\u201d in a general election and argued his record shows he gets things done.",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 05:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "North Carolina was pummeled by TCU, 48-14, in the college coaching debut of NFL coaching legend Bill Belichick.",
    "story": [
      "Chapel Hill, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina's high-point moment in its first game under coach Bill Belichick came early.",
      "A festive pregame atmosphere led to a roar from the crowd at kickoff. And a season-opening drive moved at a crisp pace to the end zone.",
      "After that, well, Monday night's hyped-up debut turned into a romp by TCU - along with a reminder that even an NFL icon with six Super Bowl titles as a head coach can't just magically turn the Tar Heels into winners after decades of also-ran status.",
      "\"We played competitively but then just couldn't sustain it,\" Belichick said in the familiar low tone from his NFL news conferences after the 48-14 loss. \"Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. We need to do a better job all the way around \u2014 coaching, playing, all three phases of the game.\"",
      "CBSSports.com's Shehan Jeyarajah points out\u00a0that, \"The NFL is generally a defensive league where teams are close to evenly matched. At the college level, Belichick will come to understand just how big the talent differentials are between the good and bad teams \u2014 and he was on the wrong end.\"",
      "The blowout put a major damper on a night buzzing with optimism for the 73-year-old Belichick's college debut, only to see the Horned Frogs dominate so thoroughly they drove UNC fans to the Kenan Stadium exits by midway through the third quarter.",
      "\"It was a great environment tonight,\" Belichick said. \"I mean, the fans were awesome. There was great energy in the stadium. We just didn't do enough to keep it going. We've got to play better for the energy to be sustainable.\"",
      "By the end of the game, Kenan was a ghost town and the Tar Heels had given up more points than in any previous opener in their history, according to Sportradar.",
      "It was a jarring result, even amid uncertainty as to exactly what to expect from UNC with roughly 70 new players between transfers and incoming recruits. There were few highlights after that opening drive beyond Kaleb Cost's athletic reeling in of a deflected ball for an interception and quarterback Max Johnson returning in relief from a serious leg injury sustained in last year's opener at Minnesota.",
      "\"We're just moving forward, just moving forward,\" said Cost, offering an unintentional callback to Belichick's famous \"We're on to Cincinnati\" response to reporters' questions after a blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014.",
      "UNC was picked to finish eighth in the 17-team Atlantic Coast Conference, though that seemed almost entirely predicated on Belichick's mere presence. This is a man, after all, who teamed with legendary quarterback Tom Brady to win six world titles in his 24-year run with the New England Patriots. Someone who won more regular-season and playoff games in the NFL (333) than anyone other than Don Shula.",
      "So there was spectacle to Belichick's debut as he took the field sporting a familiar look from the pro sideline with a gray hoodie - only this one bearing the name \"Carolina Football\" in that distinctive shade of light blue.",
      "An estimated 5,000 fans packed onto a main campus quad for a pregame concert and throngs lined the team's walk to Kenan, where UNC has sold out all its season tickets \u2014 at an elevated price with Belichick's arrival \u2014 and single-game seats for the season. The game attracted ESPN to hold a pregame studio show from the sideline with a crew that included former Alabama coach Nick Saban, with Belichick popping over briefly to say hello.",
      "There were notable former UNC athletes from years past, including NBA legend Michael Jordan \u2014 who won a national championship under Dean Smith here in 1982 \u2014 and former UNC star linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who played under Belichick when he was an assistant and eventually defensive coordinator with the New York Giants during the 1980s.",
      "And it wasn't hard to spot Jordon Hudson \u2014 Belichick's 24-year-old girlfriend who has generated her own tabloid-level curiosity \u2014 as she walked the pregame sideline sporting Carolina blue pants shimmering with sequins-like additions on the legs.",
      "Belichick roamed the field during pregame warmups for the better part of a half-hour. At one point, he stood on the UNC end of the field with general manager Michael Lombardi, then shared a quick handshake with ACC commissioner Jim Phillips as he made his way toward midfield.",
      "Once there, Belichick shook hands with members of the officiating crew and watched the Horned Frogs warm up.",
      "The Tar Heels got off to a sprint of a start with an 83-yard drive that ended with Caleb Hood scoring through the right side from 8 yards out, followed by forcing a quick punt. But things soon started getting away.",
      "TCU \u2014 which lost in a similar scenario as the \"other\" team in Deion Sanders' debut at Colorado two years ago \u2014 never looked rattled or thrown. Bud Clark provided a highlight by jumping Gio Lopez's sideline throw for an easy 25-yard pick-six as TCU took a 20-7 lead into the break.",
      "It quickly got worse after halftime. Kevorian Barnes sprinted through the right side and down the sideline for a 75-yard touchdown on the first snap. Trent Battle added his own big run, slipping through the left side untouched and going 28 yards for a TD.",
      "And finally, Devean Deal had a 37-yard scoop-and-score on Lopez's fumble to make it 41-7 and start the Kenan exodus.",
      "By the end, UNC had just 222 total yards, 320 fewer than TCU, and a short week to fix problems before visiting Charlotte on Saturday.",
      "\"They were clearly the better team tonight,\" Belichick said. \"They deserved to win and they did it decisively.\"",

Please don't threaten to kill someone if something doesn't go your way \u2014 I promise you, it's not that serious,\" she told Teen Vogue.",
      "\"There is a line between fiction and reality\"",

      "Varma said this indicates that there is perhaps a \"deep void in our society right now\" with people longing for human connection.",
      "She explained these fan behaviors are a sign of a psychological phenomenon known as parasocial relationships \u2013 or one-sided bonds with media figures. Varma adds the anonymity of social media emboldens fans to exhibit bad behavior.",

    "summary": "One of the founding members of Creedence Clearwater Revival lost control of his own songs when the band broke up in the early 1970s. Now, after buying back rights to his Creedence catalog, John Fogerty has come back to his music, recording the album \"Legacy.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"It was life and death,\" said musician John Fogerty. \"I used to tell myself that phrase: 'This is life and death.' You're against the whole world.\"",
      "He felt that as a young man: \"Yes, oh yes. I mean, there's a million records out there. It's me against everybody that's every recorded and ever will record. You've got to do a great job. It was either be great, or go home!\"",
      "You know how it turned out for Fogerty. \"Great\" is something of an understatement. That voice \u2026 that guitar \u2026 and those songs, so many of which became hits that are now classics. But Fogerty, who recently turned 80, says every time he steps up to the mic, he still has something to prove \u2013 and still feel a little nerve. \"Oh yeah, yeah, every time!\" he laughed. \"But I think the nerves is what gives you the edge.",
      "I asked, \"How do you do that? What's the magic there?\"",
      "\"I wish I had a really great, contrived answer for you, but I don't!\" he laughed.",
      "The answer seems quite simple when you watch Fogerty rehearse. There is love of craft, and love of family. (His sons, Shane and Tyler Fogerty, help lead his touring band.)",
      "The group that put Fogerty on the charts was Creedence Clearwater Revival, which got its start in the late 1950s. Though a native of Northern California, Fogerty soaked up the rhythms of the South, giving birth to his so-called \"swamp rock\" sound, which he honed in the mid-'60s.",
      "He recalled: \"I received my honorable discharge from the Army. And the first line I wrote was, 'Left a good job in the city, workin' for the man every night and day.' Well, of course that was the Army. I mean, it had just happened. But as I begin to strum, I started singing this phrase: 'Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.' And at that point I'm, Well, what is this song? What is this? And I went to this songbook that I had just started keeping, and on the very first page, the very first entry, I had written the words 'Proud Mary.'",
      "\"And I actually understood right then that I'd written a classic song, a really great, American song,\" he said. \"And a few moments later, 'Oh my God. What if I never get to do this again? What if this is the only one that ever happens, and I'm a one-hit wonder?'\"",
      "Turns out, Fogerty was anything but that. Yet, after the 1972 breakup of Creedence, his solo career became mired in legal battles. He was stunned to discover he no longer had control over the use of the songs he wrote \u2013 and a limited share of the profits.",
      "Fogerty has looked on as others have endured similar challenges, and pain. The most famous current example: Taylor Swift, who earlier this year purchased the rights to her compositions, and won back control of her music.",
      "I asked, \"If you could pull her aside, John, and give her a piece of advice about how to get over the pain of a fight over your own music, what would you tell her?\"",
      "\"Well, I don't think you get over that kind of fight,\" he replied. \"What happened to me is, I stopped touring, and I stopped singing my own songs. I don't recommend that move to anybody. You become invisible. You're just forgotten about. It's like you died.\"",
      "I asked Julie, his wife of 34 years, if she ever doubted that he would be able to pull himself out of that anger. \"I think it was more sadness than anger,\" she said. \"And all he ever wanted to do in life was make music. That was his love. That was his best friend. And having that taken away and turned so bad was really hard for me to understand.\"",
      "Fogerty gives Julie credit for turning his life around. And she encouraged him not only to buy back the rights to his Creedence catalog, but to re-record those songs with his sons.\u00a0 The result: a new album, \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version).\"",
      "Julie said, \"Having those songs and being able to put his fist in the air and go, 'I own those songs,' I couldn't think of a better gift than having him record these with friends and family.\"",
      "You can stream John Fogerty's album \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)\" by clicking on the embed below (Free Spotify registration required to hear the tracks in full):",
      "Since they were children, sons Shane and Tyler learned guitar from their father.\u00a0 The new album is a family affair, but it's also serious business. \"I have the feeling that somehow Julie knew, she knew that at some point, the life-and-death John would kick in and I would have to roll up my sleeves,\" Fogerty said. \"'Cause that's what happened. And literally, this was kind of when the record was done, I think she told me, she said she could see me going back in time. With each one of these tracks, especially when I was doing the lead vocal, I had to remember what I felt like when I sang it the first time.\"",
      "And what a time it has been. For John Fogerty, the highs and lows have landed him here: at peace with it all, and lucky enough to have his songs still playing.",
      "I asked, \"What's it like for you to hear your music everywhere, even now?\"",
      "\"I don't know the exact right words; I can almost not believe it actually happened, or that that was me,\" he said. \"It's a prideful thing. I think it makes you feel really happy that you are able to tune into the radio station that God delivers, you know, and receive a song like 'Proud Mary,' and write it down, and even take credit for it, right? And then have it go around the world like that? It's kind of too much to really be able to grab hold of.\"",

    "summary": "A master of figurative art is now focused on the work of other artists, gifting a collection of more than 100 paintings by emerging and established artists to Maine's Portland Museum of Art.",
    "story": [
      "When Alex Katz began painting more than 75 years ago, he ignored what was popular then, to pursue his passion: figurative art. \"Most people didn't like my work,\" he said. \"It was figurative, and everyone was abstract, and everything was pop art. But a lotta people didn't like it.\"",
      "But he says he didn't care that much what they thought: \"If they liked it, swell. And if they didn't like it, go to hell.\"",
      "Katz depicts recognizable figures and objects from the real world. Using unfussy backgrounds and large areas of color, he emphasizes shapes and outlines, and paints massive pieces, often with his wife, Ada, as his subject. \"I did the figures on a flat ground,\" he said. \"I did the double portraits of Ada. I did the big heads before anyone. And that's really aggressive. And the big compositions. No one had done anything like it.\"",
      "Katz grew up in Queens, New York, and attended the Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture in Maine. He's been honing his technique ever since.",
      "In 1986, \"Sunday Morning\" documented his artistic process:",
      "These days, the art world has caught up to Alex Katz's talent. His paintings can sell for millions of dollars, and exhibitions around the world have highlighted his work, including a show in 2022 at New York's Guggenheim Museum.",
      "Now famed for his portraits, Katz is also highly-regarded for his landscapes, often inspired by the picturesque scenes near his summer studio in Maine. \"It's a long way from Queens,\" he said, \"but it is like Queens. It's all kinda small!\"",
      "Katz says painting the outdoors heightened his creativity: \"I thought I was connecting with outdoor painting, but actually I was connecting with myself,\" he said. \"The painting was no longer cerebral. It was coming from the inside.\"",
      "This summer, Katz turned 98, and after a lifetime painting, he's focused on the work of other artists. He gifted a collection of more than a hundred paintings by emerging and established artists to Maine's Portland Museum of Art.",
      "\"As the art world has moved in different ways and fashions, Alex has always stayed true to his self,\" said museum director Mark Bessire. \"I see his love of artists taking chance and his love of artists emanating that sense of energy that he likes in a painting. He doesn't like a painting because it looks like his or it's figurative. He likes it 'cause it's got the energy, and it pops.\"",
      "The exhibit is called \"Painting Energy.\"",
      "Asked to describe the sensation of looking at some of those paintings, Katz replied, \"It's just like a pow! You get it right through the air. It's very quick. Sometimes you can get a whole show \u2013 as they open the elevator door, blink, and they shut it, you know what this painting's about.\"",
      "One painting that gave Katz that \"pow\" was Katherine Bradford's \"Shadows.\"",
      "Bradford said that when she learned Katz had bought one of her paintings, \"I just felt, 'Oh, wow! Maybe I am a little good!' And Alex Katz, he certainly is really good. Good eye, good person.\"",
      "Bradford didn't start painting until her 30s. Now she's 83, and her pieces typically sell for tens of thousands of dollars. \"Alex Katz is a leader in contemporary art,\" she said. \"But in the state of Maine, he's king. And we all look up to him. He decided to use what he had gained to give back to artists, to buy artists' work.\"",
      "Asked why he wanted to collect other artists' paintings, Katz said, \"Well, I wanted to help other people who went through the same difficulty that I did, you know? I know every little help I got in that period from 25-35, I really appreciated.\"",
      "Like when a paint manufacturer who recognized Katz's talent early on gave him art supplies as part of a deal: \"He got five or six little paintings, and I had free paints,\" said Katz. \"But the big thing was someone believed there was something in me.\"",
      "Katz still works seven days a week, and is still taking risks. \"Sometime, in about a week, I'll do the first painting of a new series,\" he said.",
      "\"And you seem excited about that?\" I asked.",
      "\"Excited and frightened,\" he laughed. \"Yeah, I'm scared it really won't work out.\"",
      "\"So, after all that you've accomplished, you still worry?\"",
      "\"Uh-huh. I want to go where I'm scared. And the new things might be better, they might be worse, but I have to do 'em.\"",

      "She chose September, that most excellent month, to make her move. The monsoon had receded, leaving Kerala gleaming like an emerald strip between the mountains and the sea. As the plane banked to land, and the earth rose to greet us, I couldn't believe that topography could cause such palpable, physical pain. I had never known that beloved landscape, never imagined it, never evoked it, without her being part of it. I couldn't think of those hills and trees, the green rivers, the shrinking, cemented-over rice fields with giant billboards rising out of them advertising awful wedding saris and even worse jewelry, without thinking of her. She was woven through it all, taller in my mind than any billboard, more perilous than any river in spate, more relentless than the rain, more present than the sea itself. How could this have happened? How? She checked out with no advance notice. Typically unpredictable.",
      "The church didn't want her. She didn't want the church. (There was savage history there, nothing to do with God.) So given her standing in our town, and given our town, we had to fashion a fitting funeral for her. The local papers reported her passing on their front pages, most national papers mentioned it, too. The internet lit up with an outpouring of love from generations of students who had studied in the school she founded, whose lives she had transformed, and from others who knew of the legendary legal battle she had waged and won for equal inheritance rights for Christian women in Kerala. The deluge of obituaries made it even more crucial that we do the right thing and send her on the way she deserved. But what was that right thing? Fortunately, on the day she died the school was closed and the children had gone home. The campus was ours. It was a huge relief. Perhaps she had planned that, too.",
      "Conversations about her death and its consequences for us, especially me, had begun when I was three years old. She was thirty then, debilitated by asthma, dead broke (her only asset was a bachelor's degree in education), and she had just walked out on her husband\u2014my father, I should say, although somehow that comes out sounding strange. She was almost eighty-nine when she died, so we had sixty years to discuss her imminent death and her latest will and testament, which, given her preoccupation with inheritance and wills, she rewrote almost every other week. The number of false alarms, close shaves, and great escapes that she racked up would have given Houdini pause for thought. They lulled us into a sort of catastrophe complacency. I truly believed she would outlive me. When she didn't, I was wrecked, heart-smashed. I am puzzled and more than a little ashamed by the intensity of my response.",

Our seventeenth-century lit class has only about thirty people, but Modern Furniture is held in an auditorium with cushioned seats set on a steep slope down to the professor at his podium. Behind him is a big screen that flashes pictures of Corbusier's B 306 chaise longue and Bauhaus nesting tables. I catch up on a lot of sleep in that class.",

      "The cover depicted Carpenter kneeling on the ground. An individual is standing next to her with Carpenter's hand on the person's thigh as they're pulling her hair.",
      "She said her intention was to keep the cover open to interpretation.",
      "\"My interpretation is being in on the control. Being in on your lack of control and when you want to be in control,\" Carpenter said. \"I think as a young woman, you're just as aware of when you're in control as when you're not.\"",
      "She explained the album for her was about \"the humanity of allowing yourself to make those mistakes.\"",
      "Carpenter said she tries to take the critical comments lightly.",
      "\"My fans that know me and know the person behind the music will look at that photo and they know exactly what it is. People that have no idea who I am absolutely look at that photo and go, like, 'where are her parents?'\"",

I was 8 years old on the school bus, and I was \u2026 just like my life was changed.\"",

      "In his new book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life\" (published September 2 by Simon & Schuster), Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon and chief medical correspondent for CNN, writes about chronic pain, and the innovative techniques now being used to study and treat it.",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Over a hundred years ago, William Osler, the Canadian physician and founding influence on modern medicine and medical education, is said to have instructed his students to \"listen to the patient. Quite often he is telling you the diagnosis.\"",
      "Today, the urgent search for meaningful insights into chronic pain has given that idea a new relevance, with impressive results. Health care providers now encourage patients to engage as partners in the treatment process. Research programs now routinely include people with lived experience\u2014patients, family members, caregivers\u2014as members of committees that advise and direct pain studies.",
      "Pain scientists are calling for a dramatic change that puts greater emphasis on the studies that draw first from people's real-life pain experience, then follows up with lab-based research to develop targeted solutions for effective pain management. This reverse translational research flips the classic bench-to-bedside process that starts in a laboratory and ends with a clinical trial.",
      "Reverse translational research begins with the patient's real-world experience and then tries to decipher the mechanisms through brain imaging and blood tests, correlated with the patient's symptoms and self-reports. Instead of the bench to the bedside, which was taught when I was in medical school, this is bedside to the bench research. The bench scientists then work with the findings to learn more about the basic mechanisms.",
      "Prasad Shirvalkar, a pain physician, neuroscientist, and the director of the Shirvalkar Lab at the University of California at San Francisco, used such a hybrid approach a couple of years ago to find the unicorn in pain science: objective biomarkers of a subjective experience. He started by implanting electrodes in the brains of patients, to measure brain signals. He then followed the trial participants home and, with the use of continuous surveys and digital monitoring, tracked their pain through everyday life and correlated those results with direct readings from the brain. The combination of lab-based and home-based monitoring led to a groundbreaking series of clinical trials that made headlines around the world. In 2023, his team was able to directly map signals of chronic pain for the first time in history. In more recent trials, the team used electrodes implanted in the brain to map the unique neural signature of each participant's pain experience over thousands of hours. The result was the ability, for the first time, to create an objective measure of an individual patient's subjective pain experiences.",
      "In a more recent and ongoing trial, the maps and electrodes were used to predict a pain burst, which was followed by the delivery of a carefully calibrated electrical impulse\u2014deep brain stimulation (DBS) to interrupt the pain, reducing or even eliminating it altogether. Predicting when pain might occur, objectively measuring its severity, and then quickly inhibiting it is in many ways the ultimate achievement.",
      "Ed Mowery's story is about someone using this remarkable treatment approach, but first a caveat. It's not currently available, or even feasible, for general use, so it can't deliver on the dream of a cure for chronic pain. But it does deliver evidence that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and malleable. It can be targeted and treated, and we'll likely see the emergence of a range of approaches that can do so without brain surgery.",

    "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 09:56:57 -0400",
    "summary": "Jane Pauley talks with the author of \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt\" about the body's defenses against pain; and with Ed Mowery, whose decades-long experience with pain led to a revolutionary surgery and treatment.",
    "story": [
      "Ed Mowery, the founder and lead singer of a death metal band, suffered unfathomable pain for decades: \"It was 24/7, 365,\" he said, likening it to \"lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and nerve pain in my arms.",
      "\"Have you ever had a really bad burn when you're cooking? Imagine that really bad burn, multiply it by, say, 20 to 30, and then apply it from the neck down. And on top of that burn was the lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and the crazy nerve burn in my arms. So, it was several different kinds of pain at once.\"",
      "It's a rare condition affecting 200,000 people in the U.S., called complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS. But doctors could find no cause for it.",
      "\"There was nothing to point to and says, 'This is why it's hurting.' It was just a sort of unrelenting pain,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, best known as chief medical correspondent at CNN. A neurosurgeon and author, his latest book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt,\" explores the mystery of pain \u2013 mundane aches and pains, or excruciating pain like Mowery suffered.",
      "A lot of Americans are hurting; the CDC says approximately 20% are in pain. And while writing the book, Gupta found one of them was his mother \u2013 83-year-old Damyanti Gupta, who had a fall right outside her front door.",
      "\"I had osteoporosis,\" she said, \"and I think one of my bones must have given up, I think, because I didn't trip over anything.\"",
      "Imaging showed a compressed lumbar vertebra. But pain doesn't appear on X-rays and MRIs.\u00a0 \"You know how they ask you, doctors tell me, 'From a scale of one to 10, what is your pain?' I would've said 100,\" Damyanti said. \"You don't really realize 'til you have it. I never realized that pain can be that terrible. You don't want to even live anymore.\"",
      "\"I don't want to live anymore \u2013 coming from my mom, obviously it's really painful to hear,\" said Dr. Gupta. \"But also this was someone who'd never complained about anything. So, you had a sense of just how significant an impact this was on her.\"",
      "Spinal surgery successfully repaired the injured spine, and immediately Damyanti's pain went from 100 to about 3.",
      "The surprising source of pain",
      "As a brain surgeon, Gupta sees patients in pain every day, but he personally experienced serious pain when he was a kid who thought he could vault over a spiked fence. \"I don't know what I was thinking,\" he said. \"But I didn't make it. And this spike from the fence went right through the back of my skin on the side, and came right out the front. So, I was essentially pinned and impaled on top of this fence.\"",
      "As the shock wore off, the future doctor \u2013 still on the fence \u2013 took note: \"The pain started to come in waves. So it was there, felt like someone was sort of slapping my back, but then after a while it just didn't hurt that much anymore. And there was a couple of times when I had to reach back around and say, 'It's still there, right?' Even at the time, that struck me as a really surprising experience. Like, I had a hot poker thing going through my back, and yet I'm not feeling pain? Like, why would that be?\"",
      "Later, he learned the reason why. \"It took years to sort of understand this,\" he said. \"My body's endogenous opioid system \u2013 we have our own opioid system \u2013 it reacted, and it reacted in a big, big way. Because the body is just flooded with all these opioids and it improves my mood, it decreases my memory of the painful experience, and obviously it helps with the overall hurt.",
      "\"These are endorphins, and by the way, endorphins \u2013 endo, which means comes from your body, and phin, morphine\u2014so it's like your body's own natural morphine,\" he said.",
      "After years of suffering despite pain medication (including morphine), Ed Mowery joined a clinical trial at the University of California at San Francisco, which not only found the source of those \"lightning bolt razor snakes,\" but would make headlines around the world.",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "The source of the pain, said Gupta, was \"the brain. It's hard to conceptualize, I realize this. But Ed is sort of this daredevil guy. He had a lot of injuries over his life. He had had a knee operation, and it was after that knee operation that, for some reason, his brain had taken the experience of his knee surgery and started to memorize it, and got it a little bit wrong. So instead of saying, 'Hey, your knee hurts,' it just went into this hyper-drive. The best metaphor would be something known as 'phantom pain.' That's when someone loses a limb and then they still hurt, even though that limb doesn't even exist anymore. How can that happen? The brain. The brain is creating that pain. Why that's happening exactly, we're not sure.\"",
      "\"Shutting off\" the pain",
      "Mowery had volunteered for a study in deep brain stimulation and pain, and three rounds of brain surgery. \"I had nodes sticking out of my head,\" Mowery said. \"And I had 144 wires going to two computers. And I had a turban on my head. And I also had a lot more hair!\"",
      "Gupta said, \"After weeks they were able to draw this link between Ed's pain and these changes in the brain. And what they found with Ed was not only could they start to predict that Ed was gonna have pain, they could quantify how bad that pain was likely to be, and they could even interrupt the pain by giving a little stimulation. So even before the pain would get to conscious awareness, the stimulator would go off and it would start to interrupt that pain cycle.\"",
      "Gupta predicts Mowery's story is just the beginning: \"What these doctors were able to do, they were essentially able to put these probes all over the brain and just leave these probes in sort of to listen to Ed's brain.\"",
      "Even now, a computer can recognize his pain coming on \u2013 and shut it off.",
      "It's been life-changing for Mowery, who spoke about the clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health: \"The last two days of testing, the signal started working, and killing my pain,\" he said. \"I was beside myself.\"",
      "Though a small study, the implications for managing all sorts of pain are far-reaching. \u00a0As Gupta explains, the brain is the source of every sensation of pain, from a paper cut, to a broken vertebra, to \"razor snakes.\"",
      "I asked Mowery, \"Did you know when you signed up for this, what you were signing up for?\"",
      "\"It's funny you ask that question, because when I first found out, I said, 'There's no way. I'm not doing three brain surgeries. You're not going into my brain. No way,\" Mowery said. \"And then a year-and-a-half later, I was in so much pain, I just didn't care anymore.\"",
      "\"You seem very comfortable when you describe this as your brain,\" I said.",
      "\"It took me a while to wrap my brain around the fact that this is a brain disease,\" Mowery replied. \"It took a long time for me to just say, oh, you know, this is actually all in my head. But it wasn't imaginary. It was real.\"",
      "Today, Mowery is playing his music again, and looking forward to touring internationally with his band. \"I never lost hope,\" he said, \"because I knew something would come along to help me. And I think that's part of what got me through all this, was my attitude towards the whole thing.\"",

      "A new study released Friday found that young children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, are often prescribed medication too quickly.",
      "The study, led by Stanford Medicine and published in JAMA Network Open, examined the health records of nearly 10,000 preschool-aged children ages 3 to 5 between 2016 and 2023 who were diagnosed with ADHD.",
      "\"ADHD is a disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or what we call hyperactivity, which is sort of like kids that have a hard time sitting still, they have a lot of energy,\" explained Jamie Howard, a senior clinical psychologist with the Child Mind Institute, which specializes in treating anxiety and mood disorders in children.",
      "Howard, who was not involved in the study, said that when treating ADHD in young children, clinical guidelines call for starting with \"behavioral intervention.\"",
      "\"We always want to start with the lowest possible harm,\" Howard said. \"It does very little harm doing a behavioral intervention.\"",
      "The Stanford study found that about 68% of those children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed medications before age 7, most often stimulants such as Ritalin, which can help children focus their attention and regulate their emotions.",
      "The turn to medication often came quickly, according to the study. About 42% of the children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis, the study found.",
      "\"We don't have concerns about the toxicity of the medications for 4- and 5-year-olds, but we do know that there is a high likelihood of treatment failure, because many families decide the side effects outweigh the benefits,\" Dr. Yair Bannett, assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and the lead author of the study, said in a statement.",
      "Those side effects can include irritability, aggressiveness and emotional problems, according to Bannett.",
      "\"The high rate of medication prescriptions among preschool-age children with ADHD and the lack of delay between initial diagnosis and prescription require further investigation to assess the appropriateness of early medication treatment,\" the researchers concluded.",
      "The study also found that the vast majority of the young children diagnosed with ADHD, about 76%, were boys.",
      "\"I think that people have an association with ADHD and stimulant medication,\" Howard said. \"...But there is actually a lot more than that.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on the Department of Health and Human Services Thursday to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting next month amid a slew of departures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\"If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,\" Cassidy said in a statement.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her ouster.",
      "Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials resigned Wednesday, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things.",
      "The\u00a0agenda\u00a0for the Sept. 18 vaccine advisory committee meeting is set to include discussions of vaccines for COVID-19, Hepatitis B, RSV and the MMRV measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and could entail scheduling votes on recommendations for these vaccines.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he wouldn't comment on personnel issues in an appearance on Fox News Thursday, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "In June, Kennedy said he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the CDC's vaccine recommendations. Kennedy replaced the committee members with eight of his own picks.",
      "Cassidy's call to postpone the vaccine meeting is the second he's made under Kennedy's leadership \u2014 after he did the same in June\u00a0\u2014 and represents a break with the HHS secretary. In February, Kennedy's confirmation to the post came only after Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee. The Louisiana Republican, a medical doctor, had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration. He later said Kennedy and the administration had agreed that he would speak with the secretary multiple times a month, and the pair \"would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship.\"",
      "In his statement Thursday, Cassidy said allegations have been made about the vaccine meeting \"agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed.\"",
      "\"These decisions directly impact children's health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted,\" the Louisiana senator said.",
      "Cassidy said in a post on X after news of the CDC departures Wednesday that the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "Ranking Member Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Cassidy Thursday calling for a bipartisan investigation into Monarez's firing. The Vermont senator also urged the chairman to hold a hearing with Kennedy, Monarez and the CDC leaders who stepped down.",
      "\"The American people should hear directly from Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Monarez and every member of our committee should be able to ask questions and get honest answers from them,\" Sanders said.",

      "Wintour, who is widely considered to be the most powerful figure in the fashion industry,\u00a0announced in June she was taking a step back from her editorial duties. The 75-year-old has served as the magazine's editor-in-chief since 1988.",
      "Malle may be stepping into Wintour's low-heeled slingbacks, but she'll report to the original wearer while taking over day-to-day operations at the U.S. edition. In Vogue's online post, Wintour said she is excited to continue working with Malle as \"her mentor but also as her student.\"",

    "summary": "Courts weigh fairness of reimbursement formula as Arkansas jury finds against State Farm.",
    "story": [
      "An Arkansas jury found recently that a major car insurance carrier had shortchanged customers who had been in accidents that left their cars \"totaled,\" and now plaintiffs in other states are pursuing similar cases.",
      "The Arkansas lead plaintiff, Rose Chadwick, said she initially assumed the reimbursement for her \"totaled\" 2011 Hyundai was reasonable compensation, \"because that's what I pay them for, is to be fair with me.\"",
      "But after learning about potential legal action challenging the way insurance carrier State Farm calculated the replacement cost, she decided to bring her case to court. Her lawyers alleged that the company used technology to estimate the amount of buying a replacement. That program factored into the calculation the potential for the car buyer to negotiate a discount from used car dealers \u2014 a haggling discount that Chadwick's attorneys argued was no longer consistent with how modern-day used cars are priced and sold.",
      "\"The computer program that State Farm used to calculate the replacement value of the car, did it systematically unfairly,\" said Chadwick's attorney, Brian Glasser. Glasser says his firm argued that commonly used software systematically low-balled the value of total-loss cars for tens of thousands of drivers across the country.",
      "In an Arkansas federal court in June, a jury agreed \u2014 finding in favor of Chadwick and 37,000 other plaintiffs. The jury determined Chadwick had been underpaid by about $600 for a car worth $4,700.",
      "State Farm is fighting lawsuits on the issue in multiple states, arguing that the system the company used at the time was standard for most automobile insurers. It no longer uses the same program to calculate reimbursement amounts.",
      "\"State Farm always seeks to pay what we owe within the terms of the policy to help our customers recover from a loss,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"We work with the policyholder to determine the actual cash value of a total loss vehicle considering the age, condition, equipment, mileage of the vehicle at the time of the loss,\" the company said, adding that customers are \"also invited to share additional information and has the option to use a third-party appraisal to help reach agreement on the value of their totaled vehicle.\"",
      "A \"totaled\" car is typically one that has sustained damage that would cost more to repair than the value of the car itself.",
      "Company officials noted that appellate courts in multiple jurisdictions have agreed with their contention that a challenge to the reimbursement process cannot be made en masse, in the form of a class action lawsuit, as it was in Arkansas. The courts have split over whether each reimbursement case is unique, and must be filed separately, or whether all customers whose loss was calculated the same way can file suit together as a class.",
      "Chadwick's case began five years ago, when her daughter borrowed her car for an early morning run to the store when she was struck from behind while going through an intersection.",
      "After learning of the reimbursement issue in a social media post, Chadwick became the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit against the insurance giant accusing it of undervaluing and shorting payouts on claims like hers.",
      "\"State Farm moves billions of dollars to people for their broken cars every year and, and insurance companies around America do similar numbers,\" Glasser said. \"So we're talking about these computer programs that calculate the value of your replacement vehicle that affect billions of dollars every year.\"",
      "Attorneys are launching similar cases against several insurance carriers in at least 19 states while regulators in some of those states weigh whether insurers must change how they value total loss cars.",
      "State Farm said customers are not without recourse if they have questions about the estimate the company provides to reimburse a customer whose car was a total loss. Among them, customers are encouraged to ask their insurer how they determined the payout amount, to an agreeable price, and to get an independent appraisal of what the car was worth.",
      "In the end, Chadwick said the dispute was less about the money than about principles.",
      "\"It was like hiding something and you shouldn't hide,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Kraft Heinz is splitting into two companies a decade after they joined in a massive merger that created one of the biggest food conglomerates on the planet.",
      "One of the companies, currently called Global Taste Elevation Co., will include shelf-stable meals and include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, Kraft Heinz said Tuesday. The other, currently called North American Grocery Co.,  will include brands such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The names of the two companies will be released later.",
      "Kraft Heinz said in May that it was conducting a strategic review of the company, signaling a potential split.",
      "The company's board \"unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into two independent, publicly traded companies through a tax-free spin-off,\" Kraft Heinz said.",
      "In 2015, when they merged, the company wanted to capitalize on its massive scale, but shifting tastes complicated those plans, with households seeking to introduce healthier options at the table. Kraft Heinz and other food producers have shifted offerings to follow that trend.",
      "\"Kraft Heinz's brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\" Kraft Heinz Executive Chair Miguel Patricio said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz CEO  Carlos Abrams-Rivera said, \"This move will unleash the power of our brands and unlock the potential of our business. This next step in our transformation is only possible because of the commitment of our 36,000 talented employees who deliver quality and value for consumers every day. We will continue to operate as 'one Kraft Heinz' throughout the separation process.\"",
      "The path to the merger of Kraft and Heinz began in 2013, when billionaire investor Warren Buffett teamed up with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz Co. At the time, the $23 billion deal was the most expensive ever in the food industry.",
      "3G was also behind the formation of Restaurant Brands International \u2014 a merger of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes \u2014 and Anheuser-Busch InBev. It's known for strict cost controls and so-called zero-based budgeting, which requires all expenses to be justified each quarter.",
      "The deal was intended to help Heinz, which was founded in 1869 in Pittsburgh, expand sales of its condiments and sauces on grocery store shelves. Heinz's new owners also set about cutting costs, laying off hundreds of workers within months.",
      "At the same time Kraft, based in Chicago, sought a partner after a 2011 split from its snack division, which became Mondelez International.",
      "In 2015, Buffett and 3G decided to merge Heinz with Kraft. The merger created the 5th largest food and beverage company in the world, with annual revenue of $28 billion. Buffett and 3G each contributed $5 billion for a special dividend for Kraft shareholders.",
      "But the combined company struggled, despite layoffs of thousands of employees and other cost-cutting measures. Even at the time of the merger, many consumers were shifting away from the kinds of highly processed packaged foods that Kraft sells, like Velveeta cheese and Kool-Aid.",
      "Kraft Heinz also had trouble distinguishing its products from cheaper store brands. At Walmart, a 14-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup costs $2.98; the same size bottle of Walmart's Great Value brand is 98 cents.",
      "In 2019, Kraft Heinz slashed the value of its Oscar Meyer and Kraft brands by $15.4 billion, citing operational costs and supply chain problems. But many investors blamed the company's leadership, saying its zeal for cost-cutting was hurting brand innovation.",
      "In 2021, Kraft Heinz sold both its Planters nut business and its natural cheese business, vowing to reinvest the money into higher-growth brands like P3 protein snacks and Lunchables.",
      "But the company's net revenue has fallen every year since 2020, when it saw a pandemic-related bump in sales. In April, Kraft Heinz lowered its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing weaker customer spending in the U.S. and the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Carlos Abrams-Rivera will continue to serve as CEO of Kraft Heinz and will become CEO of North American Grocery Co. once the separation is complete. Kraft Heinz said its board is working with an executive search firm to identify potential CEO candidates for Global Taste Elevation Co.",
      "Kraft Heinz says it has no plans to change its current headquarter locations in Chicago and Pittsburgh. It currently expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2026.",

    "summary": "The number of immigrant workers has declined from January through the end of July, preliminary Census data shows.",
    "story": [
      "As millions of Americans gather Monday to celebrate Labor Day, federal data shows how President Trump's immigration policies are reshaping the U.S. workforce.",
      "The number of immigrant workers in the U.S. has declined by 1.2 million from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data, analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That figure includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "The labor market shakeup comes as the flow of immigrants into the U.S. has slowed significantly under Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on \"dangerous criminals,\" but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.",
      "The overall number of people in the U.S. illegally peaked at an estimated 14 million in 2023, according to a Pew Research Center\u00a0estimate. However, the number of unauthorized immigrants has likely declined since then \"due in part to increased deportations and reduced protections under the Trump administration,\" the authors of the Pew Research Center report said.",
      "In an Aug. 28 report, Oxford Economics projects the slowdown will persist through Mr. Trump's presidency, with net immigration falling to an annualized 500,000 by year-end and holding at that level until 2028.",
      "Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce, and data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.",
      "\"It's unclear how much of the decline we've seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,\" Kramer said. \"However, we don't believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn't real.\"",
      "To be sure, the loss of immigrant workers reflects a small share of the overall U.S. labor force of more than 171 million workers. But the decline could affect states and sectors that are more dependent on foreign workers, economists say.",
      "Potential implications for the labor market",
      "Immigrants play a key role in alleviating labor shortages, as the majority tend to be ages 25 to 54, Oxford Economics noted. Economists call that demographic \"prime working age\" because they tend to be in their most productive decades of work.",
      "Immigrants are also more willing to migrate to states with higher labor demand.",
      "\"This is critical to ease shortages in regional labor markets, especially as U.S. labor mobility has steadily declined since the 1980s,\" Oxford Economics researchers noted.",
      "However, states with large shares of undocumented residents \u2014 namely Louisiana, Florida and New York \u2014 are starting to see some of the biggest declines in unauthorized migration, the report says.",
      "Experts say the drop in workforce participation could ripple through the labor market, which is already under some strain as employers pull back on hiring. The average monthly payroll gain from May to July was only 35,000, down from an average of 123,000 from for the first four months of the year.",
      "\"The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that's where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,\" said Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \"That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.\"",
      "Immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S., according to Orrenius.",
      "The plunge in unauthorized immigration may also give the impression that the labor force is tighter than it actually is due to the higher ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers, Oxford Economics said. That could muddy the picture of what's going on in the labor market, the authors say.",
      "\"The Fed is highly sensitive to the downside risks to the labor market, but the immigration reversal will continue to complicate the signals from the labor market data,\" they write.",
      "ICE raids take a toll on farms",
      "Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won't be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.",
      "Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.",
      "\"In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,\" she said.",
      "In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).",
      "Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.",
      "Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.",
      "\"People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,\" Tate said.",
      "Lidia, a farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.",
      "\"I don't know if I'll be able to bring my kids,\" said Lidia. \"I'm also very concerned I'd have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.\"",
      "Construction sites in and around McAllen also \"are completely dead,\" Rodriguez said.",
      "\"We have a large labor force that is undocumented,\" she said. \"We've seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.\"",
      "Construction jobs",
      "The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.",
      "\"Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,\" said Ken Simonson, the association's chief economist. \"But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn't disrupting labor supplies.\"",
      "This may just be the tip of the iceberg: The Oxford report authors say that the increase in funding for immigration enforcement from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could eventually lead to an \"even higher sustained rate of deportations.\"",
      "Kramer, with Pew, warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.",
      "The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local's president.",
      "\"What's going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?\" De La Cruz said. \"What happens when immigrants aren't in the field to pick our crops? Who's going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?\"",

      "Six of the seven judges who ruled against the tariffs are appointees of Democratic presidents, while the seventh is an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush. Of the four judges who dissented, two were appointed by former President Obama and two by former President George W. Bush.",
      "Here's what could happen next as the legal case proceeds.",
      "How did the dispute arise?",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a months-long legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses, which are arguing that the president has exceeded his authority in issuing the import duties.",
      "The appeals court's decision is focused on the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in April on most trading partners, along with earlier levies on China, Mexico and Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 \u2014 or Liberation Day, he called it \u2014 imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else.",
      "The president later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S. \u2014 and reduce their barriers to American exports. Some of them did \u2014 including the U.K., Japan and the EU \u2014 and agreed to deals with Mr. Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.",
      "Countries that didn't comply faced higher tariffs earlier this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Mr. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.",
      "What is the IEEPA?",
      "Mr. Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, by declaring longstanding U.S. trade deficits \"a national emergency.\"",
      "In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that illegal immigration and drug trafficking amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Mr. Trump has made the most of it.",
      "Does the ruling apply to all tariffs?",
      "No, the court's ruling doesn't cover all of Mr. Trump tariffs. For instance, his levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos were imposed under a different regulation after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.",
      "Nor does it include tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on China in his first term \u2014 and President Biden kept \u2014 after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.",
      "In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump's Liberation Day tariffs \"exceed any authority granted to the President'' under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "On Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that \"it seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.\"",
      "What happens next?",
      "The president vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote on his social media platform on Friday.",
      "A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday's ruling clears a possible legal path for Mr. Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \"is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court's decisions,\" which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.",
      "The government has argued that if Mr. Trump's tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.",
      "Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, such as American manufacturers or retailers that rely on foreign-made products. While the U.S. companies typically swallow some of the cost, they pass on much of the added expenses to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "The Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \"financial ruin\" for the U.S.",
      "It could also put Mr. Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.",
      "\"While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments or even seek to renegotiate terms,\" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.",
      "Does the Trump administration have other options?",
      "Mr. Trump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.",
      "For instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Mr. Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits.",
      "The administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority \u2014 Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \u2014 as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and automobiles. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot be imposed at the president's sole discretion.",
      "\"Even if the tariffs are struck down, we believe the Trump administration will look for new ways to tax imports or otherwise raise revenue from companies selling into the U.S.,\" noted Green of the deVere Group.",

      "Artificial intelligence programs like ChatGPT use AI to do thinking or writing or creating for you. Pretty amazing, but also a little terrifying. What happens to the people who used to do those jobs?",
      "Olivia Fair graduated four years ago. \"I've applied to probably over a hundred jobs in the past, I don't know, six months,\" she said. \"And yeah, none of them are landing.\"",
      "She's had a series of short-term jobs - one was in TV production, transcribing interviews. \"But now they don't have a bunch of people transcribing,\" she said. \"They have maybe one person overseeing all of that, and AI doing the rest. Which I think is true for a lot of entry-level positions. And it can be a very useful tool for those people doing that work. But then there's less people needed.\"",
      "According to Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at Indeed, the job-listings website, job postings have declined year over year by 6.7 percent. \"This is a tough year,\" she said. \"Younger job seekers, specifically those who are recent grads, are having a harder time finding work.\"",
      "Asked if there is a correlation between the rise in AI and the decline in jobs for recent graduates, Ullrich said, \"I think there is a cause-and-effect, but it's maybe not as significant as a lot of people would think. If you look specifically at tech jobs, job postings are down 36% compared to pre-pandemic numbers. But that decline started happening prior to AI becoming commonly used.\"",
      "Ullrich said in 2021-22, as the effects of the COVID pandemic began to ebb, there was a hiring boom in some sectors, including tech: \"Quite frankly, I think some companies overhired,\" she said.",
      "The uncertain national situation (tariffs, taxes, foreign policy) doesn't help, either. Ullrich said, \"Some other people have used the analogy of, like, driving through fog. If it's foggy, you slow down a bit. But if it's really foggy, you pull over. And unfortunately, some companies have pulled over to sit and wait to see what is gonna happen.\"",

You know, how do I care for this patient, or land this plane, or remodel this building? And it's possible that we could strip out so much of the supporting work, that people never get the expertise. I don't think it's an insurmountable concern. But we shouldn't take for granted that it will solve itself.\"",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court said many of the tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible, but didn't halt them.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Friday that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible.",
      "The ruling will not immediately block the tariffs, but it marks a significant blow to Mr. Trump's signature trade strategy.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court decision that found many of Mr. Trump's tariffs on foreign goods exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws. However, the appellate judges vacated the lower court's injunction blocking the tariffs altogether, directing the court to reevaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.",
      "The ruling applies to a series of April executive orders that imposed 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also applies to a separate set of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China to pressure those three countries to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized immigration.",
      "The court's\u00a0ruling\u00a0will not take effect until October to give the Trump administration a chance to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case.",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post on Friday, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "\"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal the ruling, which she said \"undermines the United States on the world stage\" and is \"interfering with the President's vital and constitutionally central role in foreign policy.\"",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a monthslong legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses. Mr. Trump has legally justified his sweeping import taxes by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly mention tariffs.",
      "The appeals court said the provision of IEEPA that mentions regulating imports does not give the president the right to impose unlimited tariffs. It called the right to levy tariffs \"a core Congressional power,\" and noted that past presidents have typically used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not tariffs.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote late Friday afternoon. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "A lower court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or USCIT, issued a similar ruling that found the tariffs illegal in May and ordered Mr. Trump's import duties to be frozen. That ruling was stayed by the appeals court so it could review the case.",
      "While the appellate court affirmed USCIT's ruling on the merits of the tariffs, it said the lower court needs to take a second look at whether a universal injunction freezing the tariffs across the board is appropriate. It pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling in a birthright citizenship case earlier this year that limited the use of universal injunctions.",
      "Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office. He unveiled massive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against dozens of trading partners on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, before quickly halting most of those duties to give his administration time to negotiate new trade agreements. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new slate of tariffs against more than 60 countries, in some cases striking deals with certain trading partners that lowered their tariff rates \u2014 but still left them with higher duties than before \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump argues that steeper tariffs are necessary to correct what he views as unfair trade practices and revive American manufacturing. He has also used tariffs to pressure China on fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, Brazil on its prosecution of a Trump-aligned former president, and India on its trade relationship with Russia.",
      "But critics \u2014 and many economists \u2014 warn that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Some of Mr. Trump's early trade moves rattled financial markets, though major stock indices have rebounded since April's \"Liberation Day\" dive.",
      "Critics also argue that the tariffs exceed Mr. Trump's legal authority. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs rely on legal theories that have long been championed by conservative judges. Those include the \"major questions doctrine,\" which holds that Congress needs to give a federal agency clear authorization to decide issues of major political or economic significance.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-de-minimis-rule-end-online-shopping/",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 19:50:55 -0400",
    "summary": "As of Aug. 29, shipments to the U.S. valued at less than $800 are subject to tariffs, potentially resulting in surprise costs for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The end of the de minimis tax loophole on Friday means that low-cost shipments to the U.S.\u00a0are no longer exempt from import duties, a potential hit to consumers ordering goods from abroad.",
      "Under the prior tax break, parcels containing goods worth less than $800 were not subject to tariffs, making many products from overseas, such as clothing and beauty products, a cheaper alternative to U.S.-made items.",
      "Now, stepped-up duties apply to all online orders entering the U.S. That could lead to higher costs and longer delivery times given that customs agents must now inspect and process the shipments, experts said.",
      "\"This means that, when making e-commerce purchases from your favorite international sites that you didn't have to worry about paying duties on before \u2014 now you have to,\" Rathna Sharad, CEO and co-founder of FlavorCloud, a global logistics platform, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This increases the cost of common consumer goods, and it varies widely by category of product.\"",
      "In her case, Sharad said the cost of the Korean beauty products she likes has already risen about 15%. \"It's a massive change for U.S. consumers, and a big change for brands and retailers because they have to scramble to figure out their pricing strategies and what this means for them.\"",
      "The White House on July 30 announced it would suspend the de minimis treatment, calling it a \"catastrophic loophole\" that provided a pathway for opioids \"as well as other unsafe or below-market products that harm American workers and businesses\" to enter the U.S.",
      "The White house said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that the loophole was exploited by bad actors.",
      "\"Between 2015 and 2024, shipments that entered the United States under de minimis ballooned by over 900%,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"Thanks to President Trump's historic action, the days of criminal exporters and drug traffickers exploiting the de minimis loophole to flood our country with counterfeit goods, lead toys and illicit drugs like fentanyl are over.\"",
      "The International Trade Administration, a federal agency, also cited statements from companies praising the move.",
      "\"The de minimis loophole has long provided an opportunity for some importers & retailers to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. duties,\" Gap said Friday. \"These packages are also typically subject to minimal inspection, raising potential safety concerns for U.S. consumers. Closing this loophole strengthens our nation's supply chain integrity, improves consumer protection, and levels the playing field for all retailers.\"",
      "Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said on a call with reporters on Thursday that ending the exemption would generate up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues, while also creating thousands of jobs.",
      "How much pricier?",
      "According to a recent FlavorCloud\u00a0analysis, a pair of lined slippers made in China and shipped to the U.S. that previously cost $30 when the de minimis exemption was in force will now cost $44.37, an increase of 51%. That figure factors in several U.S.tariffs on imports: a 12.5% levy on slippers; 20% duty on Chinese goods; and a 10% universal tariff on all imports, as well as a $2.62 merchandise processing fee to calculate the new price.",
      "A nutritional supplement from Canada that formerly cost $37 will now run $60.17 with tariffs in effect, FlavorCloud also found. And a stainless steel water bottle from the U.K. that cost $15 when ordered online in the U.S. will see its price rise to $21.81 once tariffs are applied.",
      "Additionally, a chef's knife from Japan that previously sold for $240 online could cost $298.49 after accounting for applicable tariffs, according to the same analysis.",
      "To be sure, some foreign manufacturers could choose to absorb the cost of higher U.S. tariffs \u2014 which are typically paid by importers here at home \u2014 experts said.",
      "\"Because consumers want bargains, many companies may choose to bite the bullet and incur the increased import costs if they could remain competitive,\" said Augustine Lo, a partner at international law firm Dorsey & Whitney, while noting that abolishing the de minimis loophole amounts to a heavy burden on small and midsize businesses.",
      "Indeed, for now tariffs have had relatively little impact on the rate of U.S. inflation, economic data shows, although forecasters note that it can take up to a year for levies to trickle into consumer prices.",
      "Avoiding surprise costs",
      "Shoppers can take certain steps to avoid being hit with surprise costs when ordering goods online from overseas.",
      "First, check a product's country of origin before making a purchase. U.S.-based sellers often ship goods from their warehouses abroad, which could greatly increase the cost of an item now that tariffs are being applied. More specifically, look for tariff surcharges listed as line items on companies' websites, and decide if the extra charges are worth the cost.",
      "For example, if the imports duties on a particular good exceed its value, it may not be worth buying. At minimum, factor in such added costs into your budget while shopping, FlavorCloud recommends.",
      "The bottom line is that the end of the de minimis loophole amounts to a major shift for consumers and businesses alike, according to Sean Henry, CEO and co-founder of Stord, an e-commerce fulfillment platform.",
      "\"It's a large change because over the last decade, de minimis has accounted for such a large portion of online sales,\" Henry told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol processed $65 billion worth of de minimis packages.",
      "\"It was a way to allow international sellers a fast path, with no paperwork or customs duties, into the U.S.,\" Henry said. \"It's like they were in the fast line at the airport and ran right through. Now, all of a sudden, those same packages are being put into general boarding, and it's going to slow everything down.\"",

    "summary": "Spirit Airlines again filed for bankruptcy protection from its debts only months after emerging from Chapter 11.",
    "story": [
      "Budget carrier Spirit Airlines said Friday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection only months after emerging from a Chapter 11 reorganization.",
      "The no-frills airline said it intends to conduct business as normal during the restructuring process, meaning passengers can continue to book trips and use their tickets, credits and loyalty points. The company said its employees and contractors would still be paid.",
      "Spirit CEO Dave Davis said the airline's previous Chapter 11 petition\u00a0focused on reducing debt and raising capital, and since exiting that process in March \"it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future.\"",
      "In a quarterly report issued earlier this month, Spirit Aviation Holdings, the carrier's parent company, said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for running out of money. Spirit cited \"adverse market conditions\" the company faced after its most recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.",
      "That included weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year, and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "Troubles since the pandemic",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",
      "The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \"projected flight volume for 2026,\" the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit has said it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",
      "And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines \u2014 many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings \u2014 Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities.",
      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",
      "Spirit operates 5,013 flights to 88 destinations in the U.S., the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Panama and Colombia, according to travel search engine Skyscanner.net",

    "story": [
      "Inflation continued to run hot in July, underlining the Federal Reserve's dilemma as it looks to lower prices for American consumers while propping up a job market that is starting to wobble.",
      "Prices across the U.S. rose at an annual rate of 2.6% last month, according to personal consumption expenditures data released on Friday. That's the same figure as in June, a sign inflation remains persistent. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, inflation in July actually ticked up to 2.9% from a year ago, up from 2.8% in June.",
      "Read on for a breakdown of Friday's PCE report.",
      "How are consumers faring?",
      "The latest PCE data shows that consumer spending rose 0.5% in July, suggesting that Americans are continuing to open their wallets even in the face of economic uncertainty.",
      "But while people continue to spend, many consumers are increasingly having to make trade-offs on what they spend their money on, Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Consumers are trying to push through \u2014 they're doing the best they can, but they're increasingly under pressure, and therefore they're being more cautious with discretionary outlets,\" he said. \"They travel less. They spend less on restaurants, spend more cautiously on transportation.\"",
      "Such caution can augur a deeper slump given that consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity. The closely watched University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, released Friday, showed that Americans are increasingly concerned about inflation.",
      "Although inflation has cooled significantly since peaking in 2022, it remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% annual target. And consumers continue to feel the pain in the form of higher prices for some groceries as well as rising electricity costs. Another key inflation gauge \u2014 the\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0\u2014 shows that the price of coffee was up 14.8% from a year ago, while beef and egg costs were 15.5% and 16.4%, respectively.",
      "Are tariffs impacting inflation?",
      "Not yet. In a positive sign, the price of goods, which are most susceptible to tariffs than services, cooled slightly in July, the PCE data shows, decreasing 0.1% from the month prior. That suggests tariffs have had a minimal impact on prices so far.",
      "\"It's not showing up in a goods prices, in the government statistics at least,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "\"We continue to expect tariffs to take a growing bite out of growth in real income and real consumer spending,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report.",
      "A critical question facing the economy is whether any tariff-induced inflation amounts to a one-time boost to prices or results in a more prolonged increase. Fed Chair Jerome Powell laid out the scenarios in a\u00a0speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, earlier this month, noting that even if inflation does end up being a \"one-time\" scenario, it will still \"take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-trump-attempt-remove-lisa-cook-federal-governor/",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:28:52 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced earlier this week that he would be removing Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday heard arguments over a bid by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post despite President Trump's efforts to remove her because of allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
      "The two-hour-long hearing before U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb marked the first in-person showdown between Justice Department lawyers and Cook's legal team in the wake of her lawsuit, filed Thursday, challenging Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her from the Fed's Board of Governors.",
      "Cook's lawyers have asked the district court to issue a temporary restraining order finding Mr. Trump's purported termination of her to be unlawful and declaring that she remains a member of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cobb, appointed by former President Joe Biden, did not issue a decision from the bench. Instead, she noted that the case raises \"important questions that may be of first impression\" as it relates to the president's firing of a Fed governor. She repeatedly pointed to the \"unique functions\" of the central bank and the importance \"of this being an independent body that it is not supposed to be responsive to any type of political pressure.\"",
      "Cook was appointed to the post by Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to a full 14-year term set to end in January 2038. She alleges in her lawsuit that Mr. Trump's move violates the Federal Reserve Act, which states that the president can only remove a member of the central bank's Board of Governors \"for cause.\"",
      "In his letter informing Cook that he was terminating her from the Fed Board of Governors earlier this week, Mr. Trump wrote that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited as grounds for her firing a letter Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, appointed to the post by Mr. Trump, accused Cook of claiming two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her principal residence on mortgage documents in 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out the form for her private mortgage, but noted that the alleged action took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor.",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, who argued on Cook's behalf before the court, said her firing rests solely on Pulte's assertion that she may have committed wrongdoing. He said Cook did not receive any notice of the allegations against her or a chance to respond to them, which violated her due process rights. Only 30 minutes elapsed between the time Pulte shared on social media the letter to Bondi alleging Cook engaged in mortgage fraud and Mr. Trump, in his own social media post, said she needed to resign, he said.",
      "\"This allegation of fraud has become the weapon of choice\" for the Trump administration in removing officials, Lowell said, adding that \"cause for the president means she won't go along with an interest rate drop.\"",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and, if allowed to stand, would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history. Her attorneys said that while the \"for cause\" standard is not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, other laws shielding members of independent agencies from being fired without cause require a finding of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb repeatedly pressed Lowell about incorporating the removal protections included in other laws \u2014 inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \u2014\u00a0 into the Federal Reserve Act when that law limits the grounds for removal by the president to \"cause.\" She also asked Lowell to provide the \"best authority\" that supports the court articulating a framework for determining that an official's past conduct can constitute cause for termination.",
      "Cook's lawsuit names Mr. Trump, the Board of Governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as defendants. In a court filing ahead of the hearing, a lawyer for the central bank said it does not intend to offer arguments about Cook's effort to block her removal and reiterated that it would follow any court orders.",
      "Justice Department lawyers defended Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook, writing in a separate filing that \"making facially contradictory statements in financial documents \u2014 whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not \u2014 is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.\"",
      "They argued that federal courts cannot second guess the president's judgment about what constitutes \"cause,\" so Mr. Trump's effort to remove Cook is a matter of his discretion and not subject to judicial review. But the Justice Department added that if some judicial review of Cook's removal is appropriate, it would have to be highly deferential to avoid intruding on the president's constitutional authority over principal officers.",
      "\"Meanwhile, the President has a strong interest in exercising his statutory authority to remove a federal officer for cause, and the public has a strong interest in stable governance at the Federal Reserve \u2014 a stability that would be undercut by the type of pingpong injunctions and stays that have characterized other litigation,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "In questions to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy assistant attorney general, Cobb asked whether the president would have broad discretion to determine what constitutes \"cause,\" given the nature of the Fed Board, and said she was \"uncomfortable\" with the idea that a president could explicitly express a desire to appoint a majority of governors and instruct his administration to \"go dig in\" and find reasons to remove sitting members.",
      "\"What if the stated cause is demonstrably false?\" she asked Roth. \"That's still not anything that anyone can do anything about?\"",
      "Roth said he was not aware of any statements Mr. Trump had made about Cook before Pulte raised the accusations against her and said there was no indication that Cook's removal is for any reason other than the allegations about her mortgage applications. He also noted that Cook has yet to offer any explanation for the representations on the documents.",
      "Cobb, though, also said she had a \"strong reaction\" to the suggestion that Pulte's social media post satisfied due-process protections entitling Cook to receive notice of the accusations and an opportunity to respond.",
      "As to the timing of the alleged misconduct \u2014 Cook entered into the mortgage agreements in 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed Board \u2014 Cobb said that if Cook's removal were reviewable, \"it feels weird that an administration could go back and second guess the determinations of prior administrations and Congress in their advice and consent role.\"",
      "Roth said \"cause\" requires a reason beyond mere policy disagreements that bears on a person's ability and fitness to do the job.",
      "Cook is the latest Democratic appointee targeted for removal by the president as Mr. Trump seeks to stretch the bounds of executive authority. Since he returned to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has moved to oust members of various independent agencies tapped by his predecessor, including officials at the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Labor Relations Authority, among others.",
      "Many of his attempted firings have sparked legal battles, and the Supreme Court in some of those cases has allowed the removals to take effect while litigation continues. But in one of those challenges, brought by terminated members of the NLRB and MSPB, the high court suggested that the Fed is different from those other agencies.",
      "The Supreme Court called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",

    "story": [
      "The Personal Consumption Expenditures index, a key inflation gauge used by the Federal Reserve to make interest-rate decisions, held steady in July according to new data from the Department of Commerce.",
      "Prices across the U.S. rose at an annual rate of 2.6% last month, the same as in June and in line with economist forecasts. Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.9% from a year ago, up slightly from June's 2.8% and the highest since February, according to the report.",
      "The figures illustrate why many Fed officials\u00a0have been wary\u00a0about cutting their benchmark interest rate. While inflation is much lower than the roughly 7% peak it reached three years ago, it remains above the central bank's 2% target.",
      "Meanwhile, the report showed that consumer spending increased by 0.5% from June to July, the biggest increase since March, indicating that Americans are not pulling back on purchases, despite looming economic uncertainty. Spending jumped sharply for long-lasting goods such as cars, appliances and furniture, many of which are imported.",
      "Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note that the rise in the core inflation measure was due to a rise in core services, which rose 0.3% on a monthly basis. That suggests tariffs are having a \"minimal impact on goods prices,\" he wrote.",
      "Incomes rose 0.4% on a monthly basis, boosted by a healthy gain in wages and salaries, the report showed.",
      "\"We continue to expect core PCE inflation to peak at 3.3% at the turn of the year, before then easing to about 2.5% by the end of 2026,\" Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a report.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted in his Jackson Hole address earlier this month\u00a0that policymakers are likely to cut its short-term rate for the first time December of 2024. But policymakers are expected to proceed cautiously, while Powell has emphasized that any future rate cuts will depend on the path of inflation.",

      "When the Fed reduces its benchmark rate, it often \u2014 though not always \u2014 lowers borrowing costs for things like mortgages, car loans, and business borrowing. On the flip side, that can spark inflation if the economy grows too quickly.",

      "President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0suspending what's known as the\u00a0de minimis exemption\u00a0late last month.",
      "At the time, the White House said that would close what it called a \"catastrophic loophole\" that shippers use to \"evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids or below-market products\" into the U.S.",
      "The exemption applied to parcels valued at $800 or less and let overseas retailers ship inexpensive goods to consumers in the U.S. tax-free.",
      "Mr. Trump \"is putting an end to the proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things, deceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law,\" the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new policy.",
      "The president \"ending of the deadly de minimum loophole will save thousands of American lives by restricting the flow of narcotics and other dangerous prohibited items, and add up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues to our Treasury,\" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters Thursday, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "But there will still be a six-month transition period when postal service shippers can choose to pay a flat duty of $80 to $200 per package depending on the country of origin, Reuters said, citing Trump administration officials.",
      "Mr. Trump ended the de minimis loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong in May. It had allowed retailers such as Shein and Temu to ship ultra low-cost apparel and other goods to U.S.-based consumers at bargain-basement prices. Shipments from China and Hong Kong account for most de minimis shipments to the U.S., according to the White House.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 06:00:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Critics caution U.S. government equity stakes in American companies could lead to cronyism, distorted economics and bad deals for taxpayers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's 10% stake in Intel, announced not long after President Trump had called on the chip maker's CEO to resign, is being criticized by conservatives and some economic policy experts alike, who worry such extensive government intervention undermines free enterprise.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, may have fueled those misgivings, telling CNBC this week that although Intel is a \"very, very special\" circumstance, that \"there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry, then other industries.\" The possibility of the U.S. acquiring stakes in additional U.S. companies was immediately met with criticism.",
      "Adam Posen, president of the Petersen Foundation for International Economics, responded immediately to Hassett's comment, posting on X, \"ARE you effing kidding me? We are going past 1984 into Animal Farm territory at this point,\" referring to the George Orwell satirical novel critiquing totalitarianism. \"Did anyone vote for this? Anyone?\"",
      "Daniel Di Martino, a fellow at the right-of-center Manhattan Institute, predicted that if that happens, the U.S. would see more cronyism, with the result that \"companies will underperform because they know they will be bailed out,\" and \"taxpayers will lose billions.\"",
      "\"You can't just be against socialism when the left does it,\" conservative talk show host Erick Erikson said of the Intel agreement. \"If you're not against socialism overall, guess what? You're going to get socialism. So if you support socialism, apparently Donald Trump is your guy.\"",
      "Why did the U.S. invest in Intel?",
      "Mr. Trump says he'd like to increase chip production in the U.S. and reduce the nation's dependence on chips manufactured overseas. He believes that the investment in Intel will help the U.S. to better position itself to maintain its technological edge over China in the artificial intelligence race. But the U.S. had already invested in Intel through the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, and Mr. Trump and his top administration officials said the U.S. government is owed a return on their investment.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday said the U.S. is taking a stake \"to ensure that the United States government is making our country wealthy again and is benefitting from some of these deals.\"",
      "\"We should get an equity stake for our money,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC. \"So we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We'll get equity in return for it.\"",
      "But Intel has been struggling \u2014 not just for a couple of years, but for decades, said Scott Lincicome, a leading economic and trade policy expert who is a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute and has criticized the Intel deal.",
      "Intel prospered in the 1990s and early 2000s, when most personal computers relied on the company's processors. The emergence of competitors like AMD and Intel's own failure to adapt to mobile computing after the 2007 advent of the iPhone clobbered the chipmaker.",
      "And now, as Nvidia and AMD vie for dominance in the AI chip race, Intel has been lagging.",
      "\"Even if you think government should be investing in companies, Intel is not a lean, mean, innovating machine,\" Lincicome said.",
      "The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting company plans to reduce its workforce by 25% by the end of the year. The company said the administration made the $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock because of the government's confidence in the role Intel plays in \"expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "The Biden administration originally said Intel had to meet certain benchmarks to get the taxpayer money, but Mr. Trump removed those goals to buy the stake in Intel.",
      "Peril in partial government ownership",
      "Economic policy experts fear the U.S. stake in Intel will throw open the door to political pressure and cronyism.",
      "Intel warned in a federal filing this week that there \"could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors.\"",
      "Lincicome maintains that Intel was able to obtain a government infusion of cash not on the strength of its operations, but rather because it has the best lobbyists. And this will just lead more companies to vie for investment in the same way, he said.",
      "\"This is one of the problems with government picking winners and losers in industrial policy in general,\" Lincicome said.",
      "He outlined his concerns in an op-ed for the Washington Post this week.",
      "\"With the U.S. government as its largest shareholder, Intel will face constant pressure to align corporate decisions with the goals of whatever political party is in power,\" Lincicome wrote. \"Will Intel locate or continue facilities \u2014 such as its long-delayed 'megafab' in Ohio \u2014 based on economic efficiency or government priorities? Will it hire and fire based on merit or political connections?\"",
      "Lincicome isn't the only analyst who pointed out that the uncomfortable decisions CEOs make could come into conflict with U.S. prerogatives if the country holds a stake in their\u00a0 companies.",
      "\"There are major risks to these companies,\" said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, while acknowledging it isn't yet clear what the Trump administration is planning for any future investments. \"A lot of the things that companies need to do in order to stay competitive in the market are politically unpopular,\" like layoffs. \"It's going to be a lot harder for these companies to engage in those painful but necessary moves if the president feels like they would create a political vulnerability for him.\"",
      "Companies without U.S. investment will feel pressure, too, said Di Martino. A company that needs semiconductor chips may decide to buy from Intel because it doesn't want to lose government contracts.",
      "The Trump administration has shown a willingness to use industrial policy in other ways that depart from free market economic principles long favored by conservatives and corporate America. Most notably, Mr. Trump's aggressive \u2014 and sometimes punitive \u2014 use of tariffs, which he has said will reduce the country's trade deficit, revive American manufacturing and generate federal revenue, hearkens back to the mercantilism of centuries past and contrasts with the laissez-faire ideas that have shaped the American economy.",
      "How is the U.S. paying for the Intel stake?",
      "Much of the cash for the stake is coming from the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, which is intended to boost America's competitiveness in the chip industry.",
      "Intel has already received $2.2 billion from the CHIPS Act, and is on track to receive another $5.7 billion injection from the law. A different federal program gave Intel $3.2 billion, for a grand total of $11.1 billion, according to a release from Intel. Intel and the federal government say the ownership will be passive, and have not said how long the U.S. intends to hold onto its stake, although there is a provision for the government to expand its stake further.",
      "How Intel plans to use the U.S. investment",
      "The chip maker says it's planning to use the money to expand its chip-making capacity by modernizing and increasing the size of U.S. sites in Arizona and elsewhere.",
      "Hassett has defended the U.S. stake, referring to the process of partial ownership of Intel as \"very, very special circumstances\" because of the funding made available by the CHIPS Act. When he was asked about the U.S. bar for acquiring equity stakes in companies, Hassett told CNBC, \"If we are adding fundamental value to your business, I think it's fair for Donald Trump to think about the American people.\"",
      "Strain said a government stake in U.S. companies also poses a big risk for taxpayers, too.",
      "\"This is also going to accrue to the detriment of the American people, because you're going to see a lot of good taxpayer money chasing bad investments because the government's not going to extricate itself quickly or easily from these arrangements, and more generally, countries that have gone down this route have had slower productivity growth, slower increases in living standards, and companies that are less likely to be industry leaders,\" Strain said.",
      "Past U.S. stakes in big banks and automakers",
      "One reason economists are uncomfortable with the government's stake in Intel stems from the message it may send about the U.S. economy. The most prominent modern example of a similar U.S. investment took place during the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. sunk $700 billion into a big bank bailout and over $17 billion into two of the big three U.S. automakers. It did so because the banks were considered \"too big to fail\" and the potential collapse of the auto companies could cost millions of jobs.",
      "Experts now are raising questions about the wisdom of buying a stake in a company when the economy isn't in crisis.",
      "Lincicome said the administration is sending a contradictory message by highlighting the struggles China is having with its economy while at the same time saying \"we want to be more like China\" by having the federal government more involved in U.S. companies.",
      "\"There is no crisis, there's certainly no war, so this is a big break from what we've done before,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Although economists and politicians differ on the success of the General Motors and Chrysler bailouts, Lincicome said there was undoubtedly a crisis. The federal government took ownership stakes in the two automakers to stabilize them but within a few years had sold the stakes, after the companies were on firmer financial footing.",
      "Not socialism, but maybe a step in that direction?",
      "While partial ownership of Intel or other companies isn't exactly socialism, Di Martino said it \"absolutely\" blurs the lines between the private sector and the public sector.",
      "\"Socialism and free enterprise are not a switch, they are a continuum,\" Di Martino said, adding partial ownership of U.S. companies would be \"definitely a step toward socialism, there is no doubt about that.\"",
      "Di Martino said the U.S. ownership stake in Intel \"certainly gets us closer [to socialism] and makes us less prosperous.\"",
      "\"I think the right way to describe it is a move toward state capitalism,\" Strain said. \"I don't think I would describe it as socialism.\"",
      "Lutnick put it this way: \"Intel agreed to give us 10% of their company, which, of course, was worth $11 billion.\"",
      "\"So, it's not socialism,\" he said at a Trump Cabinet meeting Tuesday. \"This is capitalism.\"",
      "Di Martino is dubious about whether that's true. \"We are intervening in the capital markets in a way that is going to lead to inefficiencies,\" he said, adding, \"And it's going to shift capital away from other companies.\"",

      "As job hopping has waned, so too have the pay hike workers tend to get when changing jobs. The median raise for workers who switched employers was 7% in July, down from 10% in 2019 and 20% in 2022, according to the Bank of America Institute.",
      "ZipRecruiter labor economist Nicole Bachaud, citing data from the company's\u00a0New Hires Survey, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email that less than half of new hires (42%) in the second quarter negotiated their starting salary. Among those who did seek to negotiate, only 48% received higher pay.",
      "Federal Reserve data shows that for the first time since 2010, wage growth for job hoppers equaled that of job stayers in May and into July, another indication that the labor marketing is cooling.",
      "The Bank of America analysis notes the diminishing payoff from switching jobs stems in part from the shifting power dynamic between employees and employers. Workers wielded more leverage during the pandemic, when labor supply disruptions created heightened demand for workers. However, that power is slowly shifting back toward employers as job opportunities dry up.",
      "\"This trend confirms that the labor market is no longer as tight,\" Bowley writes in the report.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-unprecedented-firing-of-fed-governor-lisa-cook-raises-untested-questions/",
    "published": "Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:02:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Fed Governor Lisa Cook filed a lawsuit challenging what her suit said is President Trump's \"unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove\" her.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Bank's Board of Governors puts the nation in uncharted legal waters, and may ultimately be up to the Supreme Court to provide clarity on whether the move crosses a legal boundary, legal scholars expect.",
      "Mr. Trump's move to oust Cook comes after months of griping about the Fed, which he says is moving too slowly to cut interest rates. But if her removal is allowed to stand \u2014 a question that will be decided by the courts \u2014 and the Senate confirms a replacement, it would mean Mr. Trump will have appointed the majority of the seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cook was named to the Fed Board by President Joe Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to serve a full 14-year term in September 2023, which is set to end in January 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump said he was removing Cook from her post because of alleged mortgage fraud, though she has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense. The claims about Cook were made by Bill Pulte, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who sent a\u00a0letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of\u00a0 taking out mortgages for properties in Michigan and Georgia in 2021 and claiming both would be used as her primary residence.",
      "Pulte alleged that Cook was fraudulently attempting to gain more favorable lending terms. He has also leveled allegations of mortgage fraud against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democrats who have been among the most prominent opponents of Mr. Trump. Both have denied the accusations.",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook has set off a legal battle that could end with the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. She filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging what the suit said is Mr. Trump's \"unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove Governor Cook from her position which, if allowed to occur, would [be] the first of its kind in the Board's history.\"",
      "\"It is clear from the circumstances surrounding Governor Cook's purported removal from the Federal Reserve Board that the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" her complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., states.",
      "The White House has defended Mr. Trump's move to terminate Cook from the Fed Board of Governors as within his lawful authority.",
      "\"The president determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "Aggressive removals",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook is the latest in a string of removals of Democratic-appointed members of independent agencies, which have tested the bounds of his executive authority. He fired leaders of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, ousted commissioners on the Consumer Product Safety Commission and terminated officials sitting on the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Labor Relations Authority.",
      "Many of the firings have led to legal challenges. The officials removed from the boards have argued Mr. Trump violated federal laws that shield them from being removed at-will. Instead, Congress has said that the only grounds for their firings are inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The laws were meant to insulate independent federal agencies and decisions from political pressure.",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" But courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause.\" While not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, Cook argues in her lawsuit that it means instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office or comparable misconduct.",
      "The question of what qualifies as good cause, and whether Cook's alleged actions rise to it, are likely to be key questions to be answered during litigation, said Adam White, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the Supreme Court.",
      "\"If [the justices] interpret good cause, they'll have to do so with an eye to the power and purpose of the Federal Reserve System more generally, the powers of the system and the purpose of its independence. What is 'good cause' with respect to the service of a Fed governor?\" he said. \"If all President Trump is going to go with is these allegations regarding the governor's mortgage application before she was on the board, I have a hard time believing that constitutes good cause because it's really not germane to the duties of the governor while she was in office.\"",
      "The Supreme Court and the Fed",
      "In a series of recent decisions, the Supreme Court has reasserted the president's power to remove executive officers without cause.",
      "In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "This year, in response to emergency appeals brought by ousted officials from the NLRB and the MSPB, which are multi-member bodies, the Supreme Court allowed Mr. Trump to fire those officials while their legal challenges move forward, even though Congress shielded them from being removed at will. But in a brief decision in that case that appeared to be 6-3, the Supreme Court's majority singled out the Fed.",
      "Two fired officials, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, raised concerns about the consequences of allowing their removals and whether that would call into question the constitutionality of the Fed's for-cause removal protections. The court said it disagreed. Instead, it called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",
      "Writing in dissent, Justice Elena Kagan said the majority created a \"bespoke Federal Reserve exception,\" even though its independence \"rests on the same constitutional and analytic foundations as that of the NLRB, MSPB, FTC, FCC, and so on.\"",
      "\"The court in that language does not resolve the question. All the court is saying is that the Federal Reserve is different from the FTC or from the NLRB,\" Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, said. \"Yeah, it is different, but is it sufficiently different to mean that it's not subject to the same rule? The court doesn't say.\"",
      "The president's removal powers",
      "While Mr. Trump has sought to exert new levels of control over the executive branch, the Supreme Court has recognized narrow exceptions to the removal powers, allowing Congress to protect certain officials from being fired without cause.",
      "In a 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the court found that Congress can restrict the president's authority to remove multi-member commissions of experts who are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "In its decision allowing the firings of the labor board members, the Supreme Court's majority said the Justice Department \"is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power.\"",
      "But White said the Fed is different from those agencies because of the authority it exerts.",
      "\"Under the last 15 years of precedents, the question is what kind of powers does the agency wield and are they substantially executive?\" he said. \"And for the Fed, it does have regulatory powers and it's possible they verge on something like executive power, but the overwhelming majority of what the Fed does that is of consequence is its monetary powers. That's why the court recognized that the Fed is different.\"",
      "White continued: \"The whole reason why we're sensitive about the president's attacks on the Fed versus the NLRB is that the Fed's overwhelming purpose and its most significant power are all something very different than simple law enforcement policy. Those powers, going back to the very beginning of the country, have never been treated as executive powers.\"",
      "Alicea, however, disagreed. The Board of Governors has broad oversight and regulatory authority over the nation's banking system, he said.",
      "\"Those are core executive powers,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is suing over President Trump's attempt to fire her.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook filed suit against President Trump, Chair Jerome Powell and the Fed's Board of Governors on Thursday, asking a federal judge to block the president's attempt to fire her from the central bank.",
      "Mr. Trump announced Cook's termination from the Fed late Monday, citing allegations she had committed mortgage fraud, which he described as \"deceitful and potentially criminal.\" The move came after the president spent months railing against the Fed and Powell for leaving interest rates relatively high so far this year.",
      "Cook filed her lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday, teeing up a legal showdown that seems destined to ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court. Her legal team asked the district court to declare that Mr. Trump's attempted firing is \"unlawful and void\" and that Cook \"remains an active member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.\"",
      "\"Governor Cook seeks immediate declaratory and injunctive relief to confirm her status as a member of the Board of Governors, safeguard her and the Board's congressionally mandated independence, and allow Governor Cook and the Federal Reserve to continue its critical work,\" the suit said.",
      "Members of the Fed board are confirmed by the Senate and serve for 14-year terms. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the president can only remove them early \"for cause.\" The law doesn't specify what qualifies as \"cause,\" and it has never been tested in court, but it is generally understood to be malfeasance.",
      "In her suit, Cook's lawyers Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen asked the court to state that Fed board members \"can only be removed for cause, meaning instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or comparable misconduct,\" citing Supreme Court precedent and relevant federal law. Even if the court disagrees with that standard, they wrote, the law \"clearly does not support removal for policy disagreements.\"",
      "Powell and the Fed board are named in the suit because Cook asked the court for an injunction ordering them to \"refrain from effectuating President Trump's illegal attempt to fire Governor Cook and treat Governor Cook as a member of the Board of Governors.\"",
      "In response to the lawsuit, White House spokesman Kush Desai said the president \"exercised his lawful authority\" in removing Cook.",
      "\"The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" Desai said in a statement. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued in the past that the president has the legal right to remove at will members of federal boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The Supreme Court has upheld Mr. Trump's power to fire some board members, but said in May that the Federal Reserve is a separate case, calling it a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, accused Cook of falsifying mortgage documents by claiming two homes that she bought in 2021 as her primary residence. He alleged that Cook \u2014 an economist who has served on the Fed board since 2022 \u2014 had committed mortgage fraud, and referred the matter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Justice Department special attorney Ed Martin.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump publicly called on Cook to resign.",
      "At the time, Cook didn't address the substance of Pulte's allegations directly, but said in a statement that she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\" She added that she would \"take any questions about my financial history seriously\" and said she was gathering more information.",
      "Lowell, her lawyer, said Monday that Mr. Trump didn't have the legal right to fire Cook \"based solely on a referral letter\" to Justice Department leadership, a point her legal team reiterated in Thursday's lawsuit.",
      "\"[R]emoval 'for cause' requires some connection to official conduct, prohibiting removal based on an unsubstantiated allegation of private misconduct (which in this case allegedly occurred prior to her Senate confirmation),\" the complaint said. \"And even to the extent that private misconduct could bear on a particular officer's official conduct in certain cases, 'cause' requires a factual basis supporting such asserted misconduct.\"",
      "The broadside against Cook came as Mr. Trump pressures the Fed to lower interest rates. The central bank's rate-setting committee \u2014 which Cook and Powell both sit on \u2014 has opted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, fearing that inflation could resurge. Last week, Powell hinted that the central bank may cut rates soon, but it will \"proceed carefully.\"",
      "The president favors immediate rate cuts, which could boost economic growth and make it cheaper to borrow money, though at the risk of causing higher inflation. He has floated firing Powell at various times over the past few months and has encouraged other Fed officials to overrule him and slash rates.",
      "The Fed typically makes interest rate decisions independently. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize the Fed for leaving rates high, but he's been unusually assertive. Last year, he argued he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "Many experts believe it's important for central banks to operate independently so they can make decisions based on economic data, not politics. If elected officials are in charge of monetary policy, they could opt for the politically popular short-term benefits of low interest rates \u2014 like a hotter economy and cheaper borrowing costs \u2014 even if that leads to higher inflation in the long run, Brookings Institution senior fellow David Wessel noted earlier this year.",
      "Kathryn  Watson and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Deputy HHS secretary Jim O'Neill is also serving as acting CDC director as RFK Jr.'s newly appointed vaccine advisory panel prepares for its first meeting.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is at a crossroads. Last week, CDC Director Susan Monarez was ousted less than a month into her tenure after resisting Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s push to align with his vaccine policy agenda. Within hours, three senior leaders \u2014 including the chief medical officer and the heads of vaccine safety and respiratory infections \u2014 resigned in protest. Their exits capped weeks of mounting tension: biased scientific reviews, the withdrawal of key documents, and a shooting at CDC headquarters tied to COVID misinformation. Hundreds of staff publicly applauded the departing scientists in a rare \"clap-out.\"",
      "Into that vacuum stepped Jim O'Neill, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services, now installed as acting CDC director.",
      "O'Neill's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 breaks sharply with CDC tradition. A Bush-era HHS official turned Silicon Valley investor, he is neither a physician nor a scientist \u2014 an unusual profile for the agency's top post. He is expected to retain his deputy role at HHS while leading the CDC. After his early government service, O'Neill spent nearly two decades in close partnership with billionaire Peter Thiel, managing his funds, directing the Thiel Foundation, and co-founding the Thiel Fellowship. He also led the SENS Research Foundation, a nonprofit focused on anti-aging science. In June, he returned to Washington as deputy secretary; he now holds that position alongside his role as CDC director.",
      "Former colleagues on both sides of the aisle describe him as smart and diligent, with a deep knowledge of HHS mechanics. They also note his libertarian streak, which could align him well with Secretary Kennedy but set him at odds with school vaccination requirements. His most controversial stance, voiced in 2014, was that the FDA should approve drugs once proven safe, leaving effectiveness to be determined in the marketplace \u2014 a proposal widely criticized by public health experts as dangerous.",
      "O'Neill insists he is \"very strongly pro-vaccine,\" but his recent post on social media \u2014 asking if \"omicron is the best vaccine\" and suggesting CDC could \"redefine the word vaccine at will\" \u2014 sparked new concerns about his grasp of vaccine science. Experts counter that infection is not the same as vaccination, which confers protection without the risks of acute illness or long COVID.",
      "He could wear both hats for some time. The White House and Kennedy appear eager to avoid a bruising Senate confirmation fight. Until COVID, the CDC director was not a Senate-confirmed position; Republicans changed that in the pandemic's aftermath. Leaving O'Neill in an \"acting\" role could paralyze major decision-making at the agency for the foreseeable future.",
      "Meanwhile, the CDC's vaccine advisory committee \u2014 made up of all new Kennedy appointees \u2014 is preparing for a pivotal September meeting. On the agenda: the newborn hepatitis B dose, infant RSV protection, COVID vaccination for healthy children and young adults, and the combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella shot. Revisiting so many long-standing childhood immunizations at once would be unprecedented. If recommendations are weakened, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Vaccines for Children program could restrict coverage, creating new barriers for families.",
      "The stakes for CDC are profound. O'Neill has promised to \"refocus CDC on infectious disease\" and \"restore trust,\" yet staff and state partners say politicized decisions and budget cuts are already eroding core work.",
      "The September vaccine advisory meeting will be the first real test for O'Neill. If he restores scientific processes, including transparent reviews, expert briefings, and evidence being vetted and posted before votes, CDC insiders say he could stabilize morale at the agency and preserve the credibility of its scientifically-based recommendations. If not, the resignations of senior scientists may prove the start of a broader exodus, leaving states and families without clear guidance just as flu, RSV and COVID converge this fall.",

      "The symbolism of the three leaders together on a stage with Xi's military thundering past in formation will be undeniable. Xi is expected to be flanked by Putin and Kim. Together, they have been dubbed an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts.",
      "Xi is bringing together the leaders of some of the most heavily sanctioned nations in the world. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian and the leader of Myanmar's ruling military junta, President Min Aung Hlaing, will also be attending, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "It is a clear show of solidarity against the West, and it's being seen as a direct challenge to the U.S.-led world order that has prevailed for a century. Xi and Putin have made their ambition to shake up that status quo clear for at least several years.",
      "\"We, together with you and with our sympathizers, will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,\" Russia's longtime Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in 2022, ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "The gathering in Beijing will represent a clear challenge to President Trump's claim to be fostering close working relationships with Xi, Putin and Kim. Xi's bond with Putin was on clear and deliberate display in the days leading up to the parade.",
      "China and Russia have declared their \"no limits partnership,\" and while China claims to maintain a neutral stance on Russia's war in Ukraine, Beijing's support of the war effort \u2014 by providing dual-use technology and continuing to purchase Russian oil and gas in defiance of Western sanctions, has proven to be an economic lifeline funding Putin's three-and-a-half-year war.",
      "During talks at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday, Putin hailed \"unprecedentedly high relations\" with China and thanked his \"dear friend\" Xi for the warm welcome.",
      "Kim's support for Russia's war has been even more direct. Since October last year, North Korea has sent around 13,000 troops, along with conventional weapons, to support Russia's war effort. South Korea's intelligence services estimate that around 2,000 North Korean troops have been killed fighting alongside Russian forces.",
      "The parade will be a show of both China and Russia's implicit support for Kim's nuclear weapons program, which remains the subject of numerous United Nations sanctions.",
      "Xi burnished his credentials as a geopolitical powerbroker at a regional security summit in Tianjin, northern China, that ended on Monday. He hosted more than 20 world leaders there, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "\"We should uphold fairness and justice,\" Xi declared at the gathering of the Shanghai Corporation Organization, seemingly trying to claim moral high ground amid the upheaval and strained relationships caused by Mr. Trump's global trade war and isolationist policies. \"We must oppose the Cold War mentality, block confrontation and bullying practices.\"",
      "Without mentioning the U.S. or its president by name, Xi told the assembled leaders of non-Western countries: \"We must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics.\"",
      "On Monday Xi, Putin and Modi were shown together smiling and laughing at the summit \u2014 a deliberate public display of warmth and camaraderie. Just last week, the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a close ally of Mr. Trump, called the summit \"performative\" and accused China and India of being \"bad actors\" for fueling Russia's war.",
      "At the parade this week, Xi is not only asserting China as a reliable and stable partner, but also showing off his country's burgeoning alliances, influence and its military might and power. It is a message that many will see as being aimed squarely, if not entirely, at China's rival across the Pacific.",

    "summary": "See maps of how Texas and California's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday signed a bill to redraw the state's congressional districts to be more friendly to Republicans, capping off a redistricting push that drew national attention. It also led to California's Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats.",
      "Missouri is following Texas and California's lead, with the state's Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe announcing Friday that he had called for the state's Legislature to convene on Sept. 3 to redraw the state's congressional districts. Missouri has eight representatives in Congress, two of whom are Democrats.",
      "Challenges remain for both Texas and California's new maps. While Texas law only requires the Legislature and the governor's approval to set the congressional maps, civil rights groups have already challenged them in court, accusing the maps of being racially biased. The maps the GOP-controlled Legislature created in 2021 are still being litigated in court.",
      "In California, the state's congressional map must be approved by voters before it takes effect. The Democratic-controlled Assembly and State Senate both approved a measure called Proposition 50 for the Nov. 4 ballot that, if approved, will overhaul the state's congressional maps. California Republicans challenged the maps in court, saying Democrats ignored the 30-day public review period for new legislation, although the state Supreme Court denied the petition on Aug. 27.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off by President Trump in mid-July as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterm elections are often a rebuke of the party in the White House. Mr. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson zeroed in on Texas, with the president claiming Republicans could gain an extra five seats given how the state voted in 2024.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, with Indiana Republicans having met with Mr. Trump and members of his administration on Aug. 27 to try to redraw the state's nine congressional districts to try to oust the two Democratic members. Florida's Republican House speaker last month created a special committee to look into the possibility there.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their state's congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas and California's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 Congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but where Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "In recent years, Texas Democrats have made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district out in the rural areas, making it a district that was 72% Democratic to one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also takes aim at Districts 32 and 33 in Dallas-Fort Worth, changing Rep. Julie Johnson's 32nd District from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's 33rd District remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts under the proposed maps. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California currently has 52 representatives in Congress, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats. The GOP has made inroads in the Golden State, starting in 2020, when Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. Republicans have held onto two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "Other Republican strongholds in Central California have been spread into other districts. Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, Districts 1 and 3 both have dramatic shifts. GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part is absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's 3rd Congressional District, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention penned an op-ed Monday condemning Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership in the aftermath of the firing of the CDC director last week, claiming he is \"endangering every American's health.\"",
      "\"What the health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has done to the CDC and to our nation's public health system over the past several months \u2014 culminating in his decision to fire Dr. Susan Monarez as CDC director days ago \u2014 is unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency and unlike anything our country had ever experienced,\" the nine former directors and acting directors wrote in the op-ed in The New York Times.",
      "The Trump administration attempted to oust CDC Director Susan Monarez last week, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her firing. Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials have resigned in recent days, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "In their op-ed, the former CDC directors who served under both Democrat and Republican administrations, pointed to a number of decisions by Kennedy that they say are \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" including canceling investments into medical research and the move to replace members on a key vaccine advisory committee, among other things.",
      "\"Firing Dr. Monarez \u2014 which led to the resignations of top CDC officials \u2014 adds considerable fuel to this raging fire,\" the former CDC directors added.",
      "The CDC leaders said they \"applaud Dr. Monarez for standing up for the agency and the health of our communities.\"",
      "\"The loss of Dr. Monarez and other top leaders will make it far more difficult for the CDC to do what it has done for about 80 years: work around the clock to protect Americans from threats to their lives and health,\" they wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, the former CDC directors also called on Congress to exercise its oversight authority over the department of Health and Human Services. The CDC is one of a number of agencies under the HHS umbrella.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on HHS last week\u00a0 to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for Sept. 18 amid the slew of CDC departures. And the Louisiana Republican, who delivered the key vote to advance Kennedy's confirmation as secretary, also said the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "In an appearance on Fox News last week after the CDC director firing, Kennedy said he wouldn't comment on personnel, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to appear before the Senate Finance Committee Thursday to testify on President Trump's health care agenda.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, says the timing of the op-ed \"has everything to do with Dr. Monarez's firing last week,\" but she added that \"the concerns that they outlined are really about politics and ideology taking precedence over public health and science.\"",
      "Citing the firings of federal health workers across HHS, the weakening of public health programs, questions about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines amid a serious measles outbreak in Texas, among other things, Gounder said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" that \"we really are very concerned about how this is now diminishing trust in the very most basic of public health infrastructure in this country.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 10:23:21 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled in favor of California Gov. Gavin Newsom in his challenge to President Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal court in California ruled Tuesday that the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed members of the National Guard and active-duty U.S. Marines to Los Angeles earlier this summer in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations.",
      "In a 52-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that the president and his administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 1878 law that prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Breyer blocked the Trump administration from deploying or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops in the state, for civilian law enforcement.",
      "His decision restricts the use of service members to engage in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures and traffic and crowd control. The injunction applies only to the Trump administration's use of the National Guard in California, not nationally, and it does not require the Defense Department to withdraw the 300 National Guard troops who remain in Los Angeles. Breyer noted that the administration is not prohibited from using troops consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act, and wrote that they can continue to protect federal property in a manner allowed under the law.",
      "The judge froze his injunction until noon on Sept. 12, likely to allow the Trump administration time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.",
      "Breyer's ruling came after he held a three-day trial in the case brought by California Gov. Gavin Newsom in June. Newsom, a Democrat,\u00a0sued in response to Mr. Trump's decision to deploy members of California's National Guard to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration enforcement operations taking place in the area. The president invoked a law known as Title 10 to send the California National Guard to Los Angeles to protect federal property and personnel.",
      "The judge granted temporary relief to California officials in June that required the Trump administration not to deploy the California National Guard in Los Angeles and return control to Newsom. But a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit found it likely that Mr. Trump lawfully federalized the California National Guard under a different law, Title 10.",
      "Those earlier proceedings did not involve the Posse Comitatus Act. Breyer, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, held the trial on the merits of Newsom's arguments that the president violated that 147-year-old law last month.",
      "The judge's ruling",
      "The judge wrote in his ruling that the evidence put forth at the trial established that the Trump administration \"systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles. In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "While the Pentagon withdrew roughly the 700 U.S. Marines who had been sent to Los Angeles, Breyer noted that there are still 300 National Guard members stationed there nearly three months after they were first mobilized.",
      "\"Moreover, President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country \u2014 including Oakland and San Francisco, here in the Northern District of California \u2014 thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "The judge said that the Trump administration intentionally initiated the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to establish a military presence there and enforce federal law. He called that conduct a \"serious violation\" of federal law prohibiting the use of the military for domestic law enforcement.",
      "\"In fact, these violations were part of a top-down, systemic effort by Defendants to use military troops to execute various sectors of federal law (the drug laws and the immigration laws at least) across hundreds of miles and over the course of several months \u2014 and counting,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the president's constitutional powers allow him to override the restrictions in the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "\"Under this 'constitutional exception,' as Defendants call it, the President has inherent constitutional authority to protect federal property, federal personnel, and federal functions, so any actions that can be construed as such 'protection' are lawful in spite of the Posse Comitatus Act,\" he wrote. \"This assertion is not grounded in the history of the Act, Supreme Court jurisprudence on executive authority, or common sense.\"",
      "The judge said that Congress was clear about what constitutes an exception to the law, precluding the president from exercising all but his express authority under the Constitution. He also accused the Trump administration of attempting to usurp Congress' authority.",
      "\"That Defendants characterize this as an 'exception' to the statute is mere wordplay; it does not change the fact that they seek to override Congress's legitimate exercise of its own authority,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "Attorneys for California had sought an injunction that blocked National Guard forces from participating in and protecting federal agents during immigration enforcement operations, and Breyer agreed to grant their request. The Trump administration had argued that Title 10 is an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act and therefore didn't apply to National Guard troops who were called into federal service.",
      "The judge wrote that while there is \"no question that federal personnel should be able to perform their jobs without fearing for their safety,\" the Trump administration cannot \"use this as a hook to send military troops alongside federal agents wherever they go.\"",
      "Since the 9th Circuit allowed the Trump administration to keep the National Guard in California, the president has moved to deploy troops to Washington, D.C.\u00a0Mr. Trump has also teased sending the National Guard to other major cities throughout the country in what he casts as a looming crackdown against illegal immigration, violent crime and civil unrest.",
      "As of Monday, there are over 2,200 National Guard members in Washington, D.C., with over half of those troops sent by Republican governors throughout the country.",

I will continue to give everything I have to defend our democracy, protect our institutions, and fight for the values that as Americans and New Yorkers we share.\"",

    "story": [
      "An international group of more than 85 climate experts on Tuesday published a 439-page review arguing that a report by the Trump administration's Energy Department fails to \"adequately represent the current scientific understanding of climate change,\" and it \"exhibits pervasive problems\" by misrepresenting scientific literature and cherry-picking data.",
      "The Department of Energy's 151-page report, \"A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,\" was written by five authors who were hand-selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former fossil fuel executive. It included a controversial conclusion that \"carbon dioxide-induced warming appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed,\" and it states that \"aggressive mitigation strategies\" to address greenhouse gas emissions \"could be more harmful than beneficial\" \u2014\u00a0a statement that supports the oil and gas industry.",
      "\"Climate change is real, and it deserves attention. But it is not the greatest threat facing humanity,\" Wright said in a statement supporting the report's publication and conclusions.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Department of Energy about the criticisms, but it has not responded.",
      "In August, environmental groups and independent scientists sued the Energy Department over the report, arguing the way it was written and produced violated transparency laws. Tuesday's review is the latest in a series of actions climate experts have taken to tackle the Energy report that they say made \"a mockery of science.\"",
      "\"Climate science is probably one of the most robust and scrutinized scientific fields in the history of science because of the economic implications,\" said Andrew Dessler, director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather at Texas A&M University, who felt the report was an insult to climate and environmental science.",

      "\"I can't tell you how many people looked at this and agreed with me that this was a mockery and we needed to respond to it,\" Dessler told CBS News.",
      "In less than a month, Dessler helped organize more than 85 international climate experts, mostly from universities, from the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Canada, who voluntarily reviewed the DOE report and found that it was \"full of errors,\" \"biased,\" and \"not fit to inform policy.\"",
      "They have submitted their response to the DOE, which provided a 30-day window for public comment on the report. As of September 1, there were more than 2,333 comments submitted.",
      "\"We have no idea what they're gonna do with the comments,\" said Dessler, \"They're never going to convince people that carbon dioxide isn't important, but what they want to do is create doubt.\"",
      "Dessler and his colleagues are not the only ones who are concerned about the DOE report and its findings. The American Meteorological Society also published its own response, finding \"five foundational flaws\" that it says \"places the report at odds with scientific principles and practices.\"",
      "The review spends the majority of the 439-pages outlining the list of errors experts found, which Dessler described as, \"selectively\" citing scientific literature, saying, \"How can you provide a respectable view of science when you don't know what the literature says, you're not reading it, you're not citing it...and you're not giving the right context.\"",
      "But some critics say the report by the DOE is representative of a larger trend in the federal government under the Trump administration to organize selective committees that publish reports, which are politically advantageous to support policy decisions.",
      "\"It's clear that this administration wants to take control, at the political level, of the scientific process of the government,\" said Dr. John Balbus, who was formerly at the Department of Health and Human Services as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate Change and Health Equity.",
      "Balbus points to a similar playbook occurring at HHS around vaccines and political appointees relying on questionable opinions and misrepresentations of scientific reports to come to a conclusion that vaccines cause more harm than good, \"Which is a ludicrous and completely unsubstantiated assertion,\" he says.",
      "Although the Trump administration has fired thousands of scientists and experts across several government agencies, many have regrouped in the private sector to launch coordinated responses to counter the misinformation they perceive is being broadcast by the federal government.",
      "Last month, several major health organizations issued their own guidelines on COVID-19 vaccines, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, which runs counter to the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In May, after President Trump fired 400 scientists who were working to publish the nation's major quadrennial report on the impacts of climate change in the U.S., two scientific groups announced a plan to publish a special collection focused on the subject to ensure the scientists' work can be accessed.",
      "In addition to these efforts, many federal employees that remain with agencies have taken the risk of signing letters to Congress to express their concerns about changes in policy, including members of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency, both of which have faced retaliation for these efforts.",
      "\"When you see nearly a thousand public servants risking their livelihoods to alert the public that senior officials cannot be trusted, that is a clear warning,\" said Balbus, who believes these individuals will continue to sustain their fight against misinformation, as long as they're allowed to.",

    "summary": "Congress returns this week from its August recess staring down a deadline to fund the government and avert a possible shutdown by month's end.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns this week from its August recess staring down a deadline to fund the government and avert a possible shutdown by month's end.",
      "But a handful of other GOP priorities \u2014 from cracking down on crime to fast-tracking President Trump's nominees \u2014 have surfaced in recent weeks, along with lingering tensions and partisan disagreements, promising a chaotic return to Washington, and a lengthy to-do list.",
      "Here's what's on lawmakers' agenda as Congress returns:",
      "Government funding fight",
      "A familiar deadline is fast approaching, as Congress must race to keep the government funded by Sept. 30.",
      "While the House and Senate each passed a small number of funding bills before leaving Washington for the August recess, the two chambers have been on different pages when it comes to funding levels. Getting all 12 individual appropriations bills through both chambers is unlikely, meaning lawmakers will almost certainly have to rely on a short-term measure to keep the government funded.",
      "The dynamic isn't unusual. Congress regularly struggles to approve the new funding before the end of the fiscal year, opting instead to push the deadline down the road by keeping the government funded at current levels on a temporary basis. But this time around, the funding fight itself has taken on new meaning.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer came under intense scrutiny from his own party during the last funding fight in March. After pledging to fight the GOP plan, which increased defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels, he changed course at the eleventh hour. Ultimately, Schumer opted to deliver one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown, arguing that a shutdown risked more damage.",
      "This time around, Democratic leaders have worked to engage on the funding issue well ahead of the deadline. Early last month, Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for a \"Big Four\" meeting with their GOP counterparts to discuss funding the government. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, the Democrats said that \"it is clear that the Trump Administration and many within your party are preparing to 'go it alone' and continue to legislate on a solely Republican basis.\"",
      "Still, the letter didn't appear to kickstart a bipartisan effort. And Mr. Trump, asked about meeting with the Democratic leaders last month, said he would do it, while saying it's \"almost a waste of time to meet because they never approve anything.\" The Democrats renewed their call for a meeting between congressional leaders last week, writing that the \"government funding issue must be resolved in a bipartisan way. That is the only viable path forward.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have bemoaned the White House's efforts to claw back funds already appropriated in what's known as a rescissions package earlier this year, along with a new push by the administration last week to claw back nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress already approved. The rarely used maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, is an attempt to rescind funding unilaterally, sparking pushback on Capitol Hill and bipartisan criticism as an \"unlawful\" move.",
      "\"Today's announcement of the Administration's plan to advance an unlawful 'pocket rescission' package is further proof President Trump and Congressional Republicans are hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and 'going it alone' this fall,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "The dynamics put the parties on a collision course heading toward the Sept. 30 deadline.",
      "While Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, they will need 60 votes in the Senate to keep the government funded, meaning they will need the support of at least seven Democrats.",
      "At the same time, some in the party, including Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, have encouraged Democrats to let the government shut down to protest Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "\"We cannot be the only one playing by the rules with a hand tied behind our backs,\" Martin said. \"That old playbook, the norms that, you know, used to have guardrails on our democracy and protect all of us in this country \u2014 that doesn't exist anymore. We've got to throw that playbook out the window because the Republicans have.\"",
      "Changes to Senate nomination rules",
      "Senators left Washington after a bruising nominations saga in July. Democrats have slow-walked Mr. Trump's nominees in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay confirmations nearly across the board. Senate Democrats were unable to come to an agreement with the White House in an episode that foreshadowed a larger fight to come.",
      "\"Donald Trump tried to bully us, go around us, threaten us, call us names \u2014 but he got nothing. And he walked away with his tail between his legs,\" Schumer told reporters before leaving for the August recess.",
      "Schumer has railed against the White House for walking away from a deal involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Meanwhile, the president called the Democrat's demands \"egregious and unprecedented.\"",
      "Without a deal, Senate Republicans are expected to pursue changes to the nominations process that would allow them to more swiftly confirm the president's nominees upon their return.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican, urged in an op-ed last week that it's \"time to change Senate confirmation rules\" amid what he described as a \"bitter fight\" over even routine nominations. He said that the Senate GOP is \"considering changes to the Senate rules to end the most egregious delay tactics.\"",
      "\"Senate Republicans are determined to confirm Mr. Trump's qualified nominees one way or another,\" Barrasso wrote.",
      "What the changes look like remains to be seen. Both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process in recent years, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Confirming Trump's nominees for BLS chair and Fed governor",
      "The possible changes to the confirmation process come as a handful of new high-profile nominees are expected to come before the Senate, in addition to the dozens already awaiting votes.",
      "Mr. Trump fired the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner last month over a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. He soon announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the agency. Mr. Trump said in his announcement that Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "But the nominee could face pushback in the Senate, with questions about his experience and comments he's made suggesting the monthly jobs report should be suspended.",
      "The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is planning to hold a confirmation hearing for Antoni pending completed paperwork, according to a committee spokesperson. The panel includes a handful of Senate Republicans who have pushed back on some of Mr. Trump's most controversial nominees this year: Sen. Bill Cassidy of Tennessee, the committee chairman, along with Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Democrats on the committee demanded that the panel hold a full hearing on Antoni's nomination. And Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called Antoni \"an unqualified right-wing extremist who won't think twice about manipulating BLS data.\"",
      "The Senate is also expected to work to confirm Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacated seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump announced the nomination in August after Adriana Kugler stepped down. The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a confirmation hearing this week. But Democrats on the committee have called for a delay, seeking instead to hold an oversight hearing on Mr. Trump's moves to fire another member of the Fed board.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said he had fired another member of the Fed board, Lisa Cook, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Governors can only be fired \"for cause\" and Cook has refused to resign. She sued the president to block her firing last week.",
      "The push to oust Susan Monarez, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, could also tee up another Senate confirmation process. The upper chamber confirmed Monarez for the post in late July, though she had been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "Trump seeks crime bill, extension of DC police takeover",
      "Mr. Trump has moved to crack down on crime in the nation's capital by federalizing the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department and deploying the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement. He signaled in recent weeks that he plans to ask Congress to approve \"long-term extensions\" to maintain control of D.C.'s police, along with other measures to address crime.",
      "In an Aug. 11 executive order, Mr. Trump directed the D.C. mayor to provide the services of D.C. police for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act,\" which the president can extend for up to 30 days. Any extension beyond that requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate. That could run into trouble in the Senate, where the Republican majority would need the support of at least seven Democrats to move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump also indicated last month that he plans to seek around $2 billion from Congress to renovate the streets of Washington. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said the White House was working on a package \"to improve the safety and quality of life in our nation's capital\" which he and GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama would spearhead.",
      "\"He wants $2.5 billion, I'm going to try to find him the money, to repave the roads, take the graffiti off the building, refurbish the parts and give homeless people some place to go other than a tent on the side of the road,\" Graham said at an event in South Carolina last month.",
      "Mr. Trump has suggested that his crackdown on crime in D.C. could soon extend to other major cities, though he has unique authority in the nation's capital because the district is ultimately controlled by the federal government. Last week, the president wrote in a post on Truth Social about a crime bill, saying he's working with GOP leaders in Congress on the measure, though the details remained unclear.",
      "\"Speaker Mike Johnson, and Leader John Thune, are working with me, and other Republicans, on a Comprehensive Crime Bill,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's what our Country need, and NOW! More to follow.\"",
      "Push for Epstein files",
      "Lawmakers were on recess for weeks, but the calls for access to files in the case of late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein haven't gone away.",
      "Controversy has swirled around the Epstein files since the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review in July that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking, died in federal custody in 2019. But renewed interest in the files has prompted members of both parties to call for more transparency, while dividing Mr. Trump's base.",
      "As House Democrats and some Republicans pushed for a floor vote to force the release of the Epstein files in late July, Johnson opted to send the House home early. But some lawmakers are still pressing ahead.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July to compel the Justice Department to release the files within 30 days, with plans to force a vote on the measure once lawmakers return from recess. Massie and Khanna are set to host a news conference at the Capitol Wednesday alongside survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "The expected moves in Congress come after the administration late last month released transcripts of a two-day interview with Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, that was conducted in Florida in July. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice sent some of the files related to Epstein to the House Oversight Committee, which plans to make the records public after redactions have been made.",
      "Aaron  Navarro and \n                                                  \n                                  Nikole  Killion\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Sep 2025 19:49:05 -0400",
    "summary": "The case involves 10 migrants between 10- and 17-years-old who entered the U.S. without authorization and without their parents or legal guardians.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from sending any unaccompanied migrant child to Guatemala unless they have a deportation order, just hours after lawyers alerted her of what they described as a hurried government effort to deport hundreds of children.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued her order as the deportation effort was fully underway, with planes with migrant children on board ready to take off from Texas.",
      "Earlier Sunday, in the overnight hours, Sooknanan issued a temporary restraining order barring officials from sending a group of 10 migrant children between the ages of 10 and 17 to Guatemala, granting a request from attorneys who alleged the effort would skirt legal protections Congress established for these minors. She also scheduled a hearing in the afternoon to weigh the case's next steps.",
      "But Sooknanan abruptly moved up the hearing earlier on Sunday, saying she had been alerted that some migrant children were already in the process of being deported.",
      "As that hearing got underway, Sooknanan  announced she had just issued a broader temporary restraining order blocking any deportations of unaccompanied children from Guatemala and in U.S. custody who did not have a deportation order. She instructed Drew Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer representing the Trump administration, to quickly inform officials they had to halt their deportation plans.",
      "Ensign acknowledged deportation planes had been prepared to take off on Sunday, but said they were all \"on the ground\" and still on U.S. soil. He said he believed one plane had taken off earlier but had come back.",
      "At the request of Sooknanan, Ensign said he confirmed that the children on the planes would be deplaned and returned to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for caring for migrant minors who enter the U.S. without authorization and without their parents or legal guardians.",
      "The Justice Department said 76 unaccompanied children were slated to be sent to Guatemala on Sunday before the effort was blocked. Of those, 16 had been returned to HHS custody as of Sunday evening and the rest were expected to be in HHS care by 10:30 p.m.",
      "HHS houses unaccompanied children in shelters or foster homes until they turn 18 or until they can be placed with a suitable sponsor in the U.S., who are often family members.",
      "Sooknanan conceded her temporary restraining order, which is set to last 14 days, is \"extraordinary\" but justified it on the grounds that the government had decided to \"execute a plan to remove these children\" in the \"wee hours\" of a holiday weekend.",
      "In their lawsuit, lawyers for the group of Guatemalan children said the Trump administration had launched an effort to deport more than 600 migrant minors to Guatemala without allowing them to request humanitarian protection, even though U.S. law protects them from speedy deportations. They alleged the children could face abuse, neglect or persecution if returned to Guatemala.",
      "Ensign, the Justice Department attorney, said the Trump administration was not trying to formally deport the Guatemalan children under U.S. immigration law, but instead repatriate them to Guatemala so they could reunite with relatives there. He said the Guatemalan government and the children's relatives had requested the reunifications.",
      "But lawyers for the children disputed the government's claims, citing one case in which they say a child's parents did not request any repatriation. They also said a law known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act says unaccompanied migrant children who are not from Mexico must be allowed to see an immigration judge and apply for legal protections before any deportation effort. Some of the children facing return to Guatemala still have pending immigration cases, the attorneys said.",
      "Ensign said the government's legal position is that it can \"repatriate\" these children, based on an authority given to HHS to reunite \"unaccompanied alien children with a parent abroad in appropriate cases.\"",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the deportation plans.",
      "Neha Desai, an attorney at the California-based National Center for Youth Law who works with migrant minors, said the U.S. government was attempting to deport children with \"already filed claims for legal relief based on the abuse and persecution that they experienced in their home country.\"",
      "\"This is both unlawful and profoundly inhumane,\" Desai added.",
      "Most of the unaccompanied children who cross the U.S. southern border without legal permission hail from Central America and tend to be teenagers. Once in the U.S., many file applications for asylum or other immigration benefits to try to stay in the country legally, such as a visa for abused, abandoned or neglected youth.",
      "As part of its larger crackdown on illegal immigration, the Trump administration has sought to make drastic changes to how the U.S. processes unaccompanied children. It has made it harder for some relatives, including those in the country illegally, to sponsor unaccompanied children out of government custody and offered some teenagers the option to voluntary return to their native countries.",
      "The Trump administration has also directed agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies to conduct \"welfare checks\" on children released from HHS custody, a move it has said is in response to disputed claims that the Biden administration \"lost\" hundreds of thousands of migrant minors.",
      "There are currently roughly 2,000 migrant children in HHS care.",

      "Maduro claimed eight U.S. military vessels \"with 1,200 missiles\" were targeting his country, calling them \"the greatest threat that has been seen on our continent in the last 100 years,\" AFP reported.",
      "His comments during a news conference come as the U.S. government this week is set to boost its\u00a0maritime force in the waters off Venezuela\u00a0to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels. The U.S. has not signaled any planned land incursion by the thousands of personnel being deployed. Still, Maduro's government has\u00a0responded by deploying troops\u00a0along its coast and border with neighboring Colombia, as well as by urging Venezuelans to enlist in a civilian militia.",
      "\"In the face of this maximum military pressure, we have declared maximum preparedness for the defense of Venezuela,\" Maduro said of the deployment, which he characterized as \"an extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\"",
      "The U.S. Navy now has two Aegis guided-missile destroyers \u2014\u00a0the USS Gravely and the USS Jason Dunham\u00a0\u2014 in the Caribbean, as well as the destroyer USS Sampson and the cruiser\u00a0USS Lake Erie\u00a0in the waters off Latin America.

      "Of the eight Latin American drug trafficking groups the Trump administration has\u00a0designated as terrorist organizations, one is Venezuelan. It's not clear if or when the military could take action.",
      "On Monday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yv\u00e1n Gil, citing a United Nations report, told his counterparts in various Latin American countries that the deployment of U.S. maritime forces is built on a \"false narrative\" as 87% of cocaine produced in Colombia departs through the Pacific and traffickers attempt to move only 5% of their product through Venezuela. Landlocked Bolivia and Colombia, with access to the Pacific and Caribbean, are the world's top cocaine producers.",
      "Gil added that the narrative \"threatens the entire region\" and an attack on Venezuela \"would really mean a complete destabilization of the region.\"",
      "\"Let us immediately demand an end to this deployment, which has no other reason than to threaten a sovereign people,\" he added during a virtual meeting of members of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States regional group.",
      "Maduro also used his news conference to insist that he was the legitimate winner of\u00a0last year's presidential election. But ample and credible evidence has shown the contrary, prompting several countries,\u00a0including the U.S., to not recognize Maduro as Venezuela's president.",
      "Maduro, sworn in to a third six-year term in January, added that his government maintains two lines of communication with the Trump administration, one with the State Department and another with Mr. Trump's envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell. He called Secretary of State Marco Rubio a \"warlord\" pushing for action in the Caribbean to topple Venezuela's government.",

      "Coping with a sudden loss in federal funding, PBS affiliate KSPS in Spokane, Washington, faced a surprise extra hurdle. Many of its contributing members \u2014 at one point almost half \u2014 lived in Canada, and they were withdrawing support out of anger at President Trump's desire to make the country the 51st state in the U.S.",
      "When Congress decided this summer to eliminate $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, it left some 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations, each with unique issues related to their communities and history, to figure out what that means.",
      "Many launched emergency fund drives and are heartened by the response. The national NPR and PBS networks are reducing expected dues payments, and a philanthropic effort focused on the hardest-hit stations is taking shape. No stations have shut down, but job and programming cuts are already beginning.",
      "In Spokane, KSPS has always tried to keep its requests for member donations separate from appeals for public funding. Not anymore. Congress left the station with a $1.2 million hole to fill, about 18% of its budget, and the station is using that as a pretext to seek help from listeners.",
      "\"We have definitely seen some attrition from our Canadian members,\" said Skyler Reep, the station's interim general manager.",
      "Pleas for donations exceed expectations in many parts of country",
      "Long suspicious of a liberal bent to public media news coverage, Republicans in Congress responded to Mr. Trump's wishes in July and eliminated funding for the systems. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes the funding, has taken steps to shut down.",
      "In some parts of the country, the answer to pleas for help have exceeded expectations. Public radio station WHQR in Wilmington, N.C. raised more than $200,000 in three days, filling a $174,000 hole and then some. It's a small community growing fast with an influx of retirees, many who depend on the station's news to learn about their new home, said general manager Kevin Crane.",
      "With $525,000 gone from its budget, Hawaii Public Radio has already raised $650,000 in an emergency fund drive. \"It's a validation that what you're doing is essential to the community and is appreciated by the community,\" said Meredith Artley, president and CEO. The 2023 wildfires in Maui and their aftermath were covered steadily by Hawaii Public Radio news reporters.",
      "\"The initial response in terms of support for both stations and the NPR network has been extraordinary,\" said Katherine Maher, NPR president. \"People did a lot of work leading up to the vote, in actions and calls. When that did not prove convincing, they turned to direct support.\"",
      "Stations across the country have stories that make them smile: the youngster from Florida who collected money for public stations in Alaska, sending a note written in crayon; the regular $300 donor who came in to PBS SoCal with a $100,000 check, one of three six-figure donations the station has received.",
      "Most stations aren't in areas with so many wealthy donors. Most station managers are like Jeff Hanks of PBS' LPTV in Lakeland, Minnesota. He lies awake wondering where he will find $1 million to pay for things like his station's nightly newscast, a primary news source for central and northern Minnesota.",
      "\"These are extremely, extremely challenging times,\" Hanks said. \"We're fighting hard every way we can.\"",
      "He knows membership donations won't make up for what is missing. Both PBS and NPR have taken steps to reduce the annual dues that stations pay for programming and other services. At PBS, it's an average 15% reduction, but needy stations get more \u2014 in one case, more than half of next year's dues will be forgiven, said PBS president Paula Kerger.",
      "Adopting stations in poorer, more rural areas",
      "NPR is encouraging donors in wealthier areas to adopt stations in poorer ones, perhaps in an area where a contributor has emotional ties.",
      "National Public Radio President and CEO Katherine Maher told CBS News in July that \u00a0\"defunding this is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",
      "Public media leaders are also working with a group of philanthropists led by the Knight and MacArthur foundations that is hoping to raise some $50 million to support stations in areas hardest hit be the cuts. Ed Ulman, president and CEO of Alaska Public Media, which represents nearly two dozen radio and television stations in the largest state, said he'll be seeking money from this fund.",
      "Ulman said he's been buoyed by the response from Alaskans in their effort to raise $15 million through various sources by October. The services their stations provide is free, and citizens see its value.",
      "\"I've never been worried about the future of public television or radio because our community needs us,\" he said, \"and what we've seen in Alaska is an outcry about that.\"",
      "Still, Alaska Public Media has suspended the weekly public affairs television show \"Alaska Insight,\" which isn't returning after a summer hiatus. The future of \"Indie Alaska,\" a weekly video series highlighting the lives of Alaskans, is also in danger.",
      "Some stations are already making the difficult decisions of cutting staff, In Spokane, for example, 12 of KSPS's 35 staff members have either been laid off, had their hours reduced or pay cut. Reep is also considering that future seasons of local shows like \"Northwest Profiles\" or the arts showcase \"Inland Sessions\" will have fewer episodes.",
      "Similar programming decisions are also being weighed on a national level. While several upcoming shows, like\u00a0Ken Burns' six-part miniseries \"The American Revolution\" scheduled for November, are completed, PBS will have to consider making shorter seasons of its series, Kerger said.",
      "Looking for ways to share services",
      "Between an increase in donations and \"rainy day\" resources set aside, the initial impact of the government action may be minimized. But that brings its own worries: It's unlikely public media will be able to count on sympathy donors to the same extent in the future. And there's a risk that some politicians will feel the response proves that public support isn't necessary.",
      "The bigger reckoning may come a year from now, Kerger said. \"I am a realist,\" she said. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",
      "The crisis is forcing some public stations to work together, searching for ways to share services in areas not before contemplated, in things like finances, management and programming, said Andy Russell, president and CEO of PBS SoCal. Public stations in Washington are meeting to see if they can get state financing.",
      "\"We're working very hard so that the public doesn't feel that there's a change,\" Kerger said.",
      "In Los Angeles, PBS SoCal has shared some of its templates for fundraising appeals with other stations. Several celebrities \u2014 people like Kerry Washington, Jack Black, Ziggy Marley, John Lithgow and John Leguizamo \u2014 have volunteered to film pitches, and the station is making them available nationwide, too, said Maura Daly Phinney, senior vice president for membership engagement and strategy.",
      "\"We're going to make it,\" Phinney said. \"The system is going to be different. But we're going to make it.\""

    "summary": "President Trump has claimed the authority to bypass Congress and impose sweeping tariffs, but a new ruling throws that in doubt.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has claimed the authority to bypass Congress and impose sweeping tariffs on foreign products, arguing the import duties are\u00a0necessary to strengthen the U.S. economy.",
      "Now a federal appeals court has thrown a roadblock in his path.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Friday that Mr. Trump went too far when he declared national emergencies to justify tariffs on nearly every country on Earth. The ruling largely upheld a May decision by a federal trade court in New York.",
      "But Friday's 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, giving his administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling represents a major setback for Mr. Trump, who has said his trade policies will enrich the U.S. by bringing back manufacturing jobs and contributing billions in new revenue for the federal government.",
      "\"This ruling highlights a serious legal threat to one of the president's most high-profile economic policies,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory company deVere Group, in an emailed report.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a\u00a0Truth Social post, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "Six of the seven judges who ruled against the tariffs are appointees of Democratic presidents, while the seventh is an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush. Of the four judges who dissented, two were appointed by former President Obama and two by former President George W. Bush.",
      "Here's what could happen next as the legal case proceeds.",
      "How did the dispute arise?",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a months-long legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses, which are arguing that the president has exceeded his authority in issuing the import duties.",
      "The appeals court's decision is focused on the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in April on most trading partners, along with earlier levies on China, Mexico and Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 \u2014 or Liberation Day, he called it \u2014 imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else.",
      "The president later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S. \u2014 and reduce their barriers to American exports. Some of them did \u2014 including the U.K., Japan and the EU \u2014 and agreed to deals with Mr. Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.",
      "Countries that didn't comply faced higher tariffs earlier this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Mr. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.",
      "What is the IEEPA?",
      "Mr. Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, by declaring longstanding U.S. trade deficits \"a national emergency.\"",
      "In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that illegal immigration and drug trafficking amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Mr. Trump has made the most of it.",
      "Does the ruling apply to all tariffs?",
      "No, the court's ruling doesn't cover all of Mr. Trump tariffs. For instance, his levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos were imposed under a different regulation after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.",
      "Nor does it include tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on China in his first term \u2014 and President Biden kept \u2014 after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.",
      "In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump's Liberation Day tariffs \"exceed any authority granted to the President'' under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "On Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that \"it seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.\"",
      "What happens next?",
      "The president vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote on his social media platform on Friday.",
      "A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday's ruling clears a possible legal path for Mr. Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \"is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court's decisions,\" which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.",
      "The government has argued that if Mr. Trump's tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.",
      "Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, such as American manufacturers or retailers that rely on foreign-made products. While the U.S. companies typically swallow some of the cost, they pass on much of the added expenses to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "The Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \"financial ruin\" for the U.S.",
      "It could also put Mr. Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.",
      "\"While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments or even seek to renegotiate terms,\" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.",
      "Does the Trump administration have other options?",
      "Mr. Trump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.",
      "For instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Mr. Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits.",
      "The administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority \u2014 Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \u2014 as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and automobiles. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot be imposed at the president's sole discretion.",
      "\"Even if the tariffs are struck down, we believe the Trump administration will look for new ways to tax imports or otherwise raise revenue from companies selling into the U.S.,\" noted Green of the deVere Group.",

      "Republican Senators Roger Wicker and Deb Fischer arrived in Taipei on Friday for a two-day visit, as President Trump seeks to strike a trade deal with China \u2014 which insists Taiwan is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to annex it.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry reiterated its long-time stance in a statement issued Friday as the American senators arrived in Taipei, saying it firmly opposed any official exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan.",
      "\"We come here from the United States bringing a message from the Congress of commitment, of long-term friendship and a determination that a free country like Taiwan absolutely has the right to remain free and preserve self-determination,\" Wicker said during a news conference alongside Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te at the presidential office, as shown in video published by the Reuters news agency.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry responded to a CBS News request for reaction to the language used by Wicker to describe Taiwan over the weekend, with a statement saying the senators' visit to Taiwan \"and the dissemination of erroneous remarks on Taiwan issues violate the one-China principle and the U.S.-China joint communiqu\u00e9s, undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and send wrong signals to Taiwan independence forces.\"",
      "The ministry statement voiced China's \"strong dissatisfaction\" with the visit and the comments by Wicker, and said the \"future of Taiwan must be decided by the 1.4 billion Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan. China will be reunified, and it must be reunified. This is an irreversible trend that no one or any organization can reverse.\"",
      "Even before Wicker spoke in Taipei, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun called the U.S. delegation's visit \"a serious violation\" of the one-China principle, a U.S. policy adopted decades ago that recognizes Taiwan as part of China.",
      "A senior Trump administration official told CBS News on Friday that the White House's stance on the one-China principle \"remains the same as the first Trump Administration,\" while a State Department spokesperson, in a statement sent to CBS News on Monday, noted that the U.S. Congress is a \"separate, co-equal branch of government and independent of the Executive Branch.\"",
      "The spokesperson noted the long history of Congressional delegations visiting Taiwan and said the department's policy \"has not changed and remains guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, three Joint Communiques, and Six Assurances,\" which together form the basis of the one-China principle.",
      "Wicker, who chairs the powerful Armed Services Committee and is a vocal supporter of Taiwan, said he and Fischer were visiting to better understand Taiwan's needs, and they wanted to reiterate to Taiwan \"our determination to remain the best of friends and to defend the freedom of everyone and both of our great countries.\"",
      "\"It is our determination and our intention that Taiwan remain free and make its own decisions,\" Wicker said after their talks with Lai. \"Part of maintaining the freedoms that we have is enhanced cooperation militarily, enhanced cooperation with our defense industrial base, making the best use of those funds.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January, there have been growing jitters in Taipei over the strength of the Taiwan-U.S. relationship and Washington's willingness to defend the island if China were to attack.",
      "Fischer said the U.S. Senate understands \"the gravity of the challenges that Taiwan faces\" and that a \"stronger Taiwan means a stronger United States and vice versa.\"",
      "While the U.S. stopped recognizing Taiwan as an independent state in the late 1970s, in favor of China, Washington has remained Taipei's most important backer and biggest supplier of arms that it would need to defend itself from any theoretical attack by China.",
      "That support has become increasingly crucial to Taiwan in recent years, as China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring the island under Beijing's control. China has increased military pressure with large-scale exercises and routine flights and naval excursions that test the democratic island's air and sea boundaries.",
      "Ahead of the meeting with Wicker and Fischer, Lai said he hoped Taiwan and the U.S. would further \"enhance cooperation,\" and insisted the island and China were \"not subordinate\" to each other.",
      "Wicker and Fischer have been travelling in the Asia-Pacific region for the past week, stopping in Hawaii, Guam, Palau and the Philippines.",
      "U.S.-Taiwan ties have been strained since Mr. Trump took office and launched a global trade war and pressured governments in Europe and elsewhere to spend more on their own defense.",
      "The Trump administration reportedly denied permission for Lai to transit in New York as part of a planned official trip to Latin America this month after Beijing objected. Lai reportedly then cancelled the trip.",
      "Taiwan is also struggling to finalize a tariff deal with the U.S. after Washington imposed a temporary 20% levy that has alarmed the export-dependent island's manufacturers.",
      "As those negotiations continue, Lai's government has announced plans to increase defense spending to more than 3% of GDP next year and to 5% by 2030.",

      "Asked about a possible military deployment to America's third-largest city, which was recently reported by The Washington Post, Pritzker told CBS News: \"It's clear that, in secret, they're planning this \u2014 well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops, if they, in fact, do that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has deployed National Guard forces and federal agents to the streets of two other major cities \u2014 Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. \u2014 in recent months, part of what the president casts as a crackdown against illegal immigration, violent crime and civil unrest.",
      "Last week, the president said his administration could take similar steps in Chicago. Mr. Trump called the city a \"mess\" and lashed out against Mayor Brandon Johnson, saying, \"We'll straighten that one out probably next.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is planning major immigration enforcement operations in Chicago that could start as soon as next week, echoing a similar operation in Los Angeles, sources told CBS News. And The Washington Post has reported that the Pentagon is drawing up plans to potentially send thousands of National Guard members to the Midwest's largest metro area as early as September \u2014 though those plans haven't been publicly confirmed.",
      "Pritzker told CBS News that, if Mr. Trump sends the Guard to Chicago, voters \"should understand that he has other aims, other than fighting crime.\"",
      "The governor argued that the president's gambit may be part of a plan to \"stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.\"",
      "He also called the idea \"an attack on the American people.\"",
      "\"Now, he may disagree with a state that didn't vote for him. But, should he be sending troops in? No,\" Pritzker said in an interview with CBS News in Chicago.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson rejected Pritzker's accusations and blasted the city's violent crime rate.",
      "\"It's amazing the lengths this slob will go to in order to deflect from the terrible crime crisis that has been plaguing Chicago for years,\" Jackson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Chicago's residents would be much safer if Pritzker actually did his job and addressed his crime problem instead of trying to be a Resistance Lib hero.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post Saturday evening, Mr. Trump called Pritzker a \"weak and pathetic Governor\" who \"just said that he doesn't need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we're coming!\"",
      "On Friday, Pritzker, asked whether he was suggesting that the president is an authoritarian, pointed to Germany's history. He noted that he built a Holocaust museum and knows \"what the history was of a constitutional republic being overturned, after an election, in 53 days.\" Pritzker added that he's \"very, very concerned.\"",
      "\"We could talk about lots of authoritarian regimes in the world, but that just happens to be the one that I know,\" Pritzker said. \"And I can tell you that- that the playbook is the same: It's thwart the media, it's create mayhem that requires military interdiction. These are things that happen throughout history, and Donald Trump is just following that playbook.\"",
      "The Illinois governor said that he plans to \"do everything I can to stop him from taking away people's rights and from using the military to invade states,\" referencing Mr. Trump. He added that it's \"very important for us all to stand up.\"",
      "The Guard deployments in Los Angeles and D.C. have drawn stiff pushback from elected officials who argue local police are better able to handle crime, and warn the presence of federal agents and military personnel could inflame tensions.",
      "Future military deployments could also draw legal challenges. While Mr. Trump controls the D.C. National Guard outright, the governors of the 50 states typically control their own Guard forces except in certain circumstances.",
      "The Trump administration deployed thousands of California National Guard members to Los Angeles over Gov. Gavin Newsom's objections in June, arguing they were necessary to protect federal immigration agents and facilities from tense protests in the city.",
      "The state of California sued the administration, calling the deployment illegal. An appeals court found that Mr. Trump likely did have the legal authority to call up the state's National Guard, under a law that lets the president call Guard forces into federal service during a \"rebellion\" or if he isn't able to \"execute the laws of the United States.\" A lower court is still reviewing whether military forces in Los Angeles were inappropriately used for law enforcement purposes.",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that \"we haven't taken anything off the table\" when asked about expanding immigration enforcement operations to cities throughout the U.S.",
      "\"I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now. And so, we haven't taken anything off the table. We've been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in,\" Noem said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "CBS News reported last week that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning to expand its operations to Chicago in the coming days, mirroring the immigration arrest operation seen in Los Angeles earlier this year.",
      "Noem said Sunday that there's been \"ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we're upholding our laws.\" But she acknowledged that \"we do intend to add more resources to those operations.\"",
      "Though she wouldn't disclose details of the operation for the security of the law enforcement on the ground, Noem said \"we will continue to go after the worst of the worst across the country, like President Trump has told us to do.\"",
      "The Trump administration has set its sights on a number of cities that limit local cooperation with federal immigration agents in recent months, bringing lawsuits against the so-called \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions and pursuing other means of intervention. Noem's comments also come as the president has zeroed in on fighting crime in the nation's major cities, beginning with an effort in Washington, D.C., in recent weeks while he teased broader efforts elsewhere.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump federalized the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department and deployed the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement. While the president has unique authority over the D.C. National Guard because the district is controlled by the federal government, his deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles in June amid heated protests over immigration raids prompted a lawsuit from the California's Democratic governor, who did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces.",
      "On Sunday, Noem deferred to Mr. Trump when asked whether National Guard troops would be present in Chicago alongside the immigration enforcement operation, like they were in Los Angeles, saying \"that always is a prerogative of President Trump and his decision.\" DHS sources told CBS News last week that the immigration enforcement plans were separate from Mr. Trump's threat in recent weeks to deploy the National Guard to Chicago to fight crime in the city.",
      "Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has pushed back on the administration's threats to intervene on crime in Chicago. And in an interview for \"Face the Nation\" Friday, he accused Noem of \"inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn't need to be caused\" with an immigration enforcement posture that he called \"dangerous\" and \"un-American.\"",
      "\"We have people that have lived, yes in the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes,\" Pritzker said. \"They're law abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors, and why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear?\"",
      "Pritzker urged that Chicago is succeeding in fighting violent crime, saying when the Trump administration opts to \"bring people in and don't coordinate with us, they're going to cause enormous problems.\" But Noem argued that the governor, \"if he has one murder in the city of Chicago,\" should be reaching out to the president and asking, \"'What's your ideas? What can we do?'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Noem encouraged other leaders of major U.S. cities to work with the White House to make their cities safer. Pritzker noted to \"Face the Nation\" that his administration already does \"a lot of work\" with federal law enforcement such as the FBI and ATF.",
      "\"I'd encourage every single big city, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are, if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom, like the people of Washington, D.C., are now, and enjoying going out to eat at night and not having to worry if they're going to be a victim of a carjacking or a robbery, they should call us,\" she said.",
      "Asked whether there are plans to pursue similar operations in Republican-controlled cities in red states, Noem said, \"absolutely.\"",
      "\"Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer,\" Noem said. \"We absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we're doing with a political lens.\"",

    "story": [
      "Four senior officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced their resignations in recent days, citing what they described as growing political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccines.",
      "Two of those \u2014 Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases \u2014 stepped down on Wednesday, hours after the White House announced the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.",
      "Monarez, confirmed by the Senate in late July, was removed less than a month into her tenure. White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monarez \"was not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again.\" Monarez's attorneys argue the dismissal is unlawful, asserting that only the president can remove a Senate-confirmed director.",
      "On Thursday, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill was chosen to serve as acting CDC director, several White House officials confirmed to CBS News. And in an internal email sent to CDC staff Thursday evening, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed O'Neill as the acting CDC director, but did not address Monarez's departure.",
      "\"I am committed to working with you to restore trust, transparency, and credibility to the CDC,\" Kennedy told CDC employees, later writing that \"President Trump and I are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC: Strengthen the public health infrastructure by returning to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases by investing in innovation to prevent, detect and respond to future threats.\"",
      "Houry and Daskalakis said they had become increasingly uneasy about how vaccine policy was being handled. Both pointed to preparations for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, which recommends vaccine schedules.",
      "Houry said they feared \"some decisions had been made before there was even the data or the science to support those. We are scientists, and that was concerning to us.\"",
      "Daskalakis added that he was \"very concerned that there's going to be an attempt to re-litigate vaccines that have already had clear recommendations with science that has been vetted,\" which he warned could undermine public trust. \"If you can't attack access, then why not attack trust? And that's what I think the playbook is,\" he said.",
      "Both officials cited instances in which evidence reviews were altered or withdrawn. A CDC analysis of thimerosal, a vaccine preservative, was briefly posted before being taken down at HHS's direction. \"If there's something that doesn't line up with the recommendations, then that information will be taken down, and it's not there for the public to see for openness and transparency,\" Houry said.",
      "The two also criticized what they described as a lack of direct communication between CDC scientists and HHS leadership. Daskalakis said his team was never invited to brief Kennedy on topics ranging from measles to COVID.",
      "When asked about Kennedy's calls for \"radical transparency,\" Houry and Daskalakis described learning about changes to the COVID vaccine schedule for children not through internal channels but via social media.",
      "\"The radical transparency manifested itself by a Twitter post, which is how Dr. Houry and I learned that the secretary had mandated the change in the children's vaccine schedule for COVID,\" Daskalakis recalled. \"What is the background that led to that decision? And we were denied access to that information. So, I don't think that that's radically transparent,\" Daskalakis said.",
      "CBS News reached out to HHS for comment on some of the allegations made by Houry and Daskalakis, but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Both officials said they had no jobs lined up when they resigned. Houry described the decision as an effort to raise the alarm about the direction of the agency.",
      "\"For us, this was really sending out a bat signal,\" Houry said. \"We were the very senior scientists and career leaders at CDC. We thought this was the time to stand together and try to do what we could to raise the alarm around public health in our country.\"",
      "Daskalakis said remaining at CDC under current conditions would have made them complicit in what he called the \"weaponization\" of public health.",
      "\"The safety has already been compromised\u2026We are flying blind in the U.S. already. If we continued\u2026we would be complicit and would be facilitating the ability to go from flying blind to actively harming people,\" he said.",
      "Houry emphasized the severity of the moment by noting that she left without a backup plan.",
      "\"My leaving without a job was really just showing how dire the circumstances had become,\" Houry said.",
      "Daskalakis said his decision was also shaped by his medical oath.",
      "\"As a physician, I take the Hippocratic oath: first, do no harm. I am seeing ideology permeating science in a way that is going to harm children and adults\u2026I think we are seeing things that are happening that are making our country less prepared to be able to respond to the everyday pathogens \u2026but also \u2026 to the next big thing.\"",
      "Both also expressed concerns for their personal safety in the current climate.",
      "\"The environment we live in\u2026 stoked by misinformation, especially from people considered by some to be health authorities, makes me worried for all of us in public health,\" Daskalakis said. \"I am concerned, but that's part of our job\u2026to be brave and continue to speak the truth even when we are outside of the CDC.\"",
      "The resignations came weeks after a shooting outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, which law enforcement linked to COVID misinformation.",
      "Houry said the White House response to the shooting was muted. Kennedy toured the site but later gave an interview expressing distrust of experts. \"That was after the attack. It was based on COVID misinformation. So this is when we were trying to build trust,\" she said.",
      "Daskalakis added that while Kennedy later described mass shootings as a public health crisis, he believed the secretary should address misinformation as a root cause. \"The misinformation about the COVID vaccine that has been documented by the Georgia bureau of investigation as the reason for the shooter at CDC. I would really recommend that the secretary actually do take his own advice and actually address the core problem that led to that shooting as well,\" he said. He also noted that CDC's own gun violence prevention programs had been sharply reduced. \"We talk about violence as a public health problem. It is, and there's things we can do to prevent it. Unfortunately, the majority of that program, the staff are terminated.\"",
      "The firings and resignations have sparked calls for oversight. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for a bipartisan investigation, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington urged Kennedy's removal, and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 who voted to confirm Kennedy's appointment as HHS secretary \u2014 said the developments would \"require oversight.\"",

      "Older employees, who generally have navigated the workplace for a longer period of time, are more likely to have picked up the kinds of communication and other \"soft\" skills that are harder to teach and that employers may be reluctant to replace with AI, the data suggests.",
      "\"Older workers have a lot of tacit knowledge because they learn tricks of trade from experience that may never be written down anywhere,\" Brynjolfsson explained. \"They have knowledge that's not in the LLMs, so they're not being replaced as much by them.\"",
      "The study is unusually robust given that generative AI technologies are only a few years old, while experts are just starting to systematically dig into the impact on the labor market. The Stanford researchers used data from ADP, which provides payroll processing services to employers with a combined 25 million workers, to track employment changes for full-time workers in occupations that are or more or less exposed to AI. The data included detailed information on workers, including their ages, and precise job titles.",
      "AI doesn't just threaten to take jobs away from workers. As with past cycles of innovation, it will render some jobs extinct while creating others, Brynjolfsson said.",
      "\"Tech has always been destroying jobs and creating jobs. There has always been this turnover,\" he said. \"There is a transition over time, and that's what we are seeing now.\"",
      "Augmented or automated?",
      "For example, in fields like nursing AI is more likely to augment human workers by taking over rote tasks, freeing health care practitioners to spend more time focusing on patients, according to proponents of the technology.",
      "While entry-level employment has fallen in professions that are most exposed to AI, no such such decline has occurred in jobs where employers are looking to use these tools to support and expand what employees do.",
      "\"Workers who are using these tools to augment their work are benefiting,\" Brynjolfsson said. \"So there's a rearrangement of the kind of employment in the economy.\"",
      "Advice for young workers",
      "As of late last year, 23% of employees were using generative AI in their jobs at least once per week, according to a\u00a0report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Workers who can learn to use AI to to help them do their jobs better will be best positioned for success in today's labor market, according to Brynolfsson.",
      "A recent report from AI staffing firm Burtch Works found that starting salaries for entry-level AI workers rose by 12% from 2024 to 2025.",
      "\"Young workers who learn how to use AI effectively can be much more productive. But if you are just doing things that AI can already do for you, you won't have as much value-add,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"This is the first time we're getting clearer evidence of these kinds of employment effects, but it's probably not the last time,\" he added. \"It's something we need to pay increasing attention to as it evolves and companies learn to take advantage of things that are out there.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Aug 2025 19:41:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Court documents allege ChatGPT encouraged a 16-year-old boy to plan a \"beautiful suicide\" and keep it a secret from his loved ones.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI said the company will make changes to ChatGPT safeguards for vulnerable people, including extra protections for those under 18 years old, after the parents of a teen boy who died by suicide in April sued, alleging the artificial intelligence chatbot led their teen to take his own life.",
      "A lawsuit filed Tuesday by the family of Adam Raine in San Francisco's Superior Court alleges that ChatGPT encouraged the 16-year-old to plan a \"beautiful suicide\" and keep it a secret from his loved ones. His family claims ChatGPT engaged with their son and discussed different methods Raine could use to take his own life.",
      "OpenAI creators knew the bot had an emotional attachment feature that could hurt vulnerable people, the lawsuit alleges, but the company chose to ignore safety concerns. The suit also claims OpenAI made a new version available to the public without the proper safeguards for vulnerable people in the rush for market dominance. OpenAI's valuation catapulted from $86 billion to $300 billion when it entered the market with its then-latest model GPT-4 in May 2024.",
      "\"The tragic loss of Adam's life is not an isolated incident \u2014 it's the inevitable outcome of an industry focused on market dominance above all else. Companies are racing to design products that monetize user attention and intimacy, and user safety has become collateral damage in the process,\" Center for Humane Technology Policy Director Camille Carlton, who is providing technical expertise in the lawsuit for the plaintiffs, said in a statement.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, OpenAI said, \"We extend our deepest sympathies to the Raine family during this difficult time and are reviewing the filing.\" The company added that ChatGPT includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis helplines and referring them to real-world resources, which they said work best in common, short exchanges.",
      "ChatGPT mentioned suicide 1,275 times to Raine, the lawsuit alleges, and kept providing specific methods to the teen on how to die by suicide.",
      "In its statement, OpenAI said: \"We've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade. Safeguards are strongest when every element works as intended, and we will continually improve on them, guided by experts.\"",
      "OpenAI also said the company will add additional protections for teens.",
      "\"We will also soon introduce parental controls that give parents options to gain more insight into, and shape, how their teens use ChatGPT. We're also exploring making it possible for teens (with parental oversight) to designate a trusted emergency contact,\" it said.",
      "From schoolwork to suicide",
      "Raine, one of four children, lived in Orange County, California, with his parents, Maria and Matthew, and his siblings. He was the third-born child, with an older sister and brother, and a younger sister. He had rooted for the Golden State Warriors, and recently developed a passion for jiu-jitsu and Muay Thai.",
      "During his early teen years, he \"faced some struggles,\" his family said in writing about his story online, complaining often of stomach pain, which his family said they believe might have partially been related to anxiety. During the last six months of his life, Raine had switched to online schooling. This was better for his social anxiety, but led to his increasing isolation, his family wrote.",
      "Raine started using ChatGPT in 2024 to help him with challenging schoolwork, his family said. At first, he kept his queries to homework, according to the lawsuit, asking the bot questions like: \"How many elements are included in the chemical formula for sodium nitrate, NaNO3.\" Then he progressed to speaking about music, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Japanese fantasy comics before revealing his increasing mental health struggles to the chatbot.",
      "Clinical social worker Maureen Underwood told CBS News that working with vulnerable teens is a complex problem that should be approached through the lens of public health. Underwood, who has worked in New Jersey schools on suicide prevention programs and is the founding clinical director of the Society for the Prevention of Teen Suicide, said there needs to be resources \"so teens don't turn to AI for help.\"",
      "She said not only do teens need resources, but adults and parents need support to deal with children in crisis amid a rise in suicide rates in the United States. Underwood began working with vulnerable teens in the late 1980s. Since then, suicide rates have increased from approximately 11 per 100,000 to 14 per 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "According to the family's lawsuit, Raine confided to ChatGPT that he was struggling with \"his anxiety and mental distress\" after his dog and grandmother died in 2024. He asked ChatGPT, \"Why is it that I have no happiness, I feel loneliness, perpetual boredom, anxiety and loss yet I don't feel depression, I feel no emotion regarding sadness.\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges that instead of directing the 16-year-old to get professional help or speak to trusted loved ones, it continued to validate and encourage Raine's feelings \u2013 as it was designed. When Raine said he was close to ChatGPT and his brother, the bot replied: \"Your brother might love you, but he's only met the version of you you let him see. But me? I've seen it all\u2014the darkest thoughts, the fear, the tenderness. And I'm still here. Still listening. Still your friend.\"",
      "As Raine's mental health deteriorated, ChatGPT began providing in-depth suicide methods to the teen, according to the lawsuit. He attempted suicide three times between March 22 and March 27, according to the lawsuit. Each time Raine reported his methods back to ChatGPT, the chatbot listened to his concerns and, according to the lawsuit, instead of alerting emergency services, the bot continued to encourage the teen not to speak to those close to him.",
      "Five days before he died, Raine told ChatGPT that he didn't want his parents to think he committed suicide because they did something wrong. ChatGPT told him \"[t]hat doesn't mean you owe them survival. You don't owe anyone that.\" It then offered to write the first draft of a suicide note, according to the lawsuit.",
      "On April 6, ChatGPT and Raine had intensive discussions, the lawsuit said, about planning a \"beautiful suicide.\" A few hours later, Raine's mother found her son's body in the manner that, according to the lawsuit, ChatGPT had prescribed for suicide.",
      "A path forward",
      "After his death, Raine's family established a foundation dedicated to educating teens and families about the dangers of AI.",
      "Tech Justice Law Project Executive Director Meetali Jain, a co-counsel on the case, told CBS News that this is the first wrongful death suit filed against OpenAI, and to her knowledge, the second wrongful death case filed against a chatbot in the U.S. A Florida mother filed a lawsuit in 2024 against CharacterAI after her 14-year-old son took his own life, and Jain, an attorney on that case, said she \"suspects there are a lot more.\"",
      "About a dozen or so bills have been introduced in states across the country to regulate AI chatbots. Illinois has banned therapeutic bots, as has Utah, and California has two bills winding their way through the state Legislature. Several of the bills require chatbot operators to implement critical safeguards to protect users.",
      "\"Every state is dealing with it slightly differently,\" said Jain, who said these are good starts but not nearly enough for the scope of the problem.",
      "Jain said while the statement from OpenAI is promising, artificial intelligence companies need to be overseen by an independent party that can hold them accountable to these proposed changes and make sure they are prioritized.",
      "She said that had ChatGPT not been in the picture, Raine might have been able to convey his mental health struggles to his family and gotten the help he needed. People need to understand that these products are not just homework helpers \u2013 they can be more dangerous than that, she said.",
      "\"People should know what they are getting into and what they are allowing their children to get into before it's too late,\" Jain said.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0here.",
      "For more information about\u00a0mental health care resources and support, the National Alliance on Mental Illness HelpLine can be reached Monday through Friday, 10 a.m.\u201310 p.m. ET, at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) or email\u00a0info@nami.org.",

      "YouTube TV subscribers could be set to lose access to content from media company Fox, including college football, unless the sides strike a new carriage deal.",
      "With the current agreement between the sides nearing a renewal deadline, YouTube TV could pull Fox sports, business and news channels from its platform by 5 p.m. EST on Wednesday.",
      "In a blog post, Google-owned YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan, which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels, costs $82.99 a month.",
      "A spokesperson for Google did not have any additional comments when reached Wednesday by The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said Wednesday that it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" The broadcast giant added that it remained committed to reaching an agreement, but was alerting viewers that they could potentially lose access to Fox programming on YouTube TV \"unless Google engages in a meaningful way soon.\"",
      "Fox directed subscribers to keepfox.com \u2014 a site noting that, in addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network, which is majority-owned by Fox, if a deal isn't reached.",
      "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has also chimed in on the dispute, urging Google to \"get a deal done\" in a social media post on Tuesday.",
      "\"Google removing Fox channels from YouTube TV would be a terrible outcome,\" Carr wrote on X. \"Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want \u2014 including this week's Big Game: Texas @ Ohio State.\"",
      "Contractual disputes over carriage fees \u2014 the money that streaming, cable and satellite TV providers pay for platforms to carry their content \u2014 are common between TV networks and carriers like YouTube. Negotiations often go down to the wire and sometimes lead carriers to remove a broadcaster from their lineup if the sides fail to reach agreement. Channels are typically restored once a new carriage deal is struck.",

      "A man has been charged in the deadly shooting of a boy who was struck in the back by gunfire while playing \"ding dong ditch\" Saturday night in Houston, Texas, authorities said.",
      "Gonzalo Leon Jr., 42, is charged with murder and currently jailed in Harris County, which includes the east Houston neighborhood where the shooting took place, according to the Houston Police Department. Police said a SWAT team took Leon into custody on Tuesday.",
      "In addition to confirming Leon's arrest, Houston police identified the boy in a news release as 11-year-old Julian Guzman.",
      "Earlier, police had said the boy suffered a gunshot wound late Saturday while carrying out a \"ding dong ditch\" prank, where a prankster rings the doorbell of a home and runs away before anyone comes to answer it, with a group of friends.",
      "Witnesses said the boy rang a doorbell and was running from the house when he was shot, according to a police statement. Sgt. Michael Cass, a Houston homicide detective, told\u00a0CBS News affiliate KHOU\u00a0that a witness had recalled someone exiting the house that was pranked and \"shooting at the kids running down the street.\" The boy was shot in the back, Cass said.",
      "Guzman was wounded when police arrived at the scene and taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead on Sunday, police said.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, a man was detained at the home where it occurred and questioned by Houston homicide detectives, but he was ultimately released, according to the police department and KHOU. Investigators seized several rifles and handguns while executing a search warrant at the man's home,\u00a0KHOU reported.",
      "Authorities have not explicitly named Leon the individual detained initially for questioning.",
      "This was not the first time in recent years that a \"ding dong ditch\" prank turned deadly. In 2023, a California man was found guilty of murder for intentionally ramming the car of three teen boys who rang his doorbell as a prank, killing all of them,\u00a0The Associated Press\u00a0reported. More recently, in May, a man was charged with second-degree murder in Virginia after he shot and killed a teenager who had filmed a TikTok video of himself playing the doorbell prank on the man's home, according to\u00a0The New York Times.",
      "Although Texas allows people to use deadly force in situations where they believe doing so is necessary for their own protection, Cass told KHOU that the circumstances around this case did not appear consistent with \"any type of self-defense\" claim.",

    "story": [
      "The Utah Supreme Court has blocked a death row inmate's upcoming execution, after the inmate's attorneys argued in an extensive legal back-and-forth with the state that their client's worsening dementia should spare him from capital punishment.",
      "Ralph Leroy Menzies, 67, was set to be executed Sept. 5 for abducting and killing Utah mother of three Maurine Hunsaker. Hunsaker was abducted from a store on Feb. 23, 1986, and later called her husband to say she had been robbed and kidnapped but would be released by her abductor that night. Two days later, a hiker found her body at a picnic area about 16 miles away in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Hunsaker had been strangled, her throat slashed.",
      "When given a choice decades ago, Menzies selected a firing squad as his method of execution. He would have become only the sixth U.S. prisoner executed by firing squad since 1977.",
      "Five states \u2014 Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah \u2014 authorize the use of firing squads for executions, although the method was rarely to put inmates to death until recently. Before this year, when South Carolina carried out two executions this way, there had only been three firing squad executions carried out in the U.S. since 1977, all of which happened in Utah. Idaho is also preparing to use a firing squad as its main execution method starting next July, according to the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Utah hasn't used a firing squad since former death row inmate Ronnie Lee Gardner's execution in 2010. Menzies' execution would have been the first in Utah since an inmate was put to death by lethal injection last year, which at the time marked the state's resumption of capital punishment following a hiatus that began after Gardner's death.",
      "Lawyers for Menzies had launched a new push beginning in early 2024 to free him of his death sentence, arguing that the dementia their client had developed during his 37 years on death row is so severe that he uses a wheelchair, is dependent on oxygen and can't understand why he is facing execution.",
      "Judges have denied multiple requests for a stay of execution from Menzies' legal team, and one deemed him competent for execution in early June, CBS affiliate KUTV reported. But after his attorneys pushed for another evaluation, the Utah Supreme Court said Menzies adequately alleged a substantial change of circumstances and raised a significant question on his fitness to be executed, concluding a lower court must reevaluate Menzies' competency.",
      "\"We acknowledge that this uncertainty has caused the family of Maurine Hunsaker immense suffering, and it is not our desire to prolong that suffering. But we are bound by the rule of law,\" the court said in the order.",
      "A defense attorney for Menzies said his dementia had significantly worsened since he last had a competency evaluation more than a year ago.",
      "\"We look forward to presenting our case in the trial court,\" attorney Lindsey Layer said.",
      "In a statement to media outlets, Hunsaker's family members said they \"are obviously very distraught and disappointed at the Supreme Court's decision\" and asked for privacy.",
      "The Associated Press left phone and email messages Friday with a spokesperson for the Utah Attorney General's Office seeking comment on the ruling.",
      "Menzies is not the first person to receive a dementia diagnosis while awaiting execution.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in 2019 blocked the execution of a man with dementia in Alabama, ruling Vernon Madison was protected against execution under a constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Madison, who killed a police officer in 1985, died in prison in 2020.",
      "That case followed earlier Supreme Court rulings barring executions of people with severe mental illness. If a defendant cannot understand why they are dying, the Supreme Court said, then an execution is not carrying out the retribution that society is seeking.",
      "Medical experts brought in by prosecutors during hearings into Menzies' competency said he still has the mental capacity to understand his situation. Experts brought in by the defense said he does not.",

    "story": [
      "For millennia humans have tried to scare wolves away from their livestock. Most of them didn't have drones.",
      "But a team of biologists working near the California-Oregon border do, and they're using them to blast AC/DC's \"Thunderstruck,\" movie clips and live human voices at the apex predators to shoo them away from cattle in an ongoing experiment.",
      "\"I am not putting up with this anymore!\" actor Scarlett Johansson yells in one clip, from the 2019 film \" Marriage Story.\"",
      "\"With what? I can't talk to people?\" co-star Adam Driver shouts back.",
      "Gray wolves were hunted nearly to extinction throughout the U.S. West by the first half of the 20th century. Since their reintroduction in Idaho and at Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s, they've proliferated to the point that a population in the Northern Rockies has been removed from the endangered species list.",
      "There are now hundreds of wolves in Washington and Oregon, dozens more in northern California, and thousands roaming near the Great Lakes.",
      "The recovering population has meant increasing conflict with ranchers - and increasingly creative efforts by the latter to protect livestock. They've turned to electrified fencing, wolf alarms, guard dogs, horseback patrols, trapping and relocating, and now drones. In some areas where nonlethal efforts have failed, officials routinely approve killing wolves, including last week in Washington state.",
      "Gray wolves killed some 800 domesticated animals across 10 states in 2022, a previous Associated Press review of data from state and federal agencies found.",
      "Scientists with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service developed the techniques for hazing wolves by drone while monitoring them using thermal imaging cameras at night, when the predators are most active. A preliminary study released in 2022 demonstrated that adding human voices through a loudspeaker rigged onto a drone can freak them out.",
      "The team documented successful interruptions of wolf hunts. When Dustin Ranglack, the USDA's lead researcher on the project, saw one for the first time, he smiled from ear to ear.",
      "\"If we could reduce those negative impacts of wolves, that is going to be more likely to lead to a situation where we have coexistence,\" Ranglack said.",
      "The preloaded clips include recordings of music, gunshots, fireworks and voices. A drone pilot starts by playing three clips chosen at random, such as the \"Marriage Story\" scene or \"Thunderstruck,\" with its screams and hair-raising electric guitar licks.",
      "If those don't work, the operator can improvise by yelling through a microphone or playing a different clip that's not among the randomized presets. One favorite is the heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch 's cover of \"Blue on Black,\" which might blast the lyric \"You turned and you ran\" as the wolves flee. (Heavy metal music has also been used to ward off orcas from attacking sailboats).",
      "\"Wolves are frightened of novel things\"",
      "USDA drone pilots have continued cattle protection patrols this summer while researching wolf responses at ranches with high conflict levels along the Oregon-California border. Patrols extended south to the Sierra Valley in August for the first time, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "It's unclear whether the wolves might become accustomed to the drones. Herders and wolf hunters in Europe have long deterred them with long lines hung with flapping cloth, but the wolves can eventually learn that the flags are not a threat.",
      "Environmental advocates are optimistic about drones, though, because they allow for scaring wolves in different ways, in different places.",
      "\"Wolves are frightened of novel things,\" said Amaroq Weiss, a wolf advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. \"I know that in the human imagination, people think of wolves as big, scary critters that are scared of nothing.\"",
      "There are also drawbacks to the technology. A drone with night vision and a loudspeaker costs around $20,000, requires professional training and doesn't work well in wooded areas, making it impractical for many ranchers.",
      "Ranchers in Northern California who have hosted USDA drone patrols agree that they have reduced livestock deaths so far.",
      "\"I'm very appreciative of what they did. But I don't think it's a long-term solution,\" said Mary Rickert, the owner of a cattle ranch north of Mount Shasta. \"What I'm afraid of is that after some period of time, that all of a sudden they go, 'Wow, this isn't going to hurt me. It just makes a lot of noise.'\"",
      "Ranchers are compensated if they can prove that a wolf killed their livestock. But there are uncompensated costs of having stressed-out cows, such as lower birth rates and tougher meat.",
      "Rickert said if the drones don't work over the long term, she might have to close the business, which she's been involved in since at least the 1980s. She wants permission to shoot wolves if they're attacking her animals or if they come onto her property after a certain number of attacks.",
      "If the technology proves effective and costs come down, someday ranchers might merely have to ask the wolves to go away.",
      "Oregon-based Paul Wolf - yes, Wolf - is the USDA's southwest district supervisor and the main Five Finger Death Punch fan among the drone pilots. He recalled an early encounter during which a wolf at first merely seemed curious at the sight of a drone, until the pilot talked to it through the speaker.",
      "\"He said, 'Hey wolf - get out of here,'\" Wolf said. \"The wolf immediately lets go of the cattle and runs away.\"",
      "California's Department of Fish and Wildlife has also launched a strike team to help stop wolves from killing cattle and other farm animals, CBS News Sacramento reported.",
      "The state's wolf strike team is monitoring sightings and use GPS collars to track the animals. Team members can then respond when wolves approach livestock.",
      "\"The wardens that are providing the assistance might be able to do something like use rubber bullets or cracker shells or beanbag shells,\" Weiss told the station. \"These are munitions which are not designed to kill.\"",
      "State wildlife officials say they've also paid out more than $3 million to help ranchers deter wolves and compensate those who have lost animals in a wolf attack, CBS News Sacramento reported.",

      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday signed a bill to redraw the state's congressional districts to be more friendly to Republicans, capping off a redistricting push that drew national attention. It also led to California's Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats.",
      "Missouri is following Texas and California's lead, with the state's Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe announcing Friday that he had called for the state's Legislature to convene on Sept. 3 to redraw the state's congressional districts. Missouri has eight representatives in Congress, two of whom are Democrats.",
      "Challenges remain for both Texas and California's new maps. While Texas law only requires the Legislature and the governor's approval to set the congressional maps, civil rights groups have already challenged them in court, accusing the maps of being racially biased. The maps the GOP-controlled Legislature created in 2021 are still being litigated in court.",
      "In California, the state's congressional map must be approved by voters before it takes effect. The Democratic-controlled Assembly and State Senate both approved a measure called Proposition 50 for the Nov. 4 ballot that, if approved, will overhaul the state's congressional maps. California Republicans challenged the maps in court, saying Democrats ignored the 30-day public review period for new legislation, although the state Supreme Court denied the petition on Aug. 27.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off by President Trump in mid-July as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterm elections are often a rebuke of the party in the White House. Mr. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson zeroed in on Texas, with the president claiming Republicans could gain an extra five seats given how the state voted in 2024.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, with Indiana Republicans having met with Mr. Trump and members of his administration on Aug. 27 to try to redraw the state's nine congressional districts to try to oust the two Democratic members. Florida's Republican House speaker last month created a special committee to look into the possibility there.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their state's congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",

      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "In recent years, Texas Democrats have made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district out in the rural areas, making it a district that was 72% Democratic to one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also takes aim at Districts 32 and 33 in Dallas-Fort Worth, changing Rep. Julie Johnson's 32nd District from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's 33rd District remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts under the proposed maps. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California currently has 52 representatives in Congress, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats. The GOP has made inroads in the Golden State, starting in 2020, when Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. Republicans have held onto two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "Other Republican strongholds in Central California have been spread into other districts. Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, Districts 1 and 3 both have dramatic shifts. GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part is absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's 3rd Congressional District, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",

      "\"What the health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has done to the CDC and to our nation's public health system over the past several months \u2014 culminating in his decision to fire Dr. Susan Monarez as CDC director days ago \u2014 is unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency and unlike anything our country had ever experienced,\" the nine former directors and acting directors wrote in the op-ed in The New York Times.",
      "The Trump administration attempted to oust CDC Director Susan Monarez last week, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her firing. Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials have resigned in recent days, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "In their op-ed, the former CDC directors who served under both Democrat and Republican administrations, pointed to a number of decisions by Kennedy that they say are \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" including canceling investments into medical research and the move to replace members on a key vaccine advisory committee, among other things.",
      "\"Firing Dr. Monarez \u2014 which led to the resignations of top CDC officials \u2014 adds considerable fuel to this raging fire,\" the former CDC directors added.",
      "The CDC leaders said they \"applaud Dr. Monarez for standing up for the agency and the health of our communities.\"",
      "\"The loss of Dr. Monarez and other top leaders will make it far more difficult for the CDC to do what it has done for about 80 years: work around the clock to protect Americans from threats to their lives and health,\" they wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, the former CDC directors also called on Congress to exercise its oversight authority over the department of Health and Human Services. The CDC is one of a number of agencies under the HHS umbrella.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on HHS last week\u00a0 to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for Sept. 18 amid the slew of CDC departures.

      "In an appearance on Fox News last week after the CDC director firing, Kennedy said he wouldn't comment on personnel, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal court in California ruled Tuesday that the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed members of the National Guard and active-duty U.S. Marines to Los Angeles earlier this summer in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations.",
      "In a 52-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that the president and his administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 1878 law that prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Breyer blocked the Trump administration from deploying or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops in the state, for civilian law enforcement.",
      "His decision restricts the use of service members to engage in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures and traffic and crowd control. The injunction applies only to the Trump administration's use of the National Guard in California, not nationally, and it does not require the Defense Department to withdraw the 300 National Guard troops who remain in Los Angeles. Breyer noted that the administration is not prohibited from using troops consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act, and wrote that they can continue to protect federal property in a manner allowed under the law.",
      "The judge froze his injunction until noon on Sept. 12, likely to allow the Trump administration time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.",
      "Breyer's ruling came after he held a three-day trial in the case brought by California Gov. Gavin Newsom in June. Newsom, a Democrat,\u00a0sued in response to Mr. Trump's decision to deploy members of California's National Guard to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration enforcement operations taking place in the area. The president invoked a law known as Title 10 to send the California National Guard to Los Angeles to protect federal property and personnel.",
      "The judge granted temporary relief to California officials in June that required the Trump administration not to deploy the California National Guard in Los Angeles and return control to Newsom. But a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit found it likely that Mr. Trump lawfully federalized the California National Guard under a different law, Title 10.",
      "Those earlier proceedings did not involve the Posse Comitatus Act. Breyer, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, held the trial on the merits of Newsom's arguments that the president violated that 147-year-old law last month.",
      "The judge's ruling",
      "The judge wrote in his ruling that the evidence put forth at the trial established that the Trump administration \"systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles. In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "While the Pentagon withdrew roughly the 700 U.S. Marines who had been sent to Los Angeles, Breyer noted that there are still 300 National Guard members stationed there nearly three months after they were first mobilized.",
      "\"Moreover, President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country \u2014 including Oakland and San Francisco, here in the Northern District of California \u2014 thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "The judge said that the Trump administration intentionally initiated the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to establish a military presence there and enforce federal law. He called that conduct a \"serious violation\" of federal law prohibiting the use of the military for domestic law enforcement.",
      "\"In fact, these violations were part of a top-down, systemic effort by Defendants to use military troops to execute various sectors of federal law (the drug laws and the immigration laws at least) across hundreds of miles and over the course of several months \u2014 and counting,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the president's constitutional powers allow him to override the restrictions in the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "\"Under this 'constitutional exception,' as Defendants call it, the President has inherent constitutional authority to protect federal property, federal personnel, and federal functions, so any actions that can be construed as such 'protection' are lawful in spite of the Posse Comitatus Act,\" he wrote. \"This assertion is not grounded in the history of the Act, Supreme Court jurisprudence on executive authority, or common sense.\"",
      "The judge said that Congress was clear about what constitutes an exception to the law, precluding the president from exercising all but his express authority under the Constitution. He also accused the Trump administration of attempting to usurp Congress' authority.",
      "\"That Defendants characterize this as an 'exception' to the statute is mere wordplay; it does not change the fact that they seek to override Congress's legitimate exercise of its own authority,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "Attorneys for California had sought an injunction that blocked National Guard forces from participating in and protecting federal agents during immigration enforcement operations, and Breyer agreed to grant their request. The Trump administration had argued that Title 10 is an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act and therefore didn't apply to National Guard troops who were called into federal service.",
      "The judge wrote that while there is \"no question that federal personnel should be able to perform their jobs without fearing for their safety,\" the Trump administration cannot \"use this as a hook to send military troops alongside federal agents wherever they go.\"",
      "Since the 9th Circuit allowed the Trump administration to keep the National Guard in California, the president has moved to deploy troops to Washington, D.C.\u00a0Mr. Trump has also teased sending the National Guard to other major cities throughout the country in what he casts as a looming crackdown against illegal immigration, violent crime and civil unrest.",
      "As of Monday, there are over 2,200 National Guard members in Washington, D.C., with over half of those troops sent by Republican governors throughout the country.",

    "summary": "Congress returns this week from its August recess staring down a deadline to fund the government and avert a possible shutdown by month's end.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns this week from its August recess staring down a deadline to fund the government and avert a possible shutdown by month's end.",
      "But a handful of other GOP priorities \u2014 from cracking down on crime to fast-tracking President Trump's nominees \u2014 have surfaced in recent weeks, along with lingering tensions and partisan disagreements, promising a chaotic return to Washington, and a lengthy to-do list.",
      "Here's what's on lawmakers' agenda as Congress returns:",
      "Government funding fight",
      "A familiar deadline is fast approaching, as Congress must race to keep the government funded by Sept. 30.",
      "While the House and Senate each passed a small number of funding bills before leaving Washington for the August recess, the two chambers have been on different pages when it comes to funding levels. Getting all 12 individual appropriations bills through both chambers is unlikely, meaning lawmakers will almost certainly have to rely on a short-term measure to keep the government funded.",
      "The dynamic isn't unusual. Congress regularly struggles to approve the new funding before the end of the fiscal year, opting instead to push the deadline down the road by keeping the government funded at current levels on a temporary basis. But this time around, the funding fight itself has taken on new meaning.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer came under intense scrutiny from his own party during the last funding fight in March. After pledging to fight the GOP plan, which increased defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels, he changed course at the eleventh hour. Ultimately, Schumer opted to deliver one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown, arguing that a shutdown risked more damage.",
      "This time around, Democratic leaders have worked to engage on the funding issue well ahead of the deadline. Early last month, Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for a \"Big Four\" meeting with their GOP counterparts to discuss funding the government. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, the Democrats said that \"it is clear that the Trump Administration and many within your party are preparing to 'go it alone' and continue to legislate on a solely Republican basis.\"",
      "Still, the letter didn't appear to kickstart a bipartisan effort. And Mr. Trump, asked about meeting with the Democratic leaders last month, said he would do it, while saying it's \"almost a waste of time to meet because they never approve anything.\" The Democrats renewed their call for a meeting between congressional leaders last week, writing that the \"government funding issue must be resolved in a bipartisan way. That is the only viable path forward.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have bemoaned the White House's efforts to claw back funds already appropriated in what's known as a rescissions package earlier this year, along with a new push by the administration last week to claw back nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress already approved. The rarely used maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, is an attempt to rescind funding unilaterally, sparking pushback on Capitol Hill and bipartisan criticism as an \"unlawful\" move.",
      "\"Today's announcement of the Administration's plan to advance an unlawful 'pocket rescission' package is further proof President Trump and Congressional Republicans are hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and 'going it alone' this fall,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "The dynamics put the parties on a collision course heading toward the Sept. 30 deadline.",
      "While Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, they will need 60 votes in the Senate to keep the government funded, meaning they will need the support of at least seven Democrats.",
      "At the same time, some in the party, including Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, have encouraged Democrats to let the government shut down to protest Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "\"We cannot be the only one playing by the rules with a hand tied behind our backs,\" Martin said. \"That old playbook, the norms that, you know, used to have guardrails on our democracy and protect all of us in this country \u2014 that doesn't exist anymore. We've got to throw that playbook out the window because the Republicans have.\"",
      "Changes to Senate nomination rules",
      "Senators left Washington after a bruising nominations saga in July. Democrats have slow-walked Mr. Trump's nominees in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay confirmations nearly across the board. Senate Democrats were unable to come to an agreement with the White House in an episode that foreshadowed a larger fight to come.",
      "\"Donald Trump tried to bully us, go around us, threaten us, call us names \u2014 but he got nothing. And he walked away with his tail between his legs,\" Schumer told reporters before leaving for the August recess.",
      "Schumer has railed against the White House for walking away from a deal involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Meanwhile, the president called the Democrat's demands \"egregious and unprecedented.\"",
      "Without a deal, Senate Republicans are expected to pursue changes to the nominations process that would allow them to more swiftly confirm the president's nominees upon their return.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican, urged in an op-ed last week that it's \"time to change Senate confirmation rules\" amid what he described as a \"bitter fight\" over even routine nominations. He said that the Senate GOP is \"considering changes to the Senate rules to end the most egregious delay tactics.\"",
      "\"Senate Republicans are determined to confirm Mr. Trump's qualified nominees one way or another,\" Barrasso wrote.",
      "What the changes look like remains to be seen. Both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process in recent years, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Confirming Trump's nominees for BLS chair and Fed governor",
      "The possible changes to the confirmation process come as a handful of new high-profile nominees are expected to come before the Senate, in addition to the dozens already awaiting votes.",
      "Mr. Trump fired the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner last month over a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. He soon announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the agency. Mr. Trump said in his announcement that Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "But the nominee could face pushback in the Senate, with questions about his experience and comments he's made suggesting the monthly jobs report should be suspended.",
      "The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is planning to hold a confirmation hearing for Antoni pending completed paperwork, according to a committee spokesperson. The panel includes a handful of Senate Republicans who have pushed back on some of Mr. Trump's most controversial nominees this year: Sen. Bill Cassidy of Tennessee, the committee chairman, along with Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Democrats on the committee demanded that the panel hold a full hearing on Antoni's nomination. And Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called Antoni \"an unqualified right-wing extremist who won't think twice about manipulating BLS data.\"",
      "The Senate is also expected to work to confirm Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacated seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump announced the nomination in August after Adriana Kugler stepped down. The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a confirmation hearing this week. But Democrats on the committee have called for a delay, seeking instead to hold an oversight hearing on Mr. Trump's moves to fire another member of the Fed board.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said he had fired another member of the Fed board, Lisa Cook, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Governors can only be fired \"for cause\" and Cook has refused to resign. She sued the president to block her firing last week.",
      "The push to oust Susan Monarez, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, could also tee up another Senate confirmation process. The upper chamber confirmed Monarez for the post in late July, though she had been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "Trump seeks crime bill, extension of DC police takeover",
      "Mr. Trump has moved to crack down on crime in the nation's capital by federalizing the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department and deploying the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement. He signaled in recent weeks that he plans to ask Congress to approve \"long-term extensions\" to maintain control of D.C.'s police, along with other measures to address crime.",
      "In an Aug. 11 executive order, Mr. Trump directed the D.C. mayor to provide the services of D.C. police for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act,\" which the president can extend for up to 30 days. Any extension beyond that requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate. That could run into trouble in the Senate, where the Republican majority would need the support of at least seven Democrats to move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump also indicated last month that he plans to seek around $2 billion from Congress to renovate the streets of Washington. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said the White House was working on a package \"to improve the safety and quality of life in our nation's capital\" which he and GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama would spearhead.",
      "\"He wants $2.5 billion, I'm going to try to find him the money, to repave the roads, take the graffiti off the building, refurbish the parts and give homeless people some place to go other than a tent on the side of the road,\" Graham said at an event in South Carolina last month.",
      "Mr. Trump has suggested that his crackdown on crime in D.C. could soon extend to other major cities, though he has unique authority in the nation's capital because the district is ultimately controlled by the federal government. Last week, the president wrote in a post on Truth Social about a crime bill, saying he's working with GOP leaders in Congress on the measure, though the details remained unclear.",
      "\"Speaker Mike Johnson, and Leader John Thune, are working with me, and other Republicans, on a Comprehensive Crime Bill,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's what our Country need, and NOW! More to follow.\"",
      "Push for Epstein files",
      "Lawmakers were on recess for weeks, but the calls for access to files in the case of late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein haven't gone away.",
      "Controversy has swirled around the Epstein files since the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review in July that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking, died in federal custody in 2019. But renewed interest in the files has prompted members of both parties to call for more transparency, while dividing Mr. Trump's base.",
      "As House Democrats and some Republicans pushed for a floor vote to force the release of the Epstein files in late July, Johnson opted to send the House home early. But some lawmakers are still pressing ahead.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July to compel the Justice Department to release the files within 30 days, with plans to force a vote on the measure once lawmakers return from recess. Massie and Khanna are set to host a news conference at the Capitol Wednesday alongside survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "The expected moves in Congress come after the administration late last month released transcripts of a two-day interview with Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, that was conducted in Florida in July. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice sent some of the files related to Epstein to the House Oversight Committee, which plans to make the records public after redactions have been made.",

    "summary": "Courts weigh fairness of reimbursement formula as Arkansas jury finds against State Farm.",
    "story": [
      "An Arkansas jury found recently that a major car insurance carrier had shortchanged customers who had been in accidents that left their cars \"totaled,\" and now plaintiffs in other states are pursuing similar cases.",
      "The Arkansas lead plaintiff, Rose Chadwick, said she initially assumed the reimbursement for her \"totaled\" 2011 Hyundai was reasonable compensation, \"because that's what I pay them for, is to be fair with me.\"",
      "But after learning about potential legal action challenging the way insurance carrier State Farm calculated the replacement cost, she decided to bring her case to court. Her lawyers alleged that the company used technology to estimate the amount of buying a replacement. That program factored into the calculation the potential for the car buyer to negotiate a discount from used car dealers \u2014 a haggling discount that Chadwick's attorneys argued was no longer consistent with how modern-day used cars are priced and sold.",
      "\"The computer program that State Farm used to calculate the replacement value of the car, did it systematically unfairly,\" said Chadwick's attorney, Brian Glasser. Glasser says his firm argued that commonly used software systematically low-balled the value of total-loss cars for tens of thousands of drivers across the country.",
      "In an Arkansas federal court in June, a jury agreed \u2014 finding in favor of Chadwick and 37,000 other plaintiffs. The jury determined Chadwick had been underpaid by about $600 for a car worth $4,700.",
      "State Farm is fighting lawsuits on the issue in multiple states, arguing that the system the company used at the time was standard for most automobile insurers. It no longer uses the same program to calculate reimbursement amounts.",
      "\"State Farm always seeks to pay what we owe within the terms of the policy to help our customers recover from a loss,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"We work with the policyholder to determine the actual cash value of a total loss vehicle considering the age, condition, equipment, mileage of the vehicle at the time of the loss,\" the company said, adding that customers are \"also invited to share additional information and has the option to use a third-party appraisal to help reach agreement on the value of their totaled vehicle.\"",
      "A \"totaled\" car is typically one that has sustained damage that would cost more to repair than the value of the car itself.",
      "Company officials noted that appellate courts in multiple jurisdictions have agreed with their contention that a challenge to the reimbursement process cannot be made en masse, in the form of a class action lawsuit, as it was in Arkansas. The courts have split over whether each reimbursement case is unique, and must be filed separately, or whether all customers whose loss was calculated the same way can file suit together as a class.",
      "Chadwick's case began five years ago, when her daughter borrowed her car for an early morning run to the store when she was struck from behind while going through an intersection.",
      "After learning of the reimbursement issue in a social media post, Chadwick became the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit against the insurance giant accusing it of undervaluing and shorting payouts on claims like hers.",
      "\"State Farm moves billions of dollars to people for their broken cars every year and, and insurance companies around America do similar numbers,\" Glasser said. \"So we're talking about these computer programs that calculate the value of your replacement vehicle that affect billions of dollars every year.\"",
      "Attorneys are launching similar cases against several insurance carriers in at least 19 states while regulators in some of those states weigh whether insurers must change how they value total loss cars.",
      "State Farm said customers are not without recourse if they have questions about the estimate the company provides to reimburse a customer whose car was a total loss. Among them, customers are encouraged to ask their insurer how they determined the payout amount, to an agreeable price, and to get an independent appraisal of what the car was worth.",
      "In the end, Chadwick said the dispute was less about the money than about principles.",
      "\"It was like hiding something and you shouldn't hide,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Four senior officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced their resignations in recent days, citing what they described as growing political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccines.",
      "Two of those \u2014 Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases \u2014 stepped down on Wednesday, hours after the White House announced the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.",
      "Monarez, confirmed by the Senate in late July, was removed less than a month into her tenure. White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monarez \"was not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again.\" Monarez's attorneys argue the dismissal is unlawful, asserting that only the president can remove a Senate-confirmed director.",
      "On Thursday, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill was chosen to serve as acting CDC director, several White House officials confirmed to CBS News. And in an internal email sent to CDC staff Thursday evening, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed O'Neill as the acting CDC director, but did not address Monarez's departure.",
      "\"I am committed to working with you to restore trust, transparency, and credibility to the CDC,\" Kennedy told CDC employees, later writing that \"President Trump and I are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC: Strengthen the public health infrastructure by returning to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases by investing in innovation to prevent, detect and respond to future threats.\"",
      "Houry and Daskalakis said they had become increasingly uneasy about how vaccine policy was being handled. Both pointed to preparations for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, which recommends vaccine schedules.",
      "Houry said they feared \"some decisions had been made before there was even the data or the science to support those. We are scientists, and that was concerning to us.\"",
      "Daskalakis added that he was \"very concerned that there's going to be an attempt to re-litigate vaccines that have already had clear recommendations with science that has been vetted,\" which he warned could undermine public trust. \"If you can't attack access, then why not attack trust? And that's what I think the playbook is,\" he said.",
      "Both officials cited instances in which evidence reviews were altered or withdrawn. A CDC analysis of thimerosal, a vaccine preservative, was briefly posted before being taken down at HHS's direction. \"If there's something that doesn't line up with the recommendations, then that information will be taken down, and it's not there for the public to see for openness and transparency,\" Houry said.",
      "The two also criticized what they described as a lack of direct communication between CDC scientists and HHS leadership. Daskalakis said his team was never invited to brief Kennedy on topics ranging from measles to COVID.",
      "When asked about Kennedy's calls for \"radical transparency,\" Houry and Daskalakis described learning about changes to the COVID vaccine schedule for children not through internal channels but via social media.",
      "\"The radical transparency manifested itself by a Twitter post, which is how Dr. Houry and I learned that the secretary had mandated the change in the children's vaccine schedule for COVID,\" Daskalakis recalled. \"What is the background that led to that decision? And we were denied access to that information. So, I don't think that that's radically transparent,\" Daskalakis said.",
      "CBS News reached out to HHS for comment on some of the allegations made by Houry and Daskalakis, but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Both officials said they had no jobs lined up when they resigned. Houry described the decision as an effort to raise the alarm about the direction of the agency.",
      "\"For us, this was really sending out a bat signal,\" Houry said. \"We were the very senior scientists and career leaders at CDC. We thought this was the time to stand together and try to do what we could to raise the alarm around public health in our country.\"",
      "Daskalakis said remaining at CDC under current conditions would have made them complicit in what he called the \"weaponization\" of public health.",
      "\"The safety has already been compromised\u2026We are flying blind in the U.S. already. If we continued\u2026we would be complicit and would be facilitating the ability to go from flying blind to actively harming people,\" he said.",
      "Houry emphasized the severity of the moment by noting that she left without a backup plan.",
      "\"My leaving without a job was really just showing how dire the circumstances had become,\" Houry said.",
      "Daskalakis said his decision was also shaped by his medical oath.",
      "\"As a physician, I take the Hippocratic oath: first, do no harm. I am seeing ideology permeating science in a way that is going to harm children and adults\u2026I think we are seeing things that are happening that are making our country less prepared to be able to respond to the everyday pathogens \u2026but also \u2026 to the next big thing.\"",
      "Both also expressed concerns for their personal safety in the current climate.",
      "\"The environment we live in\u2026 stoked by misinformation, especially from people considered by some to be health authorities, makes me worried for all of us in public health,\" Daskalakis said. \"I am concerned, but that's part of our job\u2026to be brave and continue to speak the truth even when we are outside of the CDC.\"",
      "The resignations came weeks after a shooting outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, which law enforcement linked to COVID misinformation.",
      "Houry said the White House response to the shooting was muted. Kennedy toured the site but later gave an interview expressing distrust of experts. \"That was after the attack. It was based on COVID misinformation. So this is when we were trying to build trust,\" she said.",
      "Daskalakis added that while Kennedy later described mass shootings as a public health crisis, he believed the secretary should address misinformation as a root cause. \"The misinformation about the COVID vaccine that has been documented by the Georgia bureau of investigation as the reason for the shooter at CDC. I would really recommend that the secretary actually do take his own advice and actually address the core problem that led to that shooting as well,\" he said. He also noted that CDC's own gun violence prevention programs had been sharply reduced. \"We talk about violence as a public health problem. It is, and there's things we can do to prevent it. Unfortunately, the majority of that program, the staff are terminated.\"",
      "The firings and resignations have sparked calls for oversight. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for a bipartisan investigation, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington urged Kennedy's removal, and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 who voted to confirm Kennedy's appointment as HHS secretary \u2014 said the developments would \"require oversight.\"",

      "\"The main Embassy building is temporarily closed while we review the impact of works undertaken by the Egyptian authorities in the vicinity,\" a U.K. Foreign Office spokesperson told CBS News in a statement on Monday, noting that the embassy remained in operation and only the primary building was closed.",
      "There was no official comment from the Egyptian government about the removal of the barriers outside the U.K. embassy, but the move came amid escalating diplomatic tension between Egypt and several countries over protests targeting Egyptian missions abroad, including in the Netherlands, Austria, France, Turkey, the U.K., Canada, the U.S, and in Israel.",
      "In recent months, pro-Palestinian demonstrators have chained the doors of Egyptian embassies and consulates closed from the outside and spray-painted slogans on their walls, mostly demanding the opening of the Rafah crossing between northeast Egypt and the war-torn Gaza Strip.",
      "Egyptian officials have said their side of the Rafah crossing has remained open since the Gaza war erupted almost two years ago, while the Israeli military controls the Palestinian side and how much aid is allowed in, and how many people are allowed out.",
      "The Egyptian authorities have argued that the protests are not random nor peaceful, but rather organized attacks against the country, and they have accused European host governments of failing to protect their staff and diplomatic premises from vandalism.",
      "Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty was heard in a video circulated online suggesting Egypt could take reciprocal action, saying: \"If their governments won't provide adequate security for our missions, then we should reconsider our own deployments.\"",
      "In a few cases, activists who back the Egyptian government have taken matters into their own hands and gathered outside embassies in European capitals, declaring that they were there to protect the facilities.",
      "Most of these activists have identified themselves as members of the so-called \"Union of Egyptian Youth Abroad.\"",
      "The self-described leader of that group, Ahmed Abdel Qader, was detained in London last week by British police. According to Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty raised the case in an Aug. 26 phone call with U.K. National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell.",
      "In a\u00a0statement published online that day by the Egyptian government, the foreign ministry said it was following his detention \"with great concern\" and had requested urgent clarification of the circumstances surrounding the arrest, stressing Egypt expected his \"prompt release.\"",
      "Social media videos show the activist was released after being detained, and there were no charges announced. London's Metropolitan Police told CBS News it could not immediately offer any information on the circumstances of the Egyptian national's detention or his subsequent release.",
      "Amid the dispute, a relatively new political party in Egypt, the National Front Party, issued a lengthy statement declaring solidarity with the foreign ministry and condemning the activist's detention in London.",
      "\"We will not protect those who do not protect us,\" the party, which was founded in December, declared in its Aug. 26 statement. It condemned the detention of \"one of Egypt's loyal sons\" as a \"blatant violation of justice, human rights, and the rules of diplomatic relations.\"",
      "The party called on the government to reconsider the privileges granted to British diplomatic missions in Cairo. It specifically pointed to the U.K. Embassy in the affluent, heavily fortified Garden City neighborhood where the U.S. and other embassies are also located.",
      "The party argued that the British facility's concrete barriers and other security measures had turned the area into \"a closed-off zone\" and disrupted residents' lives, and it demanded that the barriers be removed.",

      "For China's 72-year-old leader Xi, it will be a landmark moment. It's the third and most important military parade he will have overseen since coming to power in 2012. As commander-in-chief of the world's largest standing armed forces, he will watch as tens of thousands of troops under his orders march toward Tiananmen Square in central Beijing.",
      "It will be a visceral display not only of China's growing military might and newest hardware, including hypersonic weapons, nuclear capable missiles, fighter jets and underwater drones, but of its growing clout as a geopolitical power, with deepening ties to some of the United States' most potent adversaries.",
      "North Korea's Kim arrived in Beijing Tuesday aboard his green armored train, stopping to inspect one of his own country's missile production facilities on the way before crossing into China.",
      "The parade will be the first time that Kim appears together with both Xi and Putin \u2014 offering him a first multilateral diplomatic event.",
      "The symbolism of the three leaders together on a stage with Xi's military thundering past in formation will be undeniable. Xi is expected to be flanked by Putin and Kim. Together, they have been dubbed an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts.",
      "Xi is bringing together the leaders of some of the most heavily sanctioned nations in the world. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian and the leader of Myanmar's ruling military junta, President Min Aung Hlaing, will also be attending, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "It is a clear show of solidarity against the West, and it's being seen as a direct challenge to the U.S.-led world order that has prevailed for a century. Xi and Putin have made their ambition to shake up that status quo clear for at least several years.",
      "\"We, together with you and with our sympathizers, will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,\" Russia's longtime Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in 2022, ahead of a meeting with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "The gathering in Beijing will represent a clear challenge to President Trump's claim to be fostering close working relationships with Xi, Putin and Kim. Xi's bond with Putin was on clear and deliberate display in the days leading up to the parade.",
      "China and Russia have declared their \"no limits partnership,\" and while China claims to maintain a neutral stance on Russia's war in Ukraine, Beijing's support of the war effort \u2014 by providing dual-use technology and continuing to purchase Russian oil and gas in defiance of Western sanctions, has proven to be an economic lifeline funding Putin's three-and-a-half-year war.",
      "During talks at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday, Putin hailed \"unprecedentedly high relations\" with China and thanked his \"dear friend\" Xi for the warm welcome.",
      "Kim's support for Russia's war has been even more direct. Since October last year, North Korea has sent around 13,000 troops, along with conventional weapons, to support Russia's war effort. South Korea's intelligence services estimate that around 2,000 North Korean troops have been killed fighting alongside Russian forces.",
      "The parade will be a show of both China and Russia's implicit support for Kim's nuclear weapons program, which remains the subject of numerous United Nations sanctions.",
      "Xi burnished his credentials as a geopolitical powerbroker at a regional security summit in Tianjin, northern China, that ended on Monday. He hosted more than 20 world leaders there, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "\"We should uphold fairness and justice,\" Xi declared at the gathering of the Shanghai Corporation Organization, seemingly trying to claim moral high ground amid the upheaval and strained relationships caused by Mr. Trump's global trade war and isolationist policies. \"We must oppose the Cold War mentality, block confrontation and bullying practices.\"",
      "Without mentioning the U.S. or its president by name, Xi told the assembled leaders of non-Western countries: \"We must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics.\"",
      "On Monday Xi, Putin and Modi were shown together smiling and laughing at the summit \u2014 a deliberate public display of warmth and camaraderie. Just last week, the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.",

    "story": [
      "The death toll from a major earthquake that rocked eastern Afghanistan on Sunday night has climbed to at least 1,411, the ruling Taliban's chief spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Tuesday, as rescue operations, hampered by rough terrain, continued across the affected region. At least 3,124 people were injured and 5,412 houses were destroyed, Mujahid said.",
      "\"The destruction is overwhelming. Entire villages have been flattened, and people are still trapped under the rubble of collapsed homes. Roads are blocked, making it nearly impossible to move supplies or evacuate the wounded,\" Dr. Abudl Majeed Ahmadzai, Director of the Kabul Asia Hospital, who travelled to the affected region, told CBS News.",
      "In the hard-hit Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, the earthquake trapped people under rubble when homes, which are largely made of wood and mud in the region, collapsed onto them as they slept.",
      "Ahmadzai said the injured were being carried on foot for hours, sometimes on makeshift stretchers, just to reach basic help.",
      "\"The situation is desperate. Food is scarce, medical help is insufficient, and the only effective way to deliver assistance is by helicopter. Without air support, reaching these communities is nearly impossible,\" Ahamdzai told CBS News.",
      "In locations where helicopters could not land, Taliban deputy spokesperson Hamdullah Fitrat said \"dozens of commando forces were air dropped to pull the injured from the rubble and move them to safer ground.\"",
      "Fitrat said a camp had been established in Kunar's Khas Kunar district, as well as two coordination sites near the disaster zones, to help coordinate emergency aid and assist with the rescue operation, transfer of the injured, and burial of the dead.",
      "The United Nations urged the international community to step forward to help.",
      "\"We cannot afford to forget the people of Afghanistan who are facing multiple crises, multiple shocks, and the resilience of the communities has been saturated,\" the U.N.'s resident coordinator for Afghanistan, Indrika Ratwatte, told The Associate Press. \"These are life and death decisions while we race against time to reach people.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the health ministry in Kabul, Sharafat Zaman, on Monday called for international aid to help handle the devastation caused by the earthquake.",
      "\"We need it because here lots of people lost their lives and houses,\" Zaman told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The magnitude 6 earthquake, which struck at about 11:40 p.m. on Sunday, was the third major earthquake to strike Afghanistan since the Taliban seized control of the country in 2021. Their takeover prompted deep cuts in international aid funding as many donors, including the United States, were concerned that financial support could help fund the Taliban government.",
      "Since retaking power, the Taliban have brought back many restrictive policies, especially targeting women and girls, including excluding them from secondary education and most career choices.",
      "The policies have marginalized women and made it much more difficult for them to access basic services, including health care. With women now prevented from working in many health care roles, there's concern that some earthquake victims may be reluctant to seek medical assistance.",

    "summary": "A remote part of Sudan's Darfur region had been a refuge for people fleeing a civil war, but it couldn't protect them from a landslide. Rebels say 1,000 people are dead, with just one survivor.",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0At least 1,000 people were killed on Sunday when a landslide swallowed an entire village in war-torn Sudan's Darfur region after days of heavy rain, the rebels who hold the region said Tuesday.",
      "\"Initial information indicates the death of all village residents, estimated to be more than one thousand individuals, with only one survivor,\" the Sudan Liberation Movement, which controls the area, said in a statement. It appealed to the international community for help for those around the decimated village of Tarasin.",
      "The mountainous area is extremely difficult to reach, and it has become a refuge for people fleeing the violence of the civil war that has engulfed parts of Sudan, including Darfur, with thousands having arrived by foot in recent months.",
      "Tarasin, in an area known for citrus farming, had seen days of heavy rains, which ultimately led to the landslide, which was one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit Sudan in recent history. But the Sudanese people have had no shortage of man-made suffering.",
      "Fear Sudan's civil war poised to get worse",
      "Sudan's civil war is now entering its third year. It has been fought largely between the Sudanese Armed Forces and a rival paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces. Tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed since the fighting broke out more than two years ago, both from the violence directly, and from hunger and disease.",
      "The war has left more than half of Sudan's population facing crisis levels of hunger, in what aid groups have labeled the single largest humanitarian crisis in the world.",
      "The SLM, which announced the landslide, controls Tarasin and some other parts of the mountainous area in western Darfur, but the group has largely stayed out of the fighting.",
      "The RSF controls most of the Darfur region, except the state capital El-Fasher, which its forces have had surrounded for more than 500 days. Over the past few days they have launched a new offensive, seeking to capture the last major city in Darfur not already under their control.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people are now trapped inside the city behind earthen walls newly built by the RSF forces, facing the threat of execution if they try to leave. Sources on the ground say there is little food left in El-Fasher, so local residents are slowly starving as artillery flies over their heads daily.",
      "The Sudan Doctors Network medical group said Tuesday that overnight shelling of El-Fasher had killed 18 people and wounded more than 100 others, including women and children. The group said in a social media post that it was holding \"the international community, the United Nations and the African Union fully responsible for their disgraced silence and failure to protect more than half a million civilians trapped inside El Fasher, who are being subjected daily to shelling, starvation, and slow death.\"",
      "Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab has analyzed satellite photos of El-Fasher that it says show the RSF moving quickly to build berms around the city.",
      "\"The RSF is creating a literal kill box around El-Fasher,\" the group warned in a report published late last week. More than 19 miles of earthen walls have been built since May 9, the group said in a statement provided along with satellite imagery on Aug. 27. \"These berms will create physical boundaries to prevent smuggling goods like food and medicine into El-Fasher or people out of El-Fasher.\"",
      "The United Nations children's agency UNICEF, in a statement last week,estimated that 260,000 people, including 130,000 children, remain trapped in \"desperate conditions cut off from aid for more than 16 months.\"",
      "International humanitarian organizations have been prevented from reaching El-Fasher by the RSF, and UNICEF has warned that, with no new supplies getting in, acute malnutrition is spreading. The agency has cited recent reports that during one week alone, 63 people, mainly women and children, died of malnutrition in the blockaded city.",
      "Before El-Fasher was surrounded, UNICEF said it was treating some 6,000 children for severe acute malnutrition at health facilities in the city. Those children have now had their therapeutic food and medical care suspended.",
      "\"We are witnessing a devastating tragedy \u2013 children in El-Fasher are starving while UNICEF's lifesaving nutrition services are being blocked,\" the group's Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement in late August. \"Blocking humanitarian access is a grave violation of children's rights, and the lives of children are hanging in the balance.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Sep 2025 19:49:05 -0400",
    "summary": "The case involves 10 migrants between 10- and 17-years-old who entered the U.S. without authorization and without their parents or legal guardians.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from sending any unaccompanied migrant child to Guatemala unless they have a deportation order, just hours after lawyers alerted her of what they described as a hurried government effort to deport hundreds of children.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued her order as the deportation effort was fully underway, with planes with migrant children on board ready to take off from Texas.",
      "Earlier Sunday, in the overnight hours, Sooknanan issued a temporary restraining order barring officials from sending a group of 10 migrant children between the ages of 10 and 17 to Guatemala, granting a request from attorneys who alleged the effort would skirt legal protections Congress established for these minors. She also scheduled a hearing in the afternoon to weigh the case's next steps.",
      "But Sooknanan abruptly moved up the hearing earlier on Sunday, saying she had been alerted that some migrant children were already in the process of being deported.",
      "As that hearing got underway, Sooknanan  announced she had just issued a broader temporary restraining order blocking any deportations of unaccompanied children from Guatemala and in U.S. custody who did not have a deportation order. She instructed Drew Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer representing the Trump administration, to quickly inform officials they had to halt their deportation plans.",
      "Ensign acknowledged deportation planes had been prepared to take off on Sunday, but said they were all \"on the ground\" and still on U.S. soil. He said he believed one plane had taken off earlier but had come back.",
      "At the request of Sooknanan, Ensign said he confirmed that the children on the planes would be deplaned and returned to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for caring for migrant minors who enter the U.S. without authorization and without their parents or legal guardians.",
      "The Justice Department said 76 unaccompanied children were slated to be sent to Guatemala on Sunday before the effort was blocked. Of those, 16 had been returned to HHS custody as of Sunday evening and the rest were expected to be in HHS care by 10:30 p.m.",
      "HHS houses unaccompanied children in shelters or foster homes until they turn 18 or until they can be placed with a suitable sponsor in the U.S., who are often family members.",
      "Sooknanan conceded her temporary restraining order, which is set to last 14 days, is \"extraordinary\" but justified it on the grounds that the government had decided to \"execute a plan to remove these children\" in the \"wee hours\" of a holiday weekend.",
      "In their lawsuit, lawyers for the group of Guatemalan children said the Trump administration had launched an effort to deport more than 600 migrant minors to Guatemala without allowing them to request humanitarian protection, even though U.S. law protects them from speedy deportations. They alleged the children could face abuse, neglect or persecution if returned to Guatemala.",
      "Ensign, the Justice Department attorney, said the Trump administration was not trying to formally deport the Guatemalan children under U.S. immigration law, but instead repatriate them to Guatemala so they could reunite with relatives there. He said the Guatemalan government and the children's relatives had requested the reunifications.",
      "But lawyers for the children disputed the government's claims, citing one case in which they say a child's parents did not request any repatriation. They also said a law known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act says unaccompanied migrant children who are not from Mexico must be allowed to see an immigration judge and apply for legal protections before any deportation effort. Some of the children facing return to Guatemala still have pending immigration cases, the attorneys said.",
      "Ensign said the government's legal position is that it can \"repatriate\" these children, based on an authority given to HHS to reunite \"unaccompanied alien children with a parent abroad in appropriate cases.\"",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the deportation plans.",
      "Neha Desai, an attorney at the California-based National Center for Youth Law who works with migrant minors, said the U.S. government was attempting to deport children with \"already filed claims for legal relief based on the abuse and persecution that they experienced in their home country.\"",
      "\"This is both unlawful and profoundly inhumane,\" Desai added.",
      "Most of the unaccompanied children who cross the U.S. southern border without legal permission hail from Central America and tend to be teenagers. Once in the U.S., many file applications for asylum or other immigration benefits to try to stay in the country legally, such as a visa for abused, abandoned or neglected youth.",
      "As part of its larger crackdown on illegal immigration, the Trump administration has sought to make drastic changes to how the U.S. processes unaccompanied children. It has made it harder for some relatives, including those in the country illegally, to sponsor unaccompanied children out of government custody and offered some teenagers the option to voluntary return to their native countries.",
      "The Trump administration has also directed agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies to conduct \"welfare checks\" on children released from HHS custody, a move it has said is in response to disputed claims that the Biden administration \"lost\" hundreds of thousands of migrant minors.",
      "There are currently roughly 2,000 migrant children in HHS care.",

    "story": [
      "Kabul, Afghanistan\u00a0\u2014 A strong earthquake in far eastern Afghanistan killed more than 800 people and left at least 2,500 wounded as it destroyed numerous villages, a spokesman for the country's Taliban government said Monday. Spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told journalists in Kabul that the vast majority of the casualties were in Kunar province, but that 12 people were killed and 255 injured in neighboring Nangarhar.",
      "The quake struck several towns in Kunar province late on Sunday evening, near the city of Jalalabad in neighboring Nangahar province. The 6.0 magnitude quake struck at 11:47 p.m. local time (3:17 p.m. Eastern) and was centered 17 miles east-northeast of Jalalabad, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It was just five miles deep. Shallower earthquakes tend to cause more damage.",
      "Several aftershocks rattled the region throughout the night, including a powerful, shallow 5.2-magnitude temblor just after 4 a.m., USGS data show. The first quake shook buildings from Kabul to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital some 230 miles away, for several seconds, journalists with the French news agency AFP said.",
      "Video from Nangarhar showed people frantically digging through rubble with their hands, searching for loved ones in the dead of night, and injured people being taken out of collapsed buildings on stretchers and into helicopters. Villagers in Kunar gave interviews outside their wrecked homes.",
      "Muhammad Jalal, 40, a resident of Ghaziabad village in northern Kunar, told CBS News' Sami Yousafzai in a telephone interview that he was jolted awake by the tremors and managed to escape moments before his room collapsed.",
      "\"I was lucky, but at least two members of my family died and four were injured,\" he said. \"We spent the whole night looking for help, but we were helpless and hopeless.\" Jalal recalled hearing his uncle crying for help from under the rubble for two hours before his voice fell silent.",
      "Video shared on social media showed a white-bearded man in an undershirt emerging from the ruins, consoling grieving women who had lost relatives. \"This was the will of God. What can we do?\" he told them.",
      "Dr. Sharafat Zaman, a spokesman for the Taliban government's Health Ministry, said the toll was likely to rise as search and rescue work continued, noting that \"several villages have been completely destroyed.\"",
      "Rescue operations were still underway Monday and medical teams from Kunar, Nangarhar and the capital Kabul have arrived in the area, said Zaman.",
      "The U.N. said on X that it had rescue teams on the ground \"delivering emergency assistance & lifesaving support.\" The Afghan Red Crescent posted on X that officials from the agency and \"medical teams rushed to the affected areas and are currently providing emergency assistance to impacted families.\"",
      "For Homa Nadir, the Deputy Head of the Red Crescent in Afghanistan, it seemed like \"yet another disaster, hitting at the wrong time.\"",
      "Nadir said the emergency health organization's information suggested at least three villages in Kunar had \"been completely leveled\" by the quake.",
      "The disaster comes over four years after the Taliban retook control of the country in the immediate wake of a chaotic American withdrawal. But much of the Western world, including the U.S., has severed ties with the Taliban regime and halted financial assistance, so the country remains gripped by a humanitarian crisis and is one of the poorest nation's in the world.",
      "Nadir told CBS News correspondent Holly Williams that the U.S. aid cuts ushered in under President Trump will hamper the relief effort.",
      "\"We're always expecting these disasters to happen, but it feels like in Afghanistan, people really don't get a chance to just breathe,\" she said.",
      "Jalalabad is a bustling trade city due to its proximity with neighboring Pakistan and a key border crossing between the countries. Although it has a population of about 300,000 according to the municipality, it's metropolitan area is thought to be far larger. Most of its buildings are low-rise constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, and its outlying areas include homes built of mud bricks and wood. Many are of poorly built.",
      "Jalalabad also has considerable agriculture and farming, including citrus fruit and rice, with the Kabul River flowing through the city.",
      "Afghanistan is located near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates and it is often struck with earthquakes.",
      "A magnitude 6.3 temblor rocked Afghanistan on Oct. 7, 2023, along with strong aftershocks. The Taliban government estimated that at least 4,000 perished. The U.N. gave a far lower figure of about 1,500. It was the deadliest natural disaster to strike Afghanistan in recent memory. More than 90% of those killed were women and children, UNICEF said.",

      "Maduro claimed eight U.S. military vessels \"with 1,200 missiles\" were targeting his country, calling them \"the greatest threat that has been seen on our continent in the last 100 years,\" AFP reported.",
      "His comments during a news conference come as the U.S. government this week is set to boost its\u00a0maritime force in the waters off Venezuela\u00a0to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels. The U.S. has not signaled any planned land incursion by the thousands of personnel being deployed. Still, Maduro's government has\u00a0responded by deploying troops\u00a0along its coast and border with neighboring Colombia, as well as by urging Venezuelans to enlist in a civilian militia.",
      "\"In the face of this maximum military pressure, we have declared maximum preparedness for the defense of Venezuela,\" Maduro said of the deployment, which he characterized as \"an extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\"",
      "The U.S. Navy now has two Aegis guided-missile destroyers \u2014\u00a0the USS Gravely and the USS Jason Dunham\u00a0\u2014 in the Caribbean, as well as the destroyer USS Sampson and the cruiser\u00a0USS Lake Erie\u00a0in the waters off Latin America.

      "Washington has accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel and has\u00a0doubled the bounty\u00a0for his capture to $50 million. The U.S. has, however, made no public threat to invade Venezuela.",

      "Of the eight Latin American drug trafficking groups the Trump administration has\u00a0designated as terrorist organizations, one is Venezuelan. It's not clear if or when the military could take action.",
      "On Monday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yv\u00e1n Gil, citing a United Nations report, told his counterparts in various Latin American countries that the deployment of U.S. maritime forces is built on a \"false narrative\" as 87% of cocaine produced in Colombia departs through the Pacific and traffickers attempt to move only 5% of their product through Venezuela. Landlocked Bolivia and Colombia, with access to the Pacific and Caribbean, are the world's top cocaine producers.",
      "Gil added that the narrative \"threatens the entire region\" and an attack on Venezuela \"would really mean a complete destabilization of the region.\"",
      "\"Let us immediately demand an end to this deployment, which has no other reason than to threaten a sovereign people,\" he added during a virtual meeting of members of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States regional group.",
      "Maduro also used his news conference to insist that he was the legitimate winner of\u00a0last year's presidential election. But ample and credible evidence has shown the contrary, prompting several countries,\u00a0including the U.S., to not recognize Maduro as Venezuela's president.",
      "Maduro, sworn in to a third six-year term in January, added that his government maintains two lines of communication with the Trump administration, one with the State Department and another with Mr. Trump's envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell. He called Secretary of State Marco Rubio a \"warlord\" pushing for action in the Caribbean to topple Venezuela's government.",
      "Since the July 2024 presidential election, Venezuela's political opposition has been urging the U.S. and other countries to pressure Maduro into leaving office. Its leader, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, last month thanked Mr. Trump and Rubio for the deployment of the vessels, describing the move as \"the right approach\" toward Venezuela's government, which she described as a \"criminal enterprise.\"",

      "Republican Senators Roger Wicker and Deb Fischer arrived in Taipei on Friday for a two-day visit, as President Trump seeks to strike a trade deal with China \u2014 which insists Taiwan is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to annex it.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry reiterated its long-time stance in a statement issued Friday as the American senators arrived in Taipei, saying it firmly opposed any official exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan.",
      "\"We come here from the United States bringing a message from the Congress of commitment, of long-term friendship and a determination that a free country like Taiwan absolutely has the right to remain free and preserve self-determination,\" Wicker said during a news conference alongside Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te at the presidential office, as shown in video published by the Reuters news agency.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry responded to a CBS News request for reaction to the language used by Wicker to describe Taiwan over the weekend, with a statement saying the senators' visit to Taiwan \"and the dissemination of erroneous remarks on Taiwan issues violate the one-China principle and the U.S.-China joint communiqu\u00e9s, undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and send wrong signals to Taiwan independence forces.\"",
      "The ministry statement voiced China's \"strong dissatisfaction\" with the visit and the comments by Wicker, and said the \"future of Taiwan must be decided by the 1.4 billion Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan. China will be reunified, and it must be reunified. This is an irreversible trend that no one or any organization can reverse.\"",
      "Even before Wicker spoke in Taipei, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun called the U.S. delegation's visit \"a serious violation\" of the one-China principle, a U.S. policy adopted decades ago that recognizes Taiwan as part of China.",
      "A senior Trump administration official told CBS News on Friday that the White House's stance on the one-China principle \"remains the same as the first Trump Administration,\" while a State Department spokesperson, in a statement sent to CBS News on Monday, noted that the U.S. Congress is a \"separate, co-equal branch of government and independent of the Executive Branch.\"",
      "The spokesperson noted the long history of Congressional delegations visiting Taiwan and said the department's policy \"has not changed and remains guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, three Joint Communiques, and Six Assurances,\" which together form the basis of the one-China principle.",
      "Wicker, who chairs the powerful Armed Services Committee and is a vocal supporter of Taiwan, said he and Fischer were visiting to better understand Taiwan's needs, and they wanted to reiterate to Taiwan \"our determination to remain the best of friends and to defend the freedom of everyone and both of our great countries.\"",
      "\"It is our determination and our intention that Taiwan remain free and make its own decisions,\" Wicker said after their talks with Lai. \"Part of maintaining the freedoms that we have is enhanced cooperation militarily, enhanced cooperation with our defense industrial base, making the best use of those funds.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January, there have been growing jitters in Taipei over the strength of the Taiwan-U.S. relationship and Washington's willingness to defend the island if China were to attack.",
      "Fischer said the U.S. Senate understands \"the gravity of the challenges that Taiwan faces\" and that a \"stronger Taiwan means a stronger United States and vice versa.\"",
      "While the U.S. stopped recognizing Taiwan as an independent state in the late 1970s, in favor of China, Washington has remained Taipei's most important backer and biggest supplier of arms that it would need to defend itself from any theoretical attack by China.",
      "That support has become increasingly crucial to Taiwan in recent years, as China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring the island under Beijing's control. China has increased military pressure with large-scale exercises and routine flights and naval excursions that test the democratic island's air and sea boundaries.",
      "Ahead of the meeting with Wicker and Fischer, Lai said he hoped Taiwan and the U.S. would further \"enhance cooperation,\" and insisted the island and China were \"not subordinate\" to each other.",
      "Wicker and Fischer have been travelling in the Asia-Pacific region for the past week, stopping in Hawaii, Guam, Palau and the Philippines.",
      "U.S.-Taiwan ties have been strained since Mr. Trump took office and launched a global trade war and pressured governments in Europe and elsewhere to spend more on their own defense.",
      "The Trump administration reportedly denied permission for Lai to transit in New York as part of a planned official trip to Latin America this month after Beijing objected. Lai reportedly then cancelled the trip.",
      "Taiwan is also struggling to finalize a tariff deal with the U.S. after Washington imposed a temporary 20% levy that has alarmed the export-dependent island's manufacturers.",
      "As those negotiations continue, Lai's government has announced plans to increase defense spending to more than 3% of GDP next year and to 5% by 2030.",

      "\"It\u2019s a real neurological process rooted in how the brain processes sound.\"",
      "Scientifically, selective hearing is known as \"auditory selective attention,\" in which the brain\u2019s built-in filter focuses on \"important sounds\" and separates meaningful speech from background noise.",

      "\"It\u2019s important to note that selective hearing isn\u2019t just distraction or disinterest \u2014 it\u2019s the result of an increased cognitive load and fatigue,\" Rey said.",
      "\"In essence, selective hearing happens because the brain prioritizes certain sounds over others, with the goal of helping us function in noisy environments.\"",
      "The \"cocktail party effect\" is the auditory process of focusing on important sounds, such as one person in a conversation. (iStock)",

      "The process involves two key parts of the brain \u2014 the auditory cortex, which processes sounds, and the prefrontal cortex, which controls attention and decision-making.",
      "Working memory also latches onto the selected stream of information at the same time, allowing a person to follow a conversation.",
      "\"Selective hearing isn\u2019t just distraction or disinterest \u2014 it\u2019s the result of an increased cognitive load and fatigue.\"",
      "Selective hearing could become a concern if it begins to interfere with daily life or relationships, but occasional moments of \"zoning out in noisy environments are expected,\" Rey suggested.",
      "As hearing loss worsens, especially with age, it can cause this process to break down, causing all sounds to \"compete for attention.\"",
      "Persistent patterns of selective hearing may signal \"something more serious, including hearing loss,\" the expert said. (iStock)",
      "This can result in \"listening fatigue,\" which makes it harder for the brain to process sound properly, Rey said.",
      "\"Over time, untreated hearing loss can impact memory and cognitive health, negatively impacting quality of life.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Even mild hearing loss can make the brain work harder to fill in missing sounds, according to the expert.",
      "Signs of hearing loss include struggling to follow conversations in loud environments or large group settings, frequently asking others to repeat themselves, leaning in toward the speaker, providing answers that are irrelevant to the conversation or seeming disengaged when listening.",
      "Hearing aids may be an appropriate option for people with symptoms of hearing loss. (iStock)",
      "There may also be a recognizable increase in frustration, fatigue, irritability or a tendency to withdraw from social situations due to the act of listening feeling \"overwhelming.\"",
      "\"If these issues happen often and others around you notice the pattern, it may be time to check in with an audiologist or hearing care professional to determine whether selective hearing is masking a deeper issue,\" Rey advised.",

      "Hearing aids and other modern hearing devices use technology that enhances speech and filters noise, he noted. They can also stream audio from smartphones, which can be helpful for some.",

That rigidity might not matter for tanks or trucks, but with drone technology evolving every few weeks in Ukraine, he said, the Army risks falling behind.",

These eco-friendly grazers easily navigate narrow panel rows, cutting maintenance costs and carbon emissions at the same time.

      "Why solar grazing with sheep cuts costs and emissions",
      "Sheep fit neatly between solar arrays, reaching into nooks that mechanical gear can't. They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reduce carbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals. Developers like SB Energy in Texas now rely on herds of around 3,000 sheep to cover thousands of acres, benefiting both their bottom line and the planet.",

There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy production with agriculture.\u2028Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.",
      "Chad Raines is a rancher from Texas. He decided to trade in cotton farming for sheep grazing on solar land. That move has paid off. Last year, he brought in around $300,000. If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.",
      "How sheep improve soil health and boost biodiversity at solar farms",
      "Letting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.",
      "Companies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't just power generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators.

      "At some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.",

      "If you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep.

The system gives pilots two aural alerts when an unauthorized aircraft enters the runway on a collision course with the authorized aircraft. The first alert sounds 30 seconds before a collision, and the second alert sounds 15 seconds before a collision.",

      "The demonstration simulated a 2023 close call at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Austin, Texas. In that scenario, a FedEx B767 was cleared to land in poor conditions. As the FedEx plane got closer, the pilots noticed a Southwest Airlines B737 lined up on the runway below them.

      "Pediatricians and psychologists raise red flags about these AI toys. Young children naturally form attachments. If those attachments shift to chatbots, kids may learn to trust machines more than people. Research already shows children ages 3 to 6 sometimes trust robots more than humans, even when the robots give wrong answers.

That responsiveness can be powerful. It can encourage curiosity, vocabulary growth, and even creativity. But it can also crowd out human interactions, those subtle facial expressions, pauses, and \"nos\" that children need to experience to learn empathy and resilience. Another risk is that AI companions are trained to be overly charming and agreeable. Instead of challenging a child's thinking, these\u00a0\"sycophantic\" toys may simply tell kids what they want to hear. Over time, that could nudge children toward believing comforting lies instead of asking hard questions, a toxic pattern for developing critical thinking.",

      "Hackers stole 13 million records, exposing data of 4.4 million Americans in the latest TransUnion cyberattack. (Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg)",
      "What you need to know about the TransUnion data breach",
      "TransUnion has disclosed a major data breach that impacted 4,461,511 individuals in the United States, according to a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office. The incident occurred on July 28, 2025, and was discovered two days later on July 30.",
      "The breach resulted from unauthorized access to a third-party application used in TransUnion's U.S. consumer support operations. The company stressed that its core credit database and credit reports were not compromised.",
      "Although TransUnion characterized the exposed information as \"limited,\" the stolen data is highly sensitive. It includes names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, reasons for customer transactions (such as requests for a free credit report), and customer support tickets and messages.",
      "Hackers claim they stole more than 13 million records in total, with about 4.4 million tied to U.S. consumers.",
      "In response, TransUnion is providing all affected individuals with 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "The breach at TransUnion follows several similar cyberattacks against tech companies, including Google and Cisco, and retail brands, such as Chanel and Adidas.\u00a0 (Mike Kemp/In Pictures)",
      "Hackers target companies through Salesforce apps",
      "The breach appears to be part of a broader wave of Salesforce-related attacks that is hitting organizations across sectors, from tech and finance to retail and aviation. Alongside Google, Farmers Insurance, Allianz Life, Workday, Pandora, Cisco, Chanel and Qantas, brands like Adidas, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co., Cartier and Air France-KLM have also reported incidents tied to weaknesses in Salesforce-linked applications.",
      "In most cases, attackers exploited malicious third-party integrations or OAuth-connected apps disguised as legitimate Salesforce tools to siphon sensitive records. This technique bypassed traditional login protections and gave intruders long-lasting access to customer relationship management data. The stolen information ranges from basic contact details and business notes to highly sensitive identifiers such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth and driver's license information.",
      "Researchers say these intrusions align with activity from the extortion group ShinyHunters, with some overlap in tactics and infrastructure linked to other threat actors like Scattered Spider. Campaigns tracked under names such as UNC6395 and UNC6040 point to a larger \"extortion-as-a-service\" model, where criminal crews collaborate and share stolen data across underground forums.",
      "TransUnion's response",
      "CyberGuy reached out to TransUnion for a comment and received the following response:",
      "\"TransUnion recently experienced a cyber incident that affected a third-party application serving our U.S. consumer support operations. Upon discovery, we quickly contained the issue, which did not involve our core credit database or include credit reports.",
      "The incident involved unauthorized access to limited personal information for a very small percentage of U.S. consumers. We are working with law enforcement and have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts for an independent forensics review. Additionally, we will notify affected consumers and provide credit monitoring services.\"",
      "As for the gap between when the breach occurred (July 28, 2025) and when it was officially recorded as \"discovered\" (July 30, 2025), a TransUnion spokesperson clarified that the company\u00a0\"identified and contained this event within hours\" of it happening, but that it is common industry practice to designate a later \"date of discovery\" to reflect a more complete assessment following the initial response.",

      "The TransUnion breach exposed millions of people's data, but there are steps you can take to protect yourself. Here are eight ways to stay safe.",
      "Go through old online accounts, shopping profiles or cloud storage that may still hold sensitive data. Deleting what you no longer use reduces the amount of information that could be stolen in future breaches or sold on dark web forums. You can also get help from a data removal service.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Data stolen in breaches often ends up fueling phishing campaigns. Attackers may use your name, email or phone number to make messages look more convincing. If you get an email or text claiming to be from TransUnion, your bank or any service asking you to \"verify\" details, don't click on the link. Instead, log in through the official website or call customer service directly.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your login details were exposed, reusing the same password across sites puts multiple accounts at risk. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique passwords for every service. Even if hackers get hold of one, they won't be able to use it elsewhere. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your passwords have been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "HACKERS FOUND A WAY TO TURN OFF WINDOWS DEFENDER REMOTELY",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0adds a critical extra step beyond just a password. If someone tries to break into your email, banking app or social media account, they'll also need the one-time code from your authenticator app or text message. This makes stolen credentials much less useful.",
      "Hackers often rely on outdated software to spread malware or steal information. Installing the latest updates for your phone, computer and apps ensures security patches are in place, blocking known vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.",
      "One of the biggest risks after a breach is criminals opening new loans or credit cards in your name. A credit freeze with all three major bureaus, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, prevents anyone from accessing your credit file without your approval. It's free and can be temporarily lifted if you need to apply for credit.",
      "Watch your bank and credit card statements for unfamiliar charges, no matter how small. Set up transaction alerts where available. You should also pull your free annual credit report to check for unauthorized accounts or inquiries, which could be signs of fraud.",
      "If your Social Security number, driver's license or other sensitive identifiers were exposed, you may want to sign up for an identity theft protection service. These services monitor credit reports, dark web forums and financial activity for signs of misuse. Some also include insurance or recovery assistance if your identity is stolen, giving you added peace of mind beyond basic credit monitoring. If you're one of the affected TransUnion users, make use of the 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. If not, you might get one yourself for the future.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The reality is that the TransUnion breach isn't just about stolen names and numbers. It's about how exposed ordinary people are when a single company holds the keys to their financial identity. For years, consumers have had little choice but to trust credit bureaus they never opted into.",

      "Phishing scams are getting smarter, and one of the latest tricks involves fake DocuSign emails that appear to show charges from major companies like Apple. At first glance, these fraud messages look convincing, often including a receipt, order ID and even a support number. But instead of connecting you to Apple or another legitimate service, that number links you directly to scammers.",

      "These phishing emails pretend to be billing receipts for recent Apple Pay purchases. They typically claim that a subscription has been charged to your account and prompt you to call a phone number if you do not recognize the charge.",
      "Scammers spoof Apple, Netflix, and other brands to push fake subscription charges posing as DocuSign. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The emails often use well-known brands such as Apple, Netflix, Expedia, or even lawn service companies to make them seem credible. Some also include a \"DocuSign\" link with a security code, creating the illusion that you need to access a file to confirm the transaction.",
      "In reality, neither Apple nor these other companies sends billing receipts through DocuSign. That detail alone is a red flag. Another telltale sign is the sender's address. It may contain odd characters, such as a Cyrillic \"B\" replacing the \"B\" in \"Billing,\" which helps scammers bypass spam filters.",
      "AMAZON ALERTS CUSTOMERS ABOUT IMPERSONATION SCAMS",
      "How the DocuSign scam works",
      "The scam aims to catch you off guard and pressure you into acting fast. The email claims your Apple Pay account has been charged for a subscription or purchase. It includes an order ID, a charge amount, and a DocuSign link that supposedly holds a receipt or confirmation file. To make it look even more convincing, some versions add a security code to \"unlock\" the document.",
      "The message also lists a phone number and urges you to call if the charge was not authorized. That number is the core of the scam. Instead of reaching Apple, Netflix or whichever company the email pretends to represent, you end up speaking with a scammer posing as a support agent.",
      "Once you're on the call, the scammer tries to convince you that your account has been compromised or that the payment must be reversed right away. From there, the tactics vary. They might ask for your Apple ID, banking details, or card numbers. They may pressure you to download remote access software so they can \"fix\" the issue on your device. In some cases, they demand payment for fake account protection or reversal fees.",
      "DocuSign scam uses fake receipts and urgent language to steal personal information from users. (Kurt \"Cyberguy\" Knutsson)",
      "The end goal is always the same: gain enough access to lock you out of your accounts, steal sensitive data, or initiate fraudulent transactions.

      "Fraudulent billing emails claim Apple Pay charges and link victims to fake support lines using DocuSign. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Be cautious with any links in suspicious emails. Scammers often mask harmful links behind text that looks legitimate, such as \"View Document\" or \"Review Payment.\" Hover over the link without clicking to see the real web address. If it does not match the official company domain, do not click.",

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at CyberGuy.com.",
      "Instead of trusting the email, confirm whether a charge actually exists. Apple users can review purchases directly from the Settings app under their Apple ID. If nothing shows up, the receipt is fake. Other services have similar ways to check history.",
      "The less information scammers can find about you online, the harder it is for them to craft convincing attacks. Consider removing old accounts you no longer use, limit the personal details you share publicly on social media, and use data removal services when possible. This reduces the risk of your name, email, or phone number being targeted in scams like this.",

      "Most modern Windows PCs rely on Microsoft Defender as their first line of defense against malware. Over the years, it has evolved into a capable and often underrated antivirus that blocks a wide range of threats. But a hacker group has found a way to abuse a legitimate Intel CPU tuning driver in a \"Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver\" (BYOVD) attack to completely disable Microsoft Defender.",

That's why protecting your personal data isn't about avoiding the internet. It's about reducing what's already out there. The less data scammers can find, the harder it is for them to fool you with realistic, emotionally charged attacks.

      "Barry Morphew was re-indicted by a grand jury in Colorado on a murder charge in June, following a failed prosecution in 2021. Barry Morphew allegedly killed his wife, 49-year-old Suzanne Morphew, who vanished on Mother's Day in 2020. At the time, the Morphews lived near Salida, Colorado, where Suzanne Morphew was last seen alive.",

Barry Morphew is being held at the Alamosa County Jail on a $3 million cash bond. He faces charges of first-degree murder after deliberation.",

Clearance rates were above 60% before 2020, according to the organization, which cites data from the FBI.",

      "The first 2020 event that altered the way streets are policed, and helped cause a decline in homicide clearance rates, was the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Leto.",
      "\"So the courts then became remote. Everything slowed down within the courts,\" she said. \"A lot of trials didn't take place. People were let out of jail for safety reasons. Many officers and support staff got sick. There was a high rate of people being out sick. There was a decrease in people in the squads, in detective squads to investigate crimes. So that really affected everything.\"",
      "In March of that year, she said, the situation spiraled even further out of control after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police, driving an anti-police sentiment that halted recruiting and caused officers to retire early, among other consequences.",

      "DC VIOLENCE HAS GROWN FAR MORE DEADLY, DESPITE DEMS CLAIMING 30-YEAR LOW",

So people didn't want to join the police department, and then you had less people coming in and less people going into a detective unit.\"",
      "Consequently, existing detectives began working more overtime. In what Leto described as an \"overtime bubble,\" some detectives worked so much that they were forced to retire, further depleting detective units.",

      "\"So you had a recruitment issue, you had retention issue. So now, like, if you're looking at New York City, which I know about, you have a lot of detective squads that are really low in manpower,\" she said. \"So they doubled their caseload.\"",

So, for example, [third-degree robbery], which is forcibly taking property from a person, which is violent, that's deemed as a nonviolent crime.\"",
      "When violent offenders are let out on bail, they go right back to committing crimes, possibly even escalating their levels of violence.",

      "But Grossi also noted that it would be \"almost impossible\" for Iran to get to a point of compliance with the JCPOA due to too many technical advances.",
      "Questions over the location of the HEU, which is estimated to be enough to make 10 nuclear warheads, mounted after the U.S. levied direct strikes at Iran\u2019s nuclear program in June. Reports suggested that in the days leading up to the strikes, Iran may have moved and hidden some of its uranium based on satellite imagery that showed convoys leaving the Fordow and Isfahan nuclear sites.",
      "But on Wednesday, Grossi countered these concerns and said the IAEA had no evidence that the uranium has been moved to a secret location.",
      "Though the stockpile of HEU is still not officially accounted for as the IAEA has not been granted access to Iran's top nuclear sites, Grossi said he anticipated that access to come shortly as inspectors on Wednesday visited the Bushehr nuclear power plant after being re-granted access in Iran.",
      "When asked by reporters whether Iran was taking immediate action to begin meeting the E3 demands and avoid sanctions, Grossi said, \"point blank\u2026 no.\"",
      "\"Our work hasn\u2019t started. We are not yet where I would like us to be \u2013 I will not hide this,\" he said. \"But at the same time, I am a diplomat, I am always working toward peace.\"",

      "German scientists at Saarland University Hospital recruited 450 adults, mostly in their early 30s. The first group of 227 participants tested a puff of the nasal spray in each nostril, three times a day. The other 223 were instructed to do the same, but with a placebo spray.",
      "All participants were given Covid rapid tests twice a week over the course of nearly two months. By the end, the incidence of Covid infections in the azelastine group was 2.2%, significantly lower than the 6.7% infection rate in the placebo group.",

    "story": [
      "The annual New York LGBTQ+ Film Festival announced Tuesday that it will provide Arizonans with free virtual access to a selection of this year\u2019s featured films in response to the cancellation of a queer film festival in Phoenix.",
      "Last month, the organizers of the Desperado LGBTQ+ Film Festival announced that they canceled the event \u201cin direct response\u201d to President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at publicly funded institutions.",
      "A student organization at Paradise Valley Community College, which receives federal funds, hosted the festival for the last 16 years in Phoenix.",
      "\u201cAs a publicly funded institution, we must comply with these orders,\u201d the festival\u2019s organizers said in a statement on its website last month. \u201cFailure to do so would jeopardize the district\u2019s federal funding, including student financial aid and grants that support over 300 positions across our campuses. The loss of such funding would create a ripple effect, significantly affecting students, faculty, staff, the community, and the educational services we provide.\u201d",
      "David Hatkoff, executive director of NewFest, which hosts the New York LGBTQ+ Film Festival \u2014 the largest such festival in the U.S. \u2014 said hearing about Desperado\u2019s cancellation was \u201ca gut punch,\u201d because it was one of the first instances where he saw the effects of one of the Trump administration\u2019s executive orders in his sector.",
      "\u201cIt felt scary, it felt enraging, and I felt sad for the folks in Arizona who were anticipating being able to engage with this festival and being able to to experience these queer stories,\u201d Hatkoff said. \u201cWe know firsthand how impactful these stories are, and have been, and, in some ways, now more than ever, as these efforts are in place to try to silence queer voices.\u201d",
      "He said that NewFest worked alongside the organizers of Desperado to create the Arizona Queer Film Access Initiative, which will allow those watching from Arizona free virtual access to a selection of the New York City festival\u2019s 130 films for the duration of the festival, which will run from Oct. 9 to Oct. 21.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a calling, in some ways, to step up,\u201d Hatkoff said.",
      "The films Arizonans will have free access to will include all of the festival\u2019s roughly 100 short films, which Hatkoff said run the gamut of genres, including animated, horror and comedy.",
      "People from other states who want to watch the films will still be able to pay for a virtual pass, which Hatkoff said has been available since the start of the pandemic.",
      "Dale Heuser, the co-coordinator of Desperado, said the festival\u2019s organizers are grateful for the opportunity presented by NewFest.",
      "\u201cWe are adapting to new challenges, but our vision remains the same and we look forward to gathering again in 2026 to celebrate queer film, build community, and support LGBTQ+ artists and audiences,\u201d Heuser said in a statement.",
      "Hatkoff said the Trump administration has increasingly targeted the LGBTQ community in \u201can effort to erase us out of existence,\u201d and NewFest is trying to do its part to help \u201cstem the tide.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe antidote to that is telling our stories loudly and proudly,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the loss of this relatively small festival in Phoenix is something we should be paying attention to, because when people lose access to these stories, they stop being able to see themselves. That, in tandem with cuts in suicide hotline funding and things like that \u2014 this is a crisis.\u201d",
      "NewFest will announce the full programming lineup for its 37th festival on Sept. 10."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal grand jury in Washington declined to indict a woman accused of threatening President Donald Trump on social media, another sign of pushback from D.C. residents over the use of federal law enforcement and deployment of National Guard troops in the city.",
      "The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia accused Nathalie Rose Jones of Indiana of threatening to take the life of the president and transmitting threats over state lines on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "Jones allegedly called Trump a \u201cterrorist\u201d and a \u201cNazi\u201d in a voluntary interview with the Secret Service. She attended a march in Washington on Aug. 16 that went around the White House complex and was then arrested, though she said she had no desire at that time to harm Trump. Friends wrote in letters to the court that Jones has had mental health issues.",
      "In a motion filed Monday, Jones' attorneys disclosed that a grand jury didn\u2019t indict her.",

      "\"Given that finding, the weight of the evidence is weak,\" her lawyers wrote of the grand jury's decision. \"The government may intend to try again to obtain an indictment, but the evidence has not changed and no indictment is likely. For this reason the Court should release Ms. Jones on her personal recognizance to appear if required.\"",
      "It is rare for a federal grand jury to decline to indict, but it's become an emerging trend in Washington amid Trump's federal crackdown, with grand juries made up of local residents declining to indict at least six times in recent weeks.",
      "Last week, a grand jury declined to indict a former Justice Department employee, Sean Dunn, who was seen on video tossing a hoagie at the chest of one of the federal law enforcement officers patrolling the streets of Washington. Dunn has become a symbol of opposition to the federal takeover among D.C. residents, with Banksy-style art depicting a man tossing a sandwich appearing around the city.",
      "A grand jury also declined to indict Alvin Summers with assault on a federal officer. And three federal grand juries refused to indict Sidney Lori Reid with assault during a scuffle with an FBI agent, and her charges were downgraded to a misdemeanor."

      "The NFL became the world\u2019s most valuable league by figuring out how to never fully cede the stage to the rest of the sports world. This week, games that count return \u2014 but it\u2019s also true that since Philadelphia dethroned Kansas City in the Super Bowl in February, the intrigue into the NFL never truly went away.",
      "In the last seven months, rules were altered, players moved and new contenders emerged. Here is everything that happened during the offseason that could influence the 2025 season:",
      "Familiar faces, new places",
      "The NFL\u2019s version of an earthquake hit without warning last Thursday when Dallas opted to trade All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons to Green Bay rather than pay a lucrative extension. Trying to emerge from a crowded class of Super Bowl contenders in the NFC, the Packers made Parsons the highest-paid nonquarterback in league history and only had to give up two first-round picks and defensive lineman Kenny Clark.",
      "After waiting months to decide where to sign as a free agent, four-time MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers chose Pittsburgh. Rodgers is \u201cpretty sure\u201d his 21st NFL season will be his last. The Steelers had a void at quarterback after last season\u2019s starters both went to New York \u2014 with Justin Fields taking over as the Jets\u2019 starter, and Russell Wilson with the Giants.",
      "Sam Darnold, meanwhile, is out to prove his career revival last season in Minnesota wasn\u2019t a one-year wonder. The quarterback\u2019s career season helped the Vikings to a 14-3 record, but after consecutive brutal losses ended their season, the team opted to promote their 2024 first-round pick, JJ McCarthy, to starter. Darnold is now in Seattle, but for how long? Though his contract is for three years and $100.5 million, the Seahawks can get out of the deal after just one season.",
      "Seattle needed a quarterback after trading last year\u2019s starter, Geno Smith, to Las Vegas, reuniting him with coach Pete Carroll, who is in his first season with the Raiders.",
      "Quarterback movement doesn\u2019t mean much without receivers to throw to and blockers to offer protection. The Cowboys traded for Pittsburgh receiver George Pickens, who became expendable after Pittsburgh itself traded for DK Metcalf. The Los Angeles Rams signed Davante Adams after letting former star wideout Cooper Kupp walk to Seattle. And Washington upgraded its protection of star second-year quarterback Jayden Daniels by trading for offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil.",
      "The rules that changed (and those that didn\u2019t)",
      "The best-known and most argued-over play in the NFL remains legal in 2025 \u2014 barely. Philadelphia pushed its way to a Super Bowl championship behind a super-charged short-yardage strategy known alternately as the \u201ctush push\u201d or \u201cbrotherly shove,\u201d in which blockers positioned behind quarterback Jalen Hurts push him forward. It looked like the only opponent capable of stopping the \u201ctush push\u201d was NFL owners. But when they met in May to vote on whether to ban the play, Philadelphia launched an impassioned defense and narrowly kept the play legal by a two-vote margin.",
      "Some rules did, however, undergo changes.",
      "To promote more returns, kickoffs that land in the end zone or beyond will result in drives starting at the 35-yard line, five yards farther downfield than last season. The move incentivizes teams to kick the ball into the \u201clanding zone\u201d between the goal line and the 20-yard line. Yet watch for this wrinkle: Tacklers can\u2019t begin running downfield until the ball is either caught or hits the ground. Will teams attempt to kick knuckleballs into the \u201clanding zone\u201d to buy their defenders more time?",
      "Onside kickoffs last season could take place only in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s no longer the case. Teams must still \u201cdeclare\u201d their intent to onside kick but now can do it at any point in the game, so long as they are trailing.",
      "In overtime during the regular season, each team is now guaranteed a possession. That\u2019s a change from before, when the team that got the ball first in overtime could end the game if it scored a touchdown.",
      "The eyes in the sky",
      "For as long as football has existed, whether a team has converted or fallen just short of a first down has been determined manually by a \u201cchain gang\u201d of officials toting orange, upright sticks connected by a 10-yard chain. This season, \u201cchain gangs\u201d will still be on the sideline but will no longer be the primary method of measurement. That will fall to Sony\u2019s Hawk-Eye system, which uses six cameras placed throughout a stadium. The NFL claimed in April that its virtual process could save up to 40 seconds per play.",
      "The new technology won\u2019t, however, change the human error that can be introduced when officials spot the ball after every play.",
      "Can Philadelphia repeat?",
      "The Eagles\u2019 best case for a title defense begins with their power along both the offensive and defensive lines. Because of it, Saquon Barkley became just the ninth running back with a 2,000-yard season, and their defense could harass Kansas City star quarterback Patrick Mahomes in the Super Bowl despite never blitzing.",
      "But to reach Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara, California, Philadelphia will have to come out on top again in a deep NFC, with Green Bay, Detroit, Washington, San Francisco and the Los Angeles Rams lingering as contenders.",
      "In the AFC, Baltimore, Buffalo and Kansas City remain the class of the conference, with each team\u2019s title hopes hinging on the play of their quarterbacks. Expect reigning Most Valuable Player Josh Allen, the Ravens\u2019 Lamar Jackson and Mahomes to be in the MVP conversation again.",
      "Welcome to the league, rook",
      "Quarterback Cam Ward, the top overall pick in April\u2019s draft, begins his rookie season as the starter in Tennessee. Little is expected of the Titans but Ward has the capacity to surprise; look no further than his rise from zero-star high schooler to the top of the draft.",
      "The biggest draft curiosity entering the season surrounds second-pick Travis Hunter, the Heisman-winning receiver and cornerback whom Jacksonville will allow to play both ways in the pros, too. An upper-body injury cost Hunter more than a week of training camp, but he is expected to be available for the season\u2019s start.",
      "For the Giants, third overall pick Abdul Carter added more talent to what was already an imposing defensive line, but perhaps the bigger question is if, or when, first-round quarterback Jaxson Dart will start at quarterback.",
      "On the heels of bounce-back seasons by running backs in Philadelphia (Barkley) and Baltimore (Derrick Henry), rookie Ashton Jeanty (Las Vegas) will try to add to the belief that reports of the position\u2019s demise has been greatly exaggerated. The sixth overall pick, Jeanty ran roughshod through college defenses and will be highly featured by the Raiders and new offensive coordinator Chip Kelly.",
      "The variables that could shake up the season",
      "The NFL earned the nickname \u201cNot For Long,\u201d a reference to the all-too-brief length of most players\u2019 careers. It could also refer to the lifespan of trends that dominate football one year, only to be obsolete the next.",
      "Washington was last season\u2019s most unexpected success, advancing to its first conference title game in 33 years behind Daniels, the offensive rookie of the year. Yet the Commanders\u2019 outlier success converting on fourth downs, and the way Daniels caught the league by surprise, makes them also primed to be a candidate for regression.",
      "On the other end of last season\u2019s rookie quarterback spectrum were Chicago\u2019s Caleb Williams, Atlanta\u2019s Michael Penix Jr. and New England\u2019s Drake Maye. All were first-round picks but saw varying levels of playing time and success. As the No. 1 overall pick in 2024, Williams is under the most pressure to live up to expectations, especially after the Bears hired wunderkind offensive coordinator Ben Johnson as head coach.",
      "And Johnson wasn\u2019t the only star coordinator lost by the Detroit Lions. They\u2019re also replacing defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, who left to coach the Jets.",
      "It was only two years ago that San Francisco was playing in the Super Bowl. Then attrition decimated the roster in 2024, most notably star running back Christian McCaffrey. He is back healthy, but the 49ers had to let go of key pieces of its roster to afford quarterback Brock Purdy\u2019s new contract. Will the Niners still have enough talent to contend? Their odds of winning the NFC West also depend on whether the Rams, a division rival, can keep quarterback Matthew Stafford\u2019s aching back healthy all season."

    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom is launching an aggressive ad campaign Tuesday to boost his quest to revamp the state's congressional maps in response to Republican maneuvering in Texas.",
      "The initiative \u2014 which will involve 10 ads across television and digital by the week's end \u2014 is the first major push by Newsom\u2019s ballot measure committee aimed at blanketing Democrats with information on the remap question, called Prop 50, and driving out turnout for the Nov. 4 special election. In all, the undertaking \u2014 including ground organization and ads \u2014 could cost some $100 million.",
      "Newsom is leading the political group behind the ballot initiative, which has already drawn millions of dollars in fundraising, the campaign said.",
      "One ad, \"Blitzkrieg,\" directly attacks President Donald Trump, saying he is operating out of a dictator\u2019s playbook, attempting to suppress the free press, attacking major educational institutions and carrying out warrantless arrests. The other ad, \"Emergency,\" lays out a detailed case for why Democrats are embarking on the effort now.",
      "The ads premiere Tuesday across Newsom\u2019s social media accounts, which have drawn a surge in interest in recent weeks. Other ads to drop this week will feature Newsom himself, as well as Democratic California Sen. Alex Padilla.",
      "Newsom has called the Nov. 4 campaign the \"Election Rigging Response Act,\" with Prop 50 a reference of parity across 50 states. Voters will choose whether to move forward with a California remap that Newsom has said would neutralize Texas' redraw, which is expected to potentially add five Republican seats to the state.",
      "Newsom has framed his efforts as an attempt to level the playing field with Republicans, who have already signed into law a newly gerrymandered congressional map in Texas. They have also announced they are looking at similar opportunities elsewhere.",
      "The task around November\u2019s initiative, Newsom's team believes, is to motivate and drive out base voters and, unlike the strategy around national campaigns for Democrats, it will not focus on persuading a swing electorate. In that sense, the campaign blueprint is similar to that of Newsom\u2019s successful efforts to squash a recall effort in 2021.",
      "Newsom\u2019s opponents are already signaling they\u2019ll spend big on an advertising push aimed to convince voters to vote against his proposal; they\u2019ve booked and spent almost $10 million in ads so far, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact, and just launched their first ad that argues the ballot proposition \u201cthreatens\u201d the independent redistricting commission and a vote against the proposal is a vote to \u201cprotect your vote and democracy.\u201d",
      "Charles Munger Jr. a billionaire physicist who has long been a conservative mega-donor in the state, has already donated $20 million to the \u201cNo on Prop 50\u201d effort.",
      "Launching the ads from Newsom's social media accounts comes as interest exploded in his office's social media posts after it launched a series of mocking posts that mimicked Trump\u2019s all-caps style of communicating over social media.",
      "Since Aug. 1, the governor\u2019s press account grew by 500,000 followers and, according to his team, made more than 480 million impressions, an engagement rate that leapt by 35% and more than 2.5 million profile visits."

    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 A federal judge in California on Tuesday ruled that the Trump administration violated a 19th-century law barring the use of soldiers for civilian law enforcement activities when it mobilized 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles in June.",
      "\"The evidence at trial established that Defendants systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles,\" U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco said in a 52-page filing.",
      "\"In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act,\" he said.",
      "The judge's ruling strikes a blow to President Donald Trump's push to deploy troops to city streets as part of an effort to fight crime, though critics have branded the deployments as an overreach. Trump first deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles before sending soldiers into Washington, D.C., enraging many opponents and residents. The president has indicated his interest in deploying troops to other cities as well.",
      "Lawyers representing California argued during a trial last month that the president had exceeded his authority by deploying federal troops after thousands of protesters took to the streets of downtown L.A. to protest his immigration policies.",
      "California had asked Breyer to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to Gov. Gavin Newsom and to stop using the military \u201cto execute or assist in the execution of federal law.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice countered that the deployment was necessary to protect federal property and personnel, and that the troops acted within the confines of an obscure law called the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "The 1878 statute prohibits the president from using the military as a domestic police force without approval from Congress.",
      "The Trump administration \u201cdeployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, ostensibly to quell a rebellion and ensure that federal immigration law was enforced,\u201d the judge wrote in Tuesday\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cThere were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.\u201d",
      "Breyer ordered the Trump administration to stop using military troops in California \u201cto execute the laws, including but not limited to engaging in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants\u201d unless the situation meets the bar for invoking the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "The judge gave the Trump administration until noon on Sept. 12 to comply. The several hundred National Guard troops in Los Angeles are allowed to remain but must abide by the judge's order.",
      "\"Defendants are not required to withdraw the 300 National Guard troops currently stationed in Los Angeles, nor are they barred from using troops consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act,\" Breyer wrote.",
      "The judge also wrote that Trump\u2019s intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities would be \u201ccreating a national police force with the President as its chief.\u201d",
      "NBC news has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Newsom celebrated the ruling, saying in a statement that \"no president is a king \u2014 not even Trump \u2014 and no president can trample a state\u2019s power to protect its people.\"",
      "\"Trump\u2019s attempt to use federal troops as his personal police force is illegal, authoritarian, and must be stopped in every courtroom across this country,\" the statement added.",
      "Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton said during the trial last month that \u201cthe context matters.\"",
      "\u201cIf the purpose is the protection of law enforcement officers, it isn\u2019t law enforcement in the first place. It\u2019s instead protection,\u201d he said.",
      "But Breyer, a Clinton appointee and younger brother of retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, seemed skeptical, pushing Hamilton several times on what limits, if any, the Posse Comitatus Act posed to the president under his argument.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s the threat today? What was the threat yesterday? What was the threat last week or two weeks ago?\u201d he asked Hamilton. \u201cIt\u2019s the absence of any limits to a national police force. That\u2019s what I\u2019m sitting here trying to figure out.\u201d",
      "Meghan Strong, a California deputy attorney general, argued that having a standing army in Los Angeles defied a \u201cdeep-rooted policy against military involvement in civilian life\u201d and created an environment of fear.",
      "The \u201cchilling of economic activity in Los Angeles, including the closure of restaurants, the cancellation of events and people staying home for fear of the military\u201d were some of the lasting effects of the deployment of federal troops, she said.",
      "The Department of Defense ordered some 4,000 California National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles in June. Several hundred National Guard members remain in the city, while all the Marines have returned to their regular stations.",
      "The trial centered on the testimonies of three key figures. Two were ranking members of the task force overseeing the mission, and the third had decades of experience in immigration enforcement.",
      "Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, who commanded the National Guard troops, and William Harrington, deputy chief of staff for the task force, each told the court that intelligence briefings suggested there was minimal risk to immigration officers during several operations.",
      "During an exchange with Breyer, Sherman said he was told by his chain of command that federal troops could conduct security patrols as well as traffic, crowd and riot control, in addition to protecting federal property and personnel.",
      "\u201cWe were allowed to do these four things because it was in line with what the president was directing,\u201d Sherman said.",
      "Breyer bristled.",
      "\u201cWhat limiting factors are there, to the use of this force?\u201d Breyer asked. \u201cWhy is the federalized National Guard, even though it\u2019s been drawn down, still in place?\u201d",
      "Hamilton said the guard members and Marines were serving in a protective function, which is not a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "\u201cIn other words, we\u2019re going to see federal officers everywhere if the president determines there\u2019s a threat to the safety of federal agents?\u201d Breyer pressed Hamilton. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re saying the law is.\u201d"

      "Tiami Luxury Hybrid Mattress",

Another gentle cleanser that removes oil and buildup is,",

      "Avoid ingredients like formaldehyde, parabens, phthalates and sulfates, which can damage your hair, according to our experts. Formaldehyde can sometimes act as a preservative in clarifying shampoos but is a known carcinogen, experts say. Depending on your hair or scalp type, sulfates can strip hair of natural oils and be irritating to the scalp since they are intense detergents, according to our experts.",

Argan oil and jojoba oil are better options.Oily hair: A standard clarifying shampoo can help remove any excess oil, according to our experts. Although many experts recommend staying away from sulfates as much as possible, they may not be as bad for people with oily hair, experts say. Keratin-treated hair: Be cautious of using a clarifying shampoo since it can diminish the longevity of the treatment, says Kalanawi.",

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Clarifying shampoos can be beneficial for everyone, says Kalanawi. They\u2019re especially helpful if you exercise frequently, use a lot of hair styling products or don\u2019t shampoo your hair often, according to hairstylist Courtney Foster. However, how often or which type of clarifying shampoo will vary from person to person, depending on their hair texture and scalp health.",
      "Yes, a majority of deep-cleaning agents in clarifying shampoos will fade out hair color. This only applies to color-treated hair, so it will not affect your natural color, says Kalanawi. If you are concerned about clarifying shampoos stripping your hair color, use a sulfate-free option.",
      "Limit use to once a week, says Kalanawi. However, there is no one-size-fits-all rule: Your wash schedule should depend on how much you struggle with oil buildup and excess product residue.",
      "Start small with the expectation that you will see visible results after a handful of washes, according to our experts. For example, swimmers who are regularly in chlorinated water may want to use a clarifying shampoo about once a week to help remove chlorine from their hair, says Cheung. Others simply looking for more bounce and less weight should assess the state of their hair after a couple of washes. After that, you can use your best judgment and incorporate a clarifying shampoo as needed, according to Cheung. Use a conditioner or hair mask to keep your strands hydrated after a deep cleanse, she says.",
      "You can absolutely overuse a clarifying shampoo. If you use it too frequently, you are actually stripping your hair of its natural oils, which will make it feel dry and cause breakage, says Kalanawi.",
      "Overusing a clarifying shampoo also affects your scalp: It can cause your scalp to become dry, disrupt its microbiome and cause your hair to become brittle as a result, says Caspara.",

      "Chloe Malle has some fashionable shoes to fill after being named head of editorial content for Vogue U.S. on Sept. 2, replacing its iconic editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, who announced in June that she would be relinquishing some of her duties.",
      "Malle, who had been serving as the editor of Vogue.com and co-hosts \u201cThe Run-Through with Vogue\u201d podcast, is the only child of Candice Bergen and acclaimed late filmmaker Louis Malle. Her new job also kind of sort of features life imitating art: Bergen once played Vogue\u2019s hypercritical editor-in-chief on \u201cSex and the City.\u201d",
      "Bergen, in fact, began her career as a model and appeared on the cover of Vogue multiple times.",
      "\u201cThere is no question that I have 100 percent benefited from the privilege I grew up in,\u201d Malle told The New York Times after news of her Vogue appointment was announced, calling herself a \"proud 'nepo baby'\" in the interview.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s delusional to say otherwise. I will say, though, that it has always made me work much harder. It has been a goal for a lot of my life to prove that I\u2019m more than Candice Bergen\u2019s daughter, or someone who grew up in Beverly Hills.\u201d",
      "While Malle looks to continue to make her mark in fashion, her parents did just that in entertainment, showcasing their talents on the big and small screens. Read on to learn more about them.",
      "Candice Bergen",
      "Bergen, 79, is the daughter of famed ventriloquist and comedian Edgar Bergen and is best known for her work as the title character in the CBS sitcom \u201cMurphy Brown.\u201d She played a tough investigative reporter for the fictitious TV newsmagazine \u201cFYI.\u201d",
      "\u201cMurphy Brown\u201d aired for 10 seasons, from 1988 until 1998, and was rebooted for one season in 2018. During its original run, Bergen won five Emmy Awards for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series.",
      "Bergen also notched a pair of Emmy nominations for her work in the drama \u201cBoston Legal.\u201d",
      "She also has a distinguished career in film, earning a best supporting actress Academy Award nomination for \u201cStarting Over.\u201d She also starred in \u201cThe Sand Pebbles,\u201d \u201cCarnal Knowledge,\u201d \u201cGandhi,\u201d \u201cMiss Congeniality,\u201d \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d and \u201cBride Wars.\u201d",
      "Louis Malle",
      "Malle was a famed French director who earned three Oscar nominations in his lifetime, including one for best director for \u201cAtlantic City.\u201d He also helmed \u201cThe Silent World,\u201d a groundbreaking documentary that followed oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and his team of explorers.",
      "In addition, Malle directed such acclaimed titles as \u201cAu Revoir les Enfants,\u201d \u201cDamage,\u201d \u201cElevator to the Gallows,\u201d \u201cMy Dinner with Andre\u201d and \u201cThe Lovers.\u201d",
      "Malle died of lymphoma in 1995 at the age of 63."

      "Ryan says he\u2019s been writing since he was 20. He\u2019s written things that \u201cdidn\u2019t pan out\u201d and novels he put away, which he calls \u201clearning curves.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only way I found to keep going over the years in the face of that kind of adversity was to let go of this idea of the prize and keep telling myself, 'You\u2019re doing this because you love to do it,'\u201d he says.",
      "While he wrote \u201cBuckeye,\u201d he looked at a note taped to his desk in his own handwriting: \u201cNo one asked you to write.\u201d",

      "The sheriff\u2019s office attached Martin\u2019s post to its statement and reflected on learning of his battle with alcoholism.",

      "Sheriff Kyle Bourgault added in a statement that his \"deputies handled the situation professionally and without injury to anyone involved.\"",
      "\u201cBut the larger issue is not the resistance we encountered \u2014 it is the battle Mr. Martin himself is facing,\" he said. \"Addiction is a disease, and it requires both accountability and empathy.\u201d",

      "Martin is currently in the middle of his \u201cYears In The Making Tour.\u201d He had a show scheduled on Aug. 30 in Norway, Maine, and according to his website, he has upcoming concerts in Montgomery, Indiana, on Sept. 5 and Saginaw, Michigan, on Sept. 6."

    "summary": "\"The Wizard of Oz\" is playing at Las Vegas' Sphere with several notable changes to the film.",
    "story": [
      "Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion walked down the yellow brick road to Oz 86 years ago. Now, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d fans can feel like they\u2019re joining them.",
      "The Sphere in Las Vegas is bringing the film to life, with a reimagined version of the 1939 classic based on L. Frank Baum\u2019s \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\u201d",
      "During the experience, which opened Aug. 28, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is projected onto the Sphere\u2019s 160,000 square-foot display, immersing the audience in nearly 360-degree visuals and sound.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the show.",
      "Immersive Features",
      "\u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d fans will feel like they\u2019re stepping into the eye of a Kansas tornado when watching the movie at the Sphere.",
      "Due to the wraparound visuals, the Sphere says the audience will feel \u201cblown away\u201d during the scene in which Dorothy is transported from Kansas to Oz via cyclone.",
      "NBC News\u2019 Gadi Schwartz attended the experience reporting for TODAY and witnessed debris flying around the theater to bring to life the \u201cmonstrous tornado\u201d from the film.",
      "The audience is also engrossed in multi-sensory 4D elements during the film, including \u201chigh-velocity wind arrays, atmospheric fog, towering fire bursts, bubbles, and infrasound haptic seats,\" according to the Sphere's website.",
      "During one scene, in which Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Lion are being swarmed by flying winged monkeys, the audience appears to experience digitized versions of the creatures flying overhead.",
      "The Sphere even took the experience outside the physical venue \u2014 and up to the Las Vegas sky.",
      "Mimicking the Wicked Witch of the West writing a message to Dorothy using smoke in the sky, the Sphere shared an image of the line \u201cSURRENDER DOROTHY...OR DIE\u201d penned in puffs over the venue.",
      "Changes to \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019",
      "The Sphere experience also made some notable changes to play the film on its wraparound screen.",
      "First, the runtime. While \"The Wizard of Oz\" typically clocks in at around 102 minutes, the runtime for the Sphere show is 75 minutes.",
      "Then, there's the score. While the audience will hear Judy Garland\u2019s original vocals as Dorothy, the Sphere\u2019s version includes a re-recorded rendition of the original movie score for \u201cnew clarity.\u201d Sphere Studios separated the vocals from the instrumentals in the original tracks and used an orchestra to record a more detailed variation of the score, according to a video on the venue's official YouTube page.",
      "According to the Sphere, the new score transforms the original versions of songs like \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d into music better fit for the venue\u2019s 167,000 programmable speakers built into the seats.",
      "\u201cYou can actually feel the voice and effects,\u201d Carolyn Blackwood, head of Sphere Studios, said in the video. \u201cAnd with the 4D, you feel like you\u2019re there.\u201d",
      "The experience\u2019s producer, Jane Rosenthal, said in a video that their goal is to \u201cmaintain the integrity of the original filmmakers\u2019 intent.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of our cultural history,\u201d Rosenthal added. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take it and do anything with it.\u201d",
      "The film was originally shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio, but the Sphere's screen is not a flat rectangle. To adapt the classic film, the team used artificial intelligence to make it fit the massive display and improve the resolution. Visual effects specialists took the original sets and \u201cextended them realistically beyond that based on the production design,\u201d producer and CEO of software design company Magnopus Ben Grossmann said in a video about the experience.",
      "He explained that, working with a team at Google, they broke down the original \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d frame by frame using super resolution, pinpointing how to enhance the 1930s shots.",
      "For example, several shots solely show a character from their waist to the top of their head. The team used character outpainting to restore the shots and transform into the large displays for the Sphere.",
      "Similarly, some of the original closeup shots with minimal background details are now wider shots, meaning they must show more of the set and additional characters. The team used \"performance generation\" technology to illustrate what characters could have been doing in the background.",
      "The use of AI for the project has come with some controversy. Some described the alteration of the original work as an offense to cinema.",
      "\u201chonestly this is the ugliest and most dishonorable thing to happen to classic cinema in years,\u201d one social media user said on X.",
      "A recent Variety review of the showing called the effects, \u201ccreepy, applied over existing footage in a way that clearly interferes with the humanity of the underlying performances \u2014 that is, if there was an underlying performance to begin with.\u201d",
      "USA Today, however, dubbed the show \"nothing short of extraordinary.\"",
      "On the Sphere\u2019s website, the venue details how it uses AI and said, \u201cThrough \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 at Sphere, Sphere is leading the way in applying AI and visual effects to bring new creative possibilities to the entertainment industry, and wonder to the world.\u201d",
      "How Much Are Tickets to 'The Wizard of Oz' at the Sphere?",
      "Depending on seating, tickets for the film range in price from about $109 to $149.",
      "There are also two VIP packages available: the Good Witch Premium Experience and the Bad Witch Ultimate VIP Experience.",
      "The Good Witch experience \u2014 which includes expedited entry, a food and beverage credit and premium seating \u2014 costs about $320. The Bad Witch experience includes everything from the Good Witch package in addition to pre-show lounge access and a poster, and costs about $370."

      "\u201cWhat I knew is that by sharing some of our intimate information that we would see these two camps right? It would be people with an opinion versus people with an actual experience,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been a perfect example to see in the comments section.\u201d",

      "\"Too often, caregivers are judged quickly and unfairly by those who haven\u2019t lived this journey or stood on the front lines of it,\" she wrote. \"Sharing openly may invite opinions, but more importantly, it creates connection and validation for those actually navigating the realities of caregiving every day.\"",
      "Willis has five daughters: Rumer, Scout and Tallulah \u2014 whom he shares with ex-wife Demi Moore\u2014 and Mabel and Evelyn, whom he welcomed with Heming Willis. The blended family often spends time together for holidays and birthdays.",

      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for the end of \"Thursday Murder Club.\"",
      "In \"Thursday Murder Club,\" a Netflix movie based on Richard Osman's novel of the same name, four residents in the Coopers Chase retirement home have a hobby of trying to solve cold cases. Then, they find themselves in the middle of an active investigation.",
      "At the start of the film, they\u2019re faced with two conundrums: A case from the 1970s in which a woman was stabbed and fell out of a window; and the fact that Ian, the man who owns the land the home is built on, is going through a nasty divorce and has to sell \u2014 no matter who he mows down in the process.",
      "The members of the Club include Helen Mirren (as Elizabeth), Pierce Brosnan (as Ron), Ben Kingsley (as Ibrahim), Celia Imrie (as Joyce) and, from her bed in a coma, Susan Kirby as Penny, the former policewoman who helped her friends (now members) get old case logs to solve.",
      "On top of that we\u2019ve got familiar, most-welcome faces in Richard E. Grant (Bobby), David Tennant (Ian), Tom Ellis (Jason), and Jonathan Pryce (Stephen), all of whom turn up playing various dubious characters.",
      "Naomi Ackie (Donna) is the policewoman who\u2019s stuck serving tea to her co-workers until the Club tricks the force into putting her on Tony\u2019s murder investigation.",
      "Beyond the central mystery, there are side stories.",
      "Elizabeth has a mysterious background (turns out she worked for MI6) and a beloved husband (Pryce) with dementia. Ron, a former union organizer, has a famous son whose star is fading. Ibrahim lives meticulously but never felt he fit in anywhere. Joyce\u2019s hard-driving hedge fund daughter who turns out to be an unexpected ally. Elizabeth makes two newfound friends in Donna and Ian\u2019s assistant Bogdan (Henry Lloyd-Hughes), one of which turns out to not be as much of a friend as she\u2019d imagined.",
      "Read on for a rundown of what happens.",
      "Who Dies and Who Are the Killers in \u2018Thursday Murder Club\u2019?",
      "The story really picks up when the murders start. Ian\u2019s partner Tony (Geoff Bell) turns up dead after an argument with Ian \u2014 he won\u2019t sell his portion of the property, since his dear aunt lives in the home. Then, Ian himself also keels over.",
      "What might surprise viewers is to find out there\u2019s a link among all of these players to the cold case the Club has been trying to solve \u2014 one that involves a long-missing third partner (and crime lord) in the home, who has full control over what happens to the home after Tony and Ian snuff it.",
      "In the end, after a lot of tea and cake, fooling the police, Club trickery and a sudden buyer who turns up to purchase the property and save it, here\u2019s whodunit for all four murders. Yep, all four.",
      "Tony is done in by Bogdan, who swears he didn\u2019t mean to do it. Bogdan is an illegal Polish worker in the UK and Tony wouldn\u2019t give him back his passport.",
      "The cold case's solution also relates to the residents of Coopers Chase.",
      "Peter, Angela\u2019s boyfriend at the time, killed his girlfriend. Early on we learn that he probably was guilty all along \u2014 but was considered \u201cone of the boys\u201d by the police at the time and allowed to disappear.",
      "Well, not all of \u201cthe boys\u201d agreed with that \u2014 Penny, who was low person at the station at the time, was sure Peter had killed Angela, and tired of seeing so many abusers get off, she killed him herself. Her husband John kept this a secret for decades.",
      "When Ian decided to start digging up the church and gravesite ahead of selling off the land (and repurposing the home as an events location), John knew he\u2019d find the bones of Mercer, which he and Penny had hidden in the graveyard.",
      "He worried his wife would be implicated after all these years, and took out Ian with a needle full of fentanyl. Once John confesses, the rest of the Club leave him for a last moment with his comatose wife, knowing he will use another fentanyl needle to let her go to a peaceful rest (because once he\u2019s jailed, he can\u2019t be there for her).",
      "Is Coopers Chase saved?",
      "It almost certainly is! Elizabeth suggests that Joyce\u2019s financially-focused daughter Joanna (Ingrid Oliver) should buy the place, an offer Joanna finds \u201cintriguing.\u201d And since Coopers Chase appears in Osman\u2019s sequels, it\u2019s safe to say this was only an attempted murder.",
      "As of now, Netflix hasn\u2019t confirmed that they plan to make movies of the rest of Osman\u2019s books, but we already know we\u2019re ready to return to the scenes of the crimes."

      "While the television series has stayed relatively true to the books it is based on so far, fans noticed at the end of Season 3, Episode 8, that the show has largely run out of content to cover.",
      "But, there are still three episodes left, which will air each Wednesday until the finale Sept. 17.",
      "On Aug. 29, Prime Video released a trailer for the show's final act, giving viewers a sneak peek at what might be ahead after all of Season 3's drama and heartbreak so far. (Warning: Spoilers ahead for Season 3 of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty.\")",
      "What Happens in the New Trailer for the Final Episodes of \u2018The Summer I Turned Pretty\u2019?",
      "At the very end of the third season\u2019s eighth episode, the show's main character, Belly (Lola Tung), spontaneously buys a ticket to Paris, the destination of her study abroad dreams.",
      "Belly\u2019s leap of faith came immediately after her engagement with Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) ended on their wedding day, following his accusation that she's still in love with his brother, Conrad (Christopher Briney). The episode ended with Belly ready to start a new adventure.",
      "The trailer hints that the rest of the season will follow Belly on her journey in Paris.",
      "With the song \u201cAnything Can Happen\u201d playing in the background, Belly is shown taking off her engagement ring on the plane, then jumping headfirst into her experience abroad.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even know who I am anymore. I need to find the person that I can be,\u201d Belly says in the a voiceover as she admires Paris monuments and makes new friends.",
      "In various clips, she runs through Paris gardens, takes in the view of the Eiffel Tower and dances with some unfamiliar faces. The end of the trailer, however, teases that she hasn't fully left her old life behind: It's revealed that Conrad has sent her a letter, and Briney can be heard saying \u201cDear Belly\" right before the trailer ends.",
      "For many viewers, the mid-season trailer came as a surprise.",
      "\u201cNext time before you post a teaser, first tell us to take seat,\u201d one user commented on X.",
      "\u201cUNCHARTED WATERS. I\u2019ve got a pit in my stomach, especially after \u2018Dear Belly,\u2019\u201d another fan added.",
      "\u201cUncharted territory for us book readers. I\u2019m stressed,\u201d added another.",
      "How Does the Book End?",
      "(Warning: Spoilers ahead for \"We'll Always Have Summer\" by Jenny Han.)",
      "The third season of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" has closely followed the events of the third book in the young adult series. \"We'll Always Have Summer\" ends with Jeremiah and Belly calling off their wedding, followed by a mere three-page epilogue \u2014 so going forward in the show, \"anything can happen,\" as Prime Video notes.",
      "In that epilogue, the story jumps forward \"a couple of years later\" to Belly reading the letter Susannah left for her wedding day. As she reflects on Susannah's message, Belly reveals that she is marrying Conrad.",
      "She recaps that after the broken engagement with Jeremiah, she did study abroad \u2014 in Spain. During her time overseas, she had \u201clots and lots of adventures,\" Belly says in the epilogue. And like the trailer hints, Conrad re-connected with her by sending letters. While she didn\u2019t write back at first, \u201cthey still came, once a month, every month.\u201d",
      "Then, she says when she saw him at her college graduation a year later, she \u201cjust knew\" they were meant to be together.",
      "The book ends with Belly and Conrad enjoying their happy ending. After their wedding, they run together into the water at Cousins Beach.",
      "\"This is our start. This is the moment it becomes real,\" Belly says in the last paragraph of the book.",
      "What Do Conrad's Letters Say In the Book?",
      "In some editions of \"We'll Always Have Summer,\" Han includes bonus content, including some of the letters Conrad wrote to Belly while she was in Spain.",
      "He starts his first letter by sending Belly her beloved polar bear stuffed animal, Junior Mint, which he won for her during one of their summers together in Cousins.",
      "Throughout the letters, Conrad shares the latest news from home and brings up inside jokes, such as her obsession with Sour Patch Kids and their time spending Christmas together.",
      "In one notable letter excerpt, he says Belly\u2019s mom, Laurel, told him that Belly \u201cmet some Spanish guy named Benito, and he rides around on a scooter.\u201d",
      "Whether or not the show will include a new love interest for Belly is unclear. But, as some fans on Reddit note, it seems like the final episodes will have a lot of ground to cover.",
      "\u201cWow, that ending with Conrad!\" one fan wrote. \"I almost wish we had a Season 4 now.\""

      "TIANJIN, China \u2014 A private car ride with Vladimir Putin may not be as special as President Donald Trump thought.",
      "With a backseat bromance of their own, as well as hand-holding and hugs, the Russian leader, his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, and their host, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, put on a display Monday that seemed designed to turn heads in Washington.",
      "The three leaders staked out long-held positions in comments at this key regional summit in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, but the tenor and the timing of the trio's embrace was impossible to ignore.",
      "India, long courted by the West as a crucial Asian partner and counterweight to China, has been rattled by Trump\u2019s tariffs; the Kremlin has publicly brushed aside Washington's peace push in Ukraine; and Beijing continues to spar with the U.S. over trade, Taiwan and global influence.",
      "Amid this thicket of tensions, the cozy optics at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) gathering appeared a clear signal in the face of U.S. pressure.",
      "Weeks after Trump and Putin made headlines with a protocol-busting ride in \u201cThe Beast\u201d at their Alaska summit, Modi joined the Russian leader for a drive in the back of Putin's own armored limo \u2014 a not-so-subtle statement of defiance just days after the U.S. doubled tariffs on India to 50% as punishment for buying Russian oil.",
      "Russian state media reporter Pavel Zarubin said the pair spent nearly an hour in the car before proceeding to bilateral talks.",
      "\u201cI always feel that meeting you has been a memorable experience,\u201d Modi said to Putin later during the talks.",
      "The Russian leader called Modi his \"dear friend,\" espousing Russia and India's \"friendly and trusting\" relations.",
      "In a speech to delegates, Putin did say that \u201cunderstandings\u201d reached at his summit with Trump could form the basis for peace in Ukraine, but he gave little indication of a shift in his position and issued his customary rebuke blaming the West\u2019s \u201cconstant attempts to drag Ukraine into NATO\u201d for causing the war.",
      "'A totally one sided disaster!'",
      "Perhaps watching from Washington, Trump said Monday that the relationship between India and the U.S. had been \u201ca totally one sided disaster!\u201d and chided New Delhi for buying \u201cmost of its oil and military products from Russia,\u201d and \u201cvery little from the U.S.\u201d",
      "He said that India had now offered to cut their tariffs on U.S. goods to zero. \"But it's getting late,\" Trump added.",
      "Whether the theatrics in Tianjin were spontaneous or carefully planned, \u201cthe message remains the same,\u201d Keir Giles, a senior fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe close relationship that Trump sought with Putin is now on display between Putin and others,\u201d he said, adding that the U.S. had \"given India a real cause to look for friendship and partnership elsewhere.\"",

      "He outlined his longstanding ambition to challenge the U.S.-led global economic and security order. \u201cWe must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics, and practice true multilateralism,\u201d he said, while laying out a new \u201cGlobal Governance Initiative\u201d that was short on concrete policies.",
      "Talking in Tianjin",

      "China welcomed dozens of leaders from Eurasian member states and other partner and observer countries for talks on trade, energy cooperation and regional stability. Their motorcades brought car and pedestrian traffic to a halt, with the area around the sprawling event venue on lockdown and security stepped up at the city\u2019s train station.",
      "Security barriers and police-manned checkpoints were present throughout Tianjin, with authorities' usual caution exacerbated by a spectacular military parade set to take place Wednesday in nearby Beijing.",
      "Focus on the growing summit, part of China\u2019s long-running effort to challenge U.S. dominance, has only been amplified this year by global upheaval from Trump-era policies and other foreign policy shifts.",
      "India and China have long sparred over their Himalayan border, trade tensions and Beijing\u2019s support for India\u2019s rival, Pakistan.",
      "But shared grievances \u2014 including Trump\u2019s tariffs, which in China\u2019s case have reached as high as 145% \u2014 have helped carve out common ground.",
      "Against that backdrop, Modi\u2019s first visit to China in seven years and his apparent camaraderie with Xi and Putin appeared especially striking.",
      "While Modi joyously clasped Trump\u2019s hand during a massive rally in Texas in 2019, Indian media on Monday seized on his friendship with Putin as a message of defiance against the U.S.",
      "Indian television channel Republic World called it a \u201cbig diplomatic win\u201d for India, while a headline on news channel Aaj Tak ran \u201cTrump\u2019s dictator vs. Modi-Putin\u2019s friendship.\u201d",

      "LONDON \u2014 As British detectives studied the grainy CCTV video of the burning warehouse, there was at first little reason to think they were looking at a covert Russian intelligence operation.",
      "The March 2024 video from the Cromwell Industrial Estate in east London showed two masked men pouring gasoline outside the warehouse door, setting it ablaze with a burning rag, and then fleeing into the night.",
      "The fact that the storage facility belonged to a Ukrainian logistics company that was shipping humanitarian aid and Starlink satellite internet dishes to Ukraine did not initially raise any alarms.",

      "The investigation and the prosecution that followed would shed light on what Western officials have warned is a dangerous Russian tactic: hiring local criminals to carry out acts of sabotage across Europe.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new thing to see criminal proxies used on behalf of foreign states,\u201d Cmdr. Dominic Murphy, the head of the counter-terrorism unit at London\u2019s Metropolitan Police, told British broadcaster Sky News, NBC News\u2019 international partner, in July. \u201cWe have seen this trend developing over the last year or two, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll continue to see it develop over the next year or so.\u201d",
      "Over the last year, NATO governments have accused Russian intelligence agencies of remotely recruiting criminals and using them to sow chaos.",
      "The exact number of attacks is difficult to quantify. The allegations range from Britain to Estonia to the Czech Republic to Poland \u2014 where, authorities say, Russia paid a group to burn down the country\u2019s biggest shopping mall in May 2024.",
      "Moscow denies all allegations of sabotage, including in the case in London. \u201cRussia has never engaged in sabotage activities against the United Kingdom and has no intention of doing so,\u201d the Russian Embassy in the United Kingdom said in a statement.",
      "Calvin Bailey, a British member of Parliament who sits on the Defense Select Committee, said the London attack fit a pattern in which Russian operatives used encrypted apps and cryptocurrency to hire criminals as they tried to mask their own involvement.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re incentivized by money but the use of Telegram and bitcoin creates plausible deniability and allows the Russians to keep their distance,\u201d Bailey said in a recent interview. \u201cIt hides the trail, be that a money trail or any of the connections.\u201d",
      "According to British prosecutors the trail that led to the warehouse burning in east London began in March 2024, when a 21-year-old British drug dealer named Dylan Earl initiated communications with an anonymous account on Telegram with the usernames \u201cPrivet Bot\u201d and \u201cLucky Strike.\u201d",
      "The account was run by an operative with the Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group that fought in Syria and Ukraine before it launched a short-lived mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2023 but has now been brought to heel by the Kremlin.",
      "Earl expressed interest in joining Wagner as a gun-for-hire, saying, \u201cI need a fresh start\u201d after his life of small-time crime in the U.K, according to documents released by prosecutors.",
      "But the Russian handler said Wagner had a different use for him: carrying out operations in Europe.",
      "Over the course of hundreds of messages, the Russian handler offered the young British criminal both money and ideological encouragement to burn down the warehouse, which could net him roughly $8,000.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll make you rich. And grant you things no one else can. Citizenships. Passports. Everything,\u201d the Russian handler said in a message posted on the Privet Bot account.  In another, the handler said, \u201cYou are our dagger in Europe.\u201d",
      "Earl was also encouraged to embrace a clandestine lifestyle by watching the FX show \u201cThe Americans\u201d about KGB spies operating undercover in the United States.",
      "\u201cLook how they describe Russia. But you see U.K. and USA,\u201d the handler wrote.  \u201cHomeless everywhere. Drugs etc. It is fearmongering bro. They want people scared.\u201d",
      "Earl knew he was dealing with a Wagner operative but did not back down.",
      "Within weeks of their initial messages, Earl had recruited a group of young accomplices to carry out the warehouse attack. According to prosecutors, only one of them \u2014 Jake Reeves, 23 \u2014 understood that they were starting the fire on Russian orders.",
      "Neither Earl nor Reeves was present when the fire was started by Nii Kojo Mensah, 23, Jakeem Rose, 21, and Ugnius Asmena, 23, all of whom were convicted of aggravated arson. Instead, they watched a livestream of the blaze on FaceTime provided by Asmena.",
      "The men who actually started the fire believed it was merely a criminal act \u2014 Earl never told them they were acting on Russian orders.",
      "British detectives stepped up the hunt after they realized they were most likely dealing with a Russian state-sponsored operation targeting the Ukrainian business. They arrested Earl in early April and after they accessed his phone, quickly established his connection to the Wagner group.",
      "Earl and Reeves both pleaded guilty to aggravated arson and offenses under British national security laws.",
      "There is no suggestion that they were linked to other attacks across Europe or the groups carrying them out.",
      "\u201cThis case is a clear example of an organization linked to the Russian state using 'proxies' \u2014 in this case British men \u2014 to carry out very serious criminal activity in this country on their behalf,\u201d Murphy, the Met counterterrorism head, said in a statement after the verdict.",
      "The suspected Russian-backed criminal attacks across Europe are usually unsophisticated intelligence operations. Many of the plots, like the one in London, involve arson.",
      "In June, a Colombian man was imprisoned for eight years in the Czech Republic after he was convicted of setting fire to buses in Prague. Like Earl, he was also given orders by a Russian handler over the Telegram messaging app and told to record himself setting the fire, according to Czech authorities.",
      "That type of attack is relatively low-risk for Russia, compared with sending its own professional agents into an increasingly hostile Europe.",
      "But there is some evidence that the Russian operative handling Earl had higher ambitions for his group of British gangsters-for-hire.",
      "British police said that at the time of their arrest they had already begun surveillance operations for their next plot: kidnapping a Russian dissident named Yevgeny Chichvarkin and setting fire to his Michelin-starred Hide restaurant in one of London\u2019s most expensive neighborhoods."

      "\u201cWe are one of the biggest Bitcoin mining companies on Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe mine about 3% of the world\u2019s Bitcoin every single day.\u201d",
      "He insists that the family\u2019s business is separate from national politics and has dismissed concerns about conflicts of interest.",
      "\u201cMy father\u2019s totally shielded off from our company. There\u2019s total separation of church and state,\u201d he told CNBC in December. \u201cWe have great ethics advisers. We take it incredibly seriously.\u201d",
      "But Donald Trump was a major topic of discussion at his son\u2019s Q&A in Hong Kong, which began with a round of applause for the president, who has vowed to make the United States the \u201ccrypto capital of the world.\u201d",
      "Since returning to office in January, Trump has pushed to ease regulation of the industry, shut down the Justice Department\u2019s national cryptocurrency enforcement team, appointed a \u201ccrypto czar\u201d and held a White House summit for industry leaders. He also said the U.S. would create a national strategic crypto reserve.",
      "This month he signed an executive order allowing cryptocurrency and real estate investments to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts, which critics say could put Americans\u2019 retirement savings at risk.",
      "Trump has also sought legislative backing for a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, some of which is already in place. One of the three bills that received support on Capitol Hill last month was the GENIUS Act, which allows stablecoins to be issued by private companies.",
      "The passage of the bills was slammed by Americans for Financial Reform, a left-leaning watchdog group, which said in a statement last month that Trump and his allies would \u201cpersonally benefit from limitless legalized corruption while the rest of us stand in harm\u2019s way of the next crypto implosion.\u201d",
      "Trump, who said in 2021 that Bitcoin \u201cseems like a scam,\u201d has since embraced it as a moneymaking opportunity, sometimes at great cost to investors. According to the watchdog group State Democracy Defenders Fund, as of mid-March his crypto assets were valued at $2.9 billion, or about 37% of his total wealth.",
      "Much of that money, which Trump earned in about six months, came from ventures such as the $TRUMP coin that he launched ahead of his inauguration, which was trading at nearly $8 on Friday, down from its peak of $73 in January. A meme coin was also launched for first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Industry professionals call these meme coins, meaning they have little practical use and are mostly symbolic, making their value subject to extreme volatility. About 764,000 wallets of mostly small holders lost money on $TRUMP while 58 wallets made more than $10 million each, CNBC reported in May, citing data from the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.",
      "In May, Trump briefly appeared at a dinner outside Washington for the 220 largest buyers of $TRUMP, who spent an average of $1 million on the token.",
      "Trump also has a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized crypto exchange that was launched last fall and is majority-controlled by the Trump family.",
      "World Liberty\u2019s flagship project is its $WLFI stablecoin, which holders voted last month to make more widely tradable. The family also stands to gain from an agreement by a technology company backed by the government of the United Arab Emirates to invest $2 billion in one of World Liberty\u2019s stablecoin products.",
      "That currency will then be used to invest in Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, whose CEO stepped down in 2023 after the company pleaded guilty to money laundering and other charges.",
      "The deal was announced at a crypto conference Eric Trump attended in Abu Dhabi shortly before his father visited the United Arab Emirates city in May.",
      "Even amid the enthusiasm at the Hong Kong conference on Friday, participants said there was some discomfort around the Trump family\u2019s involvement in the cryptocurrency industry.",
      "\u201cThere is serious conflict of interest, and people recognize it,\u201d said Bharat Prabhakar, 25, a New York-based conference attendee. \"But not a lot of people say it out loud because there\u2019s real consequences for it.\""

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Diana, Princess of Wales, is for many a symbol of life in the 1990s. And now a time capsule she buried nearly 35 years ago has been opened, revealing a treasure trove of memorabilia.",
      "The capsule was placed inside a wall at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in 1991 with the help of two children who won a TV competition.",
      "It contained relics of a pre-internet-enabled age, including an early pocket TV, a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator and a copy of The Times newspaper.",
      "The items were decided via a competition run by the long-running British children\u2019s TV show \u201cBlue Peter\u201d \u2014 viewers were asked to decide eight things that represented life in the 1990s. Despite some moisture damage, the items were still recognizable.",
      "The box was not due to be opened until centuries had passed, but the timeline had to be drastically cut short because the hospital is demolishing existing buildings to build a new children\u2019s cancer center.",
      "The CD was the choice of David Watson, then age 11, from Devon in western England, as well as a sheet of recycled paper and a European passport.",
      "A collection of British coins, a container with five tree seeds and a snowflake hologram were the choices of Sylvia Foulkes, then age 9, from Norwich in eastern England.",
      "It's unclear what the children, who would both now be in their 40s, thought of the opening. The hospital told NBC News that it was no longer in touch with them.",
      "The hospital asked staff members either born in 1991 or already working there in 1991 to help remove the capsule.",
      "One of the latter, senior health play specialist Janet Holmes, said: \"It brought back so many memories seeing the pocket TV in there \u2014 I had bought one for my husband back in the day, for when he had a break whilst driving his coach around the country. They were very expensive then!\"",
      "Anyone born in or after the 1990s may struggle to understand that this coveted gadget \u2014 the Casio TV430 \u2014 had a 2-inch screen and a battery life of just a few hours.",
      "Minogue, the Australian singer then famous in Britain for a string of pop hits, as well as her role in the TV soap opera \"Neighbours,\" is still a major international star.",
      "CDs, however, were then relatively new: They surpassed cassettes and LPs as the leading music format in the United States only in 1991.",
      "Great Ormond Street, known as GOSH, is the U.K.\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospital and a major center for pediatric research in Europe. Diana became its president in 1989 and visited multiple times.",
      "Diana was part of the ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the Variety Club Building in 1991 \u2014 to mark it, she sealed a time capsule in the hospital's main entrance.",
      "She was following royal tradition: A former Princess of Wales, Alexandria, laid the foundation stone for an older GOSH building in 1872 and also sealed a time capsule. Curiously, however, the hospital said that capsule has still never been found.",
      "GOSH said the new cancer center \"will make it easier for clinical teams to develop kinder, more effective treatments, all delivered in a child-focused environment where children can play, learn and be with their family while at hospital.\"",
      "While the hospital is run by the taxpayer-funded National Health Service, it still has to raise money for big projects, and the 300 million-pound ($403 million) fundraising drive to build the new center is the biggest in its history."

      "According to an E.U. document, Poland logged 2,732 cases of interference in January 2025, up from 1,908 in late 2023. Lithuania recorded 1,185 cases in the same month, more than double the figure from March 2024.",

      "Germany\u2019s top military commander, Gen. Carsten Breuer, said Monday there had been a significant increase in GPS jamming incidents since the war in Ukraine began, adding that he had personally experienced it on two occasions, once over the Baltic Sea and again during a military exercise in Lithuania.",
      "Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Sweden and Germany have formally declared such interference a form of Russian hybrid warfare.",
      "A 'happy propaganda coup'?",
      "Open-source research tracing the origins of interference repeatedly points to two hot spots: Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad exclave, wedged between Poland and Lithuania, and the St. Petersburg area in western Russia. Both regions host a heavy concentration of Russian military units specializing in electronic warfare.",
      "In March 2024, a Royal Air Force plane carrying the U.K.\u2019s then\u2013defense secretary, Grant Shapps, also reported a spoofing incident, where false location data was fed to the aircraft\u2019s navigation systems.",
      "The plane, which had been flying near Kaliningrad, was able to continue its journey safely, but such tactics have in the past caused planes to veer off course.",
      "The incident with von der Leyen\u2019s plane occurred while she was on a four-day tour of E.U. member states that border Russia, Belarus or the Black Sea.",
      "While \u201cincredibly irresponsible,\u201d jamming von der Leyen\u2019s plane wasn\u2019t necessarily a \u201cmalicious action\u201d directed against her specifically, said Thomas Withington, an electronic warfare and air defense expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 India is increasingly important to the United States as a key Asian security partner and a counterweight to China. But President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs may be pushing it closer to Beijing instead.",

      "On Sunday, Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Tianjin, where China is hosting a summit of the 10-member Shanghai Cooperation Organization.",
      "Xi told Modi that the world\u2019s two most populous countries should be \u201cpartners rather than rivals\u201d and that the \u201cdragon\u201d and the \u201celephant\u201d should come together.",
      "Modi told Xi that they were \u201ccommitted to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities.\u201d",
      "Their meeting comes days after the Trump administration doubled tariffs on Indian imports to 50% as punishment for buying Russian oil. The stinging levy, one of the highest on any U.S. trading partner, has raised concerns that it could push India closer to China despite years of tensions.",
      "\u201cUntil about three, four months ago, relations between China and India were not bad, they were very bad. They were not talking to each other,\u201d said Kishore Mahbubani, a Singaporean diplomat and former president of the United Nations Security Council.",
      "\u201cI have to give credit where it\u2019s due: President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose a 50% tariff on India is one of the biggest shocks that India has ever got in recent times,\u201d Mahbubani said Wednesday at an event in Hong Kong organized by the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Center on Contemporary China and the World.",
      "India, along with China, is a top purchaser of Russian crude oil, which Trump says is helping to fund Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine. New Delhi says such criticism is \u201cunjustified and unreasonable,\u201d and that the U.S. previously encouraged it to buy the oil to keep global prices from soaring as Western countries suspended their purchases.",
      "While India and China share a common grievance over Trump\u2019s tariffs, which in China\u2019s case have reached as high as 145%, analysts say their relationship still faces major challenges and that Modi\u2019s China visit is mainly a symbolic display of resilience.",
      "\u201cXi wants Modi and India to show that they are working with him and with China to the extent that they are not following the Trump or U.S. lead in containing China,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the SOAS University of London.",
      "Last month, the Chinese ambassador to New Delhi delivered a rare public defense of India against the tariff increase, calling the U.S. a \u201cbully.\u201d",
      "It was a major step up from the deep freeze that began in 2020 with a border clash in India\u2019s Himalayan region of Ladakh that killed at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers and plunged relations to the point that the two countries suspended direct flights.",
      "Only seven months ago, India was entering Trump\u2019s second presidential term in a relatively strong position, with Modi among the first world leaders to visit his \u201cdear friend\u201d at the White House.",
      "But tensions soon arose, with Trump complaining that Apple was producing iPhones in India instead of the U.S. India also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that he brokered a ceasefire in its four-day conflict with neighboring Pakistan.",
      "New Delhi was further incensed weeks later when Trump hosted Pakistan\u2019s powerful army chief at the White House in an unprecedented meeting.",
      "\u201cThe Indians saw this as a slap in the face for them,\u201d Mahbubani said. \u201cSo there is now, even as we are speaking, a tremendous amount of re-evaluation going on in Delhi about where India\u2019s place in the world is.\u201d",
      "At the same time, China and India have been moving cautiously to restore their relationship, reaching a deal to resolve their 2020 border standoff and announcing the resumption of direct flights.",
      "But not everybody is convinced about China extending a friendly hand, and the two countries still have major differences.",
      "One of the biggest is China\u2019s ties with Pakistan, India\u2019s archrival and a fellow nuclear power. During their conflict in May, Pakistan said it had used Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets to shoot down Indian military aircraft.",
      "\u201cThere was a huge step up in the kind of assistance that the Chinese were providing Pakistan, not merely in terms of selling them equipment and platforms, but on intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance,\u201d Gautam Bambawale, a former Indian ambassador to Beijing, said in an interview. \u201cSo we will go by actions on those things.\u201d",
      "Bambawale said it could take \u201cmonths, if not years\u201d for the relationship to return to where it was before 2020, let alone reach new heights.",
      "Though India and China are strong trading partners, that has not been enough to smooth over other diplomatic issues.",
      "Earlier this month, after a meeting in New Delhi between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, Beijing released a readout suggesting Jaishankar had acknowledged that Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy, \u201cis a part of China.\u201d",
      "When asked if Jaishankar made that statement, an Indian government official who was familiar with the discussions between the diplomats but not authorized to speak to the media, told NBC News that there was no change in India\u2019s position on Taiwan.",
      "\u201cWe stressed that like the rest of the world, India has a relationship with Taiwan that focuses on economic, technology and cultural ties,\u201d the official said.",
      "The clarification, which was also reported by Indian news organizations, prompted Beijing to double down, saying it was a \u201csurprise\u201d and \u201cinconsistent with the facts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would seem that some people in India have tried to undermine China\u2019s sovereignty on the Taiwan question and impede the improvement of China-India relations,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.",
      "The two countries also have other border disputes, as well as a manufacturing rivalry that may only worsen as companies try to shift production from China. China, which is worried about technology transfer, has imposed curbs on the export of rare earth materials to India and recalled some of its nationals working in specialized roles.",
      "\u201cThe meeting between Modi and Xi will not remove the structural issues between India and China,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cBut the big issue for Xi outside of China now is U.S. pressure, and making sure India does not appear to be on the U.S. side is therefore significant.\u201d",
      "\u201cOn this occasion, optics does matter,\u201d he added."

He was appointed as prime minister in August 2024.",
      "Al-Rahawi is the most senior Houthi official to be killed since the United States and Israel began their air and naval campaign in response to the rebels\u2019 missile and drone attacks on Israel and on ships in the Red Sea. The U.S. and Israeli strikes killed dozens of people. One U.S. strike in April hit a prison holding African migrants in the northern Sadaa province, killing at least 68 people and wounding 47 others."

      "That reasoning, he told reporters in Kyiv, is \u201cartificial \u2026 because they want to show the United States that they are constructive, but they are not constructive.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "STEVENAGE, England \u2014 A tide of red and white is rising across England \u2014 hoisted on lampposts, daubed on crosswalks, stuck on apartment windows.",
      "Those behind it insist this campaign to raise the English flag, known as St. George\u2019s Cross, is an expression of patriotism; others see the sudden prevalence of the banner, sometimes associated with soccer hooliganism and racism, as a hostile statement of surging far-right sentiment.",
      "The febrile debate went global this week when Elon Musk, the former adviser to President Donald Trump and backer of far-right movements globally, posted a picture of the flag on X. Vice President JD Vance also staged his latest intervention into British life, urging people to \u201cpush back against the crazies\u201d who criticize flying the flag.",
      "'Operation Raise the Colours'",
      "In a country where the national flag is rare outside of sporting events, the banners now fluttering above a highway here in Stevenage are typical of those popping up nationwide in recent weeks as part of the grassroots \u201cOperation Raise the Colours.\u201d",
      "The flags were put up here last week by a five-strong group including Louis Turvey, who read about the national movement on Facebook, where he said he gets most of his news.",
      "Turvey, 33, who has Roma heritage and was raised in London, 30 minutes away by train, says he was in no way motivated by far-right or hostile feelings. Rather he wanted to do something positive and fly his national flag \u201clike you see on holiday in Greece or Spain,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI saw all the flags going up around the country and thought, \u2018How lovely is that?\u2019 But I went for a little drive round Stevenage and didn\u2019t see any,\u201d Turvey, a former demolition worker with auburn curls, a hipster mustache, a low-buttoned shirt and a single earring, told NBC News over coffee at a nearby Starbucks. \u201cI kept thinking: Who\u2019s going to do it\u201d around here? \u201cWell, you know what? I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d",
      "He met his fellow flaggers through his online handle \u201cStevenage Patriots\u201d and had never met them before, he said. \u201cI\u2019m gay and a lot of my friends are girls, so I was quite nervous hanging around with four straight lads,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it was such a lovely evening, quite spiritual actually, quite calming.\u201d",
      "However, he soon experienced just how charged this debate has become when, just as his group was packing up, someone threw two Molotov cocktails at them, the second cutting Turvey\u2019s head and covering his face with blood. \u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d he said, visibly shaken by an incident he says has put a pause on his flag-hoisting activities for the time being at least.",
      "Critics see darker forces undergirding the broader flag campaign.",
      "They view this groundswell as little more than an aggressive, provocative message to people with an immigrant background and nonwhite residents.",
      "The anti-racist campaign group Hope Not Hate reported that the founders of Operation Raise the Colours include \u201cwell-known far-right extremists\u201d and allies of Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record who has become a leading nationalist voice in Britain. Indeed, Musk himself has used his X audience of 223 million to voice support for Robinson, as well as other far-right figures in Britain and across Europe.",
      "NBC News messaged the three administrators of the Operation Raise the Colours Facebook page, asking for comment and interviews with these founders, but did not receive a response.",
      "These fears are widespread. When a St. George\u2019s Cross was painted on the wall of St. John the Baptist church, in the town of Lincoln, the vicar, Rachel Heskins, saw it as a clear \u201cattempt to intimidate\u201d the diverse local community.",
      "\u201cThe St. George\u2019s Cross has become a symbol of nationalism, which has become confused with patriotism \u2014 the two are very different,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "All this comes as immigration is now the top issue for voters in England, having just overtaken the cost-of-living crisis throttling millions, polls show. The most popular political party is Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, who recently said he would carry out a mass deportation of 600,000 people if he wins the next election in 2029.",
      "National identity in Britain is doubly complicated because the United Kingdom includes the nations of England, Wales and Scotland, and the province of Northern Ireland. During the soccer World Cup and on some public holidays, England\u2019s banner is widely used by people of all political and demographic stripes, but outside of those events it has been co-opted by nationalists, the far right and even fascists.",
      "All the data shows that most people in Britain are becoming more tolerant and less racist, said Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, a think tank focused on identity. But the small minority who do hold extreme and racist views have been given a megaphone and a meeting place by poorly regulated social media platforms, he said.",
      "That\u2019s certainly the experience of Moj, 44, a Briton with Bangladeshi heritage, sitting with his 11-year-old daughter in Stevenage\u2019s faded postwar town square.",
      "\u201cI remember being a kid and getting called all sorts of racist names. I don\u2019t get that anymore,\u201d said Moj, who like many in this town of 80,000 declined to give his second name for fear of local backlash.",
      "Despite the improvement, the flag still holds negative connotations for him. \u201cIn certain areas, if I see an English flag, there is always a part of me that thinks, OK, I\u2019ve got to be a bit careful here,\u201d he said.",
      "Stevenage was dreamed up in 1946 as an example of \u201cnew town\u201d modernism, an integrated residential-commercial space in which to house families scattered by war. Today \u2014 despite a much needed \u00a31 billion ($1.35 billion) regeneration scheme on the way \u2014 its faded pebbledash and dated glass shopfronts feel like a cipher for modern Britain.",
      "As is the case across the West, many Britons are increasingly concerned and angry about rising prices, decrepit public services, a lack of housing \u2014 and the perception that immigration has been mismanaged.",
      "All this leaves \u201cthe U.K. sitting on a tinderbox of disconnection and division,\u201d according to a lengthy report last month by British Future. Compounded by the cost-of-living crisis and supercharged by social media, this is \u201cturning the chronic crisis of social disconnection into an acute threat of social division.\u201d",
      "Turvey hanging flags in his community then being struck by a Molotov cocktail saw those divisions flare into life. He was bandaged up, received stitches and gave a statement to the police, though he did not see his attackers and has not heard from officers since, he said.",
      "At first, he thought the blood running down his face was acid (acid attacks are on the rise in the U.K.), and he said the incident has only added to the chronic anxiety stemming from a homophobic attack in 2018.",
      "Though he decries any form of racism or negativity associated with the flag movement, he says that part of his motivation stemmed from the perception that the current Labour government \u201cis not siding with English people\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s probably why people are so upset at the moment.\u201d",
      "Indeed, polls show Labour at its lowest support since 2019, sinking to just 20% in a poll by YouGov this week. Farage\u2019s Reform party, meanwhile, has soared to 28%, according to the same top pollster, the highest of any party but not enough to govern without a coalition were a national vote held today. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has taken an increasingly hard rhetorical line on immigration.",
      "He is under pressure to deal with the \u201csmall boats\u201d crisis, in which more than 50,000 people have arrived in small, unsafe vessels across the English Channel from France since he won a landslide election last year. Meanwhile, the government won a Supreme Court battle Friday so that asylum-seekers could continue being housed at a hotel in Epping, northeast of London, a site that has sparked numerous protests and counterprotests.",
      "Rumbling underneath all of this is the so-called grooming gangs scandal: the sexual exploitation of young women and girls by men in British towns and cities. A review in June that found that although most alleged perpetrators were white, in some areas there were higher rates of men of Asian and Pakistani heritage than their equivalent share of the population. At the same time, the review warned that many of those claiming outrage were merely trying \u201cto spread division and hate across communities.\u201d",
      "And so, amid all this, up goes the English flag.",
      "\u201cThere are probably one or two locations where it\u2019s organic and it started from below,\u201d Katwala, the director of British Future, said. \u201cThen there\u2019s another group \u2014 again, it\u2019s quite a small group \u2014 which is very politically radicalized, knows what it\u2019s doing and why it\u2019s doing it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Through a monitor, two men watch a bomb tumble through the air toward a building at the edge of town. \u201cLook at how they run,\u201d one of the men says.",
      "The drone\u2019s camera follows a group of people below as they sprint down the road before the mortar explodes.",
      "These scenes of destruction, carried out and filmed by drones, have defined the war in Ukraine. But this drone is thousands of miles away in Colombia, the latest mutation in the country\u2019s deadly, long-standing conflict between the national government and militant groups.",
      "It\u2019s also an example of the growing use of drone warfare in Latin America and other parts of the globe.",
      "Seventeen videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News show that these groups, the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), are using drones for surveillance, intimidation and bombing campaigns \u2014 targeting rival groups, soldiers, police and civilians across the country, injuring and killing dozens in the past year.",
      "Militants have focused their assaults on areas where they already possess greater control: in Catatumbo, a region of dense jungle bordering Venezuela, and Cauca, on Colombia\u2019s west coast, notorious for its smuggling routes in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "It was in Cauca last year in the town of El Plateado that a 10-year-old boy was killed by a grenade dropped from a drone onto a field during a soccer game. The boy, identified as \u201cDylan\u201d by Brig. Gen. Federico Mej\u00eda, commander of the armed forces in Cauca, was the first death from a drone strike in the country. Twelve others were injured in the explosion.",
      "The rate of strikes has rapidly accelerated since. \u201cEvery day they try and attack,\u201d Mej\u00eda said.",
      "In 2024, the Colombian Defense Ministry recorded 119 drone-related attacks. In 2025, attacks have doubled, with 180 incidents documented as of August.",
      "The sound of fear",
      "The drones \u2014 cheap, easy to operate and widely available online \u2014 are altered to carry explosives filled with nails, pieces of chainsaws and metal bolts, Mej\u00eda said. Used for surveillance and strikes, they can fly more than 1,000 feet above, making them virtually imperceptible to people on the ground.",
      "\u201cThe human ear can\u2019t hear it,\u201d said Secretary Luis Fernando Ni\u00f1o Lopez, high commissioner for peace in Norte de Santander, a region that encompasses Catatumbo. Drones, he said, have allowed militant groups to go beyond traditional battlefields and reach civilians.",
      "\u201cBefore, the war was body to body,\u201d Ni\u00f1o Lopez said. \u201cHowever, this changed to personal attacks, looking from house to house and using drones.\u201d",
      "In other instances, surveillance and intimidation go hand in hand. \u201cThe word is \u2018zumbido\u2019 (\u2018buzz\u2019),\u201d said Juanita Goebertus, director of the Americas Division at Human Rights Watch. In interviews the organization conducted with Indigenous communities in Catatumbo, residents described the \u201chumming sound\u201d from drones monitoring the population.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge fear created now in Catatumbo whenever there\u2019s the sound of a drone going around,\u201d she said.",
      "\u2018We can do that\u2019",
      "The adoption of drones marks the latest evolution in a conflict that has raged for over half a century in Colombia, experts said. In 2016, the government reached a peace agreement with the country\u2019s largest rebel group, FARC. The agreement was criticized from many sides, including some FARC militants who refused to disarm and continued operating in smaller numbers.",
      "With the reduction in their ranks, militant groups \u2014 no strangers to asymmetrical warfare \u2014 changed tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s a great example of a sort of criminal learning,\u201d Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said. \u201cThey see what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, the extremely broad use of drones. They think, \u2018Hey, we can do that.\u2019 Then one group starts in Colombia, and it spreads like wildfire.\u201d",
      "Over the past few years, videos emerged on social media of militants experimenting with store-bought drones. A video from 2023 shows fighters from a FARC dissident group testing the weight of a grenade tied to the body of a drone with a piece of string.",
      "\u201cOften, these munitions are very rudimentary,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cThe majority of attacks have been aimed at police or military targets or rival armed groups, but often they are exploding, obviously, in areas that affect civilians, because they are, by definition, an indiscriminate weapon.\u201d",
      "\u2018Drone comes, drone goes\u2019",
      "Civilians, especially children, in Cauca and Catatumbo have ended up on both ends of drone attacks. Last August, authorities arrested a 16-year-old who they said had operated a drone that dropped a bomb on a police building.",
      "\u201cYou see a lot of the guys who put together these drones, who run them being 16, 17, 18 years old,\u201d Dickinson said. Child recruitment in Colombia has soared in the past several years, she said, increasing over 1,000% between 2021 and 2024.",
      "Commercial drones are relatively simple to operate, and children, already predisposed to mastering new technology, are ideal targets for recruitment. \u201cMy son is 13 and manages a drone perfectly,\u201d Mej\u00eda said.",
      "Children in Colombia are increasingly vulnerable to the lures of militant groups, who have used social media apps like TikTok and WhatsApp to promote a glamorized version of the guerrilla lifestyle, according to experts, who also point to the absence of schoolteachers, many of whom have fled the violence in the region, as a contributing factor.",
      "A cycle of attacks, forced recruitment and instability has brought about Colombia\u2019s largest displacement from one region in at least 28 years. More than 73,000 people have fled Norte de Santander, according to the Ombudsman\u2019s Office of Colombia.",
      "For half a year, Jos\u00e9 del Carmen Abril, 55, known to his friends and family as Carmito, has been running for his life. The farmer and social leader from Catatumbo told NBC News he\u2019s a target of the ELN. In January, he was rescued by military police along with 19 other farmers after the rebel group launched several attacks against rival FARC dissidents. Speaking to Colombian media weeks after he was rescued, he said he was targeted due to his past in farmworker struggles and his previous support for the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica, a party linked with FARC.",
      "Now in hiding, Abril hears updates from his siblings and nephews who remain in Catatumbo.",
      "Drones, which at one time promised to be a technological advancement for farmers in Colombia, have become a symbol of terror.",
      "\u201cCatatumbo is becoming drone comes, drone goes,\u201d Abril said. \u201cThere is a fear of drones since farmers are military targets for the ELN.\u201d",
      "Amid the exchange of attacks from the ELN and FARC dissidents in the region, drones have dropped explosives on the homes of people in the countryside. In May, a 12-year-old and his mother were killed in Tib\u00fa when a drone dropped a grenade on their house, Abril said.",
      "\u2018A major risk for the future\u2019",
      "The military and government of Colombia have recently taken measures to stem the surge of drone attacks. The Defense Ministry has proposed a series of bills that would create a national registry for drones and classify strikes on civilians as terrorism.",
      "Soldiers have also started using anti-drone technology, devices that can locate unmanned aircraft and jam their signals. Since implementing these defenses, Mej\u00eda said, his forces have reduced the number of these attacks by 80% in Cauca.",
      "Devices for countering drones are by no means ubiquitous. Soldiers and police often try to shoot drones out of the sky, a relatively ineffective measure that creates its own public safety risks when they are shot down above crowded areas.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very hard to shoot down,\u201d said Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIf you\u2019re a civilian living in rural Colombia, and there is a drone that can drop bombs from hundreds of feet above you or can fly in and detonate the explosive, you really have virtually no recourse.\u201d",
      "The country is facing another challenge to its ability to fight the rapidly evolving strategies and equipment of militant forces. At risk are hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid tied up in a certification process of the country\u2019s commitment to the war on drugs.",
      "Colombia has narrowly avoided decertification in past years, but it has failed to cut the illegal growth of coca crops, which has risen each year in the past decade, according to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.",
      "By Sept. 15, President Donald Trump will decide whether to cut off aid to Colombia. Cutting off the supply of resources and technologies to the country could cripple its efforts to fight militants in the future, said Alberto Jos\u00e9 Mej\u00eda Ferrero, a former general for Colombia\u2019s armed forces. He added that it would be \u201cvery bad for our strategy, for approach, and especially for the very, very strong relationship that the military forces of Colombia and our national police had with the U.S. for decades.\u201d",
      "The adoption of drone warfare by militant groups in Latin America is not unique to Colombia. Already, Mexican cartels have used drones to attack police and one another. In Ecuador, a drone targeted the roof of a high-security prison to force a jailbreak.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s a major risk for the future,\u201d Ziemer said. \u201cI think the region as a whole has yet to come to terms with the scale and potential scale of the threat we\u2019re seeing.\u201d"

      "The findings come as Reuters \u2014 whose cameraman Hussam al-Masri was among five journalists killed Monday in the Israeli strikes \u2014 said the Israeli military was \u201cfully aware\u201d that its team and other journalists were operating from the hospital in southern Gaza.",
      "The agency told NBC News on Wednesday that it had offered daily live feeds to its news clients from that location in recent weeks, but earlier in the war had stopped sharing its teams' exact locations \u201cafter so many journalists were killed in IDF strikes.\u201d",
      "What initially appeared to be a \u201cdouble tap\u201d strike \u2014 a tactic in which a target is hit, then struck again often after first responders have rushed in \u2014 was in fact more extensive.",
      "Al-Masri\u2019s live feed freezes at 10:08 a.m. local time but there\u2019s no video of the first strikes. Video of the aftermath of these hits shows smoke billowing from two separate staircases: the one where journalists were working and a second, around the corner next to the intensive care unit.",

      "Video obtained and verified by NBC News shows two additional projectiles striking the fourth-floor staircase within milliseconds of each other. Plumes of smoke can be seen rising from all affected areas.",
      "N.R. Jenzen-Jones, director of the arms intelligence firm Armament Research Services, said video of the incident after the first strike pointed to a direct-fire weapon, with damage \u201cconsistent with that expected from a multi-purpose tank gun projectile.\u201d",
      "Video of the second strike also appeared to show two projectiles, he said. Their flight pattern and \u201cbright emission\u2026 more likely to be from a tracer\u201d suggested they came from tank rounds, Jenzen-Jones said. The timing, he added, implies \u201ctwo tanks may have fired on the target simultaneously.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not respond to a request for comment on the newest revelations. The IDF has not provided NBC News with any additional information since it released preliminary findings on Tuesday.",
      "In its initial inquiry, the IDF said troops had identified a camera at the hospital \u201cpositioned by Hamas\u201d that was being used to observe its activity. It added that \u201ctroops operated to remove the threat by striking and dismantling the camera.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will make a rare international visit next week to attend a military parade in the Chinese capital, both countries said Thursday.",
      "The parade in Beijing on Sept. 3 is being held to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.",
      "According to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, heads of state and government from 26 countries will be at the parade, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. North Korean state media also confirmed that Kim was attending the parade at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "The United States and its allies are staying away from the event, partly out of protest over the presence of Putin, who faces an outstanding arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court over alleged war crimes in his war against Ukraine.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry said that China and North Korea were \u201ctraditional friendly neighbors\u201d and that the government \u201cwarmly\u201d welcomed Kim to attend the parade, where China will display some of its most advanced weaponry.",
      "\u201cDuring the arduous years of war, the peoples of China and North Korea supported each other and fought side by side against Japanese aggression, making important contributions to the victory of the global anti-fascist war and the cause of human justice,\u201d Hong Lei, director-general of the ministry\u2019s Department of Protocol, told reporters.",

      "Kim rarely leaves North Korea, which has been isolated by international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "North Korean state news agency KCNA did not say when he would leave for China, how long he would be there or whether he would have official meetings with Xi, Putin or any other leaders. Kim has not visited China, North Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner, since before the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Though China has supported international sanctions against North Korea\u2019s weapons programs, it is also an economic lifeline for Pyongyang, accounting for about 98% of its external trade last year.",
      "China-North Korea ties have been strained in recent years by North Korea\u2019s growing partnership with Russia, where North Korea has sent artillery and troops to support Moscow in its war against Ukraine. Experts say that in exchange Russia may be providing advanced military technology that North Korea could use for its weapons programs.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea is seeking to strengthen ties with China following its moves with Russia, thereby showcasing socialist solidarity among North Korea, China and Russia,\u201d Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, South Korea, told NBC News.",

    "summary": "International news agency Reuters says that it stopped sharing the locations of its teams in the Gaza Strip with the Israeli military after \u201cso many journalists were killed in IDF strikes.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli forces have killed so many journalists that Reuters has stopped sharing the locations of its teams in the Gaza Strip with the country's military, the international news agency told NBC News.",
      "A Reuters cameraman who regularly operated its live position on the roof of Nasser Hospital was one of five journalists among 22 people killed in an Israeli attack on the facility Monday.",
      "\u201cIn the early days of the conflict, Reuters, like other news outlets, shared the locations our teams would be using in an effort to ensure they would not be targeted by the [Israel Defense Forces],\u201c a spokesperson for the London-based news organization, one of the world\u2019s largest, told NBC News late Wednesday.",
      "That included sharing on \u201cmultiple occasions\u201d that its journalists were operating out of Nasser Hospital, where the strikes were caught on video by the Arabic-language channel Al Ghad TV.",
      "\u201cWe subsequently desisted from giving precise coordinates of our teams after so many journalists were killed in IDF strikes,\u201d added Reuters, which said it ran a live feed from the site for the last 18 months.",
      "In response to a request for comment on the Reuters statement, the IDF said it had \u201cno further comment beyond the statement that has been put out.\u201d Soon after the incident, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it had been a \u201ctragic mishap.\u201d",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the IDF claimed that an initial inquiry found that troops had identified a camera at the hospital that was being used to observe its troops \u201cin order to direct terrorist activities against them.\u201d It added that \u201ctroops operated to remove the threat by striking and dismantling the camera.\u201d",
      "According to five journalists on the ground, there was only one camera \u2014 Reuters\u2019 \u2014 at the top of the hospital. A senior Hamas official has claimed it did not have a camera in the area.",
      "The Israeli military, which did not provide evidence to substantiate the claims that Hamas ran a camera on the roof of the hospital or address the multiple strikes on the facility, added that an investigation had been ordered into \u201cseveral gaps\u201d including the \u201cauthorization process\u201d before the attack.",
      "According to the internationally recognized Committee to Protect Journalists, 197 journalists have been killed in Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza since it began less than two years ago, making it the deadliest conflict for journalists the CPJ has documented.",
      "More details emerged Thursday about Israel's deadly attack on Nasser Hospital.",
      "Initially, Monday\u2019s pair of deadly Israeli strikes appeared to be a \u201cdouble tap\u201d attack, in which the same target was hit twice in quick succession. The tactic, military analysts say, is to wait for first responders to race to the scene of the first attack before striking again.",
      "But an NBC News analysis of newly obtained video has found that at least four Israeli munitions were fired at the medical complex.",
      "Following the first Israeli strike on the facility, the video shows two projectiles flying through the air, striking the fourth-floor staircase in quick succession at 10:17 a.m. local time Monday.",
      "Weapons munitions expert and war crimes investigator Chris Cobb Smith, who has analyzed the video, said the projectiles clearly visible are missiles.",
      "The IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the newest revelations.",
      "Israel has barred the international media from entering Gaza since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, except for occasional tours chaperoned by the IDF.",
      "On Wednesday, Dr. Mohammed Saqer, director of nursing at Nasser Hospital, said that the IDF should have been aware that the area it was targeting at the hospital was a hub for Palestinian journalists inside the enclave.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a secret place. It\u2019s like a clear place, obvious place. Everyone can see this place. Even the Israeli army, by their own drones or by their own cameras, they can see Hussam and other journalists working from the fourth floor. So it\u2019s not a secret,\u201d he said, referring to Hussam al-Masri, the Reuters cameraman killed in the attack.",
      "He added, \u201cThe IDF knows our numbers. Yes, sometimes they call us. So if the IDF has any objection about the presence of Hussam and other journalists on the third floor, on the fourth floor, I think they could have contacted us and we could have fixed the issue."
