      "Women folk singers are preserving one of Morocco's most cherished culturual traditions, a genre of folk singing known as aita",
      "SIDI YAHYA ZAER, Morocco -- Mbarka Moullablad\u2019s family frowned when she first told them she planned to make a living as a cheikha, singing about love, pain, and societal change to the melodies of her ancestors under the stage name \u201cThouria.\u201d",
      "Women like her are the stewards of one of Morocco\u2019s most cherished oral traditions: a form of folk singing known as aita, which means a \u201ccry\u201d or \u201clament\u201d in Arabic. From smoky bars and cabarets in Morocco\u2019s largest cities to the gatherings in the country\u2019s rural regions, they croon at weddings, festivals and private events and pub nights, hypnotizing audiences both humble and wealthy.",
      "But despite aita's position in Moroccan culture, the genre\u2019s popularity does not always translate into acceptance for those who perform it. Cheikha are often stigmatized, eroticized, and pushed to society\u2019s margins. That was once a fear for Moullablad, but she says her community in Sidi Yahya Zaer, a farming town on Morocco\u2019s Atlantic plains, has mostly accepted her.",
      "\u201cMy family did not agree at first and I used to suffer from society\u2019s judgment, but now everything is good,\u201d Moullablad said on the sidelines of a recent performance south of Morocco\u2019s capital, Rabat. \u201cI do it in order to earn money for my children.\u201d",
      "A form of sung poetry, aita has long explored themes of societal triumphs, ironies, and unspoken struggles, including those related to relationships and economic hardship. Cheikha don heavy stage makeup, silk caftans, and golden takchita belts as they sing about their community's agonies and triumphs. They sway their hips to amplify emotion, dancing seductively or cheerfully depending on the context.",
      "When Moullablad performs, men and women lean in as her voice softens, captivated as she climbs octaves into a full-throated howl. The beads wrapped around her sister Fatiha\u2019s belly shake as she dances. The band leader, another singer, backs her with his own poetry while a drummer keeps the beat, a guitarist strums, and a violinist drags his bow in sync.",
      "Those who come to hear them sing say cheikha can serve as a community's truth-tellers, singing about often unspoken dynamics related to marriage, agriculture or, historically, colonial resistance. Moullablad sings in Moroccan Arabic, embodying traditions specific to her community. But cheikha across the North African Kingdom also perform in the indigenous Amazigh language, adapting the music and lyrics to reflect their region.",
      "The art form has inspired contemporary acts like the electro-infused \u201cAita, Mon Amour\u201d and Kabareh Cheikhats, a troupe of male actors who pay homage, dress and sing in the tune of Morocco's most celebrated 20th century women folk singers. It is also the subject of Morocco\u2019s submission for this year\u2019s Academy Awards, \u201cEverybody Loves Touda,\u201d which follows a single mother who leaves her town in the Atlas Mountains to pursue her dream of singing in bars, cabarets, and hotels in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cI was always amazed by their strength and the power that they have toward people when they open their mouths. Whether they are modern or conservative people, they all stand up and get into a kind of trance like gospel,\u201d Nabil Ayouch, the film\u2019s director, said in an interview when the film premiered at the Marrakech Film Festival last year.",
      "Morocco\u2019s music scene is increasingly embracing Middle Eastern pop and rap by North African artists from throughout the diaspora. And rural communities are shrinking amid the country's rapid development and urbanization. But though the future of aita may seem uncertain, its musicians and listeners remain confident that it will endure.",
      "\u201cAita will not die because it is renewed by young people. Aita will remain in all times and is loved by old people and young people as well. It is developed and improved, but they preserve its origins,\u201d said Rachid Kadari, a Cheikh who also sings aita."

      "Beyonc\u00e9 winning the trophy for album of the year was the highlight of the Grammy Awards on Sunday, but there were plenty of other key moments",
      "All eyes at the Grammy Awards were on whether the most-nominated artist in the history of the telecast would finally walk away with the coveted album of the year trophy. She did. \u201cWe finally saw it happen,\u201d host Trevor Noah said, almost in relief.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 winning for \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d capped a night that turned into a tribute to a suffering Los Angeles, with city firefighters chosen to reveal the winner of the last award and speeches offering words of encouragement for communities devastated. The Grammys almost veered into a telethon; $7 million was pledged from viewers of the show.",
      "It was also a telecast where the best new artist nominees like Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter were given plenty of time to show why there's a deep well of talent coming up. And there was a shock return for The Weeknd, who had been boycotting the Grammys.",
      "Here are some of the night\u2019s notable moments:",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga were right there, as were Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, but the honor of opening the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles was given to two local brothers deeply affected by the wildfires: Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of the band Dawes.",
      "They lost one brother\u2019s home along with their childhood home, instruments and much else. They've advocated for victims, raised money and were included in the FireAid benefit concert on Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey truly epitomize the unique spirit that we are seeing in LA right now,\u201d host Trevor Noah said. \u201cWhat better way to start the Grammy Awards?\u201d",
      "Dawes then played Randy Newman's \u201cI Love L.A.\u201d surrounded by an all-star backing band: John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent.",
      "\u201cLook at these firefighters, ain\u2019t nothin like \u2018em nowhere,\u201d Taylor Goldsmith sang, altering the line: \u201cLook at these women/There ain\u2019t nothing like \u2019em nowhere.\u201d",
      "Doechii won the Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category. And, with her mother by her side, she had a strong message for young Black girls.",
      "\u201cI know that there's some Black girl out there, so many Black women out there, that are watching me right now, and I want to tell you: You can do it. Anything is possible. Anything is possible,\u201d she said.",
      "\"Don\u2019t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you, to tell you that you can\u2019t be here, that you\u2019re too dark, or that you\u2019re not smart enough, or that you\u2019re too dramatic, or you\u2019re too loud. You are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are, and I am a testimony right now. Good night!\u201d",
      "The win caps an astounding few years for the 26-year-old Floridian who mixes R&B, hip-hop, jazz, boundary-pushing sounds and samples, and adds theatricality. She playfully calls herself the \u201cswamp princess.\u201d",
      "Her 2024 mixtape, \u201dAlligator Bites Never Heal\u2033 went to No. 33 on the Billboard 200, No. 9 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart and No. 8 on the Top Rap Album chart.",
      "Her Grammy performance of \u201cCatfish\u201d and \u201cDenial Is a River\u201d was electric, with the singer-songwriter backed by over a dozen dancers in matching Thom Browne suits and she eventually stripped down to a white two-piece set.",
      "Chappell Roan was crowned best new artist and then used her speech to demand change in the music business.",
      "\u201cI told myself that if I ever won a Grammy and got to stand up here before the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage and health care, especially to developing artists,\u201d she said.",
      "Roan began her music career in 2015 when she signed with Atlantic Records, releasing several singles including \u201cPink Pony Club.\u201d In 2020, the label dropped her. She moved back to her hometown to work as a barista before releasing her debut full-length album.",
      "\u201cIt was devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and dehumanized,\u201d Roan said in her speech. \u201cRecord labels need to treat their artists as valuable employees with a livable wage and health insurance and protection.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Roan performed a rocking version of her \u201cPink Pony Club,\u201d joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys as she sang from atop a giant pink horse.",
      "Lady Gaga, accepting the trophy for best pop duo or group alongside Bruno Mars for their chart-topping collab, \u201cDie with a Smile,\u201d gave a shout-out to the trans community, targets of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love,\" Lady Gaga said.",
      "Not long after, Alicia Keys, being honored with The Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, also backed diversity and inclusion programs, another Trump target.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices,\u201d said Keys. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen on this stage talented, hardworking people from different backgrounds with different points of view, and it changes the game. DEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift.\u201d",
      "The Grammy Awards had a powerful way to prove that they've changed. They got a surprise endorsement by The Weeknd, who was last on the Grammy stage in 2017.",
      "The pop superstar in 2020 slammed the Grammys, calling them \u201ccorrupt\u201d after he landed zero nominations despite a megahit album. \u201cYou owe me, my fans and the industry transparency,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Grammys CEO Harvey Mason jr., who started in his post in 2020, on Sunday said he understood the criticism and listed all the things the Academy has done to fix it.",
      "\u201cWe have completely re-made our membership, adding more than 3,000 women voting members. The Grammy electorate is now younger, nearly 40% people of color, and 66% of our members are new since we started our transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the past few years, we have listened, we\u2019ve acted and we\u2019ve changed.\u201d",
      "Mason then introduced The Weeknd, who performed two tunes from his just-released album \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d \u2014 \u201cCry For Me\u201d and \u201cTimeless\u201d with special guest Playboi Carti. He wore a long druid's robe and the stage was smoky.",
      "Will Smith, hosting a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, marked his first appearance at a major awards show since since he slapped Chris Rock onstage at the Oscars in 2022.",
      "\u201cIn his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but I have to say, he changed mine forever. You probably wouldn\u2019t even know who Will Smith was if it wasn\u2019t for Quincy Jones,\" Smith said.",
      "Smith has been banned from film academy ceremonies for 10 years but the Grammys are a different beast. He made no mention of the infamous Slap.",
      "Smith has previously nabbed Grammy wins in the short form music video (\u201cWill 2K\u201d), best rap solo performance (\u201cGetting\u2019 Jiggy Wit It,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d), and best rap performance by a duo or group (\u201cSummertime\u201d as the Fresh Prince with DJ Jazzy Jeff).",

      "A woman from New Zealand says in lawsuits that British author Neil Gaiman sexually assaulted her repeatedly when she worked as a babysitter and nanny for him and his wife",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A woman from New Zealand has filed three civil lawsuits against best-selling British author Neil Gaiman and his wife, accusing Gaiman of repeatedly sexually assaulting her while she was working as the couple's babysitter and nanny.",
      "Scarlett Pavlovich filed the lawsuits in federal court in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New York on Monday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. Pavlovich identified herself in an interview with New York Magazine, which published an article in January detailing allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women.",
      "Pavlovich alleges in the lawsuits that she was homeless and living on a beach when she met Palmer in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2020. Pavlovich was 22 years old at the time.",
      "According to the lawsuits, Gaiman's wife, Amanda Palmer, invited Pavlovich to the couple's home on Waiheke Island. Pavlovich began running errands for the couple, babysitting their son and helping with chores, eventually becoming the couple's nanny.",
      "Gaiman first sexually assaulted her the night they met in February 2022, according to the lawsuits. The assaults continued but she kept working for the couple because she was broke and homeless and Gaiman had told her he would help her writing career, according to the lawsuits.",
      "When she told Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that more than a dozen women had told her in the past that Gaiman had sexually abused them, according to the lawsuits.",
      "The assaults didn't stop until Pavlovich told Palmer she was going to kill herself, the lawsuits said. She left the family and became homeless again, although the documents say Gaiman eventually paid her for her work caring for the couple's child and helped cover her rent for a few months.",
      "Palmer knew of Gaiman's sexual desires and presented Pavalovich to him knowing he would assault her, according the lawsuits. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman and Palmer violated federal human trafficking prohibitions and seeks at least $7 million in damages.",
      "After the New York Magazine article was published, Gaiman released a statement in January denying he had ever engaged in non-consensual sex. The allegations of four of the women were previously broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever,\u201d Gaiman posted on the social media platform Tumblr.",
      "Representatives for Gaiman and Palmer did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday and online court records did not list attorneys representing them in the suits. Pavlovich\u2019s attorneys stated in the filings that Gaiman, author of such bestsellers as \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Sandman\u201d series, is a resident of Menomonie, Wisconsin. But they\u2019re unsure if Palmer resides in Massachusetts or New York.",
      "Pavlovich told New York Magazine that she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault. Police have not confirmed whether Gaiman was ever under investigation.",
      "Gaiman has worked with numerous publishers over the years. Two of them, HarperCollins and W.W. Norton, have said they have no plans to release his books in the future. Others, including Bloomsbury, have so far declined comment.",
      "Dark Horse Comics announced in January that it would no longer release its illustrated series based on Gaiman's novel, \u201cAnansi Boys.\u201d The seventh of eight editions was released earlier that month.",
      "Disney has paused a planned adaptation of Gaiman\u2019s \u201cThe Graveyard Book,\u201d while Netflix is still scheduled to release a second season based on \u201cThe Sandman.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A former friend who alleges rapper A$AP Rocky fired a gun at him in 2021 testified that no one involved in the incident gave him any indication the firearm might be fake until the day the trial started two weeks ago",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A former friend who alleges rapper A$AP Rocky fired a gun at him in 2021 testified Monday that no one involved in the incident gave him any indication the firearm might have been fake \u2014 as the defense contends \u2014 until the day this trial started.",
      "The testimony from the trial\u2019s key witness, who goes by A$AP Relli, came at the end of a long, frustrating slog on the stand in a Los Angeles courtroom that drove him to shout, \u201cYou're annoying, bro!\u201d and much more at the lead defense attorney.",
      "In its re-direct questioning on Monday, the prosecution pushed back against the idea that for security Rocky carried a starter pistol that only shot blanks.",
      "Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec showed Relli texts from after the incident in which he told Rocky \u201cU try killing me\u201d and that Rocky had tried to take him from his daughter.",
      "\u201cAt any point did he respond to your text messages to tell you it was a fake gun?\u201d The prosecutor asked Relli, who testified his knuckles were grazed in the incident.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d he responded. He said the same of the two mutual friends who had been there.",
      "The testimony was the first time the jury heard how late the prop gun defense was revealed, despite more than three years passing and several days of testimony at a preliminary hearing in 2023.",
      "Rihanna, the superstar singer who is Rocky\u2019s longtime partner and the mother of his two toddler sons, was not in the courtroom after being in the audience to support him for the trial\u2019s previous three days.",
      "Rocky has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, charges that with a conviction carry a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison.",
      "A day earlier, the hip-hop star was up a Grammy Award for the third time at a ceremony just two miles away, but lost to one of the night\u2019s big winners, Kendrick Lamar.",
      "Relli who first took the stand on Wednesday, had been often evasive and just as often angry under cross-examination from Rocky's lawyer.",
      "That came to a head Monday as the defense got a chance to ask its last set of questions before he was excused.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on trial. I\u2019ve been here for five days, dealing with this man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking stupid for five days.\u201d",
      "He ignored the judge\u2019s warnings not to make such statements.",
      "\u201cYou think you\u2019re slick!\u201d he shouted at Tacopina moments later. \u201cAnd I\u2019m on to you! You\u2019re not going to keep tripping me up! You\u2019re not slick!\u201d",
      "Last week, Relli had angrily declared that recordings of phone calls the defense played for him about getting money from Rocky were faked. Defense lawyers contend the only reason Relli went to police about the incident was so he could extract money from Rocky in the civil case he has also filed.",
      "On Monday, the man who recorded those calls, Wally Sajimi, took the stand as an out-of-order witness for the defense, and the jurors heard the recordings themselves.",
      "In one of them, a voice resembling Relli's says he'll stop participating in the criminal case as soon as he gets paid.",
      "\u201cOnce I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" says the recording that Sajimi testified he made in 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard for the DA to find me. Because I\u2019m going to be on another island.\u201d",
      "Sajimi testified that he builds websites for artists and brands, and has worked with both Rocky and Relli, but said he is much closer to Rocky, who he considers a friend."

    "summary": "A Paris court has found a filmmaker guilty of sexual assault on French actor Ad&egrave;le Haenel when she was between 12 and 15 in the early 2000s, in the country&rsquo;s first big #MeToo trial",
    "story": [
      "A Paris court has found a filmmaker guilty of sexual assault on French actor Ad\u00e8le Haenel when she was between 12 and 15 in the early 2000s, in the country\u2019s first big #MeToo trial",
      "PARIS -- A Paris court found a filmmaker guilty of sexual assault on French actor Ad\u00e8le Haenel when she was between 12 and 15 in the early 2000s, in the country\u2019s first big #MeToo trial.",
      "Filmmaker Christophe Ruggia was sentenced Monday to two years under house arrest with an electronic bracelet plus a two-year suspended sentence. Ruggia had denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Haenel, now 35, was the first top actor in France to accuse the film industry of turning a blind eye to sexual abuse after the #MeToo movement broke out. In 2019, she accused Ruggia of having repeatedly touched her inappropriately during and after filming of the movie \u201cLes Diables,\u201d or \u201cThe Devils,\u201d in the early 2000s.",
      "Haenel appeared relieved, breathing deeply, as Monday's verdict was being released. She was applauded by some women\u2019s rights activists as she left the courtroom.",
      "The court ruled that Ruggia \u201ctook advantage of the dominant position\u201d he had on Haenel at the time. \u201cDuring quasi-weekly meetings at your home for over three years you had sexualized gestures and attitudes,\u201d as Haenel was \u201cgradually isolated\u201d from her loved ones, the court said in a statement.",
      "Ruggia's lawyer said her client would appeal.",
      "He \u201cmaintains that he has never touched Ad\u00e8le Haenel,\u201d the lawyer, Fanny Colin, said. \u201cSentenced in these conditions and on the sole basis of her words seems to us not only unjustified but dangerous.\u201d",
      "Haenel, star of the 2019 Cannes entry \u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire,\u201d has in recent years vocally protested what she\u2019s called an insufficient response to sexual abuse in French filmmaking.",
      "At the C\u00e9sar Awards in 2020, she walked out of the ceremony after Roman Polanski won best director. Polanski is still wanted in the United States decades after he was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.",
      "In 2023, Haenel, announced she was quitting the French film industry that she denounced for \u201ccomplacency toward sexual aggressors.\u201d She published an open letter in which she said Cannes and other pillars of the French film industry are \u201cready to do anything to defend their rapist chiefs.\u201d",
      "While #MeToo initially struggled to find traction in France, some other actors and film industry workers have since spoken out.",
      "French renowned actor Judith Godr\u00e8che attended Monday\u2019s verdict at the Paris courthouse. \u201cIt was a very moving and a very important moment that reminded me of things that, in my case, may go unpunished,\u201d she told reporters with tears in her eyes.",
      "Last year, Godr\u00e8che accused film director Beno\u00eet Jacquot of having raped and physically abused her in a six-year relationship that began when she was 14 years old. Jacquot, who has more than 50 director credits in film and television, was handed preliminary charges of rape, sexual assault and violence in July 2024.",
      "Godr\u00e8che is also accusing another film director, Jacques Doillon, of sexual abuse while he was directing a film when she was 15.",
      "Both Jacquot and Doillon have denied the allegations.",
      "In a separate case, French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu is to go on trial in March on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a film set.",
      "Depardieu, who has denied any wrongdoing, is accused of using \u201cviolence, coercion, surprise or threat\u201d in the alleged sexual assaults that prosecutors say took place in 2021 on the set of \u201cLes Volets verts,\u201d or \"The Green Shutters.\u201d"

      "Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck\u2019s weather verdict as the sun rises",
      "Punxsutawney Phil's team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck's weather verdict as the sun rises on Sunday, telling the world whether he is predicting wintry conditions for the next six weeks or the relief of an early spring.",
      "The annual ritual goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 movie to transform it into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.",
      "Last year's crowd may have been a record and organizers are bracing for a similar turnout on Sunday.",
      "If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club members declare Phil did not see his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. If he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter, although what that means can be subjective.",
      "Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time.",
      "Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.",
      "Phil communicates his forecast through \u201cGroundhog-ese\u201d with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll like wink, he\u2019ll purr, he\u2019ll chatter, he\u2019ll \u2014 you know \u2014 nod,\u201d Dunkel said.",
      "Attendance is free but it costs $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction is made, some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.",
      "A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also is putting up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.",
      "\"It\u2019s a holiday where you don\u2019t really owe anyone anything,\u201d said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler. \u201cYou\u2019re grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that\u2019s just fun to believe in.\u201d",
      "Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family won't join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and see a veterinarian at least once a year.",
      "The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an \u201celixir of life\u201d that keeps him immortal.",
      "\u201cThere's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,\u201d Dunkel said. \u201cJust like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.\u201d",
      "Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, are being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces."

    "story": [
      "Film wasn\u2019t the only thing on people\u2019s minds at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, which comes to a close Sunday in Park City, Utah",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Film wasn\u2019t the only thing on people\u2019s minds at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, which comes to a close Sunday in Park City, Utah ( and online ).",
      "The effects of the wildfires in Southern California loomed large, as did the bittersweet knowledge that this year will be the second to last Sundance based in Park City. Some films offered an escape from reality; others were a pointed reminder of the domestic and international political landscape, from transgender rights to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Here are some of the key takeaways from the 41st edition of the festival.",
      "The wildfires were still burning in parts of Los Angeles when Sundance began last week and reminders of its devastation were everywhere, even on screen. Max Walker-Silverman\u2019s \u201cRebuilding,\u201d starring Josh O\u2019Connor as a cowboy who loses his ranch in a wildfire and forms a community with fellow survivors in a FEMA camp, hit close to home for many.",
      "Filmmakers Meena Menon and Paul Gleason lost their home in Altadena where they filmed some of their zombie apocalypse movie \u201cDidn\u2019t Die.\u201d Sundance artist labs head Michelle Satter lost her Palisades home as well. Satter had an audience of Sundance Institute donors in tears early in the festival while accepting an honor at a fundraising gala.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a deeply devastating time for us and so many others, a moment that calls for all of us coming together to support our bigger community,\u201d Satter said. \u201cAs a friend recently noted, and I have to listen to this, \u2018Take a deep breath ... We lost our village, but at the end of the day we are the village.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was a topic bound to come up in nearly every conversation: The festival\u2019s new home in 2027. \u201cWhere do you think it will go? How do you feel about it leaving Park City? What would Sundance in Ohio even look like?\u201d No one had any answers, but everyone had an opinion about the fact that next year will be the last year in which the center of activity is in Park City. Sundance Institute leadership has narrowed the finalist cities to Salt Lake City, Utah, Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio, and is expected to announce the winner before spring.",
      "Actor Tessa Thompson, who serves on the institute\u2019s board, was hopeful about a new city.",
      "\u201cI think that Sundance has more to do with the spirit and community, and I think that\u2019s evergreen,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cRegardless of where Sundance is, Sundance will always be.\u201d",
      "In the early days of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second administration, politics were also a main topic of private discussions at least. Several films (mostly documentaries) had direct relevance to recent news, like \u201cHeightened Scrutiny,\u201d about transgender lawyer Chase Strangio and the media coverage of transgender issues amid a pending Supreme Court case.",
      "Even \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d filmmaker Bill Condon quoted Trump\u2019s \u201ctwo genders\u201d mandate before his film screened.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a sentiment I think you\u2019ll see that the movie has a different point of view on,\u201d Condon said.",
      "There also wasn\u2019t the spirit of public protest that was unavoidable eight years ago when Trump first took office, when A-listers took to the streets to march for women's rights. But audiences at Q&As for films like \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d about the abusive Alabama prison systems which the AP has reported extensively on, were curious how they could help change things.",
      "There have been essentially two major deals out of the festival so far: Netflix took \u201cTrain Dreams,\u201d Clint Bentley\u2019s lyrical Denis Johnson adaptation, with Joel Edgerton and Felicity Jones, and Neon acquired the Dave Franco and Alison Brie relationship body horror \u201cTogether.\u201d",
      "As always, some films came in with distribution in place: Focus Features with \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island\u201d; A24 with \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You,\u201d \u201cOpus,\u201d and \u201cThe Legend of Ochi\u201d; Bleecker Street with \u201cThe Wedding Banquet\u201d; Nat Geo with the Sally Ride documentary \u201cSally\u201d; MUBI with \u201cMagic Farm\u201d; and Apple with \u201cDeaf President Now!\u201d; HBO Documentary Films with \u201cThe Alabama Solution\u201d and \u201cEnigma.\u201d",
      "Most deals happen after the festival ends, but there have been private grumblings that the market this year was weaker than usual, and the films were not commercial enough. Several insiders singled out Condon\u2019s adaptation of \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d with Jennifer Lopez as being too expensive for anyone but a streaming service. But there are also plenty of deals in the works, some of which will be finalized soon, while others may be settled at the Berlin Film Festival market.",
      "As festival programmers like to say, Sundance isn\u2019t the end of the story for new films \u2014 it\u2019s just the beginning. Last year\u2019s program had over 100 films distributed to audiences through traditional means, and only a small fraction of those were announced during the festival.",
      "Perhaps the biggest discovery of the festival is \u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d from writer-director-star Eva Victor in her feature debut. This funny and quietly piercing film is about Agnes, who was sexually assaulted by her thesis advisor. Instead of making it about depicting the incident itself (Victor keeps the camera firmly planted outside of the home where it occurs, showing the passage of time through light), Victor, who could be the next Greta Gerwig and/or Phoebe Waller-Bridge, stays focused on how it affects Anges.",
      "Filmmaker James Sweeney also scored a big win with \u201cTwinless,\u201d which picked up the U.S. dramatic audience prize and a special award for his star Dylan O\u2019Brien. The movie is about a bromance between two men in a twin bereavement group.",
      "On the documentary side there was much chatter about \u201cAndr\u00e9 Is an Idiot,\u201d a documentary about a \u201cbrilliant idiot\u201d who is dying because he didn\u2019t get a colonoscopy and trying to live out his final days happily.",
      "The in-person experience at Sundance is also a good reminder that reviews are only part of the equation when it comes to judging the response to a film. Hailey Gates\u2019 war satire \u201cAtropia\u201d got mixed reviews from critics, but premiere audiences were very enthusiastic (as was the U.S. dramatic jury who gave it the festival\u2019s top prize ).",
      "As of publication, all are still seeking distribution.",
      "Others that played notably well with audiences and critics include: \u201cIf I Had Legs I'd Kick You,\u201d \u201cDJ Ahmet,\u201d \u201cCactus Pears,\u201d \"2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d \u201cPlainclothes,\u201d \u201cRicky,\u201d \u201cPrime Minister,\u201d \u201cSelena y Los Dinos,\u201d \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d\u201cSLY LIVES!,\u201d \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d \u201cPredators,\u201d \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d \u201cFolktales,\u201d \u201cFree Leonard Peltier,\u201d \u201cPeter Hujar\u2019s Day,\u201d \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island\u201d and \u201cTrain Dreams.\u201d",

      "The Grateful Dead kicked off Grammy weekend being honored as MusiCares Persons of the Year",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Colorful dancing bears during cocktails. Tie-dye clothing mixed with black-tie. Oh yeah, the Grateful Dead was in the house to kick off Grammy weekend.",
      "The legendary jam band was honored for its musical achievements and philanthropic efforts as MusiCares Persons of the Year on Friday night, two days before the Grammy Awards.",
      "The band's iconic skull logo was prominent in the ever-changing graphics on stage. Their well-known dancing bears posed for photos with attendees.",
      "Devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen hosted the 2 1/2-hour show at the Los Angeles Convention Center. He recounted convincing his parents to let him drive from St. Louis to Wisconsin to catch his first Dead concert as a teenager.",
      "\u201cI venture to say they are the great American band,\" Cohen said. \"What a wonder they are.\u201d",
      "So what if the Dead owns just two Grammys, for lifetime achievement in 2007 and best music film in 2018. They made their mark with a unique style and long improvisations blending such genres as rock, blues, jazz, folk and psychedelia.",
      "\u201cLongevity was never a major concern of ours,\u201d 77-year-old guitarist Bob Weir said, drawing laughs. \u201cSpreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\u201d",
      "Drummer Mickey Hart paid homage to the band's free-spirited fans.",
      "\u201cThe Deadheads have kept the dream alive for 60 years now and continue to take this music into the next century,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore the world even knew what to make of us, our community lifted us up and kept us going. Without support there would be no Grateful Dead.\u201d",
      "Actor Woody Harrelson told a few long-winded tales about his adventures with the band, including \u201cgoing drugless to Thailand with Bobby, which is not easy for either of us.\u201d",
      "Weir and Hart were joined onstage to accept the award by three of their bandmates\u2019 offspring: Grahame Lesh, Trixie Garcia and Justin Kreutzmann.",
      "Lesh\u2019s father, Phil, died in October at age 84. Garcia\u2019s father, Jerry, died in 1995 at age 53. Kreutzmann\u2019s father, Bill, didn\u2019t attend and instead gave his thanks in a video message.",
      "\u201cI can feel his spirit in the house,\u201d the 81-year-old Hart said of Bill Kreutzmann. \u201cHe\u2019s in the music, he\u2019s in the rhythm, the heartbeat of everything we built together all these years.\u201d",
      "Grahame Lesh was busy all night playing guitar as part of the backing band led by musical director Don Was. He sang with The War on Drugs during \u201cBox of Rain,\u201d composed by his father.",
      "Weir opened the show on guitar backed by an orchestra. They soon gave way to The War and Treaty performing \u201cSamson and Delilah\u201d with Stewart Copeland and Mick Fleetwood taking turns on drum solos.",
      "Technical difficulties briefly affected performances by My Morning Jacket and John Mayer, who rebounded for an extended jam with Was and Jeff Chimenti on \u201cTerrapin Station.\u201d Hart kept looking offstage as he drummed during Dead & Company's finale of \u201cSugar Magnolia\u201d and \u201cTouch of Grey\u201d until a technician appeared to bring him in-ear monitors.",
      "Eaerlier, Hart was on his feet pumping his right arm to Sammy Hagar's version of \u201cLoose Lucy.\u201d",
      "\u201cBobby, Mick, love you brothers,\u201d Hagar said.",
      "Two of the quieter moments were in-the-round performances by Norah Jones on \u201cRipple\" and Bruce Hornsby doing \u201cStanding on the Moon.\u201d",
      "Wynonna Judd performed \u201cRamble On Rose.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love you Robert Weir,\u201d she said from the stage. \u201cYou are my family of choice. You showed up when my momma died.\u201d",
      "Wearing a crown of red roses, Grammy nominee Sierra Ferrell teamed with Lukas Nelson on \u201cIt Must Have Been the Roses.\u201d",
      "Dwight Yoakam had the crowd on its feet dancing during \u201cTruckin.'\u201d Grammy nominee Noah Kahan sang \u201cFriend of the Devil\" featuring three guitars, banjo and bass.",

      "\u201cWhat we have here in Southern California these days is a rebuild that\u2019s going to take some time and effort and an immense amount of teamwork,\u201d Weir said. \u201cMy guess is it\u2019s going to take a few years, but SoCal will be back stronger and shinier.\u201d",
      "MusiCares Executive Director Laura Segura said $9.3 million was raised with another $5.2 million in pledges during the dinner.",

      "There have been plenty of out-of-the-ordinary moments at the ongoing trial of rapper A$AP Rocky",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The trial of rapper A$AP Rocky is progressing according to standard legal procedure, but there have been no lack of unusual moments, from visits from Rihanna to a tough-but-quirky judge and lawyers nearly coming to blows.",
      "Testimony is expected to last another week before jurors will decide Rocky's fate on two counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm. A conviction could lead to up to 24 years in prison for the hip-hop star.",
      "Here are some of the out-of-the-ordinary moments from the first two weeks of the trial, most not captured by the cameras in the courtroom.",
      "From the moment it became clear the case was going to trial, nearly everyone involved was asking the same thing: What about Rihanna?",
      "Editors asked it of reporters, who asked it of lawyers. Even Judge Mark Arnold asked it months ago at a hearing: \u201cWill the mother of his children be there?\u201d",
      "Her name came up constantly during jury selection, when prospective panelists were asked whether her attendance would affect their judgment.",
      "Yet when the singing superstar finally did show up, she was easy to miss.",
      "She didn't appear through the first week, but rumors abounded Wednesday that she might appear, on a short court day with important testimony. Yet there was no sign of her outside or in the halls. (Unlike a nearby civil courthouse, where celebrities like Britney Spears and the Kardashians are smuggled in, Rocky and other defendants must use public entrances and many thought she'd accompany him.)",
      "When the media were allowed in the courtroom, many reporters walked past her without noticing she was already sitting inconspicuously between Rocky's mother and sister. She had been brought in through restricted entrances. She could barely be seen from the media section, and the camera capturing the trial is not allowed to shoot the audience.",
      "Her presence caused a quiet stir once the audience realized it, though it's not clear if the jurors had noticed her.",
      "She appeared again the next day, and it soon felt almost unexceptional that she was there. By Friday, she slipped in about 30 minutes into testimony after coming through a public entrance.",
      "Later that day she entered the courtroom together with Rocky for the first time, down a hallway full of jurors from his and other cases that was abuzz.",
      "Court observers knew that when Deputy District Attorney John Lewin joined the prosecution shortly before trial, that he and Rocky's equally bullish and vocal attorney, Joe Tacopina, were sure to butt heads. They weren't wrong.",
      "Lewin, a dogged prosecutor, is best known for his successful murder prosecution of real estate heir Robert Durst. Tacopina is a New York attorney and frequent TV commentator whose clients have included President Donald Trump.",
      "Their shouting matches began quickly. Soon, without judge or jury present, the two had to be separated by a fellow lawyer when they went nose-to-nose in a faceoff that looked like it might become a fistfight.",
      "\u201cMr. Tacopina started literally screaming at me in the courtroom. He basically appeared to challenge me to a fight,\u201d Lewin told the judge later.",
      "Tacopina responded. \u201cNo one screamed. You weren\u2019t there your honor. Mr. Lewin comes up with his little scolding, bullying attitude.\u201d",
      "Arnold, a former sheriff's deputy, forbade the two from talking to each other except on the record.",
      "Moments later, he said a UFC fight might be warranted. \u201cMaybe we should get an octagon.\u201d",
      "Arnold wasn't wrong either. An even more fierce fight broke out between the two men in front of the judge but off camera a few days later as they argued over evidence. Lewin shouted that the defense assertion Rocky was carrying a prop gun was \u201cgarbage.\"",
      "\u201cOh?! Oh?!\u201d Tacopina yelled. \u201cWe'll see what the jury says at the end!\"",
      "\"The argument grew more out of control and turned to personal insults.",
      "\u201cYou don't know me! But you will learn!\u201d Tacopina yelled.",
      "The judge, disgusted, refused to keep playing referee.",
      "\u201cThat's it, we're off the record,\u201d he said, and walked out.",
      "The testimony of A$AP Relli, Rocky's accuser, was dark and difficult but brought a couple of oddly light moments.",
      "At one point, Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec asked him how far away Rocky was at a certain moment.",
      "\u201cAbout three or four skips,\" Relli said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never heard about anyone estimating with skips,\u201d Przelomiec said.",
      "\u201cWait, what does a skip mean?\u201d the judge asked.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I mean?\u201d Relli asked.",
      "They determined for the record that it was about 7 to 8 feet.",
      "Arnold's long-for-a-judge hair and rugged, bushy mustache evoke a biker, or a cowboy. His nameplate on the bench is a carved wooden log. Relli let him know he liked his style.",
      "As he testified, Arnold told him he clearly had to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for the court reporter.",
      "Relli said sorry, he was nervous, then looking at the judge said, \u201cI like your bracelet.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat?\u201d Arnold said.",
      "Relli pointed at the silver wristband on the judge's right arm. \u201cYour bracelet.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThank you.\u201d",
      "Rocky\u2019s mother, Renee Black, and his sister, Erika Mayers, garnered their own share of attention even before Rihanna sat between them.",
      "The first day they appeared, Arnold asked Rocky who the women in his section were.",
      "\u201cThat's my mother and my sister,\u201d Rocky said. The judge's marveled at Black's youthful appearance.",
      "\u201cWhat were you, 7 when you had him?\u201d the judge asked. She said she was 26.",
      "\u201cYou are very beautiful,\u201d the judge told her. \u201cThat\u2019s on the record.\u201d",
      "Later, Lewin politely approached the women and talked to them during a break. He said of Rocky, \u201cI just hope he's evaluating everything\u201d in a reference to the deal Rocky turned down \u2014 a recommendation of 180 days in jail and other relatively minor punishments for a guilty plea on one count.",
      "Tacopina angrily brought it up to the judge later, and Lewin explained himself.",
      "\u201cI walked up very kindly to the defendants mother and sister. I said \u2018I am very sorry you have to go through this. I hope that your brother and your son, he\u2019s really evaluated what he\u2019s risking here.\u2019\u201d",
      "During jury selection, when the room was packed with tired and seemingly bored potential jurors being questioned one after another, a woman gave everyone a start when she suddenly shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s a woman taking a picture in that corner!\u201d",
      "She pointed to a door with a small window behind the judge, who pounced into action, his robe flying. He and his clerk opened the door and hurried down the hall behind it, but found no one.",
      "The woman swore she saw someone and tried to justify herself, but Arnold cut her off.",
      "\u201cYou did the right thing!\u201d Arnold said. \u201cYou done good!\u201d",
      "They kept the window covered after that."

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Rihanna appeared for the first time at the trial of her longtime partner A$AP Rocky, on the day of its most important testimony \u2014 the description by a former friend of the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him.",
      "The singer superstar, who has two toddler sons with the rapper Rocky, sat out of view of the courtroom\u2019s cameras, between Rocky\u2019s mother and sister, in the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse. Security brought her in surreptitiously to avoid crowds Wednesday morning.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelston Mayers, has been standing trial on two felony charges that he fired a handgun at the former friend, who is known by the name A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron. If convicted, Rocky could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna watched Wednesday as Relli testified about the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "He had been shouting angrily at Rocky, who was walking away after an initial confrontation and scuffle, when Rocky pulled a gun from his waistband and held it in the air, Relli testified.",
      "\u201cHe turned around and then it was like BOOM!\u201d he told the jury. \u201cThe whole thing was like a movie, he kind of like pointed down and he shot the first shot.\"",

      "The trial's key witness said he grabbed one of their mutual friends who were with Rocky after the first shot was fired and stood behind him for protection. He said he did not see Rocky fire the second shot, and Rocky ran away moments later.",
      "When jurors were being selected, prosecutors asked them whether Rihanna\u2019s connection to the case, especially if she appeared in court, would affect their ability to deliver a guilty verdict.",
      "Nearly all those questioned had heard of her \u2014 far more than had heard of Rocky \u2014 and some described themselves as fans, but all said they felt it would not affect their decisions.",
      "It was not clear whether they could see Rihanna or were aware of her presence as they watched the testimony. She wore a long black dress with buttons on the front that resembled a winter overcoat, and had a pair of glasses on her head that she put on during the prosecution's questioning.",
      "Earlier in the trial, which began on Jan. 21, Relli said he and Rocky, members of A$AP, a crew of creators at a New York high school, had been close but their relationship eroded after Rocky became famous.",
      "He said their relationship had been strained for years and was getting worse in the days leading up to the incident, but he was still \u201cfurious\u201d when Rocky pulled a gun on him after a scuffle that began the moment the two met up near the W Hotel. He dared him to use it.",

      "Rocky\u2019s lawyer says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun \u2014 they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.",
      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified Wednesday, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "He said he felt free to follow and shout at Rocky because \u201cI felt like because he put it away and we\u2019re on a busy street in Hollywood. He\u2019s definitely not gonna shoot it.\u201d",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",
      "About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.",
      "He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying \"U try killing me.\"",
      "Rocky denied it in his reply.",
      "\u201cBro wtf is u talkin bout why u tell ppl I shot at u.\u201d",

      "Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers. The result is \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City.",
      "Filmmakers Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman became interested in Alabama prisons in 2019. Jarecki, the filmmaker behind \u201cThe Jinx\u201d and \u201cCapturing the Friedmans,\u201d and Kaufman first gained access to the restricted grounds through a visit with a chaplain during a revival meeting held in the prison yards. There men pulled them aside and whispered shocking stories about the reality of life inside: forced labor, drugs, violence, intimidation, retaliation and the undisclosed truths behind many prisoner deaths.",
      "The Associated Press has written extensively about the problems in the state\u2019s prison system, including high rates of violence, low staffing, a plummeting parole rate and the use of pandemic funds to build a new supersized prison.",
      "This process eventually led them to incarcerated activists Melvin Ray and Robert Earl Council (also known as \u201cKinetik Justice\u201d) who had for years been trying to expose the horrifying conditions and deep- seated corruption across the system. They helped feed dispatches to the filmmakers with contraband cellphones.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned for their safety, and we have been since the first time we met them,\u201d said Kaufman. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this work for decades and as you see in the film, they\u2019ve been retaliated against in very extreme ways. But there are lawyers who are ready to do wellness checks and visit them and respond to any sort of retaliation that may come.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday at the first showing of the film, she had Council on the phone listening in. They put the microphone up to the cellphone so that Council could speak.",
      "\u201cWe thank you all for listening, for being interested,\u201d Council said. \u201cOn behalf of the brothers of Alabama, I thank you all.\u201d",
      "Several family members of their incarcerated subjects were also in the audience, including Sandy Ray, the mother of Steven Davis, who died in 2019 at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility, his face beaten beyond recognition. Prison officials said Davis was killed in self-defense because he didn\u2019t put down his weapons. The prisoners tell a vastly different story.",
      "Alelur \u201cAlex\u201d Duran, who spent 12 years in prison in New York, also helped produce the film. Jarecki said they wouldn't have taken on the subject without the expertise of someone who had been incarcerated.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in this film is going on all over the nation,\u201d Duran said.",
      "Also embedded in the story is Alabama\u2019s long history of contracting prisoners to do work at private companies from Burger King to Best Western, an issue that the AP investigated for over two years. The cheap, reliable labor force has generated more than $250 million for the state since 2000 \u2014 money garnished from prisoners\u2019 paychecks, the AP wrote in December. Parole numbers have also plummeted in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe want to show viewers the truth about a system that has been cloaked in secrecy,\u201d Jarecki said. \u201cWe hope the film sparks an effort to allow access for journalists and others so the public can have transparency into how incarcerated citizens are treated and how our tax dollars are being spent. We hope to inspire Alabama\u2019s leadership to acknowledge the crisis and to overhaul its prison system and its use of forced labor.\u201d",
      "The film will have a theatrical release before it debuts on HBO sometime this year, but the specific dates and details are still being worked out. And while it is in its early days, the impact, Jarecki said, has already been seen, including in a class action labor lawsuit.",

      "Fresh off the release of a new album called \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow,\u201d The Weeknd has announced a massive North American stadium tour",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Fresh off the release of a new album, \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow,\u201d The Weeknd has announced a massive North American stadium tour \u2014 not an easy feat for a contemporary solo act and further confirmation of his popularity.",
      "The \u201cAfter Hours 'Til Dawn\u201d tour kicks off May 9 in Phoenix at the State Farm Stadium and concludes in San Antonio on Sept. 3 at the Alamodome.",
      "The tour will also hit Detroit; Chicago; East Rutherford, New Jersey; Foxborough, Massachusetts; Minneapolis; Denver; Inglewood, California; Las Vegas; Santa Clarita, California; Seattle, Vancouver, Canada; Edmonton, Canada; Montreal; Toronto; Philadelphia; Landover, Maryland; Nashville, Tennessee; Miami; Atlanta; Orlando, Florida; Arlington, Texas, and Houston.",
      "He will be joined by Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti and Mike Dean.",
      "Tickets can be purchased through the artist presale, which will begin Wednesday at 10 a.m. local time and run until Thursday at 9 a.m. local time. The general sale will begin on Feb. 7 at 10 a.m. local time via theweeknd.com/tour.",

      "The album was at least partially inspired by a set at Inglewood, California's SoFi Stadium just outside Los Angeles in 2022, where the musician born Abel Tesfaye lost his voice. He has described the moment as the start of a breakdown. He will return to the venue for two nights in June."

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has asked state legislators to double their spending to date on Hurricane Helene recovery and approve it now",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein asked state legislators Monday to roughly double their spending so far on recovery from Hurricane Helene, warning that waiting will cause more business closings, housing construction delays and students falling behind.",
      "Speaking in a mountain county hit by the historic flooding, the new Democratic governor said he wants his $1.07 billion request enacted now by the Republican-controlled General Assembly \u2014 rather than wait for the two-year budget that starts in July, for which he'll make an additional Helene appeal.",
      "At a news conference at a food bank in Mills River, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) west of Raleigh, Stein said the funds are urgently needed in the first half of the year \u201cso that people can get their lives back together.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we do not act, some businesses will not be here in the summer, and we will miss an entire building season before the winter weather comes again,\u201d he warned, calling the funds a high priority.",
      "The largest chunks of his proposal, which contains no tax increases, would fund grants for struggling businesses; help repair and rebuild homes; clean up farm debris; fix private bridges and roads; and replace revenues spent or lost by local governments. There's also money for summer school in districts that lost at least 15 instructional days shortly after Helene's rampage last September.",
      "\u201cWe can ensure that our students are set up for long-term academic success.,\u201d Stein said. \u201cAll of these components are necessary to building a safer, stronger and more resilient western North Carolina, and they are needed now.\u201d",
      "The state legislature already appropriated last fall well over $900 million for relief and rebuilding efforts and earmarked a couple of hundred million more for that purpose in the future. New House Speaker Destin Hall has said getting bipartisan early-session Helene funding bill to Stein's desk was a top priority.",
      "Advancing Monday's package could provide an early test for Stein, who was sworn in last month, in his efforts to find consensus with Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger. While Republicans control both chambers, they are one seat short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "GOP Rep. Jake Johnson of Polk County, who served on a bipartisan Helene advisory committee organized by Stein last year, spoke at the news conference with an optimistic tone.",
      "\u201cWe will start reviewing the governor\u2019s proposed budget and figuring out how we can get these dollars to people who need them the most right now,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Berger spokesperson Lauren Horsch said Monday that the Senate is reviewing Stein\u2019s proposal and anticipates considering Helene legislation in the coming weeks. Even with the money already put toward the recovery, Horsch added, \u201cthere is still more we can do.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene with 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads damaged. The state budget office estimated that Helene caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "Helene made landfall last Sept. 26 in Florida\u2019s Big Bend and swept far inland, upending life throughout the Southeast. Officials have warned that rebuilding from the widespread loss of homes and property would be lengthy and difficult.",
      "Stein's request to spend money currently sitting in two reserves emphasizes speed.",
      "The $150 million sought for a home reconstruction, repair and buyout program is designed so such work can begin immediately while awaiting the distribution from Washington of similar housing assistance, which could take a year. The state program could assist at least 225 of 5,100 homes estimated to need rebuilding, Stein\u2019s request says.",
      "Stein also wants $150 million for two business grant programs designed to provide up to $75,000 to companies that suffered significant sales and economic losses, it physical damages.",
      "Stein said on Monday that \u201ctaking on additional business debt is simply not the answer for small businesses that are already struggling.\u201d",
      "In a special session last week, Tennessee lawmakers approved Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s $470 million package offering further aid for communities ravaged by Helene in the northeast part of that state. The package will help local governments cover loan interest on recovery costs, fuel agricultural and business recovery, fund disaster-related unemployment aid, and pay for rebuilding a badly damaged high school.",

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Ugandan authorities on Monday began a clinical trial of a vaccine against the Sudan strain of Ebola that has killed one person in the outbreak declared last week.",
      "Health workers and others exposed to the Ebola strain are being targeted in the study, which began four days after Uganda announced the death of a nurse in the capital, Kampala. Two more cases were confirmed on Monday in relatives of the first victim.",
      "Officials are investigating the source of the outbreak. Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding.",
      "Responding to this outbreak could prove difficult because Kampala has a highly mobile population of about 4 million. The nurse who died had sought treatment at a hospital just outside the capital and later traveled to Mbale in the country\u2019s east, where he was admitted to a public hospital. Health authorities said he also sought the services of a traditional healer.",
      "At least 234 contacts in this outbreak have been identified, according to the Ministry of Health.",
      "Health authorities have access to more than 2,000 doses of a candidate vaccine against the Sudan strain. IAVI provided the vaccine.",
      "The trial \u201cmarks a major milestone in public health emergency response and demonstrates the power of collaboration for global health security,\u201d Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO director for Africa, said in a statement.",
      "This is the first Ebola outbreak since the Trump administration's decision last week to withdraw from the U.N. health agency, and since Trump's order for a freeze on foreign assistance.",
      "Uganda has had multiple Ebola outbreaks, including one in 2000 that killed hundreds. Tracing contacts is key to stemming the spread of Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever.",
      "A trial vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, used to vaccinate 3,000 people at risk of infection during an outbreak of the Zaire strain of Ebola in eastern Congo between 2018 and 2020, proved effective in containing the spread of the disease there.",
      "The confirmation of Ebola in Uganda is the latest in a series of outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the east African region. Tanzania declared an outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg disease last month, and Rwanda in December announced that its own outbreak of Marburg was over.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know the natural reservoir of Ebola, but they suspect the first person infected in an outbreak acquired the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat.",
      "Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named."

      "NEW YORK -- New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday told hospitals that they would be violating state law if they stop offering gender-affirming care for people under age 19 in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at curtailing federal funding for such treatments.",
      "In a letter, James, a Democrat, told health care facilities that refusing to provide the treatments would violate New York's anti-discrimination laws.",
      "\"Regardless of the availability of federal funding, we write to further remind you of your obligations to comply with New York State laws,\" her letter reads.",
      "Trump, a Republican, last week signed an executive order that directed agencies to take steps to make sure that hospitals receiving federal research and education grants \u201cend the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\u201d The language in the order \u2014 using words such as \u201cmaiming,\u201d \u201csterilizing\u201d and \u201cmutilation\u201d \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States.",
      "The letter from James came as some hospitals in Colorado, Virginia and Washington, D.C., said they were pausing gender-affirming treatments for young people while administrators evaluate the order. The White House on Monday released a statement that said the executive order was \u201calready having its intended effect.\u201d",

Fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents in the U.S. with commercial insurance received puberty blockers or hormones during a recent five-year period, according to a new study."

      "GOMA, Congo -- Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma, a major city in eastern Congo, as fighting rages on between government forces and the Rwanda-backed rebels who seized the city of around 2 million people.",
      "\u201cThey will get infected before we can treat them all,\u201d said Florence Douet, an operating room nurse at Bethesda Hospital, as she attended to patients with varying degrees of injuries.",
      "Since the start of the M23 rebels' offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda Hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds.",
      "Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "As more people arrived at the hospitals with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, many were forced to share beds while others lay on the floor, writhing in pain as they waited for medical attention.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m experiencing this,\" said Patrick Bagamuhunda, who was wounded in the fighting. \u201cThis war has caused a lot of damage, but at least we are still breathing.\u201d",
      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma before withdrawing under international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Unlike in 2012, the rebels say they now plan to march to Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away, describing the country as a failed state under President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi.",
      "The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia group. Rwanda said the group is \"fully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges.",
      "Medical workers at Kyeshero Hospital in Goma say they are treating an increasing number of patients with bullet wounds.",
      "\"We removed 48 bullets yesterday,\u201d Johnny Kasangati, a surgeon, said Friday as he examined a patient under a tent.",
      "Kyeshero is also severely overcrowded, hitting more than 200% of its capacity on some days, according to Joseph Amadomon Sagara, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which runs the hospital.",
      "In the past, hospitals in Goma could transport wounded patients by boat to South Kivu's main Bukavu city, 180 kilometers (111 miles) to the south, but transport across Lake Kivu was suspended during the rebellion and roads have been mostly cut.",
      "The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control.",
      "\u201cGoma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,\" said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.",
      "The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have been looted.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don\u2019t know for how long,\u201d Napolitano said.",

      "The Maternit\u00e9 de la Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Goma was among those struggling to find space for the dead.",
      "\u201cWe had 66 bodies here. Fifty-six were transferred to the provincial hospital, where the morgue has more space than ours,\" said Jules Kafitiye, the hospital's medical director.",
      "\"We need to avoid decomposition due to disease,\u201d he added, pointing to a tent where bodies were being stored.",
      "Scores of bodies lay on streets and in hospitals in Goma after the city's capture, raising fears of disease outbreaks in the region, which is also facing mpox and cholera outbreaks.",
      "The U.N. health body warned last week that repeated mass displacement in Congo has created ideal conditions for the spread of endemic diseases in displacement camps and surrounding communities, including cholera, which saw more than 22,000 infections last year, and measles, which affected close to 12,000 people. The region also battles with chronic child malnutrition.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a fear for the disease to be spreading widely in communities,\u201d said Dr. Boureima Hama Sambo, the World Health Organization\u2019s representative in Congo. \u201cBut at this point, we cannot say because we have not been able to get there.\u201d",

      "Even before the Gaza war began, the Rafah crossing represented a crucial escape valve from the territory, where a 15-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade aimed at containing Hamas undermined health facilities and impoverished the population. Palestinians routinely applied for permission to travel outside the territory for lifesaving treatments not available in Gaza, including chemotherapy.",
      "It took some diplomatic gymnastics to reopen the crossing and overcome security disputes between Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian officials. Hamas had overseen the border since 2007, when it took control of Gaza from its rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, or PA, after winning parliamentary elections in 2006.",
      "Israeli troops remain at the Rafah crossing and in the Philadelphia Corridor, a band of land running the length of the border. Israel has refused to allow Hamas to resume management of the crossing, accusing it of smuggling weapons through tunnels under the border, though Egypt says it destroyed the tunnels from its side and stopped smuggling years ago. Israel also refuses to allow the Palestinian Authority to officially run the crossing.",
      "Instead, the crossing will be staffed by Palestinians from Gaza who previously served as border officers with the PA, but they will not be allowed to wear official PA insignia, a European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to brief the media. Israel has screened the officers to ensure they have no affiliation with Hamas, the European diplomat added.",
      "European Union monitors will also be present, as they were before 2007.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the deal \u2014 which calls for a permanent ceasefire, full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of any remaining hostages \u2014 are supposed to begin Monday. Israel has resisted the notion that the PA would control postwar Gaza."

      "GENEVA -- The World Health Organization chief asked global leaders to lean on Washington to reverse President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the U.N. health agency, insisting in a closed-door meeting with diplomats last week that the U.S. will miss out on critical information about global disease outbreaks.",
      "But countries also pressed WHO at a key budget meeting last Wednesday about how it might cope with the exit of its biggest donor, according to internal meeting materials obtained by The Associated Press. A German envoy, Bjorn Kummel, warned: \u201cThe roof is on fire, and we need to stop the fire as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "For 2024-2025, the U.S. is WHO\u2019s biggest donor by far, putting in an estimated $988 million, roughly 14% of WHO\u2019s $6.9 billion budget.",
      "A budget document presented at the meeting showed WHO\u2019s health emergencies program has a \u201cheavy reliance\u201d on American cash. \u201cReadiness functions\u201d in WHO\u2019s Europe office were more than 80% reliant on the $154 million the U.S. contributes.",
      "The document said U.S. funding \u201cprovides the backbone of many of WHO's large-scale emergency operations,\u201d covering up to 40%. It said responses in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan were at risk, in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars lost by polio-eradication and HIV programs.",
      "The U.S. also covers 95% of WHO's tuberculosis work in Europe and more than 60% of TB efforts in Africa, the Western Pacific and at the agency headquarters in Geneva, the document said.",
      "At a separate private meeting on the impact of the U.S. exit last Wednesday, WHO finance director George Kyriacou said if the agency spends at its current rate, the organization would \u201cbe very much in a hand-to-mouth type situation when it comes to our cash flows\u201d in the first half of 2026. He added the current rate of spending is \u201csomething we're not going to do,\" according to a recording obtained by the AP.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s executive order, WHO has attempted to withdraw funds from the U.S. for past expenses, Kyriacou said, but most of those \u201chave not been accepted.\u201d",
      "The U.S. also has yet to settle its owed contributions to WHO for 2024, pushing the agency into a deficit, he added.",
      "WHO's executive board, made up of 34 high-level envoys including many national health ministers, was expected to discuss budget matters during its latest session, which opens Monday and is set to run through Feb. 11.",
      "Last week, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were instructed to stop working with WHO immediately.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the attendees at the budget meeting that the agency is still providing U.S. scientists with some data \u2014 though it isn't known what data.",
      "\u201cWe continue to give them information because they need it,\u201d Tedros said, urging member countries to contact U.S officials. \u201cWe would appreciate it if you continue to push and reach out to them to reconsider.\u201d",
      "Among other health crises, WHO is currently working to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus in Tanzania, Ebola in Uganda and mpox in Congo.",
      "Tedros rebutted Trump\u2019s three stated reasons for leaving the agency in the executive order signed on Jan. 20 \u2014 Trump's first day back in office. In the order, the president said WHO mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic that began in China, failed to adopt needed reforms and that U.S. membership required \u201cunfairly onerous payments.\"",
      "Tedros said WHO alerted the world in January 2020 about the potential dangers of the coronavirus and has made dozens of reforms since \u2014 including efforts to expand its donor base.",
      "Tedros also said he believed the U.S. departure was \u201cnot about the money\u201d but more about the \u201cvoid\u201d in outbreak details and other critical health information that the United States would face in the future.",
      "\u201cBringing the U.S. back will be very important,\" he told meeting attendees. \"And on that, I think all of you can play a role.\u201d",
      "Kummel, a senior advisor on global health in Germany's health ministry, described the U.S. exit as \u201cthe most extensive crisis WHO has been facing in the past decades.\u201d",
      "He also asked: \u201cWhat concrete functions of WHO will collapse if the funding of the U.S. is not existent anymore?\u201d",
      "Officials from countries including Bangladesh and France asked what specific plans WHO had to deal with the loss of U.S. funding and wondered which health programs would be cut as a result.",
      "The AP obtained a document shared among some WHO senior managers that laid out several options, including a proposal that each major department or office might be slashed in half by the end of the year.",

      "Some experts said that while the departure of the U.S. was a major crisis, it might also serve as an opportunity to reshape global public health.",
      "Less than 1% of the U.S. health budget goes to WHO, said Matthew Kavanagh, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Global Health Policy and Politics. In exchange, the U.S. gets \u201ca wide variety of benefits to Americans that matter quite a bit,\u201d he said. That includes intelligence about disease epidemics globally and virus samples for vaccines.",

      "A new memo says the Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments, according to a new memo.",
      "The directive signed this week eliminates a rarely used Biden administration policy enacted in October 2022, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and more states began to impose increased abortion restrictions.",
      "Signed on Wednesday by Jeffrey Register, the director of the Pentagon's human resources department, the memo simply shows red lines crossing out the previous regulation and offers no other guidance.",
      "Asked if service members would still be allowed time off to travel at their own expense, the department had no immediate answer.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the policy change \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur service members go wherever they need to in order to bravely serve our country \u2014 and because President Trump\u2019s extremist Supreme Court overturned Roe, where they and their families are stationed quite literally dictates their access to critical reproductive care,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cNow, Trump is turning his back on our servicemembers \u2014 and our servicewomen in particular \u2014 to score political points. It\u2019s shameful, and will only make our troops and our nation less safe.\u201d",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin instituted the policy in October 2022 to ensure that troops who were assigned to states where abortions or other types of health care such as IVF treatment were no longer provided could still access those services.",
      "The Defense Department on Friday was unable to say how many times the reimbursement policy was used, or the costs. But last March, officials said it had been used by service members or their dependents just 12 times from June to December 2023. And the total cost was roughly $40,000 to cover transportation, lodging and meals.",
      "The policy did not cover the cost of abortions, and it\u2019s not clear how many of the 12 trips were for abortions or other type of reproductive health care, such as IVF treatment. That specific medical information is protected by health privacy law.",
      "In his memo at the time, Austin said service members and their families were worried they may not get equal access to health care, including abortions. And he noted that service members who often must move for various missions or training would be forced to travel farther, take more time off work and pay more to access reproductive health care.",
      "The problem, Austin said, would create extraordinary hardship and \"interfere with our ability to recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force.\u201d",
      "He ordered the department to allow troops and dependents, consistent with federal law, to take time off and use official travel to get to other states for reproductive care not available locally. That care includes in vitro fertilization and other pregnancy aids that also may not be accessible close by.",
      "Under federal law, Defense Department medical facilities can perform abortions only when the life of the pregnant person is at risk or in cases of rape or incest, and those instances have been extremely rare. According to the department, there were 91 abortions performed in military medical facilities between 2016 and 2021."

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "Carpenter did not immediately return a message.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we\u2019ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women\u2019s rights,\u201d the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s indictment could be the first direct test of New York\u2019s shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cWe always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn\u2019t the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That\u2019s why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They\u2019re also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed."

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the \u201cstrangling angel\u201d for the way it suffocated children.",
      "Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors \u2014 the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver life-saving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria.",
      "Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 \u201cGreat Race of Mercy\u201d are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of this heroic effort and ... spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for the state of Alaska,\u201d said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and co-owner of Alaska\u2019s oldest newspaper, the Nome Nugget.",
      "\u201cPeople just dropped whatever they were doing,\" she said. \"These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail.\u201d",
      "Other communities are also marking the anniversary \u2014 including the village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the serum run's most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed and displayed at a museum.",
      "Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team.",
      "Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film to develop at the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S.",
      "Nome, western Alaska\u2019s largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn\u2019t seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area.",
      "Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: \"An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.\u201d",
      "The first death was a 3-year-old boy on Jan. 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine.",
      "West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle and then onto a ship for Seward, an ice-free port south of Anchorage. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital.",
      "It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome.",
      "Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 675 miles (1,086 kilometers) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails.",
      "Thanks to Alaska\u2019s new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers \u2014 many of them Alaska Natives \u2014 with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn\u2019t see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 51 degrees Celsius).",
      "The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke.",
      "Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 250 miles (320 kilometers) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound.",
      "After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on Feb. 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed: \u201cDogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.\u201d",

      "Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala\u2019s dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.",
      "Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck.",

      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s famous name, populist stances and loyal following have earned him President Donald Trump's support, but will that get him the votes he needs from the Republican-controlled Senate to become the nation's top health official?",
      "If approved, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country.",
      "His confirmation hearings are set before the Senate finance committee on Wednesday and the Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to watch during his confirmation hearings:",
      "Over many years, Kennedy has been clear about his beliefs on vaccines in dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts.",
      "He's headed up a nonprofit that has sued the government over its authorizations of vaccines. He's said there is \u201c no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and repeatedly called for further study of routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and real-world use that proves they've safely prevented disease.",
      "But more recently, Kennedy has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, saying he's not anti-vaccine and promising not to \u201ctake away\u201d the shots.",
      "The health committee chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also has expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. A physician, Cassidy said earlier this month he \u201chad a frank conversation\u201d and \u201cspoke about vaccines at length\u201d with Kennedy. On Tuesday, Cassidy told reporters that he is still unsure if he is backing Trump\u2019s nominee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still working through it,\u201d Cassidy said during a press availability with Louisiana reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI look forward to the hearings and I will allow that to guide my decision.\u201d",
      "The intensity of the questioning on vaccines over the next two days could provide clues for how other Republicans \u2014 like Sen. Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor who represents Kentucky \u2014 might consider Kennedy\u2019s nomination.",
      "Some of the country's most conservative lawmakers have been worried about how Kennedy will handle abortion as health secretary.",
      "Republican Sen. James Lankford, who sits on the finance committee, is expected to grill Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, on the issue during Wednesday's hearing. Lankford is seen as a possible \u201cno\u201d vote over Kennedy's past comments supporting abortion. Last month, the Oklahoma senator said he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Kennedy but stopped short of endorsing.",
      "HHS can influence abortion and reproductive health access in a number of ways, including with millions of dollars in grants it sends to Planned Parenthood and regulations around abortion pills. Under the Biden administration, the agency also said hospitals were required to provide emergency abortions for pregnant women in medical distress.",
      "On Monday, acting HHS Secretary Dorothy Fink signaled the agency is prepared to adopt a tougher stance on abortion under Kennedy. She ordered the agency to investigate all of its programs to make sure no taxpayer money is going toward elective abortions.",
      "Kennedy needs to earn support from nearly all Senate Republicans, but he may also try to pick up a vote or two from the Democratic Party. His closest supporters and advisers have urged followers to call the offices of Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",
      "Another Democratic senator may also be in play: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who met with Kennedy and has said he's open to supporting Trump's nominees.",
      "An area where Kennedy is trying to find common ground with Democratic senators: food regulations and access to healthier foods. Kennedy has said he supports Medicare and Medicaid helping people pay for healthier foods and gym memberships, an idea Democrats have lobbied for as well. He's also called for a ban on some of the ingredients used in foods, like dyes and additives.",
      "In a letter sent to U.S. senators on Tuesday, Caroline Kennedy shared shocking personal details about her cousin, saying he is not qualified for the health secretary job.",
      "Caroline Kennedy said RFK Jr.'s views on vaccines are a problem, but she also brought up her experiences growing up with him.",
      "A copy obtained by The Associated Press notes that while she admired him for overcoming a drug addiction, she said he has gone on to \u201cmisrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\u201d In an extreme anecdote, she accused him of hosting drug-fueled gatherings in his basement, dorm and garage where he \u201cenjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, another cousin, former Rhode Island congressman and Democrat Patrick J. Kennedy, threw his support behind the health secretary nominee in an opinion piece for The Washington Post on Tuesday. RFK Jr. helped pull him out of addiction, Patrick J. Kennedy said.",
      "\u201cBobby was the first family member to call and offer his personal and public support, even at a time when some in my family criticized me for breaking the so-called family code of silence,\u201d he wrote.",

      "",
      "Despite long COVID's vast reach, the federal government's investment in researching the disease  --  to the tune of $1.15 billion as of December  --  has so far failed to bring any new treatments to market.",
      "",
      "This disappoints and angers the patient community, who say the National Institutes of Health (NIH) should focus on ways to stop their suffering instead of simply trying to understand why they're suffering.",
      "",
      "\"It's unconscionable that more than 4 years since this began, we still don't have one FDA-approved drug,\" said Meighan Stone, executive director of the Long COVID Campaign, a patient-led advocacy organization. Stone was among several people with long COVID who spoke at a workshop hosted by the NIH in September where patients, clinicians, and researchers discussed their priorities and frustrations around the agency's approach to long COVID research.",
      "",
      "Some doctors and researchers are also critical of the agency's research initiative, called RECOVER, or Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery. Without clinical trials, physicians specializing in treating long COVID must rely on hunches to guide their clinical decisions, said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development with the VA St. Louis Healthcare System.",
      "",
      "\"What [RECOVER] lacks, really, is clarity of vision and clarity of purpose,\" said Al-Aly, saying he agrees that the NIH has had enough time and money to produce more meaningful progress.",
      "",
      "Now the NIH is starting to determine how to allocate an additional $662 million of funding for long COVID research, $300 million of which is earmarked for clinical trials. These funds will be allocated over the next 4 years. At the end of October, RECOVER issued a request for clinical trial ideas that look at potential therapies, including medications, saying its goal is \"to work rapidly, collaboratively, and transparently to advance treatments for long COVID.\"",
      "",
      "This turn suggests the NIH has begun to respond to patients. This has stirred cautious optimism among those who say that the agency's approach to long COVID has lacked urgency in the search for effective treatments. Stone calls this $300 million a down payment. She warns it's going to take a lot more money to help people like Hayes regain some degree of health. \"There really is a burden to make up this lost time now,\" Stone said.",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR via email that it recognizes the urgency in finding treatments. But to do that, there needs to be an understanding of the biological mechanisms that are making people sick, which is difficult to do with post-infectious conditions.",
      "",
      "That's why it has funded research into how long COVID affects lung function, or trying to understand why only some people are afflicted with the condition.",
      "",
      "Good Science Takes Time",
      "",
      "In December 2020, Congress appropriated $1.15 billion for the NIH to launch RECOVER, raising hopes in the long COVID patient community.",
      "",
      "Then-NIH Director Francis Collins, MD, PhD, explained that RECOVER's goal was to better understand long COVID as a disease and that clinical trials of potential treatments would come later.",
      "",
      "According to RECOVER's website, it has funded eight clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment or intervention. Just one of those trials has published results.",
      "",
      "On the other hand, RECOVER has supported more than 200 observational studies, such as research on how long COVID affects pulmonary function and on which symptoms are most common. And the initiative has funded more than 40 pathobiology studies, which focus on the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of long COVID.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's website says this research has led to crucial insights on the risk factors for developing long COVID and on understanding how the disease interacts with preexisting conditions.",
      "",
      "It notes that observational studies are important in helping scientists to design and launch evidence-based clinical trials.",
      "",
      "Good science takes time, said Leora Horwitz, MD, the co-principal investigator for the RECOVER-Adult Observational Cohort at New York University (NYU). And long COVID is an \"exceedingly complicated\" illness that appears to affect nearly every organ system, she said.",
      "",
      "This makes it more difficult to study than many other diseases. Because long COVID harms the body in so many ways, with widely variable symptoms, it's harder to identify precise targets for treatment.",
      "",
      "\"I also will remind you that we're only 3, 4 years into this pandemic for most people,\" Horwitz said. \"We've been spending much more money than this, yearly, for 30, 40 years on other conditions.\"",
      "",
      "NYU received nearly $470 million of RECOVER funds in 2021, which the institution is using to spearhead the collection of data and biospecimens from up to 40,000 patients. Horwitz said nearly 30,000 are enrolled so far.",
      "",
      "This vast repository, Horwitz said, supports ongoing observational research, allowing scientists to understand what is happening biologically to people who don't recover after an initial infection  --  and that will help determine which clinical trials for treatments are worth undertaking.",
      "",
      "\"Simply trying treatments because they are available without any evidence about whether or why they may be effective reduces the likelihood of successful trials and may put patients at risk of harm,\" she said.",
      "",
      "Delayed Hopes or Incremental Progress?",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR that patients and caregivers have been central to RECOVER from the beginning, \"playing critical roles in designing studies and clinical trials, responding to surveys, serving on governance and publication groups, and guiding the initiative.\" But the consensus from patient advocacy groups is that RECOVER should have done more to prioritize clinical trials from the outset. Patients also say RECOVER leadership ignored their priorities and experiences when determining which studies to fund.",
      "",
      "RECOVER has scored some gains, said JD Davids, co-director of Long COVID Justice. This includes findings on differences in long COVID between adults and kids. But Davids said the NIH shouldn't have named the initiative \"RECOVER,\" since it wasn't designed as a streamlined effort to develop treatments.",
      "",
      "\"The name's a little cruel and misleading,\" he said.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's initial allocation of $1.15 billion probably wasn't enough to develop a new medication to treat long COVID, said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, MD, PhD, co-director of the University of Pennsylvania's Healthcare Transformation Institute.",
      "",
      "But, he said, the results of preliminary clinical trials could have spurred pharmaceutical companies to fund more studies on drug development and test how existing drugs influence a patient's immune response.",
      "",
      "Emanuel is one of the authors of a March 2022 COVID roadmap report. He notes that RECOVER's lack of focus on new treatments was a problem. \"Only 15% of the budget is for clinical studies. That is a failure in itself  --  a failure of having the right priorities,\" he told KFF Health News and NPR via email.",
      "",
      "And though the NYU biobank has been impactful, Emanuel said there needs to be more focus on how existing drugs influence immune response.",
      "",
      "He said some clinical trials that RECOVER has funded are \"ridiculous,\" because they've focused on symptom amelioration, for example to study the benefits of over-the-counter medication to improve sleep. Other studies looked at non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise and \"brain training\" to help with cognitive fog.",
      "",
      "People with long COVID say this type of clinical research contributes to what many describe as the \"gaslighting\" they experience from doctors, who sometimes blame a patient's symptoms on anxiety or depression, rather than acknowledging long COVID as a real illness with a physiological basis.",
      "",
      "\"I'm just disgusted,\" said long COVID patient Hayes. \"You wouldn't tell somebody with diabetes to breathe through it.\"",
      "",
      "Chim\u00e9re L. Sweeney, director and founder of the Black Long COVID Experience, said she's even taken breaks from seeking treatment after getting fed up with being told that her symptoms were due to her diet or mental health.",
      "",
      "\"You're at the whim of somebody who may not even understand the spectrum of long COVID,\" Sweeney said.",
      "",
      "Insurance Battles Over Experimental Treatments",
      "",
      "Since there are still no long COVID treatments approved by the FDA, anything a physician prescribes is classified as either experimental  --  for unproven treatments  --  or an off-label use of a drug approved for other conditions. This means patients can struggle to get insurance to cover prescriptions.",
      "",
      "Michael Brode, MD, medical director for UT Health Austin's Post-COVID-19 Program  --  said he writes many appeal letters. And some people pay for their own treatment.",
      "",
      "For example, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, low-dose naltrexone, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are all promising treatments, he said.",
      "",
      "For hyperbaric oxygen, two small, randomized controlled studies show improvements for the chronic fatigue and brain fog that often plague long COVID patients. The theory is that higher oxygen concentration and increased air pressure can help heal tissues that were damaged during a COVID infection.",
      "",
      "However, the out-of-pocket cost for a series of sessions in a hyperbaric chamber can run as much as $8,000, Brode said.",
      "",
      "\"Am I going to look a patient in the eye and say, 'You need to spend that money for an unproven treatment'?\" he said. \"I don't want to hype up a treatment that is still experimental. But I also don't want to hide it.\"",
      "",
      "There's a host of pharmaceuticals that have promising off-label uses for long COVID, said microbiologist Amy Proal, PhD, president and chief scientific officer at the Massachusetts-based PolyBio Research Foundation. For instance, she's collaborating on a clinical study that repurposes two HIV drugs to treat long COVID.",
      "",
      "Proal said research on treatments can move forward based on what's already understood about the disease. For instance, she said that scientists have evidence  --  partly due to RECOVER research  --  that some patients continue to harbor small amounts of viral material after a COVID infection. She has not received RECOVER funds but is researching antivirals.",
      "",
      "But to vet a range of possible treatments for the millions suffering now  --  and to develop new drugs specifically targeting long COVID  --  clinical trials are needed. And that requires money.",
      "",
      "Hayes said she would definitely volunteer for an investigational drug trial. For now, though, \"in order to not be absolutely miserable,\" she said she focuses on what she can do, like having dinner with her family. At the same time, Hayes doesn't want to spend the rest of her life on a beige couch.",

      "Politicians in Italy have asked authorities to take action against a hunting party including Donald Trump Jr. that may have killed a protected species of duck near Venice",
      "MILAN -- Italian politicians on Tuesday asked authorities to take action against a hunting party including Donald Trump Jr. that may have killed a protected species of duck near Venice.",
      "Andrea Zanoni of the Europa Verde party in the northern Veneto region cited a video posted on the Field Ethos website for male adventurers founded by Trump. It shows Trump on a recent hunt in the wetlands in the Valle Pierimpie\u2019 bordering the Venice Lagoon.",
      "At one point, Trump is shown next to a dead duck that Zanoni identifies as a ruddy shelduck. The species is protected in Europe, and killing one is a criminal offense in Italy, Zanoni said.",
      "The video picked up by Italian media does not indicate who killed the duck. It was not clear when the hunt took place, but Italian media said Trump was in Italy in December and a Christmas tree was seen.",
      "Zanoni appealed to Veneto legislators to take action in coordination with Luana Zanella, a Greens lawmaker in Italy\u2019s lower house, who appealed to Italy\u2019s environment minister. Zanoni said he also sought the suspension or revocation of authorization for the Valle Pierimpie\u2019 wildlife hunting company that led the hunt.",
      "Hunting is strictly regulated in Italy. Non-residents are permitted to hunt only on private reserves.",
      "A spokesman for Trump said the hunting party had permits and were hunting in a legally allowed area \u201cwhere there were countless other hunting groups present.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile it\u2019s unclear whether this single duck was unintentionally shot by someone in Don\u2019s hunting group, another hunting group or killed in a different manner and retrieved by the group's hunting dog, Don takes following all rules, regulations and conservation on his hunts very seriously and plans on fully cooperating with any investigation,\" Andy Surabian, spokesman for Trump, said in a statement.",

      "Though militant groups have stopped claiming attacks on polio workers and police escorting them, authorities say Pakistani Taliban and other breakaway factions of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, have been behind such attacks. The TTP is an ally of the Afghan Taliban who seized power in Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif launched the vaccination campaign Sunday when he met with medical staff and representatives of international aid agencies and vowed that Pakistan would win the war against polio. The campaign that began Monday aims to vaccinate 44.2 million children younger than 5 and will continue through next Sunday.",

In severe cases, polio can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis within hours, according to the World Health Organization.",

    "summary": "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says El Salvador&rsquo;s president has offered to accept deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including violent American criminals now imprisoned in the United States",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says El Salvador\u2019s president has offered to accept deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including violent American criminals now imprisoned in the United States",
      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late Monday that El Salvador's president has offered to accept deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including violent American criminals now imprisoned in the United States.",
      "President Nayib Bukele \u201chas agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,\u201d Rubio said at a signing ceremony for an unrelated civil nuclear agreement with El Salvador's foreign minister.",
      "\"He's also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentence in the United States even though they\u2019re U.S. citizens or legal residents,\u201d Rubio said. He had just met with Bukele at his lakeside country house outside San Salvador for several hours.",
      "After Rubio spoke, a U.S. official said the Trump administration had no current plans to try to deport American citizens, but said Bukele's offer was significant. The U.S. government cannot deport American citizens and such a move would be met with significant legal challenges.",
      "Rubio was visiting El Salvador to press a friendly government to do more to meet Trump administration demands for a major crackdown on immigration amid turmoil in Washington over the status of the government\u2019s main foreign development agency.",
      "He arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight with 43 migrants leave from Panama for Colombia. That came a day after Rubio delivered a warning to Panama that unless the government moved immediately to reduce or eliminate China's presence at the Panama Canal, the U.S. would act to do so.",
      "Migration, though, was the main issue of the day, as it will be for the next stops on Rubio's five-nation Central American tour of Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic after Panama and El Salvador.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States and has worked with regional countries to boost immigration enforcement on their borders as well as to accept deportees from the United States.",
      "The agreement Rubio described for El Salvador to accept foreign nationals arrested in the United States for violating U.S. immigration laws is known as a \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement. That would mean the U.S. could deport non-Salvadorean migrants to El Salvador.",
      "Officials have suggested this might be an option for Venezuelan gang members convicted of crimes in the United States should Venezuela refuse to accept them, but Rubio said Bukele's offer was for detainees of any nationality.",
      "Rubio said Bukele then went further and said his country was willing to accept and to jail U.S. citizens or legal residents convicted of and imprisoned for violent crimes.",
      "Human rights activists have warned that El Salvador lacks a consistent policy for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees and that such an agreement might not be limited to violent criminals.",
      "Manuel Flores, the secretary general of the leftist opposition party Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, criticized the \u201csafe third country\u201d plan, saying it would signal that the region is Washington\u2019s \u201cbackyard to dump the garbage.\u201d",
      "The deportation flight Rubio watched being loaded in Panama City was carrying migrants detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department says such deportations send a message of deterrence. The U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets since an agreement was signed to fund them.",
      "Rubio was on the tarmac for the departure of the flight, which was taking 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia. It\u2019s unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation, especially in front of cameras.",
      "\u201cMass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,\u201d Rubio said, speaking afterward in a nearby building. \u201cIt impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it\u2019s not good for anyone.\u201d",
      "Monday\u2019s deportation flight came as Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals from the United States, and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States.",
      "\u201cThis is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd it would have been impossible to do without the strong partnership we have here with our friends and allies in Panama. And we\u2019re going to continue to do it.\u201d",
      "His trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting, but details of those were not immediately available.",
      "While Rubio was out of the country, staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed Monday to stay out of the agency\u2019s Washington headquarters after billionaire Elon Musk announced Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.",
      "Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs shut down. Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.",
      "The change means that USAID is no longer an independent government agency as it had been for decades \u2014 although its new status will likely be challenged in court \u2014 and will be run out of the State Department by department officials.",
      "In his remarks, Rubio stressed that some and perhaps many USAID programs would continue in the new configuration but that the switch was necessary because the agency had become unaccountable to the executive branch and Congress.",
      "On his weekend discussion with Panama's president on the Panama Canal, Rubio said he was hopeful that the Panamanians would heed his and Trump's warnings on China. Panamanians have bristled at Trump's insistence on retaking control of the American-built canal, which the U.S. turned over in 1999, although they have agreed to pull out of a Chinese infrastructure and development initiative.",
      "\u201cI understand that it\u2019s a delicate issue in Panama,\u201d Rubio told reporters in San Salvador. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a hostile and negative relationship with Panama,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we do. And we had a frank and respectful conversation, and I hope it\u2019ll yield fruits and result in the days to come.\u201d",
      "But back in Washington, Trump was less diplomatic, saying: \"China\u2019s involved with the Panama Canal. They won\u2019t be for long and that\u2019s the way it has to be.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe either want it back, or we\u2019re going to get something very strong, or we\u2019re going to take it back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cAnd China will be dealt with.\u201d",
      "As he has in the past, Trump again criticized the Carter administration for having signed a 1970s treaty to cede control of the canal to Panama and said it was a pact that Panama has since \u201ctotally violated.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve agreed to certain things, but I\u2019m not happy with it,\u201d Trump said.",

      "LONDON -- It was quite the journey for such tiny froglets: traveling thousands of miles from the forests of southern Chile to London, carried and brooded inside their fathers' vocal sacs for safety.",
      "London Zoo said Monday that 33 endangered Darwin's frogs, named after scientist Charles Darwin who discovered the species, were born in their new home as part of a rescue mission to save the species from extinction.",
      "Known populations of Darwin's frogs have suffered a 90% decline within a year since a deadly disease known as chytrid fungus arrived in 2023 in their habitat, the Parque Tantauco forests in southern Chile. The fungus has affected hundreds of amphibian species around the world.",

      "A team of conservationists traveled to Chile's forests in October in search of healthy Darwin's frogs free of the infectious disease. They collected 52 frogs, which were then placed in climate-controlled boxes for a 7,000-mile (11,265 kilometers) ride by boat, car and plane to their new home in London.",
      "Of the group, 11 male frogs \u2014 each measuring under 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) \u2014 carried 33 tadpoles that were born at the zoo.",

      "BRUSSELS -- Denmark\u2019s prime minister insisted on Monday that Greenland is not for sale and called for a robust response from her European Union partners should U.S. President Donald Trump press ahead with his threat to take control of the island.",
      "\u201cI will never support the idea of fighting allies. But of course, if the U.S. puts tough terms on Europe, we need a collective and robust response,\u201d Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters in Brussels as EU leaders gathered for defense talks.",
      "Greenland, home to a large U.S. military base, is an autonomous territory of Denmark, a longtime U.S. ally. Last month, Trump left open the possibility that the American military might be used to secure Greenland, as well as the Panama Canal. \u201cWe need Greenland for national security purposes,\u201d he said.",
      "Frederiksen said she has \u201cgreat support\u201d from her EU partners on the fact \u201cthat everybody has to respect the sovereignty of all national states in the world, and that Greenland is today a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It\u2019s part of our territory and it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d",
      "She acknowledged U.S. concerns about security in the Arctic Region, where Russia and China have been increasingly active.",
      "\u201cI totally agree with the Americans that the High North, that the Arctic region is becoming more and more important when we are talking about defense and security and deterrence,\u201d Frederiksen said, adding that the U.S. and Denmark could have \u201cstronger footprints\u201d in Greenland, in security terms.",
      "\u201cThey are already there and they can have more possibilities,\u201d she said, underlining that Denmark itself can also \u201cscale up\u201d its security presence. \u201cIf this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward,\u201d Frederiksen said.",
      "Last week, her government announced a roughly 14.6 billion kroner (nearly $2 billion) agreement with parties including the governments of Greenland and the Faeroe Islands to \u201cimprove capabilities for surveillance and maintaining sovereignty in the region.\u201d",
      "It would include three new Arctic naval vessels, two additional long-range surveillance drones and satellite capacity, the Defense Ministry in Copenhagen said.",
      "Frederiksen's remarks came as EU leaders met for defense talks but with no clear sign yet from Trump about how he intends to try to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. The Europeans fear that any attempt to pull together a quick deal would not be favorable to Ukraine.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte were set to join the bloc\u2019s 27 leaders at a self-styled \u201cretreat\u201d at Egmont Place in the Belgian capital.

      "The meeting comes as Europe\u2019s biggest land conflict since World War II approaches its third anniversary, and with confidence in Trump shaky as he threatens his allies with tariffs. Trump already slapped duties on European steel and aluminum during his first term.",
      "\u201cWe were listening carefully to those words, and of course we are preparing also on our side,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said. But, she underlined, \"there are no winners in trade wars. If \u2026 the U.S. starts a trade war, then the one laughing on the side is China. We are very interlinked.\u201d",

      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist party is eyeing the state legislature election in Delhi where it is in race against a popular regional party that has governed the Indian capital for over a decade",
      "NEW DELHI -- The resurgent Hindu nationalist party of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is eyeing a state legislature election in Delhi where it is looking to unseat the governing movement which has led the Indian capital for over a decade but has recently been embroiled in graft allegations.",
      "Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party, which failed to secure a majority of its own in last year's national election but formed the government with coalition partners, has gained some lost ground by winning two state elections in northern Haryana and western Maharashtra states. It is up against the Aam Aadmi Party, or AAP, led by Arvind Kejriwal, that runs Delhi and has built a huge support base on the back of its popular welfare policies.",
      "Delhi, a city of more than 20 million people, is a federal territory which Modi\u2019s party has not been able to win for over 27 years, despite having a sizeable support base in the capital.",
      "The polls open on Wednesday, with results due on Saturday.",
      "Both Modi and Kejriwal have offered to revamp government schools, free health services and electricity, and a monthly stipend of over 2,000 rupees ($25) to poor women.",
      "Modi's party, in particular, is hoping to better its tally from the previous election after last week's budget that slashed income tax on the salaried middle class, one of its key vote block.",
      "Kejriwal\u2019s party won 62 out of 70 seats in the last election, held in 2020.",
      "\u201cPublicity wise, the BJP seems ahead of the AAP because it has more significant resources,\u201d said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst, who added that it will be difficult for the BJP to dislodge the AAP because of its popularity among voters.",
      "India\u2019s main opposition Congress party is also in the Delhi race, but many poll experts believe it has run a lackluster campaign and is expected to fare poorly.",
      "Claiming himself to be an anti-corruption crusader, Kejriwal is Delhi\u2019s former top elected official and a fierce critic of Modi. He formed the AAP in 2012 after tapping into public anger against the then Congress party government over a series of corruption scandals. His pro-poor policies have focused on fixing state-run schools and providing cheap electricity, free health care and bus transport for women.",
      "Kejriwal was, however, arrested last year along with two key leaders of his party ahead of national elections on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. The accusations have been consistently denied as part of an alleged political conspiracy. The Supreme Court allowed the release of Kejriwal and other ministers on bail.",
      "Kejriwal later relinquished the chief minister\u2019s post to his most senior party leader, Atishi, and said he would submit himself to the court of public opinion.",
      "Opposition parties widely condemned Kejriwal\u2019s arrest, accusing the Modi's government of misusing federal investigation agencies to harass and weaken political opponents, and pointed to several raids, arrests, and corruption investigations of key opposition figures in the months before the national election.",
      "Past voting pattern in the capital shows the distinction voter have made between national and state legislature elections. Since Modi came to power in 2014, his party has often dominated both polls. But in Delhi people have voted differently \u2014 for the AAP in state election and the BJP in national polls.",
      "During election campaigning, Modi\u2019s party reminded voters of graft allegations against Kejriwal, hoping the incumbent party\u2019s corruption allegations will outweigh its popular welfare programs.",
      "The BJP was voted out of power in Delhi in 1998 by the Congress party, which ran the government for 15 years. In the 2015 elections, AAP won a landslide victory by capturing 67 of 70 seats.",
      "Kejriwal's AAP has focused on economic development issues, like health care and education in poll rallies. He has avoided talking about the corruption allegations against him, instead asking voters to reward the party for its track record of delivering better services.",
      "\u201cI am not here for Aam Aadmi Party. I am here for the progress of Delhi. I am here for the progress of your families, and to provide a future for your children,\" Kejriwal told a recent campaign rally.",
      "For some supporters of Kejriwal, the campaign has struck a chord. \u201cAll the allegations (against Kejriwal) are false. Whenever a true leader contests elections, he has to face such struggles. He is with us and he is like our brother,\" said Pooja Lamba, a Delhi homemaker.",

Nevertheless, the risk that he would reoffend was high, the panel found.",

      "Smyth joined the church after fleeing Zimbabwe to South Africa in 2001 following allegations that he had sexually, physically, and psychologically abused over 100 children and men during Christian summer camps, where he volunteered.",
      "Last year, the former Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby resigned following an inquiry that found that he failed to tell police about serial abuse by Smyth when he became aware of it in 2013.",
      "The inquiry found that the Church of England covered up \u201chorrific\u201d abuse by Smyth, with the 251-page report saying he had abused 30 boys and young men in the UK and 85 in Africa over five decades.",
      "Makgoba on Tuesday apologized to members of the church for putting congregants at risk.",
      "\u201cI and the Diocese apologize to our congregants and the wider community that we did not protect people from that risk,\" Makgoba said on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cDespite the efforts of some individuals to bring the abuse to the attention of authorities, the responses by the Church of England and others were wholly ineffective and amounted to a coverup,\" the inquiry said the time."

      "Still, about 2 meters (6.5 feet) of water fell across the state since Saturday, with six months of rain recorded in some areas.

      "Queen Rania of Jordan opened the summit, recalling that the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely ratified human rights convention in history but is hardly enforced on an equal plane.",
      "\u201cIn theory, the global consensus is clear: every right, for every child,\u201d she told the gathering in the Apostolic Palace. \u201cYet, so many children around the world are excluded from its promise -\u2013 particularly in warzones.

He also has not ruled out using military force to seize control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark.",

      "PARIS -- French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou used special executive powers Monday to get the country's 2025 budget approved without a vote by lawmakers, and now faces a no-confidence motion that threatens the survival of his 6-week-old government.",
      "Opposition parties were expected to file the no-confidence motion later Monday, and a vote is expected in the National Assembly on Wednesday.",
      "That may provide France with a budget at last, or send the country into new political and economic turmoil. Bayrou's survival depends on how many parties agree to support the motion. He is France\u2019s fourth prime minister in little over a year.",
      "French politics have been in disarray since President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections last year that left no party with a majority in parliament. With one of the world's biggest economies, France\u2019s failure to pass a budget has worried investors and hurt the 20-country eurozone.",
      "France is also under pressure from the European Union to reduce its huge debt and deficit.",
      "For Macron, this is a particularly bad time for France to be weakened. U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening new tariffs on the EU and making designs on Greenland, and Russia is growing more emboldened in Ukraine.",
      "After weeks of debate, French lawmakers on Monday debated the conclusions of a joint Parliamentary committee on the state budget.",
      "The previous government collapsed over its budget plans, which included slashing 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raising taxes by 20 billion euros. Bayrou\u2019s revised version has addressed some concerns from opposition lawmakers.",
      "The joint committee has kept an extra tax on large companies while increasing a tax on financial transactions. And Bayrou agreed not to cut 4,000 jobs in national education as previously envisaged.",
      "But opposition parties said that wasn't enough. So Bayrou, who has no majority at the National Assembly, used a constitutional tool known as Article 49.3 that allows the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote. It is rarely used for a budget.",
      "The hard-left party France Unbowed said it would file a no-confidence motion over Bayrou\u2019s move.",
      "To pass, a no-confidence motion needs at least half the votes in the 577-seat Assembly. France Unbowed's measure will likely have the support of Communist and Green lawmakers, but that\u2019s not enough.",
      "The vote of the Socialists could be decisive. The Socialist Party said Monday that it would not vote to bring down the Bayrou government because \u201cit\u2019s time to give France a budget.\u201d Yet some lawmakers may not follow the party\u2019s instructions.",
      "Far-right leader Marine Le Pen was instrumental in ousting the previous government. Her National Rally party has the largest single group in France\u2019s lower house of parliament, and said it will give its lawmakers instructions Wednesday on how to vote.",
      "If Bayrou is voted out, Macron would face the prospect of finding a new prime minister once again and forming another government capable of finding consensus on the budget.",
      "Something similar happened in December, when a confidence motion triggered by budget disputes forced conservative Prime Minister Michel Barnier to resign.",
      "Barnier was named to solve the political impasse created by last year\u2019s elections. But his proposed austerity budget only deepened divisions.",
      "Macron then tapped the veteran centrist Bayrou in the hope he could bridge divides.",
      "Unlike Barnier, Bayrou has held intense negotiations with the Socialists aimed at reaching a non-aggression deal over the budget under which they would agree not to undercut each other."

      "Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said Monday that the 27% tariff to be applied on Mexican goods was aimed at boosting local manufacturers.

      "International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi also said there were \u201ca few occasions where we had close calls\u201d with regard to Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia which is under Russian occupation.

    "story": [
      "U.S. President Donald Trump says he will cut all funding to South Africa over what he called a massive human rights violation",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump said he will cut all funding to South Africa over what he called a human rights violation, a move that reflects Elon Musk's repeated and false claims over the years that authorities in his country of birth are anti-white and even encouraging the killing of white people.",
      "Trump said on Sunday that \u201cterrible things are happening in South Africa. The leadership is doing some terrible things, horrible things\u201d without providing specifics. He said \u201cthey're taking away land, they're confiscating land, and actually they're doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d",
      "While it wasn't clear exactly what Trump was referring to, he appeared to be referencing a new law in South Africa that gives the government powers in some instances to expropriate land from people.",
      "Musk, a close Trump ally and head of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, has highlighted that law in recent social media posts and cast it as a threat to South Africa's white minority.",
      "Many South Africans viewed Trump's sudden pledge to punish America's biggest trade partner in Africa as surprising and at least partly influenced by billionaire Tesla owner Musk, who was born in the South African capital of Pretoria but left for Canada after he completed high school.",
      "The Expropriation Act was signed into law by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last month and allows the government to take land in specific instances where it is not being used, or where it would be in the public interest if it is redistributed.",
      "It aims to address some of the wrongs of South Africa's racist apartheid era, when Black people had land taken away from them and were forced to live in areas designated for non-whites.",
      "Ramaphosa responded to Trump's comments Monday by saying the U.S. president was wrong and no land had been confiscated, and said he looked forward to \"engaging\" with the Trump administration over the issue. The South African government said that the U.S. didn't understand the law.",
      "Musk accused Ramaphosa's government in 2023 of allowing a \u201cgenocide\u201d to happen over the killings of some white farmers, which have happened for years.",
      "While the killings have been condemned, experts have said there is no evidence of any genocide and they are part of South Africa's extremely high violent crime rates and mostly related to farm robberies. Crime affects all South Africans, and the country has an average of 70 homicides a day, with the vast majority of the victims Black.",
      "Musk also waded into the issue Monday by replying to a post by Ramaphosa's official account on X with the question: \u201cWhy do you have openly racist ownership laws?\u201d",
      "Again, it remains unclear exactly what Musk was referring to, but his comments seemed to allude to South Africa's affirmative action laws in business that are designed to advance opportunities for Blacks and other racial groups who were disadvantaged under apartheid. Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has been denied a license in South Africa because it doesn't meet affirmative action criteria.",
      "More than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule, white people in South Africa generally still have a much higher standard of living than Black people.",
      "That's reflected in poverty statistics, with a 2021 study by the South African Human Rights Commission finding that 64% of Black people were living in poverty against 1% of white people. When it comes to land, white people make up about 7% of the population of 62 million and own around 70% of land, according to the most recent land audit, although that share has decreased since apartheid.",
      "Still, the new land law has drawn criticism even from inside the country, with civic groups that represent the interests of whites and some South African political parties saying they will challenge it in court because it allows land to be taken without compensation in some cases.",
      "While South Africa has deep socioeconomic problems and a damaging legacy from nearly a half-century of apartheid, it is regarded as a stable democracy and is not a country brimming with racial tensions as it is sometimes portrayed to be.",
      "Trump said on his Truth Social platform that South Africa was \u201ctreating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,\u201d again without elaborating, and he would stop all future funding while the U.S. investigated.",
      "That threatens around $400 million a year in aid the U.S. gives to South Africa, most of it for the country's HIV/AIDS program through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR. South Africa's U.S. funding through PEPFAR was already threatened by Trump's global aid freeze.",
      "South Africa was also concerned that Trump might remove it from the AGOA trade agreement, which gives South Africa and other African nations tariff-free access to the U.S. market. Trump has already imposed tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico \u2014 although on Monday he said he is pausing his tariffs planned for Mexico by one month.",

      "NEW YORK -- For Elon Musk fans, it\u2019s the half a trillion-dollar bet.",
      "That is how much the stock market value of Tesla has rocketed since the presidential election, a vertiginous climb uninterrupted in recent days despite a disappointing financial report that would have sunk the stock of nearly any other company.",
      "Investors are wagering that President Donald Trump will help Musk\u2019s company more than hurt it with his plans to take an axe to reams of Washington regulations and wield tariffs to get his way with key trading partners.",
      "Less regulation? Fantastic. Trade war? No biggie.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a golden age for Tesla and Musk,\u201d said Wedbush Securities financial analyst Dan Ives, adding after an investor conference call Wednesday, \u201cThis is the bullish I\u2019ve ever heard Musk.\u201d",
      "Investing in Tesla has long been a gamble. Odds were against Musk creating a successful electric car company, never mind growing it to become the world\u2019s most valuable automaker \u2013 and in the process making himself the world\u2019s richest man. But this latest bet seems particularly risky.",
      "Musk says the true value of company lays in a future of Tesla robots, thousands of them possibly by the end of the year, and in unsupervised, driverless vehicles. He promised in Tesla's investor conference call to start offering such robotaxis in June in Austin, Texas, and across the country by the end of next year.",
      "Speeding all that along will be Trump, or so the story goes, who has given Musk an office in the White House and made him the head of the new Department of Government Efficiency tasked with shrinking the size of the government.",
      "Trump\u2019s new transportation secretary, who can have a big impact on Tesla, is mostly sticking to the script. Sean Duffy has promised to cut excessive regulation on automakers as well as to come up with a single set of federal rules on self-driving technology to replace a patchwork of state-by-state ones that Musk has blasted for holding back development.",
      "Perhaps more importantly, Trump has softened his stance toward China, a big market for Tesla, hitting the country with an additional 10% tariffs starting Saturday, and not the 60% he threatened on the campaign trail. Still, Trump's decision to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as China, should affect Tesla. Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said last week the company should feel an impact to its business because it sources parts from around the globe.",
      "Trump has also vowed to do other things that will hurt Musk\u2019s business.",
      "Tesla sources many of its parts from abroad and so Trump\u2019s decision to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will hit the company hard if they stick.",
      "Trump also has vowed to eliminate a $7,500 federal tax rebate designed to get people to buy electric vehicles. He\u2019ll also lower emission standards, a potential blow to Tesla\u2019s business of selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to car makers that pollute more and fall short of the requirements. Tesla sold $692 million of these credits i n the last three months of 2024, a 60% jump from a year ago, revenue that nearly all flows straight to Tesla\u2019s bottom line.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear whether the Trump administration will hold off on investigations into Tesla, in particular a technology the company calls Full Self-Driving, a misnomer because the vehicles could require human intervention at any moment. In October, the transportation department\u2019s auto safety regulator, the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration, launched the latest of several probes into the technology after getting reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "Transportation Secretary Duffy promised senators at a hearing earlier this month that he would let the Tesla investigations follow the facts \u2014 specifically vowing to buck any political pressure to go easy on the self-described \u201cfirst buddy\u201d of the president.",
      "Musk will need all the regulatory relief and other goodies from Trump that he can get.",
      "In early January, Tesla said sales dropped in 2024, a first in more than a dozen years, as rivals such as BMW, Volkswagen and China\u2019s BYD come out with competitive EVs and steal market share.",
      "Then on Wednesday, Tesla reported revenue, profits and other key measures of financial health for the last quarter of 2024 all fell short of what analysts had expected. The stock climbed higher anyway.",
      "\u201cThings that would hurt other automakers,\u201c marvels Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein, \u201ddon\u2019t seem to impact Tesla.\u201d",
      "Besides the business, Tesla shareholders must always keep one eye on the CEO himself. Lately, that\u2019s meant weighing Musk\u2019s foray into politics.",
      "In Europe, a major market for his cars, Musk has endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany and called British Prime Minister Keir Starmer an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d who is running a \u201ctyrannical police state.\u201d",
      "On Inauguration Day in the U.S., Musk made a straight-arm gesture during a speech that many interpreted as Nazi salute. He scoffed at the criticism, but the backlash was fierce nonetheless. In Germany, an image of Musk making the salute was projected onto his massive Tesla factory outside Berlin in protest. In Italy, a communist youth group hung an effigy of Musk upside down in the same square in Milan where the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini was strung upside down, too.",
      "\u201cHow many of these Tesla buyers agree with Musk?\u201d said Felipe Munoz, a senior analyst at auto researcher Jato Dynamics. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point of alienating potential customers.\u201d",
      "Musk also risks turning off regulators in Europe, who he hopes will soon approve the use of Full Self-Driving there.",
      "If investors start losing faith in Musk, it\u2019s a long way down.",
      "The run-up in Tesla stock alone since the election amounts to more than the annual economic output of 160 countries. Tesla\u2019s total market value has grown to about $1.3 trillion, more than the worth of General Motors, BMW, Ford, Ferrari, Porsche and a dozen other top car makers combined.",
      "Musk thinks that, if anything, the stock should be higher.",
      "\u201cI see a path for Tesla being the most valuable company in the world \u2014 by far, not even close,\u201d he said Wednesday, before doubling down on that statement. \u201cThere is a path where Tesla is worth more than the next five companies combined.\u201d",
      "That would mean surpassing the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia. Tesla is currently the seventh-most valuable company in the S&P 500.",
      "Wedbush's Ives, the \u201cgolden age\u201d analyst, agrees the stock can only go up from here.",
      "\u201cThe bet for the ages that Musk made was on Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cMusk is going to have massive impact on deregulation in the beltway \u2014 and that is worth a trillion dollars.\u201d"

      "The leader of Canada\u2019s most populous province of Ontario says he\u2019s ripping up a contract with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink internet services in response to Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs on Canada, as well as banning American companies from provincial contracts",
      "TORONTO -- The leader of Canada's most populous province of Ontario said Monday he's ripping up a contract with Elon Musk's Starlink internet services in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Canada.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who said he is also banning American companies from provincial contracts, signed a $100-million Canadian (US$68 million) with Musk's company in November to deliver high-speed internet to remote residents in rural and northern Ontario.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be ripping up the province\u2019s contract with Starlink. Ontario won\u2019t do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy,\u201d Ford said.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is the only person to be blamed. Maybe Elon Musk can call his buddy? This is one of the ramifications.\u201d",
      "Ford said U.S.-based businesses will lose out on \u201ctens of billions of dollars\u201d in new revenues as a result of Ontario\u2019s response.",
      "\u201cWe just aren't going to be using American companies,\u201d Ford said. \u201cAnd no matter if we are building a hospital, if we're building anything, if we're building a dog house I want to make sure we are using Ontario steel, Canadian products, Canadian wood, Ontario wood, anything.",
      "\"I don't care if it's a toothpick. We need to purchase from Canada and Ontario.\u201d",
      "Ontario and other provinces already planned to remove American liquor brands from government store shelves. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario sells nearly $1 billion worth of American wine, beer, spirits and seltzers every year, Ford pointed.",
      "\u201cCanada didn\u2019t start this fight with the U.S., but you better believe we\u2019re ready to win it,\u201d said Ford, who called an election for his province last week.",
      "Ford said he wants a four year mandate that outlasts Trump's term. \u201cHe wants to come after us?\u201d he asked. \u201cI've yet to hear one American citizen say Canada is the problem.\u201d",
      "Canada and Mexico ordered retaliatory tariffs on American goods in response to sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump. Ford also encouraged businesses to put the Canadian flag on products so Canadians know what to buy.",
      "\"This is a tax on American citizens. That\u2019s what Donald Trump is doing to his own people,\u201d said Ford, who described Musk as part of the Trump team \u201cthat wants to destroy families incomes, destroy businesses. He want to take food off the table of hard working people and I\u2019m not going to tolerate it.\u201d",
      "Trump responded Sunday, criticizing Canada\u2019s trade surplus with the United States and contending that without that surplus, \u201cCanada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada \u2014 AND NO TARIFFS!\u201d",

      "With his 70th birthday looming on this year's horizon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates looked inward to open a window into the man behind Windows and other seminal software that turned the personal computer into a household staple.",
      "Gates focuses on the first quarter-century of his life in \u201cSource Code: My Beginnings,\u201d the opening installment in a retrospective trilogy about an insouciant, impertinent and often misunderstood kid who grew up to become a polarizing technology titan before morphing into an influential philanthropist.",
      "In \u201cSource Code,\u201d Gates explores how his childhood quirks, upbringing, friendships and experiences coalesced into shaping his own internal operating system. Along the way, he dissects his brain's unusual wiring, delves into the emotional trauma of his best friend dying while they were both in high school, and revisits the birth of Traf-O-Data, a trailblazing startup that he launched in Albuquerque, New Mexico with another childhood friend, Paul Allen.",
      "Traf-O-Data, conceived to create software for the groundbreaking Altair computer made Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, became Microsoft in 1975 \u2014 a year it booked $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen were making $9 per hour.",
      "By 1977, Microsoft had become successful enough to embolden Gates to drop out of Harvard University. In 1979, he had decided to move Microsoft to the Seattle area where he grew up. Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO 25 years ago, the Windows operating system and other software created under his reign remain the main pillar in a company that now generates $212 billion in annual revenue, boasts a $3.1 trillion market value, and accounts for most of Gates' $100 billion personal fortune.",
      "\u201cSource Code\u201d ends with Gates's drive back to Seattle in 1979, meaning it doesn't touch upon his 1994 marriage to Melinda French, nor their 2021 divorce.",
      "\u201cI am being reflective, which is not my normal mode, but it\u2019s kind of time,\u201d Gates said during an interview about the book with The Associated Press. \u201cAs we went back and got teacher\u2019s comments or people I worked with at Harvard, it was fascinating. I had confused myself into thinking I got straight A\u2019s in ninth grade.\u201d",
      "That might not sound like much of a revelation, but it was a surprise to the cerebral Gates, who paints himself in the book as a \u201cbratty smartass\u201d prone to dismissively sneering, \u201cThat's the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d about remarks that seemed nonsensical to him.",
      "Gate's self-portrait is that of a nerd nicknamed \u201cTrey\u201d by his card-playing grandmother because he was the third male on this father's side of the family to be named Bill. He was a pipsqueak who had difficulty making friends and preferred living in his own head before he discovered computers, which became like slot machines that rewarded him for writing elegant lines of code.",
      "When he did talk, the young Gates rocked back and forth like a metronome setting a rhythm for his brain \u2014 a habit that surfaced during parts of his 45-minute interview with the AP.",
      "\u201cIt was a little weird because it was hard to direct my attention,\u201d Gates recalled during the interview. \u201cI had one year in school where they said, \u2018Oh we should put you ahead a couple grades.\u2019 And then another time, they said, \u2018No, we should hold you back.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Well make up your mind.\u2019 They were a little confounded.\u201d",
      "Although he didn't realize it as a boy, Gates has no doubt he was and still is neurodivergent who channeled that anomaly into learning to program computers at the right time in the right place with the patient support of his late parents (the book is dedicated to them, along with his sister, Kristi and Libby).",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that there was this idea that there are kids that have this kind of unique ability to concentrate but less social skills. I certainly would be included in that,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI encourage people who have strengths and deficits to kind of map their ambition onto something that plays to their strengths. Being able to think just about programming and how you do it better ended up being invaluable for me.\u201d",
      "Gates also had the advantage of growing up in a family that could afford to pay for him to attend a private high school in Seattle. Still, that privilege didn't insulate him from the trauma he experienced when his best friend, Kent Evans, died in a mountain climbing accident in May 1972 \u2014 a year before they were going to graduate.",
      "Evans' death occurred while he and Gates were preparing to spend much of the summer working on a program for their school, but what hurt far more was the loss of someone who understood him and helped give him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life.",
      "\u201cI had no notion of a friend just being gone. It was the only negative thing in my childhood,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt shapes you, that someone can just disappear \u2014 somebody you loved and would have done things with. He would have been part of whatever I ended up going on to do. I give Kent credit, along with Paul (Allen), for setting the direction that I ended up going down.\u201d",
      "Evans' death provided the impetus for Gates to reconnect with Allen, who was already attending college, to help him with his programming projects. Allen, three years older than Gates and a passionate fan of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, did more than just help with the coding. He also offered Gates some LSD in an attempt to lure his partner down a more psychedelic path.",
      "Gates rebuffed Allen at first but decided to drop acid with a group of high school friends shortly before his 1973 graduation, according to the book.",
      "It wasn't a pleasant experience, a reaction that Gates thought might have been related to the dental surgery he underwent the day after his LSD trip. He tried LSD again with Allen in October 1974 while they were watching an episode of the old \"Kung Fu\" series on TV, and decided he would be better off without psychedelic drugs even though Apple co-founder Steve Jobs contended Microsoft would have created better products had Gates taken more acid.",
      "\"I thought maybe I\u2019d seem cool if I took it, but that didn\u2019t happen,\" Gates said during the interview. \u201cI would say Steve was definitely more hip than I was. He took a lot more acid than I did. He had a sense of style. I had some charisma in terms of motivating engineers and saying this great thing (with personal computers) would happen, but Steve had natural speaking and charisma capabilities, even beyond mine. So I always envied him for the things he did.\"",
      "Gates' mind is now being blown by the recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology being planted into Microsoft's software as part of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.",
      "\u201cWhen I finally see ChatGPT-4, where the OpenAI guys show me a very early version, I am just blown away completely,\u201d Gates said. He views AI as an \u201camazing and scary\u201d technology that should be rigorously monitored.",
      "\u201cYou should be nervous. We have to acknowledge that AI is almost uniquely dangerous because it\u2019s unbounded in terms of how good it will get and it\u2019s happening within a generation,\u201d Gates said. \u201cHopefully, the politicians and the technologists will share with each other, and we can shape this thing. We better get on top of that now.\u201d",
      "If nothing else, Gates is hoping \u201cSource Code\u201d will help people see a more human side of him, even if he might never been seen as the cultural tastemaker that Jobs was.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was completely uncool,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut once I got going on Microsoft, I was willing to be pretty monomaniacal. Even people I competed with found it very intimidating how focused I was. I really didn\u2019t goof off in my 20s because my whole thing was having Microsoft move at full speed.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Gates will delve deeper into the monomania that made him so rich, famous and sometimes reviled in the next book about his life \u2014 an installment that he says won't be done until sometime in 2027, at the earliest."

      "In the hills of Kentucky where most of the world\u2019s bourbon supply is crafted, a new trade war would feel like an aching hangover that won\u2019t go away",
      "LAWRENCEBURG, Ky. -- In the rolling hills of Kentucky where most of the world's bourbon supply is crafted, the prospect of a new trade war feels like an aching hangover that won't go away.",
      "Kentucky bourbon producers again find themselves in the crosshairs as a target for retaliation after President Donald Trump ordered new tariffs on U.S. neighbors Canada and Mexico. On Monday, Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum put their planned tariffs on hold for a month to give time for further negotiations.",
      "American whiskey exports slumped badly amid an earlier trade dispute during Trump's first term.",
      "Canada, a key export market for American spirits, responded to this latest outbreak of trade warfare by initially ordering tariffs on American imports including beverages starting Tuesday. Some authorities in the provinces of Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Manitoba and Nova Scotia planned to remove American liquor brands from government store shelves.",
      "The latest back-and-forth is a sobering prospect for Kentucky bourbon producers and their supporters. The bourbon industry pumps $9 billion into the Bluegrass State\u2019s economy each year, creating more jobs and attracting more tourists than ever before, according to a study released last year. Kentucky distillers produce 95% of the global bourbon supply, according to the Kentucky Distillers\u2019 Association.",
      "Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear warned that tariffs will hurt working families in a state that voted overwhelmingly last November to return Trump to the White House. The pain won't be limited to distilleries, but will include every segment contributing to bourbon production, said Beshear, who is widely seen by political observers as a potential candidate for president in 2028.",
      "\u201cA state that voted for this president by more than 30 points is going to feel the impact of these actions. Think about the farmers that support the industry. The people in the bottling plants and the cooperages. These are our families, our neighbors,\u201d Beshear said in a recent social media post, referring to cooperages where barrels are made.",
      "Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, whose district spans the heart of Kentucky bourbon production country, remained supportive of Trump amid the uncertainty hanging over the industry.",
      "\u201cOther nations have forgotten that the United States is the world\u2019s superpower, and under President Trump\u2019s leadership, they are quickly remembering that we will no longer be taken advantage of,\" Barr said in a statement Monday.",
      "Barr noted that discussions were continuing on the trade front and said he was committed to protecting the bourbon industry.",
      "\u201cOur distilleries are not just a proud part of our state\u2019s heritage but also a vital engine of jobs and economic growth,\u201d he said. \"I will continue to advocate for our bourbon producers to ensure they are not unfairly impacted as we take necessary steps to safeguard America\u2019s economic interests.\u201d",
      "The industry is hoping that cooler heads will prevail. Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, urged the U.S. and Canada to reach an agreement that enables the spirits industries in both countries to thrive. Many producers are boxed in by the tariffs, he said.",
      "\u201cSome spirits are recognized as \u2018distinctive products\u2019 by the U.S. and Canada and can only be made in their designated countries, such as bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey in the U.S. and Canadian Whisky in Canada,\u201d Swonger said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, the production of these products cannot simply be moved to another country or region.\u201d",
      "American whiskey producers faced headwinds even before the new trade dispute. It comes as the industry has massive inventories of aging whiskeys that will someday reach the market. In Kentucky, a record 14.3 million barrels of bourbon were aging, the Kentucky Distillers\u2019 Association said recently. That inventory is awaiting bottling at a time when younger adults appear to be drinking less alcohol.",
      "The biggest threat could be looming overseas, where the European Union is set to reinstate tariffs on American whiskey at a whopping 50% rate in late March if nothing is done to head it off. Trump told reporters Sunday that import taxes will \u201cdefinitely happen\u201d with the European Union and possibly with the United Kingdom as well. The return of tariffs in the biggest export market for American whiskey would be devastating, Swonger has said."

      "TOKYO -- The conviction of a former American Nissan executive for helping fugitive former Chairman Carlos Ghosn hide income was upheld by a Japanese appeals court Tuesday, which also rejected prosecutors' bid to overturn his acquitals on other counts.",
      "Greg Kelly, a lawyer and former executive vice president at Nissan Motor Corp, was convicted in 2022 of charges related to only one of eight years during which prosecutors said he under-reported Ghosn's income. Kelly, who received a 6-month sentence suspended for three years and was allowed to return to Tennessee, did not attend the hearing.",
      "Yoichi Kitamura, Kelly\u2019s attorney, said he will appeal to the Japanese Supreme Court.",
      "Prosecutors, who sought to overturn Kelly\u2019s acquitals for the other seven years, declined to comment. Both sides have 15 days to appeal.",
      "The latest ruling means the six-year battle over the alleged scheme to hide Ghosn\u2019s pay continues.",
      "Ghosn, who became chairman of Nissan after years working in alliance partner Renault, is widely credited with turning around the Japanese carmaker. He was hailed as a business genius until his relationship with the company broke down for reasons that analysts say are related to his foreign management style in an old-fashioned Japanese company.",
      "Prosecutors and the company said that after the board cut his pay by nearly half, he conspired with Kelly and other company officials to secure secret promises of future compensation.",
      "Ghosn and Kelly were arrested in late 2018 in separate but coordinated operations when they returned to Japan for meetings at Nissan.",
      "Ghosn was charged with underreporting his compensation and with breach of trust. He fled to Lebanon while out on bail in December 2019, hiding in a box for musical instruments carried by two Americans who were later extradited from the U.S., found guilty and served nearly two years in Japan.",
      "Ghosn, who says he is innocent, is unlikely to ever stand trial as Lebanon has no extradition agreement with Japan.",
      "Kelly has repeatedly said he was merely working for Nissan\u2019s interests, and the issue should have been sorted out in a board room, not a courtroom.",
      "Kelly still faces a civil lawsuit filed by Nissan, alleging 4 billion yen ($26 million) in damages. Nissan, based in the port city of Yokohama, south of Tokyo, acknowledged the case is ongoing but declined to comment.",
      "Nissan, having sunk into losses over the last quarter amid drooping sales, is in talks with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co. to integrate their business through a joint holding company.",
      "The Ghosn debacle has long been seen in Japan as a reflection of the difficulties in forging international business alliances.",
      "In Japan, less than 1% of criminal cases results in verdicts of innocence, according to the Japan Federation of Bar Associations.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday agreed to a 30-day pause on his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada as America's two largest trading partners took steps to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking.",

      "\u201cI am very pleased with this initial outcome, and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured,\u201d Trump posted on social media. \u201cFAIRNESS FOR ALL!\u201d",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted Monday afternoon on X that the pause would occur \u201cwhile we work together,\u201d saying that his government would name a fentanyl czar, list Mexican cartels as terrorist groups and launch a \u201cCanada-U.S. Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money laundering.\u201d",

      "Trump on Saturday had directed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, with another 10% tariff on Canadian oil, natural gas and electricity. The U.S. president had repeatedly previewed these moves, yet they still managed to shock many investors, lawmakers, businesses and consumers.",

      "China says the U.S. must hold itself to account instead of \u201cthreatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said. \u201cThe United States needs to view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way ...

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 22:42:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Most countries in fast-growing Southeast Asia are looking to develop nuclear energy in their quest for cleaner and more reliable energy",
    "story": [
      "Most countries in fast-growing Southeast Asia are looking to develop nuclear energy in their quest for cleaner and more reliable energy",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Southeast Asia's only nuclear power plant, completed four decades ago in Bataan, about 40 miles from the Philippine capital Manila, was built in the 1970s but left idle due to safety concerns and corruption. It has never produced a single watt of energy.",
      "Now the Philippines and other countries in fast-growing Southeast Asia are looking to develop nuclear energy in their quest for cleaner and more reliable energy. Nuclear energy is viewed by its proponents as a climate solution since reactors don\u2019t emit the plant-warming greenhouses gases released by burning coal, gas or oil. Advances in technology have helped reduce the risks from radiation, making nuclear plants safer, cheaper to build and smaller.",
      "\u201cWe see multiple signs of a new era in nuclear power across the world,\u201d said Faith Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, adding that it expects 2025 to be a historical high for nuclear-generated electricity because of new plants, new national plans and interest in smaller nuclear reactors.",
      "Nuclear energy has been used for decades in wealthier nations like the U.S., France and Japan. It produces about 10% of all electricity generated worldwide, with 413 gigawatts of capacity operating in 32 countries, according to the IEA. That is more than African's entire generating capacity. The IEA says construction of new nuclear power plants needs to \u201caccelerate significantly\u201d in this decade to meet global targets for ending emissions of greenhouse gases.",
      "Southeast Asia will account for a fourth of global energy demand growth between now and 2035, and fossil fuels account for most of the region's energy capacity. Many countries in the region are showing interest in building nuclear power plants \u2014 which typically produce one gigawatt of power per plant \u2014 to help clear their smoggy skies and boost capacity.",
      "Indonesia plans 20 nuclear power plants. A Korean company is assessing restarting the mothballed Philippine plant. Vietnam has revived nuclear plans, and Malaysia\u2019s future plans include nuclear energy. Singapore signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the U.S. last year, and Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar have shown interest in nuclear power.",
      "But nuclear power plants are expensive, take years to build and require a long time to become profitable. Vietnam suspended a nuclear project in 2016 after costs soared to $18 billion, but on Jan. 14, it signed a deal with Russia on atomic energy cooperation.",
      "International financing for nuclear energy is becoming more available, said Henry Preston, a United Kingdom-based communications manager for the World Nuclear Association, noting that 14 major financial institutions endorsed a goal for tripling global nuclear energy capacity by 2050 at the latest Climate Week NYC.",
      "Financing sources are still limited, though. The World Bank does not fund any nuclear energy development projects.",
      "\u201cWe hear the call from some stakeholders to explore nuclear power to decarbonize energy and improve energy supply reliability,\" a World Bank spokesperson said in a recent written response to questions from The Associated Press. \"We continue to have conversations with our board, management, and external stakeholders to understand the facts. Any reconsideration of our position is ultimately a decision for our member countries.\"",
      "Developing robust nuclear energy policies and regulations, now lacking in many countries, could catalyze more funding by reassuring investors, Preston said.",
      "Technological advances are making nuclear power more affordable, experts say.",
      "Small modular reactors, which advocates say can generate up to roughly one-third the amount of power of a traditional reactor, can be built faster and at lower costs than large power reactors, scaling to fit the needs of a particular location. Advocates say they are safer due to simpler designs, lower core power, and more coolant, giving operators more time to respond in case of accidents.",
      "Critics question how inexpensive the technology might be since smaller reactors have not been widely commercially deployed, said Putra Adhiguna of the Jakarta-based think tank Energy Shift Institute.",
      "The small modular reactors already operating are run by state-owned entities that aren\u2019t transparent about performance or costs. The cost of the first such reactor that was to be commercially deployed in the U.S. inflated by about half before it was cancelled, he said. The Idaho-based project had a target of delivering 40 years of electricity at $55 per megawatt-hour, but project costs climbed to $89 per MWh, according to a report by The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Nuclear disasters dimmed earlier enthusiasm for nuclear power in Southeast Asia. Ukraine\u2019s 1986 Chernobyl disaster was a factor behind the decision to shelve the project in the Philippines. Meltdowns in 2011 at the Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan, following a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami also raised worries, leading Thailand to halt its nuclear power plans. In 2018, Malaysia\u2019s then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad cited such disasters when deciding against using nuclear energy.",
      "Some other challenges remain. Markets for nuclear technologies remain concentrated in a few countries \u2014 Russia controls roughly 40% of the world's supply of enriched uranium \u2014 and this is a \u201c\u201crisk factor for the future,\u201d said an IEA report. It added that safely disposing of spent fuel and other radioactive waste is essential to gain public acceptance of nuclear power.",
      "For countries like Vietnam, a lack of trained engineers and scientists is also a big obstacle. It estimates that it will need around 2,400 trained personnel to revive its nuclear program.",
      "\u201cThis is not just about the program but about building a nuclear power ecosystem and technology for the future,\u201d the state-run VN Express cited Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyen Hong Dien as saying.",

      "European Union leaders are grappling with how to respond to the United States as it appears determined to start a trade war or even seize part of their territory",
      "BRUSSELS -- After three years spent trying to deter Russia from destroying Ukraine, European Union leaders grappled on Monday with how to respond to a major ally who appears determined to start a trade war or even seize part of their territory.",
      "It would \u201cbe a cruel paradox if, during the time of this direct Russian threat and Chinese expansion,\u201d the EU and the United States might end up in a \u201cconflict among allies,\" said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose country currently holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency.",
      "Since taking office last month, U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on EU imports and refused to rule out military force to take control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark.",
      "Trump has also mystified Europeans by showing little sign of how he intends to end the war in Ukraine within six months as promised, let alone in a day, as he boasted while campaigning last year.",
      "\u201cWe have to do everything to avoid this totally unnecessary and stupid tariff war or trade war,\u201d the Polish prime minister told reporters in Brussels, where EU leaders met for talks on boosting and improving military spending and ramping up Europe\u2019s defense industry.",
      "Tusk said Trump\u2019s threats amount to \u201ca serious test\u201d of European unity, and \u201cin a very strange context, because it\u2019s the first time where we have such a problem among allies.\u201d",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU is \u201ca power that stands its ground\u201d and that if hit with tariffs, the 27-nation bloc \u201cwould have to make itself respected.\u201d He said Trump\u2019s threats are \u201cpushing Europeans to be more united, more active in addressing their collective security challenges.\u201d",
      "Trump slapped tariffs on European steel and aluminum during his first term, and EU leaders have already been in contact with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau since Canada imposed retaliatory duties on U.S. goods in response to a 25% tariff levied by Trump. The U.S. president later on Monday agreed to a 30-day pause on his tariff threat as America\u2019s two largest trading partners took steps to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen underlined that ties between the bloc and the United States are part of \u201cour most consequential relationship. It is fundamental to promoting peace, security and prosperity.\u201d",
      "But she warned that \u201cthere are clearly new challenges and growing uncertainty\u201d and the EU stands ready to defend itself. \u201cWhen targeted unfairly or arbitrarily, the European Union will respond firmly,\u201d von der Leyen told reporters after the meeting.",
      "Meanwhile, Denmark\u2019s prime minister again insisted on Monday that Greenland isn't for sale and called for a robust response from the EU should U.S. Trump press ahead with his threat to take control of the island.",
      "\u201cI will never support the idea of fighting allies. But of course, if the U.S. puts tough terms on Europe, we need a collective and robust response,\u201d Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters.",
      "Last month, Trump left open the possibility that the American military might be used to secure Greenland, as well as the Panama Canal. \u201cWe need Greenland for national security purposes,\u201d he said.",
      "Frederiksen said she has \u201cgreat support\u201d from her EU partners on the fact \u201cthat everybody has to respect the sovereignty of all national states in the world, and that Greenland is today a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It\u2019s part of our territory and it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d",
      "European Council President Antonio Costa, noting that the EU has stood beside Ukraine in defense of its borders, said of Greenland: \u201cOf course, we will stand also for these principles, all the more so if the territorial integrity of a member state of the European Union is questioned.\u201d",
      "Frederiksen acknowledged U.S. concerns about security in the Arctic Region, where Russia and China have been increasingly active.",
      "\u201cI totally agree with the Americans that the High North, that the Arctic region is becoming more and more important when we are talking about defense and security and deterrence,\u201d Frederiksen said, adding that the U.S. and Denmark could have \u201cstronger footprints\u201d in Greenland, in security terms.",
      "\u201cThey are already there and they can have more possibilities,\u201d she said, underlining that Denmark itself can also \u201cscale up\u201d its security presence. \u201cIf this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward,\u201d Frederiksen said.",
      "Last week, her government announced a roughly 14.6 billion kroner (nearly $2 billion) agreement with parties including the governments of Greenland and the Faeroe Islands to \u201cimprove capabilities for surveillance and maintaining sovereignty in the region.\u201d",
      "It would include three new Arctic naval vessels, two additional long-range surveillance drones and satellite capacity, the Danish Defense Ministry said."

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump has said he will cut all funding to South Africa and has launched an investigation into the country's policies, claiming that a \u201cmassive\" human rights violation against white people is happening over a new land expropriation law.",
      "Trump made the pledge to stop all future funding on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, writing: \u201cSouth Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY.\"",
      "In South Africa, Trump wrote, a \u201dmassive Human Rights VIOLATION, at a minimum, is happening for all to see,\" without giving details or providing evidence.",
      "\u201cThe United States won\u2019t stand for it, we will act,\u201d Trump added. \"Also, I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!\u201d",
      "The South African government said Monday that the Trump administration needed to have a better understanding of the new law, which is meant to help redress the impact of decades of white minority rule in South Africa under the apartheid regime, which ended in 1994. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement that \u201cthe South African government has not confiscated any land.\u201d",
      "No significant action has been taken since the bill was signed into law.",
      "During the apartheid era, land was taken from South Africa\u2019s Black majority, who were forced to live in areas designated for Blacks only. The law has been debated and considered for years as a means, according to the government, to right historic wrongs.",
      "Elon Musk, who is one of Trump\u2019s close allies, was born and raised in South Africa and has also targeted Ramaphosa\u2019s government, previously accusing it of being anti-white and claiming in 2023 that it was allowing a \u201cgenocide\u201d against white farmers.",
      "Experts in South Africa say that while there are cases of white farmers being killed, it's rather a reflection of the country\u2019s desperately high levels of violent crime across the board, which are some of the worst in the world.",
      "In comments to reporters, Trump said Sunday \u201cthey\u2019re taking away land, they\u2019re confiscating land and actually they\u2019re doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d",
      "Trump didn't say exactly which policy he was referring to, or which people were being mistreated. But his comments appeared to be in reaction to the new land law that South Africa passed last month that gives the government scope to acquire land from private parties if it's in the public interest.",
      "The law has been criticized by some interest groups in South Africa as opening the way to seize land from some of the country's white minority. However, the government says people's rights are still protected and land can only be taken in specific circumstances where it's not being used productively and it's in the public interest that the land is redistributed. The race of the land owner isn't a factor.",
      "Ramaphosa's office released a statement Monday, saying: \"The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the constitution.",
      "\u201cSouth Africa, like the United States of America and other countries, has always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d",
      "South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said that the Trump administration should use the investigation it says it is launching \u201cto deepen their understanding of South Africa\u2019s policies as a constitutional democracy. Such insights will ensure a respectful and informed approach to our democratic commitments.\u201d",
      "South Africa is a major beneficiary of U.S. funding under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which contributes around $400 million a year to the country's HIV/AIDS program. That funding was already under threat after Trump's freeze on foreign aid across the world.",
      "Ramaphosa\u2019s office said that there is \u201cno other significant funding that is provided by the United States in South Africa,\u201d although South Africa is Washington's largest trading partner in Africa by some way, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.",
      "A civil society group that represents the interests of South Africa\u2019s Afrikaans-speaking white minority, and which has fought against the new law, said that Trump\u2019s proposed measures would likely hurt the South African people. It said that it was asking Trump to ensure that any \u201cpunitive measures\u201d be targeted at senior government leaders.",
      "Trump has previously been critical of South Africa's government, writing in a social media post during his first term in 2018 that land was being seized from white farms and there was \"large scale killing of farmers.\" Trump said in the same message \u2014 which was roundly criticized in South Africa as making false claims \u2014 that he was ordering then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to investigate.",

      "A new lawsuit alleges for the first time that people died because of the disastrous 2023 East Palestine train derailment",
      "A lawsuit alleging for the first time that people died because of the disastrous 2023 East Palestine train derailment has been filed ahead of Monday's second anniversary of the toxic crash near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border amid a flurry of new litigation.",
      "On Monday, Vice President JD Vance is also expected to visit the small community near the crash site that he used to represent as a senator, along with President Donald Trump's newly confirmed head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin.",
      "The new lawsuit that will be made public later on Monday contains the first seven wrongful death claims filed against Norfolk Southern railroad \u2014 including the death of a 1-week-old baby. It also alleges the railroad and its contractors botched the cleanup while officials at the EPA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on it and failed to warn residents about the health risks. Many of the other parties in the lawsuit cite lingering, unexplained health problems along with concerns something more serious could develop.",
      "\u201cOur clients want truth. They want transparency,\" attorney Kristina Baehr said about the roughly 750 people she represents. \u201cThey want to know what they were exposed to, which has been hidden from them. They want to know what happened and why it happened. And they want accountability.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit provides some examples of the lingering effects on families, but it doesn't include details about the deaths.",
      "At least nine other lawsuits were filed over the past week by individuals and businesses that argue the railroad's greed is to blame for the derailment and the $600 million class-action settlement doesn't offer nearly enough compensation nor sanction the railroad enough to spur them to prevent future derailments. The dollar amount represents only a small fraction of the $12.1 billion in revenue the railroad generated in each of the past two years.",
      "Dozens of rail cars careened off the tracks on Feb. 3, 2023, after an overheating bearing failed. Several of the cars carrying hazardous materials ruptured and spilled their cargo that caught fire. But the disaster was made worse three days later when officials blew open five tank cars filled with vinyl chloride and burned that toxic plastic ingredient because they feared it would explode.",
      "Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board determined the controversial vent and burn operation never needed to be done because there was evidence the railroad ignored that the tank cars were actually starting to cool off and wouldn't explode. The state and local officials who ultimately made the decision to release and burn the vinyl chloride \u2014 generating a towering plume of thick, black smoke that spread over the town and region \u2014 have said they never heard anything suggesting the tank cars wouldn't explode.",
      "\u201cThe EPA had rules to follow and chose not to follow their own rules. The EPA was too busy trying to get the train back on track to protect the people,\u201d Baehr said.",
      "Officials didn't immediately respond to questions about the new lawsuit and separate federal claims that were filed against the EPA and CDC. But in the past the EPA has defended the agency's role in the vent and burn operation by saying they were only there to advise on the potential consequences and measure the resulting contamination.",
      "Baehr said the EPA and CDC's approach to the derailment followed a similar pattern she's seen in other environmental disasters she\u2019s been involved with like the Navy\u2019s toxic spill of jet fuel that contaminated water in Hawaii. She said the agencies tend to downplay the health risks people face. Residents have expressed frustration with the data the EPA discloses and the refusal of the class-action attorneys to reveal what their own testing expert found.",
      "A spokesperson for Norfolk Southern railroad said she couldn\u2019t comment on the pending litigation. The railroad has agreed to the $600 million class-action settlement with residents who lived or worked within 20 miles of the derailment and a separate settlement with the federal government where Norfolk Southern pledged to pay for the entire cleanup and set up funds to pay for medical exams and drinking water monitoring. But the railroad did not admit any wrongdoing in either settlement.",
      "Some people who lived near the derailment have started to receive payments for personal injuries as part of the class-action settlement, but nearly half of the settlement remains on hold as some residents appeal for higher compensation and more information about the contamination.",
      "So the main payments of up to $70,000 per household won\u2019t go out until the appeal is settled.",
      "The nine other new lawsuits included claims by a pipe manufacturer, dog kennels and a winery that the derailment harmed their businesses in various ways, from staffing shortages to having to shut down or move because of customers' concerns.",
      "One business about a quarter of a mile (0.4 kilometers) from the derailment alleged cleanup work created \u201csmoke, debris and odors\u201d that reached their property and led to routine flooding. The dog breeder who owned a business in neighboring Pennsylvania blamed the toxic chemicals for causing the deaths of at least 116 puppies and three adult dogs.",

      "Sri Lanka, which gained independence from Britain in 1948, suffered its worst economic crisis in 2022, forcing the island nation to declare bankruptcy. It also suspended repayments on some $83 billion in domestic and foreign loans amid a foreign exchange crisis that led to a severe shortage of food, medicine, fuel and cooking gas, and hourslong power cuts.",
      "The economic crisis caused political upheaval and finally paved the way for Dissanayake\u2019s party to win power four months ago.",
      "On Tuesday, Dissanayake said he would improve the living standards of all Sri Lankans during his tenure, giving them opportunities to enjoy modern scientific and technological innovations.",

      "Under Dissanayake\u2019s leadership, Sri Lanka is trying to emerge from bankruptcy by restructuring its staggering debt.",

      "In September, Sri Lanka announced it had concluded the debt restructuring process after reaching agreements with bilateral and multilateral creditors and private bond holders.",
      "Sri Lanka is seeking to obtain $17 billion in debt service relief.",
      "Sri Lanka\u2019s crisis was largely the result of economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, along with 2019 terrorism attacks that devastated its important tourism industry. The pandemic also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad."

This led to some confusion about whether Direct File is still available to taxpayers, but the free filing program is still available, at least for the coming tax season.",
      "While Musk\u2019s tweet may have intimated that the group of workers had been eliminated, an individual with knowledge of the IRS workforce said the Direct File program was still accepting tax returns. The individual spoke anonymously with The Associated Press because they were not authorized to talk to the press.",

      "Rubiales is accused of sexual assault for kissing Hermoso, the Spain forward, at the 2023 Women's World Cup final presentation ceremony in Sydney, as well as of coercion for allegedly trying to convince the player to support his version of the kiss. Hermoso says she did not consent to the kiss while Rubiales says it was consensual.",
      "De la Fuente said during his brief appearance in court that he spoke with Hermoso only about two months ago at a gala.

      "De La Fuente last week had his contract with the men's national team extended to 2028.",

      "Prosecutors, Hermoso and the Spain players\u2019 association want Rubiales jailed for two and a half years, fined 50,000 euros ($51,800) for damages, and banned from working as a sports official. They want the other three defendants sentenced to one and a half years in prison.",
      "The trial will continue on Wednesday. It is expected to last at least 10 days. Rubiales attended the first day on Monday.",

      "CLEVELAND -- Star defensive end Myles Garrett has requested a trade from the Cleveland Browns with the hope of better positioning himself to win a Super Bowl, according to a statement he sent to media outlets Monday.",
      "The Browns finished last in the AFC North with a 3-14 record and general manager Andrew Berry had said last week he would not trade Garrett in the offseason, saying he anticipated Garrett going directly from the Browns to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. A Browns spokesman said Monday the team is not entertaining trade offers for Garrett.",
      "Garrett is under contract with the Browns for two more seasons under a five-year, $125 million extension he signed in 2020.",
      "\u201cAs a kid dreaming of the NFL, all I focused on was the ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl \u2014 and that goal fuels me today more than ever,\" Garrett said in his statement. \"My love for the community of Northeast Ohio and the incredible fanbase of the Cleveland Browns has made this one of the toughest decisions of my life. These past eight years have shaped me into the man that I am today.",
      "\u201cWhile I\u2019ve loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won\u2019t allow me to be complacent. The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton, it has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl. With that in mind, I have requested to be traded from the Cleveland Browns.\u201d",
      "Garrett, The Associated Press NFL defensive player of the year last season, is a finalist for the award again. His 14 sacks ranked second in the league, and he became the first player in NFL history to record 14 or more in four consecutive seasons. He holds the franchise record with 102.5 career sacks.",
      "During preparations for the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama, last week, Berry told reporters he would not trade Garrett even if a team were to offer two first-round draft picks.",
      "\"We feel really good about Myles obviously as a big piece of our future,\u201d Berry said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to him being on the field. Like I said in my (early January) press conference, we envision him going from Cleveland to Canton when his career is over.\u201d",
      "Garrett has relatively low salaries the next two seasons, according to Over The Cap. He is owed about $20 million in base salary and bonus in 2025 and $25 million in 2026.",
      "But he also carries significant dead money if Cleveland were to trade him. The Browns, who are currently projected at $30 million over the cap in 2025, would face a $36.2 million dead cap charge with a trade based on bonuses already paid to Garrett. Keeping Garrett in 2025 would result in just a $19.7 million cap charge for Cleveland.",

I\u2019m very proud of what we have been able to accomplish here over the last 23 seasons.",

      "But the lawsuit has taken center stage the last two months. The former players allege Hamilton failed to make good on a promise to get each of them $250,000 in NIL compensation.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 Darin Green Jr., De\u2019Ante Green, Cam\u2019Ron Fletcher, Josh Nickelberry, Primo Spears and Jalen Warley \u2014 filed suit in Leon County Circuit Court in late December.",

      "\"However, his extremely poor judgment in sharing betting accounts with a professional poker player he had reason to believe bet on baseball and who did, in fact, bet on baseball from the shared accounts, combined with his deletion of messages, creates at minimum the appearance of impropriety that warrants imposing the most severe discipline. Therefore, there is just cause to uphold Mr. Hoberg\u2019s termination for failing to conform to high standards of personal conduct and to maintain the integrity of the game of baseball.\u201d",
      "Now 38, Hoberg became a professional umpire in 2009, made his big league debut as a call-up on March 31, 2014, and joined the major league staff ahead of the 2017 season. During Game 2 of the 2022 World Series, he had an unprecedented \u201cumpire's perfect game\u201d by accurately calling balls and strikes on all 129 taken pitches, according to Umpire Scorecards.",
      "\u201cI take full responsibility for the errors in judgment that are outlined in today\u2019s statement,\u201d Hoberg said in a statement. \"Those errors will always be a source of shame and embarrassment to me. Major League Baseball umpires are held to a high standard of personal conduct, and my own conduct fell short of that standard.",
      "\"That said, to be clear, I have never and would never bet on baseball in any way, shape, or form. I have never provided, and would never provide, information to anyone for the purpose of betting on baseball. Upholding the integrity of the game has always been of the utmost importance to me. I apologize to Major League Baseball and the entire baseball community for my mistakes. I vow to learn from them and to be a better version of myself moving forward.\u201d",
      "Hoberg was notified of his termination on May 31 for violating Article 9 (A) of the umpires' collective bargaining agreement, which states the umpire must \"conform to high standards of personal conduct; and maintain the integrity of the international game of baseball.\u201d Under the labor contract, Hoberg had the right to appeal Hill's decision, triggering the hiring by MLB of a neutral fact finder who made a report to Manfred.",
      "MLB said the sportsbook notified it that Hoberg opened an account in his name on Jan. 30 last year and an electronic device associated with the account had accessed an account in the name of another person, who had bet on baseball.",
      "Hoberg\u2019s devices placed 417 direct bets with Sportsbook A between Dec. 30, 2020, and Jan. 15, 2024, on the friend\u2019s accounts totaling $487,475.83, which lost $53,189.65 in the aggregate. The devices placed at least 112 bets with Sportsbook B totaling $222,130 that resulted in a loss of $21,686.96 in the aggregate. Most of the direct bets were on football, basketball, hockey and golf.",
      "Nineteen of the 141 baseball bets by the friend were made from Hoberg\u2019s home and eight involved five games that Hoberg umpired or was a replay umpire. MLB detailed those games:",
      "\u2014On April 13, 2021, Hoberg had three close calls at third base that MLB said he ruled correctly on. There were money line bets of $2,000 and $1,000 on Cincinnati, which lost to San Francisco 7-6.",
      "\u2014On June 15, 2021, Hoberg was the lead replay umpire and there were no replay reviews in a Chicago Cubs\u2019 3-2 loss to the New York Mets. There was a $1,050 bet on a live runs line, a baseball equivalent of a points spread, and the bet won and paid $1,550.",
      "\u2014On Aug. 15, 2021, Hoberg was the plate umpire for the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 14-4 win over the Mets and had 98.89% accuracy, missing two pitches that MLB said were in low-leverage situations and benefited Los Angeles. Six calls were in a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d and four went against the Dodgers and two against the Mets. A $3,200 money line bet for the Dodgers paid $5,200.",
      "\u2014On Oct. 8, 2021, Hoberg was the third base umpire for the Dodgers\u2019 4-0 loss to San Francisco in an NL Division Series opener and did not have any close calls. A $2,000 money line bet and $3,000 run line bet on the Giants both won and paid a combined $9,300.",
      "\u2014On Oct. 30, 2021, Hoberg was lead replay official for World Series Game 4. Houston challenged on a possible overslide by Atlanta\u2019s Austin Riley at second base in the sixth inning of the Braves\u2019 3-2 win and Hoberg upheld the call by Alfonso M\u00e1rquez, a decision MLB said was supported by its replay operations center staff. Money line bets on Houston of $3,000 and $1,050 on the Astros both lost.",
      "\u201cAlthough the baseball bets were profitable, the data did not support a finding that baseball bets from Individual A\u2019s accounts were connected to game-fixing or other efforts to manipulate any part of any baseball game or event,\u201d MLB said in its findings. \u201cThe baseball betting activity did not focus on any particular club, pitcher or umpire, and there was no apparent correlation between bet success and bet size. The eight bets on games Hoberg worked similarly did not reveal any obvious pattern.\u201d",
      "After being contacted by MLB investigators, the friend deleted Telegram threads communicating the bets and tracking amounts owed and, after a phone conversation between Hoberg and the friend, the umpire deleted his Telegram account, according to MLB. MLB said Hoberg told it during the investigation and appeal that he had been unaware of his friend\u2019s baseball bets.",
      "\u201cIf our union believed that an umpire bet on baseball, we would never defend him,\u201d the Major League Umpires Association said in a statement. \"But as today\u2019s statement from the league makes clear, the neutral fact finder did not find that Pat placed bets on baseball. Yet we respect Pat\u2019s unequivocal acceptance of responsibility for the mistakes that led to his termination.\u201d",

      "Spain's women\u2019s World Cup winner Jenni Hermoso has testified against the former Spanish soccer federation president",
      "MADRID -- When the former president of Spain's Football Federation kissed a player from the national team who had just won the 2023 Women's World Cup, it sparked widespread outrage in Spain about sexism in sports and beyond.",
      "On Monday, women's World Cup winner Jenni Hermoso testified at the trial of Luis Rubiales that she did not consent to the kiss and that she felt coerced to publicly exonerate him after the incident.",
      "\u201cI felt disrespected,\u201d Hermoso said. \u201cI think it was a moment that stained one of the happiest days of my life.\u201d",
      "The 47-year-old Rubiales, who sat nearby at Madrid's High Court, is accused of sexual assault and of trying to coerce Hermoso, alongside others, to publicly support him.",
      "Rubiales has denied the charges, claiming the kiss was consensual and happened in a \u201cmoment of jubilation.\u201d Facing immense pressure, he resigned in 2023 and was banned by FIFA for three years. Rubiales had said he was the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by \u201cfalse feminists.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors, Hermoso and Spain\u2019s players\u2019 association want a prison sentence of two-and-a-half years for Rubiales, a payment of 50,000 euros ($51,800) for damages and for him to be banned from working as a sports official.",
      "When asked if at any point Rubiales had asked Hermoso if he could kiss her, the Spain forward said no.",
      "\u201cI didn't hear or understand anything,\u201d Hermoso said. \u201cThe next thing he did was to grab me by the ears and kiss me on the mouth.\u201d",
      "Rubiales could face a fine or a prison sentence of one to four years if found guilty, according to court officials.",
      "Hermoso had celebrated with her teammates after the kiss at the World Cup awards ceremony in Australia. When asked about those champagne-fueled celebrations on Monday, Hermoso said she chose to celebrate her team's victory like any footballer would.",
      "\u201cFor me, it was important to be able to celebrate this moment,\u201d she said.",
      "The trial is expected to last at least 10 days. Among the nearly 20 witnesses expected to testify are Spain\u2019s men\u2019s national team coach Luis de la Fuente and some of Hermoso\u2019s teammates on the women's team, including former world player of the year Alexia Putellas.",
      "Rubiales is required to attend only the first and the last day, according to the court.",
      "Also on trial are Spain's former women\u2019s national team coach Jorge Vilda, former sports director of Spain\u2019s men\u2019s team Albert Luque, and the federation\u2019s former head of marketing, Rub\u00e9n Rivera. They are accused of allegedly pressuring Hermoso to defend Rubiales publicly in a statement after the incident, which she refused to do.",
      "Hermoso said that after the incident and ensuing controversy, her life had been put on standby. She said she was able to escape the spotlight that she was thrust into after the incident in Mexico, where she plays for a club team.",
      "The incident overshadowed Spain's first women's World Cup victory, triggering protests and widespread condemnation.",
      "\u201cI have not been able to really live freely,\u201d she told the court.",

      "No. 16 Kansas turned up the defense and shut down eighth-ranked Iowa State in a 69-52 victory that helped to keep the Jayhawks in the Big 12 title race",
      "LAWRENCE, Kan. -- Kansas had just turned the ball over in the first half against Iowa State on Monday night when it suddenly popped loose again along the sideline, and Jayhawks guard Dajuan Harris Jr. made perhaps the hustle play of the game.",
      "With a textbook baseball slide, Harris managed to corral the ball and throw it from his rear to teammate Hunter Dickinson, who in turn tossed the ball ahead to David Coit. After a couple of dribbles, Coit unloaded a pass from the midcourt line that KJ Adams leaped into the air and slammed for a dunk that seemed to shake the rafters of Allen Fieldhouse.",
      "It was a play that underscored a rare fact about the Jayhawks at this point in the season.",
      "They were playing with a sense of desperation.",
      "Zeke Mayo scored 17 points and Dickinson added 14 points and nine rebounds as the No. 16 Jayhawks roared to a 69-52 win over eighth-ranked Iowa State. But it was the defense, which nearly shut down the Cyclones' prolific backcourt, and the hustle on both ends of the floor that allowed Kansas to remain in the regular-season Big 12 title hunt.",
      "Kansas (16-6) moved into a tie with Iowa State (17-5) at 7-4 in the league, 2 1/2 games back of Houston and Arizona.",
      "\u201cWe talked about a mindset of just, you know, how much can we trust each other? And how much do we enjoy playing with each other?\u201d Jayhawks coach Bill Self said. \u201cI don't think the emphasis was defense. I think the emphasis was, \u2018If our head is right and we play with freedom, we can look pretty good at times,\u2019 and that is what happened tonight.\u201d",
      "The Jayhawks held Iowa State to just 3-for-21 shooting from beyond the 3-point arc. And while the Cyclones only turned the ball over seven times, just about all of them \u2014 like that alley-oop dunk by Adams \u2014 turned into fast-break points.",
      "\u201cThere's probably not a place or a team or a program that does a better job than what Kansas does in transition,\u201d Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said. \u201cIf you have a turnover and how they turn it into points \u2014 we had very few turnovers but you feel like every one that we had turned into a layup or a dunk at the other end.\u201d",
      "While the Jayhawks, who blew a 19-point halftime lead at Baylor last weekend, thrived with their backs against the wall, Iowa State lost its third consecutive game while struggling without injured forward Milan Momcilovic in the lineup.",
      "Momcilovic, who hurt his non-shooting hand last month, went through pregame warmups and could be back soon.",
      "\u201cHe continues to do the things he needs,\u201d Otzelberger said. \u201cI do think he\u2019ll be back in the next few weeks. But it's a day-to-day situation. Today was the first step for him, feel what it feels like to go through the game warmup. But we\u2019ll see. I don't want to rush him back. I want it to be on the timeline that's on his best interest and whenever that is he'll be ready to go.\u201d",
      "Tamin Lipsey, Keshon Gilbert and Joshua Jefferson were held to 11 points apiece by Kansas, and it took a whole lot of shots for them to get there. The trio of Cyclones was 13 of 42 from the field and 2 of 14 from beyond the 3-point arc.",
      "Meanwhile, leading scorer Curtis Jones was held to seven points on 3-for-11 shooting.",
      "\u201cIt sucks for sure. Losing is not ideal,\u201d Jones said, \u201cbut I mean, we did some things well. We got 17 offensive rebounds, only had seven turnovers. It's just really shots weren't falling. We clean up free throws, make a couple 3s, it's a different game.\u201d",

      "Ethereum, dogecoin, and other popular cryptocurrencies saw significant price drops \u2013 some more than 10% -- since Trump\u2019s weekend tariff announcement. Trump\u2019s own meme coin, which he launched just before taking office, also saw a huge drop.",
      "\u201cThose are riskier cryptos\u201d than bitcoin, said Garrick Hileman, an independent cryptocurrency analyst. \u201cBut it\u2019s a little surprising how big the gap is.\u201d",

Trump warned Americans they may feel \u201csome pain\u201d  from the tariffs, which he said would be \u201cworth the price\u201d to make America great again. He also said Sunday night that import taxes will \u201cdefinitely happen\u201d with the European Union and possibly with the United Kingdom as well.",
      "Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a kind of electronic cash uncontrolled by banks or governments. It and newer forms of cryptocurrencies have moved from the financial fringes to the mainstream in recent years, with bitcoin\u2019s price movements largely tracking that of tech stocks.",
      "Trump\u2019s meme coin was trading at about $19 Monday, which is about 75% off the all-time high it reached right after Trump launched the coin on the eve of his second inauguration. First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s new meme coin has seen an even bigger drop from its all-time high \u2013 nearly 90% -- and is currently trading at about $1.50.",
      "Meme coins are a highly volatile corner of the crypto industry that often start as a joke with no real value but can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them.",
      "Trump is a former crypto skeptic who has since warmly embraced digital assets, both as a source of personal wealth and as a matter of government policy. He\u2019s promised to make the U.S. the world capital of crypto and appointed several crypto-friendly officials to key government positions.",
      "Cryptocurrencies have enjoyed a surge in value since Trump\u2019s election and bitcoin is still trading near its all-time high of $109,000."

      "Researchers across the country are in \u201ca mad scramble\u201d to sort out what public data the Trump administration has deleted from government websites",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers are in what one described as \u201ca mad scramble\u201d to sort out what public data the Trump administration has deleted from government websites and electronic publications.",
      "Late last week, federal agencies took down scores of government webpages as staffers hurried to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s order rolling back protections for transgender people, which required the removal of \u201cgender ideology\u201d language from websites, contracts and emails.",
      "Some of the sites were back online Monday, but data analysts say it's not clear exactly what was removed or changed.",
      "\u201cYou go looking for something and it's just not there,\u201d said Amy O'Hara, a Georgetown University researcher who is president of the Association of Public Data Users.",
      "Social science researchers and other federal data users on Monday described feeling like a five-alarm fire was triggered when they discovered late last week that vital federal datasets were inaccessible.",
      "It sparked \u201ca mad scramble right now\u201d to grab copies of whatever federal data was posted before, O'Hara said.",
      "While the administration's stated goal was to delete gender and transgender terminology, O'Hara said some researchers worry that other politically charged topics \u2014 such as climate change or vaccines \u2014 might be removed or altered.",
      "A expert panel affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention demanded a meeting on the deletions.",
      "The committee, chartered by Congress to advise the CDC director, asked the agency's acting director, Susan Monarez, for an explanation about why it had cut off access to datasets \u201cthat allow people across the country to understand the health of their communities.\u201d",
      "The panel had yet to receive a response, said committee member Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a former federal health official who is now a health policy expert at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Experts say datasets and summaries were affected, but so too were codebooks that explain different variables. They say they also saw changes to published research that used affected datasets, and even redactions to lists of publications about certain topics.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this is quite stunning,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "Researchers are still stumbling on what was taken down or changed, she added.",
      "\u201cWe are finding out about omissions when somebody goes searching for it,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "On Monday, for instance, when a query was made to access certain data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s most comprehensive survey of American life, users got a response that said the area was \u201cunavailable due to maintenance.\u201d",
      "The CDC\u2019s official public portal for health data, data.cdc.gov, was taken down entirely on Friday but went back up over the weekend, albeit with a yellow ribbon at the top saying: \u201cCDC\u2019s website is being modified to comply with President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders.\u201d The agency's Youth Risk Behavior Survey data was restored too, but with at least one of the gender columns missing and its data documentation removed.",
      "CDC officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. statistical system is considered the best in the world and researchers fear that the removals will undermine trust and put the integrity of the data at risk.",
      "\u201cThis sets a really dangerous precedent that any administration can come in and delete whatever they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Beth Jarosz, a senior program director at the Population Reference Bureau. \u201cRegardless of your politics, this should alarm you since this is taxpayer-funded data and it belongs to the public.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement, the presidents of the Population Association of America and the Association of Population Centers called the takedowns \u201cunacceptable\u201d and called on Congress and the Trump administration to restore the datasets.",

It also placed two other U.S. firms on an unreliable entity list that could bar them from investing in China.",
      "China and Google have had a long and entangled relationship going back to the early 2000s.",
      "Here's a look at Google's history in China and what the antitrust probe means for the company:",
      "Google launched Chinese-language search engine google.cn in 2006. It was censored to comply with Beijing\u2019s laws, and in 2009, was a major search engine in China with about 36% market share.",
      "In 2010, in response to a cyberattack and an increasing unwillingness to comply with censorship rules, Google said it was no longer willing to block search results and shut down its Chinese search engine, redirecting users to its Hong Kong site instead.",
      "Beijing later blocked Google services under its Great Firewall censorship system, including its email service Gmail, as well as its Chrome browser and search engine, making it inaccessible to users in mainland China.",
      "China typically blocks most Western internet platforms, such as Google, as well as social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram.",

      "Google maintains offices in the major Chinese cities Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.",
      "China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it was investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws.",
      "While regulators did not provide further details, the announcement came minutes after the 10% tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump came into effect.",
      "As there are few details on what exactly Google is being investigated for, the immediate impact on Google operations is unclear, although its current status is unlikely to be affected by the probe, which could takes months.",
      "Google did not immediately comment on the investigation.",
      "Some experts believe that the antitrust investigation is likely to center around Google\u2019s Android operating system for smartphones and used as a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "John Gong, a professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics, said that the investigation could be related to Google\u2019s dominance in the Android business, as virtually all smartphone brands apart from Apple and Huawei would have to pay licensing fees to Google to use the Android system on their devices.",
      "\u201cNow, this time, Google is put on the chopping board. But I think it\u2019s still an investigation, right? It hasn\u2019t reached a decision yet,\u201d said Gong, adding, \"I think it\u2019s very much negotiable.\u201d",
      "Huawei developed its own HarmonyOS operating system after it was placed on the U.S. entity list \u2014 foreign individuals, companies and organizations deemed a national security concern \u2014 in 2019, which prevented it from doing business with U.S. firms including Google.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury's verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbehavior. Video game maker Epic Games, which brought the case alleging Google's Play Store has been abusing its stranglehold over the Android app market, countered with arguments outlining why both the verdict and punishment should be affirmed to foster more innovation and lower prices.",
      "In a nearly hour-long presentation in San Francisco's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Google lawyer Jessica Ellsworth explained why the company believes the judge overseeing a month-long trial in 2023 improperly allowed the market in its case to be defined differently than it had in a similar antitrust trial revolving around Apple's antitrust trial in 2021.",
      "Ellsworth also asserted the trial shouldn't have been decided by a jury in the first place because Google exercised its consent to that process and demanded the case be decided by a judge instead, as had the trial by Apple.",
      "Epic, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed separate antitrust cases against Apple and Google on the same day in August 2020 and culminated in dramatically different outcomes. Unlike the jury in Google's trial in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers largely sided with Apple in an 185-decision that defined the Play Store and Apple's iPhone app store as part of a broader competitive market.",
      "Ellsworth told the appeals court that U.S. District Judge James Donato improperly allowed Epic to turn the Google trial into a \u201cdo-over\u201d that excluded the Apple app store as a rival in the market definition that led to the jury's verdict in its case.",
      "\"You can't just lose an issue that was fully litigated the first time (in the Apple case) and then pretend it didn't happen,\" Ellsworth said. She said the competition that Google and Apple engage in while making the two operating systems that power virtually all of the world's smartphones \u201csufficiently disciplines\u201d their actions in the app market.",
      "But the appeals judges indicated they believed the market definitions could differ in the separate app store cases because Apple bundles all its software and the iPhone together \u2014 creating what has become known as a \u201cwalled garden\u201d \u2014 while Google licenses the Android software that includes its Play Store a wide variety of smartphone makers.",
      "\u201cThere are clearly some factual differences between the Android world and Apple world,\u201d Judge Danielle J. Forrest told Ellsworth.",
      "Judge Gabriel Sanchez also sounded skeptical about Google's claims about being lumped with an improper market definition in its trial.",
      "\u201cEven if Google vigorously competes with Apple (in smartphone operating systems), that doesn't mean it can't create a different ecosystem where it's a monopolist,\u201d Sanchez interjected during Ellsworth's presentation.",
      "Epic attorney Gary Bornstein painted Google's arguments as a desperate and unfounded effort to preserve the system that boosts Google's profits with price-gouging commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app purchases flowing from software downloaded through the Play Store.",
      "The penalties that Donato imposed in October and subsequently postponed while Google pursues its appeal would impose a series of sweeping changes that include making the Play Store's entire library of 2 million apps available to potential competitors \u2014 a move expected to result in lower commission rates.",
      "The appeals court hasn't set a timeline for issuing a ruling in the Play Store case, but it typically takes several months before a decision is reached.",
      "Google is also currently facing other potential penalties that could include being forced to sell its Chrome web browser after a judge in another antitrust trial ruled its ubiquitous search engine is an illegal monopoly, too.",
      "In Monday's two-hour hearing Bornstein contended that Google never tried to define the Android app market during the trial the way it presented it during its appeal and reminded the three-judge panel that the bar should be set high before reversing a jury's verdict and the ensuing punishment ordered by a lower court judge.",
      "\u201cThe benefit of the doubt does not go to the wrongdoer,\u201d Bornstein said.",
      "The judges seemed more troubled by Donato's decision to stick with a jury trial after the case changed shortly before the Epic trial when Google settled lawsuits brought by attorneys general across the U.S. and another prominent app developer, Match Group. An agreement for a jury trial had been reached when the attorneys general and Match cases were going to be combined with Epic's, but Google wanted to revert to having a judge decide the outcome after settling some of the claims only to be rebuffed by Donato.",
      "At one point during Bornstein's presentation, Forrest openly mused about the possibility of declaring the verdict as a decision rendered by the equivalent of an advisory jury and sending the case back to Donato for a more lengthy ruling.",
      "That is an approach favored by Ellsworth, who pointed out that the judge's ruling in the Apple app store case spanned nearly 200 pages while the jury in the Google trial \u201cwere asked eight questions and they offered 14 words defining a relevant market.\u201d",
      "But Bornstein urged the appeals court to resort to giving Donato a \u201chomework assignment\u201d that would give Google more time to profit from its illegal conduct.",

      "Thousands of residents and seasonal workers have left the Cycladic Islands as hundreds of quakes up to magnitude 5 were recorded in the volcanic region since Friday. Ferry and commercial flight operators added services to accommodate departures.",
      "The quakes have caused cracks in some older building but no injuries have been reported so far. On Tuesday, schools were shut on 13 islands, up from four the previous day. Santorini earlier canceled public events, restricted travel to the island and banned construction work in certain areas.",
      "Efthimios Lekkas, head of the state-run Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization, said the epicenter of earthquakes in the Aegean Sea was moving northward away from Santorini, emphasizing that there was no connection to the area's dormant volcanoes.",
      "\u201cThis may last several days or several weeks. We are not able to predict the evolution of the sequence in time,\u201d Lekkas told state-run television.",
      "In Santorini\u2019s main town, Fira, the narrow, whitewashed streets along the island\u2019s clifftops were deserted \u2014 a rare sight even in the off season \u2014 except for small pockets of tour groups, many from Asian countries.",
      "Joseph Liu, from Guangzhou in southern China, said he had wanted to visit Santorini for years after seeing it in a documentary. He joined family and tour group members on a balcony deck typically used for high-end wedding receptions.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- New research shows that when an asteroid slammed into the moon billions of years ago, it carved out a pair of grand canyons on the lunar far side.",
      "That's good news for scientists and NASA, which is looking to land astronauts at the south pole on the near, Earth-facing side untouched by that impact and containing older rocks in original condition.",
      "U.S. and British scientists used photos and data from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to map the area and calculate the path of debris that produced these canyons about 3.8 billion years ago. They reported their findings Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The incoming space rock passed over the lunar south pole before hitting, creating a huge basin and sending streams of boulders hurtling at a speed of nearly 1 mile a second (1 kilometer a second). The debris landed like missiles, digging out two canyons comparable in size to Arizona's Grand Canyon in barely 10 minutes. The latter, by comparison, took millions of years to form.",
      "\u201cThis was a very violent, a very dramatic geologic process,\u201d said lead author David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.",
      "Kring and his team estimate the asteroid was 15 miles (25 kilometers) across and that the energy needed to create these two canyons would have been more than 130 times that in the world\u2019s current inventory of nuclear weapons.",
      "Most of the ejected debris was thrown in a direction away from the south pole, Kring said.",
      "That means NASA\u2019s targeted exploration zone around the pole mostly on the moon's near side won\u2019t be buried under debris, keeping older rocks from 4 billion plus years ago exposed for collection by moonwalkers. These older rocks can help shed light not only on the moon\u2019s origins, but also Earth\u2019s.",
      "Kring said it\u2019s unclear whether these two canyons are permanently shadowed like some of the craters at the moon\u2019s south pole. \u201cThat is something that we\u2019re clearly going to be reexamining,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "America&rsquo;s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
    "story": [
      "America\u2019s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
      "WEST ORANGE, N.J. -- Along the long road from American icon to endangered species and back again, the bald eagle \u2014 the national bird of the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky \u2014 is having a moment.",
      "The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since the early 2000's, when the federal government took the thriving birds off its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally, too, the animals are soaring.",
      "In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the country's national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a bit). This month, New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence \u2014 and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship in the Super Bowl this weekend.",
      "How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales, it's complex.",
      "The story \u2014 there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance \u2014 centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972.",
      "To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to \u201cincubate\u201d while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so I think now it\u2019s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,\u201d said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska.",
      "Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're \u201cfairly adaptable\" and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey \u2014 from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.",
      "She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town \u2014 New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans \u2014 that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it.",
      "\u201cThose birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?\u201d",
      "The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. One bird, a male named Freedom, perched atop a branch in his enclosure at the zoo recently and called out loudly. He was found dangling by a rope, left with an injury that renders him unreleasable, Fazio said.",
      "There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.",
      "Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month.",
      "She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in a number of Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.",
      "The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an \u201cumbrella species,\u201d whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser known wildlife.",
      "\u201cAmericans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles,\" Clark said.",
      "Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green \u201cBirds\u201d cap and binoculars.",
      "\u201cJust the mere thrill of seeing one \u2014 a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.\u201d",
      "Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection official: \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being on the brink there, not knowing if if you\u2019re going to be able to save the species.\"",

    "summary": "The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States dropped dramatically this year even as federal officials move to extend protections for the beloved pollinator",
    "story": [
      "The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States dropped dramatically this year even as federal officials move to extend protections for the beloved pollinator",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States has dropped to its second-lowest mark in nearly three decades as pesticides, diminishing habitat and climate change take their toll on the beloved pollinator.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange-and-black wings, are found across North America. Monarchs in the eastern United States spend their winters in Mexico and are counted by the World Wildlife Fund, which has yet to release data for this year. Monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains typically overwinter along the California coast.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs in 2020.",
      "The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies this year.",
      "Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect's caterpillars. The plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires, agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society.",
      "It's unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year may have slowed breeding.",
      "Monarchs suffer when the mercury gets up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 Celsius) and any temperatures above 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.2 degrees Celsius) are lethal to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July that drove temperatures in some areas well past 100 degrees. Palm Springs, for example, hit a record 124 degrees Fahrenheit (51.1 degrees Celsius) on July 5. Another heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple cities breaking heat records.",
      "Pelton said that it's too early to tell what long-term impact the dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population. Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to 247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs.",
      "\"This is bad news,\" Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. \u201cBut we have seen incredible recovery. this doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to have western monarchs. It's hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set them back pretty significantly.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in December 2024 that it was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit anyone from killing, transporting them or making changes that would render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect 4,395 acres (1,779 hectares) in seven coastal California counties that serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs.",
      "A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened if officials decide to move forward.",
      "Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Samoa\u2019s top health official on Monday denounced as \u201ca complete lie\u201d remarks that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made during his bid to become U.S. health secretary, rejecting his claim that some who died in the country's 2019 measles epidemic didn't have the disease.",
      "\"We don\u2019t know what was killing them,\" Kennedy said during tense U.S. Senate hearings last week on whether he should oversee the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, suggesting that the cause of the 83 deaths \u2014 mostly of children under age 5 \u2014 was unclear.",
      "\"It's a total fabrication,\u201d Samoa Director-General of Health Dr. Alec Ekeroma told The Associated Press of Kennedy's comments.",
      "U.S. senators grilled Kennedy last week over his 2019 Samoa trip, accusing him of downplaying his role in the epidemic.",
      "The outbreak devastated the Pacific island nation in 2019, killing 83 people in a population of 200,000. Vaccination rates were historically low because of poor public health management and the 2018 deaths of two babies whose vaccines were incorrectly prepared, prompting fears that the MMR immunization was unsafe before the nature of the error was discovered.",
      "The government suspended vaccinations for 10 months before the outbreak \u2014 the period when Kennedy visited. His trip was organized by a Samoan anti-vaccine influencer, according to a 2021 blog post by Kennedy.",
      "On Wednesday, Kennedy denied that his visit had fueled anti-vaccine sentiment. A spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.",
      "\u201cAnti-vaxxers from New Zealand came to be with him here,\u201d Ekeroma said. \u201cThat's how I know that his influence can be far-reaching.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen the tissue samples were sent to New Zealand, most of those people did not have measles,\u201d Kennedy told U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.",
      "Ekeroma, a medical doctor who also holds a doctorate in health, said that the claim was a \u201chuge denial\u201d of the fact that doctors from several countries traveled to Samoa to treat measles patients.",
      "The Samoan official wasn't the health chief during the outbreak, but confirmed key details with his predecessor, he said. Only one autopsy was carried out and no postmortem tissue samples were sent abroad, which was not unusual because measles is a simple disease to diagnose, said Ekeroma.",
      "Blood samples from living patients were sent to Australia and New Zealand, where the public health agency said Monday that testing had confirmed the same strain of measles circulating in New Zealand at the time.",
      "\u201cI went there \u2013 nothing to do with vaccines,\u201d Kennedy said Wednesday. \u201cI went there to introduce a medical informatics system that would digitalize records in Samoa and make health delivery much more efficient.\u201d",
      "Ekeroma rejected that assertion, referring to social media posts by anti-vaccine advocates who posed for photos with Kennedy during his trip. One later wrote on the blog of Kennedy's then nonprofit, Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 which has decried MMR vaccines as unsafe \u2014 that during the outbreak he received advice from people assembled by Kennedy encouraging the alternative treatments he was supplying to Samoan families.",
      "In the same blog post, Kennedy recalled meeting Samoa's then prime minister, who he said was \u201ccurious to measure health outcomes following the \u2018natural experiment\u2019 created by the national respite from vaccines.\u201d",
      "In late 2019, Kennedy wrote to the leader, saying that the deaths could have been caused by a measles vaccine \u2014 statements he repeated in written responses to senators' questions following the hearing. He urged the Samoan leader to approach a particular laboratory to investigate the source of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cMy words had nothing to do with vaccine uptake in Samoa or with the 2019 epidemic,\u201d Kennedy said in his written responses.",
      "But Kennedy emboldened anti-vaccine contacts in Samoa, Ekeroma said, and the epidemic was fueled by disinformation in social media posts in the island nation and abroad.",
      "Moelagi Leilani Jackson, a Samoan nurse who worked on the vaccination campaign, told the AP in 2023 that anti-vaccine campaigners \u201cgot louder\u201d after Kennedy\u2019s visit.",
      "\u201cI feel like they felt they had the support of Kennedy,\u201d she said.",
      "However, Ekeroma said that Kennedy's overtures weren't heeded by the nation\u2019s leaders. A vaccination campaign resumed in 2019 and measles vaccines are now compulsory for Samoan children.",
      "If Kennedy is affirmed as the top U.S. health official this week, it would be \u201ca danger to us, a danger to everyone,\u201d Ekeroma said. Kennedy would control U.S. funding for vaccination initiatives and could make affordable vaccines harder for small nations like Samoa to access, the official said.",
      "\u201cIf he\u2019s going to be appointed, then we will have to actually discuss around the Pacific as to how we\u2019re going to try to neutralize his influence in the region,\u201d he added.",

      "With his 70th birthday looming on this year's horizon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates looked inward to open a window into the man behind Windows and other seminal software that turned the personal computer into a household staple.",
      "Gates focuses on the first quarter-century of his life in \u201cSource Code: My Beginnings,\u201d the opening installment in a retrospective trilogy about an insouciant, impertinent and often misunderstood kid who grew up to become a polarizing technology titan before morphing into an influential philanthropist.",
      "In \u201cSource Code,\u201d Gates explores how his childhood quirks, upbringing, friendships and experiences coalesced into shaping his own internal operating system. Along the way, he dissects his brain's unusual wiring, delves into the emotional trauma of his best friend dying while they were both in high school, and revisits the birth of Traf-O-Data, a trailblazing startup that he launched in Albuquerque, New Mexico with another childhood friend, Paul Allen.",
      "Traf-O-Data, conceived to create software for the groundbreaking Altair computer made Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, became Microsoft in 1975 \u2014 a year it booked $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen were making $9 per hour.",
      "By 1977, Microsoft had become successful enough to embolden Gates to drop out of Harvard University. In 1979, he had decided to move Microsoft to the Seattle area where he grew up. Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO 25 years ago, the Windows operating system and other software created under his reign remain the main pillar in a company that now generates $212 billion in annual revenue, boasts a $3.1 trillion market value, and accounts for most of Gates' $100 billion personal fortune.",
      "\u201cSource Code\u201d ends with Gates's drive back to Seattle in 1979, meaning it doesn't touch upon his 1994 marriage to Melinda French, nor their 2021 divorce.",
      "\u201cI am being reflective, which is not my normal mode, but it\u2019s kind of time,\u201d Gates said during an interview about the book with The Associated Press. \u201cAs we went back and got teacher\u2019s comments or people I worked with at Harvard, it was fascinating. I had confused myself into thinking I got straight A\u2019s in ninth grade.\u201d",
      "That might not sound like much of a revelation, but it was a surprise to the cerebral Gates, who paints himself in the book as a \u201cbratty smartass\u201d prone to dismissively sneering, \u201cThat's the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d about remarks that seemed nonsensical to him.",
      "Gate's self-portrait is that of a nerd nicknamed \u201cTrey\u201d by his card-playing grandmother because he was the third male on this father's side of the family to be named Bill. He was a pipsqueak who had difficulty making friends and preferred living in his own head before he discovered computers, which became like slot machines that rewarded him for writing elegant lines of code.",
      "When he did talk, the young Gates rocked back and forth like a metronome setting a rhythm for his brain \u2014 a habit that surfaced during parts of his 45-minute interview with the AP.",
      "\u201cIt was a little weird because it was hard to direct my attention,\u201d Gates recalled during the interview. \u201cI had one year in school where they said, \u2018Oh we should put you ahead a couple grades.\u2019 And then another time, they said, \u2018No, we should hold you back.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Well make up your mind.\u2019 They were a little confounded.\u201d",
      "Although he didn't realize it as a boy, Gates has no doubt he was and still is neurodivergent who channeled that anomaly into learning to program computers at the right time in the right place with the patient support of his late parents (the book is dedicated to them, along with his sister, Kristi and Libby).",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that there was this idea that there are kids that have this kind of unique ability to concentrate but less social skills. I certainly would be included in that,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI encourage people who have strengths and deficits to kind of map their ambition onto something that plays to their strengths. Being able to think just about programming and how you do it better ended up being invaluable for me.\u201d",
      "Gates also had the advantage of growing up in a family that could afford to pay for him to attend a private high school in Seattle. Still, that privilege didn't insulate him from the trauma he experienced when his best friend, Kent Evans, died in a mountain climbing accident in May 1972 \u2014 a year before they were going to graduate.",
      "Evans' death occurred while he and Gates were preparing to spend much of the summer working on a program for their school, but what hurt far more was the loss of someone who understood him and helped give him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life.",
      "\u201cI had no notion of a friend just being gone. It was the only negative thing in my childhood,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt shapes you, that someone can just disappear \u2014 somebody you loved and would have done things with. He would have been part of whatever I ended up going on to do. I give Kent credit, along with Paul (Allen), for setting the direction that I ended up going down.\u201d",
      "Evans' death provided the impetus for Gates to reconnect with Allen, who was already attending college, to help him with his programming projects. Allen, three years older than Gates and a passionate fan of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, did more than just help with the coding. He also offered Gates some LSD in an attempt to lure his partner down a more psychedelic path.",
      "Gates rebuffed Allen at first but decided to drop acid with a group of high school friends shortly before his 1973 graduation, according to the book.",
      "It wasn't a pleasant experience, a reaction that Gates thought might have been related to the dental surgery he underwent the day after his LSD trip. He tried LSD again with Allen in October 1974 while they were watching an episode of the old \"Kung Fu\" series on TV, and decided he would be better off without psychedelic drugs even though Apple co-founder Steve Jobs contended Microsoft would have created better products had Gates taken more acid.",
      "\"I thought maybe I\u2019d seem cool if I took it, but that didn\u2019t happen,\" Gates said during the interview. \u201cI would say Steve was definitely more hip than I was. He took a lot more acid than I did. He had a sense of style. I had some charisma in terms of motivating engineers and saying this great thing (with personal computers) would happen, but Steve had natural speaking and charisma capabilities, even beyond mine. So I always envied him for the things he did.\"",
      "Gates' mind is now being blown by the recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology being planted into Microsoft's software as part of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.",
      "\u201cWhen I finally see ChatGPT-4, where the OpenAI guys show me a very early version, I am just blown away completely,\u201d Gates said. He views AI as an \u201camazing and scary\u201d technology that should be rigorously monitored.",
      "\u201cYou should be nervous. We have to acknowledge that AI is almost uniquely dangerous because it\u2019s unbounded in terms of how good it will get and it\u2019s happening within a generation,\u201d Gates said. \u201cHopefully, the politicians and the technologists will share with each other, and we can shape this thing. We better get on top of that now.\u201d",
      "If nothing else, Gates is hoping \u201cSource Code\u201d will help people see a more human side of him, even if he might never been seen as the cultural tastemaker that Jobs was.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was completely uncool,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut once I got going on Microsoft, I was willing to be pretty monomaniacal. Even people I competed with found it very intimidating how focused I was. I really didn\u2019t goof off in my 20s because my whole thing was having Microsoft move at full speed.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Gates will delve deeper into the monomania that made him so rich, famous and sometimes reviled in the next book about his life \u2014 an installment that he says won't be done until sometime in 2027, at the earliest."

      "The H3 rocket carrying the Michibiki 6 satellite lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island.",
      "Everything went smoothly and the satellite successfully separated from the rocket as planned about 29 minutes after the liftoff, said Makoto Arita, H3 project manager for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA.",

      "Researchers have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution dating to around 5,200 years ago in ancient Greece",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient Greece produced the earliest records of democracy, western philosophy \u2014 and, it turns out, lead pollution.",
      "Researchers studying sediment cores recovered from mainland Greece and the Aegean Sea have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution in the environment dating to around 5,200 years ago.",
      "That's 1,200 years older than the previous earliest recorded lead pollution, which was found in a peatbog in Serbia.",
      "In antiquity, lead was released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of smelting ore for copper and silver. The toxic metal later condensed as dust and settled onto the soil.",
      "\u201cSilver was used for jewelry, for special objects \u2014 but it wasn't found in a pure state,\u201d but mined in ore combined with lead, said Heidelberg University archaeologist Joseph Maran, co-author of a new study published Thursday in Communications Earth and Environment.",
      "The site with the earliest signs of lead contamination is located in northeastern Greece, near the island of Thasos. Prior archaeological evidence suggests Thasos was one of the region\u2019s most significant sites for silver mining and metalwork, said Maran.",
      "\u201cLead released from smelting is the world\u2019s first form of toxic or industrial pollution,\u201d said Yale historian Joseph Manning, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The researchers found that levels of lead contamination remained fairly low and localized in ancient Greece, considered the cradle of European civilization, throughout the Bronze Age, the Classical period and the Hellenistic period. The Classical period is famous for Athenian democracy, Socrates and Plato, and the Hellenistic period saw Greek cultural influence peak across the Mediterranean region.",
      "But around 2,150 years ago, the researchers detected \u201ca very strong and abrupt increase\" in lead emissions caused by human activities across Greece, said co-author Andreas Koutsodendris at Heidelberg University.",
      "Around that time, in 146 B.C., the Roman army conquered the Greek peninsula, transforming the region\u2019s society and economy. As Roman trade, colonies and shipping expanded across the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, demand for silver coins grew rapidly, requiring smelting that released lead, said Koutsodendris.",
      "Later the Roman Empire used lead for tableware and for construction, including pipes.",
      "Previous research \u2013 including an analysis of ice cores from Greenland \u2013 had detected high levels of lead across much of the Northern Hemisphere during Roman times.",

      "The 40-year-old founder of China's DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund that now manages a reported $8 billion in assets",
      "BANGKOK -- The 40-year-old founder of China\u2019s DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund and then refined its quantitative models to branch into artificial intelligence.",
      "Liang Wenfeng, who founded DeepSeek in 2023, was born in southern China's Guangdong and studied in eastern China's Zhejiang province, home to e-commerce giant Alibaba and other tech firms, according to Chinese media reports.",
      "The hedge fund he set up in 2015, High-Flyer Quantitative Investment Management, developed models for computerized stock trading and began using machine-learning techniques to refine those strategies.",
      "Like many Chinese quantitative traders, High-Flyer was hit by losses when regulators cracked down on such trading in the past year. However, it reportedly manages $8 billion in assets, ample resources for funding DeepSeek\u2019s AI research.",
      "It also has abundant computing power for AI, since High-Flyer had by 2022 amassed a cluster of 10,000 of California-based Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips that are used to build and run AI systems, according to a post that summer on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. soon after restricted sales of those chips to China.",
      "\u201cThing is, we are sure now that we want to do this, can do this, and are capable of doing this, so we\u2019re among the best-suited candidates to tackle it at this moment,\" Liang told Waves, a tech media outlet, in 2023.",
      "\u201cCurrently, neither tech giants nor startups have an unassailable lead. With OpenAI paving the way, everyone is working with published papers and open-source code,\u201d it quoted him as saying.",
      "Liang said he spends his days reading papers, writing code, and participating in group discussions, like other researchers.",
      "DeepSeek is exploring what intelligence means, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople may think there\u2019s some hidden business logic behind this, but it\u2019s mainly driven by curiosity,\u201d Liang said.",
      "When DeepSeek was asked, \u201cWho is Liang Wenfeng?\u201d its first answer was to name a different Chinese entrepreneur with the same name, at least as spelled in English letters.",
      "When asked: \u201cWhere is Liang Wenfeng from and where did he go to university?\u201d it said that as of October 2023, the most recent knowledge cutoff for DeepSeek's R1 AI model, \u201cthere is no publicly available information about Liang Wenfeng\u2019s background, including his place of origin or educational history.\"",
      "\"If you are referring to the founder of DeepSeek, details about his personal life or academic background have not been disclosed publicly. For more information about DeepSeek, you can visit its official website,\u201d it said.",
      "Liang's focused approach fits in with his determination to push AI learning forward. After decades of relying on innovation from the West, he says China should be making its own contributions.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that Chinese AI can\u2019t be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,\u201d he said in another Waves interview in November. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change, China will always be only a follower \u2014 so some exploration is inescapable.\u201d",

      "Chinese artificial intelligence startup company DeepSeek stunned markets and AI experts with its claim that it built its immensely popular chatbot at a fraction of the cost of those made by American tech titans.",
      "That immediately called into question the billions of dollars U.S. tech companies are spending on a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers they say are needed to unlock the next wave of artificial intelligence.",
      "Could this new AI mean the world needs significantly less electricity for the technology than everyone thinks? The answer has profound implications for the overheating climate . AI uses vast amounts of energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change. Tech companies have said their electricity use is going up, when it was supposed to be ramping down, ruining their carefully-laid plans to address climate change.",
      "\u201cThere has been a very gung ho, go ahead at all costs mentality in this space, pushing toward investment in fossil fuels,\u201d said Eric Gimon, senior fellow at Energy Innovation. \u201cThis is an opportunity to tap the brakes.\u201d",
      "Making AI more efficient could be less taxing on the environment, experts say, even if its huge electricity needs are not going away.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s claims of building its impressive chatbot on a budget drew curiosity that helped make its AI assistant the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s iPhone this week, ahead of U.S.-made chatbots ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden we wake up Monday morning and we see a new player number one on the App Store, and all of a sudden it could be a potential gamechanger overnight,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \u201c It caused a bit of a panic. These were the hottest stocks in the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s app competes well with other leading AI models. It can compose software code, solve math problems and address other questions that take multiple steps of planning. It's attracted attention for its ability to explain its reasoning in the process of answering questions.",
      "Leading analysts have been poring through the startup's public research papers about its new model, R1, and its precursors. Among the details that stood out was DeepSeek\u2019s assertion that the cost to train the flagship v3 model behind its AI assistant was only $5.6 million, a stunningly low number compared to the multiple billions of dollars spent to build ChatGPT and other well-known systems. DeepSeek hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment.",
      "The $5.6 million number only included actually training the chatbot, not the costs of earlier-stage research and experiments, the paper said. DeepSeek was also working under some constraints: U.S. export controls on the most powerful AI chips. It said it relied on a relatively low-performing AI chip from California chipmaker Nvidia that the U.S. hasn\u2019t banned for sale in China.",
      "Data centers consumed about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity in 2023 and that's expected to increase to 6.7% to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",
      "It's been axiomatic that U.S. tech giants must spend much more on building out data centers and other infrastructure to train and run their AI systems. Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, says it plans to spend up to $65 billion this year, including on a massive data center complex coming to Louisiana.",
      "Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion this year. And Trump last week joined the CEOs of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to announce a joint venture that hopes to invest up to $500 billion on data centers and the electricity generation needed for AI development, starting with a project already under construction in Texas.",
      "When there's an innovative technology that's useful to the general population and it's affordable, people will use it, said Vic Shao, founder of DC Grid, which delivers off-grid, direct current power to data centers and electric vehicle charging stations.",
      "That means data centers will still be built, though they may be able to operate more efficiently, said Travis Miller, an energy and utilities strategist at Morningstar Securities Research.",
      "\u201cWe think that the growth in electricity demand will end up at the lower end of most of the ranges out there,\u201d he said.",
      "If DeepSeek's claims hold true, some routine AI queries might not need a data center and could be shifted to phones, said Rahul Sandil, vice president and general manager for global marketing and communications at MediaTek, a semiconductor company. That would ease the computing need and give more time to scale up renewable energy sources for data centers.",
      "Bloom Energy is one of the AI-related stocks that took a hit Monday. KR Sridhar, founder and CEO, said it's imperative that the U.S. leads in AI because it can power data centers with clean energy, unlike other countries that still primarily rely on coal.",
      "\u201cWe can continue to make it better and we will continue to make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Rick Villars, an analyst for market research group IDC, said the DeepSeek news could influence how AI researchers advance their models, but they\u2019ll still need plenty of data centers and electricity.",
      "\u201cWe think this actually could boost and accelerate the time frame for when AI becomes much more embedded into our lives, in the work sense, the living sense and in health care,\u201d Villars said. \u201cSo we still think the capacity is required.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is meeting Friday with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company designs and supplies the advanced computer chips that play an integral role in developing artificial intelligence",
      "President Donald Trump is meeting Friday with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company designs and supplies the advanced computer chips that play an integral role in developing artificial intelligence.",
      "The meeting at the White House was confirmed by a person familiar who insisted on anonymity to discuss the conversation between Huang and Trump. The person said the meeting was set up weeks ago and would enable them to get acquainted and talk about AI policy. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, Calif., declined to comment on the meeting.",
      "Nvidia had loudly protested a last-minute move by the Biden administration in January to expand AI chip restrictions beyond adversaries like China to more than 100 other countries, including Singapore. But it remains to be seen if Trump will follow through with or drop those proposed rules.",
      "Trump signed an order on his first day in office last week that said his administration would \u201cidentify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls,\u201d signaling that he might continue and harden Biden\u2019s approach.",
      "The Republican president is banking on AI to foster economic growth and draw hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, but he also saw the performance of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI technology as a sign that the technology can be developed more cheaply.",
      "Speaking Monday to House Republicans in Miami, Trump called the DeepSeek news \u201cpositive\u201d if it\u2019s accurate because \u201cyou won\u2019t be spending as much and you\u2019ll get the same result.\u201d",
      "Trump said it was a \u201cwake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek has said its recent models were built with Nvidia\u2019s lower-performing H800 chips, which are not banned in China. DeepSeek began attracting more attention in the AI industry last month when it released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and was more cost-effective in its use of expensive Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data. The chatbot became more widely accessible when it appeared on Apple and Google app stores early this year.",
      "The meeting between Trump and Huang comes as leaders of a special House committee focused on countering China have urged Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, to consider the potential national security benefits of placing export controls on Nvidia semiconductor chips used by DeepSeek. They said the examination should be part of a review that Trump ordered on his first day in office that called on the secretaries of State and Commerce to review the U.S. export control system.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said DeepSeek made extensive use of a Nvidia chip designed specifically to fall outside U.S. export controls. The lawmakers said that the committee supports American AI innovation, and that support \u201cincludes imposing reasonable safeguards\u201d to protect those innovations from China.",
      "\u201cThis demonstrates what the Select Committee has long argued: frequently updating export controls is imperative to ensure (China) will not exploit regulatory gaps and loopholes to advance their AI ambitions,\u201d the two lawmakers wrote in letter dated Wednesday.",
      "The pair asked that Waltz look for ways to strengthen controls on shipments through third countries \u201cthat pose a high risk of diversion.\u201d Singapore, the letter said, represented 22% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in its most recently quarterly statement, \u201cdespite the company itself revealing most of these shipments ultimately went to users outside of Singapore.\u201d",
      "Countries such as Singapore, they added, should be subject to strict licensing requirements if they aren't willing to \u201ccrack down\u201d on China using their country as an intermediary for shipments.",
      "In an emailed statement, Nvidia said that its revenue associated with Singapore \"does not indicate diversion to China.\"",
      "\u201cOur public filings report \u2018bill to\u2019 not \u2018ship to\u2019 locations of our customers,\u201d a Nvidia spokesperson said. \u201cMany of our customers have business entities in Singapore and use those entities for products destined for the U.S. and the west. We insist that our partners comply with all applicable laws, and if we receive any information to the contrary, act accordingly.\u201d"

      "The unsolved death of a teenager in 1977 haunted students and staff at Honolulu's McKinley High School for nearly half a century",
      "HONOLULU -- Former Hawaii lawmaker Suzanne Chun Oakland remembers arriving at school one morning in 1977 to an eerie buzz.",
      "The 15-year-old had met up with girlfriends as usual before class at Honolulu's McKinley High School when she learned a student named Dawn Momohara had been found dead on the second floor of a school building.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we got word of it, but everything spread really quickly,\u201d Chun Oakland said.",
      "Chun Oakland didn't know Momohara, who was 16, but the unsolved death has haunted her and other McKinley students and staff for nearly half a century. That was until last week, when police used advances in DNA technology to arrest a 66-year-old resident of a Utah nursing home.",
      "The suspect, former McKinley student Gideon Castro, was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Friday before a judge in Salt Lake County District Court. He remained in custody Thursday with the bond for his release set at $250,000, according to Salt Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office records.",
      "Castro\u2019s attorney, Marlene Mohn, did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.",
      "Momohara had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said.",
      "\u201cI was just really sad,\" Chun Oakland recalled earlier this week. \"I think for our student body, of course there\u2019s that concern that what if he\u2019s still out there and he does it to somebody else.\u201d",
      "On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found Momohara lying on her back, partially clothed, an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck.",
      "Details from more than four decades ago are fuzzy for 1967 McKinley graduate Grant Okamura, who was the school\u2019s 28-year-old band teacher in 1977, but the morning Momohara was found has remained a core memory.",
      "Momohara's sister \u2014 one of his flute players \u2014 arrived at school that day not knowing her sister had been found dead, he recalled. The sister was called to the office and later walked into the band room, devastated.",
      "\u201cThe other students were trying to console her,\" Okamura said. \"At that point, I couldn't have band. How do you have a class? She just sat there crying.\u201d",
      "She didn't return to school for weeks afterward.",
      "He doesn't remember the sister's name. The Associated Press was unable to make contact with any possible relatives. Okamura said he met Momohara a few times when he let her into the air-conditioned band room to wait for her sister.",
      "The morning before Momohara was killed, she got a call from an unknown male and told her mother she was going to a nearby shopping center with friends. That was the last time her mother saw her, homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said.",
      "Police released sketches of a person of interest and a possible vehicle described by witnesses as a 1974 or 1975 Pontiac Lemans. A witness reported seeing the car when he and his girlfriend drove through campus the night before Momohara died. The witness saw a man and the car on the grass near the school's English building, Thoemmes said.",
      "The witness circled back around but the car and the man were gone.",
      "Police were unable to identify a suspect and the case grew cold, though grief lingered over the campus.",
      "In 2019, cold case detectives asked a forensic biology unit to examine several items of evidence from the scene, including Momohara's underwear. They were able to develop a DNA profile in 2020. Then, in 2023, police received information about potential suspects, two brothers who were interviewed in 1977.",
      "Several days after Momohara was killed, detectives interviewed Castro, who graduated from McKinley High in 1976. He said he met Momohara at a school dance that year and last saw her at a carnival on campus in February 1977. Police interviewed his brother, who also met Momohara at the dance.",
      "In November 2023, Honolulu police went to Chicago, where the brother was living. They \u201csurreptitiously\u201d obtained DNA from one of the brother's adult children, Thoemmes said.",
      "Lab findings excluded the brother as a suspect, but a DNA sample from Castro's adult son, and later from Castro himself, proved he was responsible, Thoemmes said.",
      "He was arrested last week at the nursing home where he lived in Millcreek, just south of Salt Lake City, on suspicion of second-degree murder.",
      "Neither Okamura nor Chun Oakland remembered Castro.",
      "Chun Oakland graduated in 1979 and grew up to become a Democratic member of the Hawaii Senate. She said Momohara's killing bothered her over the years, especially when she would meet victims through her work as a lawmaker or as a board member of the nonprofit Sex Abuse Treatment Center, a statewide program provding services for sexual assault survivors.",
      "Chun Oakland said she is grateful an arrest was possible even after all these years.",
      "\u201cI think the community in general, and our elected officials, they know the importance of trying to preserve the evidence that can someday be able to see justice for that individual or individuals,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro says he wants to fast-track the construction of power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that produce electricity and use hydrogen",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Gov. Josh Shapiro said Thursday that he wants to fast-track the construction of big power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that provide electricity to the grid and use hydrogen.",
      "Shapiro's announcement comes a few days before he delivers his third budget proposal to lawmakers amid an energy crunch that threatens to raise electricity bills across Pennsylvania, the nation's second-biggest natural gas-producing state.",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat, said he wants to start the \u201cnext chapter in Pennsylvania\u2019s long story of energy leadership\u201d and keep pace with other states that are attracting big projects, such as data centers and electric vehicle factories.",
      "\"Pennsylvania, it\u2019s time for us to be more competitive. It\u2019s time for us to act. We need to take some big and decisive steps right now, build new sources of power so Pennsylvania doesn't miss out,\u201d Shapiro said at a news conference at Pittsburgh International Airport.",
      "Shapiro said Pennsylvania is one of just 12 states that doesn't have an entity to fast-track siting decisions for energy projects. He wants to change that by creating the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board to streamline permitting and support for new energy projects.",
      "\"We need shovels in the ground now, not in the years to come,\" Shapiro said.",
      "The tax credits Shapiro is proposing are aimed at large projects producing electricity, using hydrogen and making hydrogen-based aviation fuel.",
      "A new power plant could qualify for up to $100 million per year for three years based on the amount of power the facility can produce, under Shapiro's plan.",
      "The Shapiro administration said it would leave it to lawmakers to hammer out what sort of power plants would qualify for a tax credit, although they said it wouldn't include the proposed restart of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to feed data centers run by tech giant Microsoft.",
      "At the federal level, former President Joe Biden's administration enacted rules last year as a centerpiece of his efforts to fight climate change by requiring coal and newer, higher-usage gas plants to slash their carbon dioxide emissions by 90% to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases from a major source.",
      "For the other tax credits, a user of hydrogen fuel could qualify for up to $49 million a year and an aviation fuel producer could qualify for up to $15 million a year, under Shapiro's plan. The hydrogen-related tax credits are an attempt to create demand for the two federally subsidized hydrogen-making projects in which Pennsylvania or some of its businesses and institutions play a role, another part of Biden\u2019s agenda to slow climate change.",
      "The plans would require approval from lawmakers. Republican lawmakers have been critical of Shapiro\u2019s energy policy, saying it is a major hurdle for Pennsylvania to attract companies that want to build big new natural gas-fired power plants and stabilize the power grid.",
      "Shapiro's plans elicited applause from renewable energy advocates, while business groups echoed Republican criticism, but said they were encouraged by Shapiro's focus on energy.",
      "Shapiro's plan unveiled last year to make power plant owners in the nation\u2019s third-biggest energy-producing state pay for their greenhouse gas emissions and require utilities to buy more electricity from renewable sources gained no traction in the Legislature.",
      "One project Shapiro said he wants to help is a proposal by natural gas producer CNX Resources to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh\u2019s airport to make hydrogen-based fuels.",
      "CNX has said it would only go through with it if the federal government allows coal mine methane to qualify for tax credits that were central to Biden's plan to fight climate change.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "That\u2019s spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants.",
      "However, the growth in energy demand comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels and the closure of aging nuclear power plants.",
      "In recent months, governors including Shapiro and state ratepayer advocates have pressured the operator of the mid-Atlantic electricity grid to reduce the amount of money it offers to power plant owners, warning that it will unjustifiably raise electricity bills across the region.",
      "__",
      "This story has been corrected to show that the hydrogen tax credit is for businesses that use it, not make it.",

      "Some legal scholars say they're concerned about what this could mean for free speech on college campuses following more than a year of tension between students, faculty and administrators, while other experts noted that past McCarthy-era cases on communist activity could foreshadow the action's legal standing.",
      "The main thrust of the executive order's purpose: \"Jewish students have faced an unrelenting barrage of discrimination; denial of access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and physical threats and assault,\" the order reads.",
      "The fact sheet released by the White House on the new executive action threatens to \"deport\" college students in the United States on student visas and other \u201cresident aliens\u201d who expressed \"pro-Hamas\" or \"pro-jihadist\" views to \"combat antisemitism on college campuses and in communities across the nation.\" It calls for immediate action to be taken by the Department of Justice to \"quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.\"",
      "\"It provides like a signaling mechanism and an alibi for university administrators who ... want to crack down on Palestinian activism, and now they can point to this executive order and use the government as a further pretext for their actions, even though they're under no legal obligation to do what the executive order says,\" said Darryl Li, a legal scholar at the University of Chicago, in an interview with ABC News.",
      "He added that in his legal opinion, \"They're not under a legal obligation to spy on their students and to report their students to the government. They need not, and they should not, cooperate with this executive order.\"",
      "However, past Supreme Court cases -- particularly during the McCarthy era and the Cold War -- found it is within Congress' power to deport a legal noncitizen resident for their views, advocacy or membership in a political group if it's in the interest of national security, Nadine Strossen, a Senior Fellow with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), told ABC News.",
      "These limitations also impact noncitizens attempting to enter the country, Strossen noted.",
      "\"There was this distinction; it's one thing to say, government may not prosecute you, you may not be subject to civil penalties, but you may still be subject to deportation because of this doctrine that Congress has what's called plenary power, pretty much unchecked power, with respect to matters concerning who is able to be present in this country and not present in this country,\" said Strossen.",
      "On Oct. 7, 2023, the Palestinian terror group Hamas attacked Israel, killing roughly 1,200 people, and around 250 others were taken hostage, according to the Israeli government.",
      "Israel then began its monthslong retaliation on the Gaza Strip, killing more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",
      "The United States and the United Nations have not officially declared Israeli action to be a genocide. However, a UN Special Committee report found that Israel\u2019s warfare methods in Gaza were consistent with genocidal tactics.",
      "Protests and around-the-clock encampments concerning the war erupted at colleges and universities around the country.",
      "Pro-Palestinian protesters called for an end to what they called an Israeli \"genocide\" against Palestinians and criticized the Israeli \"occupation\" of Palestinian territories. Pro-Israel protesters called for a return of the hostages or were in support of the Israeli effort against Hamas.",
      "Colleges were thrust into the spotlight as they reckoned with charges of antisemitism and Islamophobia, and anti-Israeli, anti-Arab or anti-Palestinian sentiment amid the campus clashes.",
      "Title IV, a law that bans discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in any institution or program that receives federal funding from the U.S. Department of Education, became the center of dozens of investigations across the country.",
      "Students and professors, many of whom were advocating for a ceasefire or pushing for an end to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, were subsequently arrested at universities and protests across the country. Some were suspended or expelled from their universities, others were arrested for trespassing or disturbing the peace, though many charges were later dropped.",
      "Student protesters critical of the Israeli government's military actions in Gaza continue to face accusations of antisemitism. But many of the student groups behind the protests \u2013 including Jewish activists \u2013 have said that individuals making inflammatory remarks do not represent their groups or their values concerning the war in Gaza.",
      "Other Jewish or pro-Israel students around the country have spoken out about the pressures they too have faced, including renewed concerns about safety and acts of hate as law enforcement noted a spike in antisemitic incidents.",
      "Trump's executive order calls on higher education institutions to familiarize themselves with 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3) -- which defines \"inadmissible\" non-citizens for their relationship to alleged \"terrorist activities.\"",
      "FIRE released a statement against Trump's executive order, arguing that college campuses are intended to be places of learning and debate over a wide range of issues: \"Advocates of ideological deportation today should not be surprised to see it used against ideas they support in the future.\"",
      "\"This openness, albeit unpleasant or controversial at times, is a defining strength of American higher education,\" an online statement read. \"It\u2019s one of the features attractive to students traveling from abroad who may hope to take part in the speech protections Americans have worked so hard to preserve. These are protections that they may very well be denied in their home countries.\"",
      "International students, or staff members with visas, are in a vulnerable situation because of their status, legal experts say.",
      "\"The potential loss of the visa is something that, of course, is devastating to international students. And if your visa is revoked on sort of security or terrorism grounds, it's kind of like a lifelong -- you're basically banned from the United States for life, even if you have family who are U.S. citizens who live in the United States,\" said Radhika Sainath, a senior staff attorney at Palestine Legal, who has advised hundreds of free speech or censorship cases concerning pro-Palestinian supporters.",
      "Legal experts argue the order's vague language is strategic to smear pro-Palestinian support -- though the order doesn't explicitly state concerns over support for \"Palestinians\" -- which has long been painted as inherently antisemitic or terroristic.",
      "\"This is McCarthyist. It's authoritarian,\" said Sainath. \"Students are really feeling the breadth already. Before Trump came in -- from their own universities -- students have been evicted from student housing and been homeless for minor, minor rule violations. They've been suspended, they've been expelled, they've lost scholarships, they've lost financial aid. The harm is really, really great, and many of these students are first-generation students. They are low-income students, and it can be quite harmful to be punished again for speaking out against a genocide.\"",

      "The timing on when Trump plans to sign the order remains unclear, but sources familiar with the process told ABC News that conversations about the future of the department have been actively occurring.",
      "Closing down the department would be an extraordinary move that would help Trump inch closer to fulfilling the promise that he made for months on the campaign trail: dismantling it and sending education policy back to the states.",

      "The Democrats called the actions against USAID \u201cillegal\u201d and a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d while vowing to take their defense of the agency to the courts.",
      "\u201cWhat Trump and Musk have done is not only wrong, it's illegal,\" said Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia during a news conference outside USAID headquarters. \"USAID was established by an act of Congress, and it can only be disbanded by an act of Congress. Stopping this will require action by the courts and for Republicans to show up and show courage and stand up for our country.\u201d",
      "Beyer was joined by fellow Reps. Gerry Connolly, Eugene Vindman and Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia; Jamie Raskin, Johnny Olszewski and Sarah Elfreth of Maryland; and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and Yassamin Ansari of Arizona.",

      "\u201cWe're here today, not only to fight for federal employees who dedicate themselves every day to a humanitarian task. We are here to save lives, because that is what USAID does,\" said Connolly, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee. \"You name it, USAID is there in the fight against HIV, in the fight to protect the Uyghur population in China, in the fight to protect refugees, in the fight to make sure that there's food security everywhere \u2026 It is the lead development agency in the world, and no one elected Elon Musk to dismantle it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are going to fight in every way we can in the courts, in public opinion, with the bully pulpit, in the halls of Congress, and here at USAID itself. We are not going to let this injustice happen,\u201d Connolly added.",

      "ABC NEWS: Joining us now for more is the president of Refugees International and former lead official at USAID for COVID-19, Jeremy Konyndyk. Thank you so much for your time, sir. You also were the director of USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance under President [Barack] Obama. A former USAID employee told ABC News people are going to die because of how they're doing this. Your response to what many are calling the \"hostile takeover\" of USAID?",
      "KONYNDYK: I think that's an accurate way to characterize it. USAID every day save lives around the world on behalf of the American people, whether that is in disaster zones, deploying teams after earthquakes to pull people from the rubble. Fighting famine right now in Sudan, providing urgent medical care. And it's the ceasefire in Gaza and also longer-term work through the Global Health Bureau. Things like keeping 20 million people who have HIV on antiretroviral drugs to keep their infection suppressed so they can live their lives. These are the critical things that USAID does all around the world, every day. All of those are now badly disrupted. All of those are now at risk.",
      "ABC NEWS: If you could get a message directly to Elon Musk tonight. What would you tell him?",
      "KONYNDYK: I would tell him: Look past the stereotypes and the caricatures that you have seemingly created about what USAID is and actually talk to the people working there. I served in that agency twice. Some of the images that you're seeing on the screen of disaster relief, those are the sorts of things that I actually led and oversaw. All of that is offline right now. The people [there], because they are professionals, they care deeply about the mission. Fairfax County Search and Rescue -- these are the people who go out after an earthquake and save lives. That is why the staff at USAID does what they do. That is why they are there. They are. They just want to do their jobs. They want to be supported. And it is really heartbreaking and frankly enraging to see the kind of misinformation, disinformation, that is now spewing on the Internet about this agency -- none of which bears resemblance to the reality that I know and have experienced myself.",
      "ABC NEWS: Now, we might be here for a while if you listed off all the important work USAID has done around the world: 25 million lives saved from HIV, beating Ebola, expanding child literacy. What are you hearing tonight from former colleagues who made helping others, with the backing of our government, their life's work?",
      "KONYNDYK: Well, they feel they feel abused. They feel betrayed. There are staff who are deployed on disaster and humanitarian responses around the world on behalf of the U.S. government, who tonight -- in the last night with no preamble, no warning and no communication -- were kicked off their email, kicked off their U.S. government computer systems. They don't know if they are still government employees. They are now in disaster zones and crisis zones, unsure whether they are still even under embassy protection. It's incredibly, incredibly dangerous and it is incredibly disrespectful to people who have gone into dangerous places to serve their country.",
      "ABC NEWS: Talk about the soft power America has been able to wield through USAID.",
      "KONYNDYK: You mentioned earlier 25 million lives saved that would have been lost to HIV. That's an incredible benefit to the world. It's an incredible legacy of the George Bush administration, which which first launched that program called the PEPFAR program: the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief. But it's also things like democracy programs helping helping Ukraine during the war to keep their economy going, to be able to keep their agricultural sector going, providing disaster relief to communities that have been bombed by by the Russian invasion. It is supporting people who are being you who have been trafficked, people who have been forced into human trafficking. It is human rights work, supporting human rights defenders, supporting democracy activists. You know, it really runs the gamut of everything from health and disaster relief to long-term economic development. It's also a really critical way that the U.S. just shows up in the world, vis-\u00e0-vis some of our geopolitical rivals. So one of the things that I'm very worried about is the ways in which rivals of the United States will take advantage of the vacuum left if USAID is pulled from the field. Just last night, Dmitri Medvedev, the former president of Russia, still very close to [current Russian President Vladimir] Putin, was cheering on Elon Musk on [X.com] for taking down USAID. American politicians and particularly some of the Republican members of Congress who have been quite silent should ask themselves: Why does Dmitry Medvedev think it's a good thing for Russia if USAID is gone?",
      "ABC NEWS: What's the answer?",
      "KONYNDYK: Well, because he knows that what USAID does is advance American values around the world and show a good face -- a positive face of American generosity, support and solidarity to countries around the world. That's very hard for Russia to compete with. That's very hard for China to compete with. And it removes one of the main strategic advantages that the U.S. has in our foreign policy, if we pull back the positive solidarity and support that USAID provides in so many countries.",
      "ABC NEWS: Why do you think the Trump administration is specifically targeting USAID, its $50 billion budget? After all, is is really a small fraction of the overall government expenditures.",
      "KONYNDYK: Well, it is certainly not about saving money. The USAID budget is less than 1% of the federal budget. That is a rounding error relative to the size of our deficit. It's far less than the tax cuts that Trump passed in his first term. I suspect what it is, is it is a soft target. They assume not too many people are going to stand up for foreign aid. It's an easy thing to caricature and demonize. And, you know, the playbook that they are running here at USAID, which is a playbook by which an unelected private citizen with cover from the president can go in and just destroy an independent federal agency without any sort of congressional oversight, without any sort of restraints from the law. That is a really, really dangerous playbook. And I think they're assuming that if they can get away with it at USAID, they can export that model elsewhere.",
      "ABC NEWS: I understand Refugees International does not receive money directly from USAID, but if this funding pause continues, is it even possible for organizations like yours to to pick up the slack?",
      "KONYNDYK: Well, I think this is if this goes forward, it really is an extinction-level event for the global aid sector in the United States -- and really for much of the global relief and development sector around the world. The U.S. is the largest single development donor, the largest single humanitarian donor. And if that goes away, there's no way that others can fill that gap. But it will also destabilize the budgets of many of the largest aid organizations and [United Nations] organizations around the world. So, you know, it threatens really the collapse not just of what USAID does, but of this huge ecosystem of relief and development organizations that are doing good around the world every day.",
      "ABC NEWS: Jeremy Konyndyk, we thank you so much for your time.",
      "KONYNDYK: Thank you.",

      "Sheinbaum said Mexico has agreed to \"reinforce\" the Mexico-U.S. border with 10,000 National Guard troops \"immediately.\" She also said the U.S. had agreed to work to prevent high-powered weapons from being trafficked into Mexico.",

The U.S. president was expected to sign executive orders on Tuesday putting in place 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada and 10% tariffs on those from China, according to the White House.",
      "Trump said Monday afternoon he plans to talk to China in the next day or two about tariffs on that country.",
      "Sheinbaum in a video posted to social media on Sunday said her government was calling for \"reason and law\" among \"individuals as well as among nations.\"",
      "'This measure of 25% tariffs has effects for both countries but it has very serious effects for the U.S. economy,\" she said, \"because it will raise the costs of all the products that are exported from Mexico to the U.S., it will have a 25% higher cost.\"",
      "Trudeau responded to the planned tariffs on Saturday evening, announcing his country will implement 25% tariffs on 155 billion Canadian dollars, or about $107 billion, of U.S. goods. The prime minister said he has not talked to Trump since his inauguration.",
      "Sheinbaum, who was elected in June, offered little detail on how her government's \"Plan B\" would respond to the tariffs.",
      "She instructed her economic secretary to \"implement Plan B that we have been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,\" she said in a statement written in Spanish and translated by ABC News.",
      "She also sought to remind the White House that the current free trade agreements between the U.S. and Mexico have been in place for about three decades.",
      "\"The last free trade agreement was signed by President L\u00f3pez Obrador and President Trump himself,\" she said.",
      "Trump on Sunday told reporters he was unconcerned about the potential impact of imposing tariffs on close trading partners, saying the American people would understand.",
      "\"We may have short term, some, a little pain, and people understand that, but, long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world,\" he told reporters on Sunday, as he departed Air Force One at Maryland's Joint Base Andrews.",
      "He added, \"We have deficits with almost every country, not every country, but almost. And we're going to change it. It's been unfair. That's why we owe $36 trillion; we have deficits with everybody.\"",
      "Canada\u00a0has been taking advantage of the U.S., Trump said, calling the relationship with the country a \"one-way street.\"",
      "\"They don't allow our banks. Did you know that\u00a0Canada\u00a0does not allow banks to go in, if you think about it, that's pretty amazing,\" he said. \"If we have a U.S. bank, they don't allow them to go in.\"",
      "Trump added, \"Canada\u00a0has been very tough on oil, on energy. They don't allow our farm products in. Essentially, they don't allow a lot of things in, and we allow everything to come in. It's been a one-way street.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 10:14:11 -0500",
    "summary": "While no specific reason was given, three employees told ABC News they believe the common thread among them is attendance at a voluntary diversity training.",
    "story": [
      "Some said they think it's because they attended voluntary diversity training.",
      "Dozens of Department of Education employees received letters as business hours closed Friday placing them on administrative leave, according to a copy of one letter obtained by ABC News.",
      "While no specific reason was given, some employees told ABC News they believe the only common thread among them is that they attended a voluntary training called the \"Diversity Change-Agent Training Program.\"",
      "The letter states that the administrative leave notice is not for disciplinary purposes. Rather, it's being issued under President Donald Trump's executive order on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and \"further guidance\" from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, according to the letter.",
      "Per the letter, employees will receive full pay and benefits through the end of the administrative leave. They are not required to do work-related tasks during this time, nor are they required to come into the office. Employees who were placed on leave also had their government email access suspended as they received the letters. There's no set time for the leave period, according to the letter.",
      "The letters have caused a frenzy throughout the department, as some employees had been locked out of their accounts and had to check their private email addresses for the notice, according to Sheria Smith, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 252.",
      "Smith told ABC News more than 50 employees in \"extremely diverse roles\" within the department received the email notices to their government email addresses or their private email accounts after regular business hours over the weekend.",
      "ABC News spoke with three Department of Education employees who received the letters and described their leave as \"paid administrative hell\" since Friday evening.",
      "\"It's very, very, unsettling,\" one department employee of over 20 years, who works in Washington, D.C., told ABC News. \"I don't get it. What's my crime? What have I done?\"",
      "Smith said the positions of Department of Education employees placed on leave run the gamut, from senior civil rights attorneys to attorneys for borrower defense to press specialists. She said she feared more letters would be sent in the coming days.",
      "An attorney who works for the department in Washington, D.C., said they were put on leave from their \"dream job.\" The employee has two children and received the notice after putting them to bed on Friday night, they said. The person said Friday was tough and the news was shocking to receive, but now they're feeling \"different levels\" of sadness.",
      "\"My mood felt a little bit different just waking up knowing that I wasn't going to be working,\" the employee told ABC News.",
      "\"But I just feel like there's a lot of information that I'm trying to process and, with small kids, it's like you're trying to balance a lot,\" the employee added.",
      "The letters came as the Trump administration worked to scrub the federal government's DEI policies and programs. The president issued an executive order during his first week in office calling on agencies to \"combat\" private-sector DEI programs.",
      "Trump's rhetoric -- including threatening for months to shutter the Department of Education -- has created fear throughout the department, according to Smith.",
      "\"People took these jobs because they care about the mission,\" Smith told ABC News. \"And so it absolutely impacts us. You know, the very thing that brought us to these jobs we're unable to do.\"",
      "The department employee with two small children has worked for the department for just over four years and comes from a family of educators. The employee said education is the \"great equalizer,\" and the Department of Education benefits everyone.",
      "\"I believe in the department,\" the department attorney said, adding: \"I always wanted to work here.\"",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Department of Education Deputy Assistant Secretary for Communications Madi Biedermann said the president was elected to enact \"unprecedented reform\" that is merit-based and efficient at serving the interests of the American people.",
      "\"We are evaluating staffing in line with the commitment to prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in schools and putting student outcomes above special interests,\" Biedermann wrote.",
      "ABC News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Meanwhile, the three department employees who spoke to ABC News said they're completely stumped on why they were issued administrative leave notices. The department employee with decades of experience in Washington also said it's puzzling, in part, because during Trump's first term, managers were evaluated on upholding DEI standards via a department performance rating system.",
      "\"We were expected to do DEI,\" the employee said. \"That's what Trump and [then-Education Secretary] Betsy DeVos wanted us to do. They wanted to do that. They put it in our [performance] plans. We did not put that in our plans. And not only that, it is in every manager's plan in the department, not just people that are on administrative leave.\"",
      "\"Every single person in the Department of Education that's a supervisor or a manager right now has [DEI] in their performance plan -- that is programmed in by the department,\" the employee added.",
      "The administrative leave notices may have been tied to a two-day \"Diversity Change-Agent Training Program,\" a facilitator-led training, according to training document slides obtained by ABC News. The training took place over two days dating as far back as March 2019, under DeVos and during Trump's first term, according to a February 2019 email obtained by ABC News with the subject \"Diversity Change Agent Course.\"",
      "The training program aimed to create specific action plans to \"drive diversity and inclusion\" and increase creativity and innovation. The program also challenged employees to achieve greater results by championing the diversity of its workforce while creating and sustaining an inclusive environment, according to the training document slides.",
      "Another department employee, who took the 2019 training and works remotely out of the New York offices, called the notice \"bizarre,\" especially since the 2019 training occurred during the president's first term.",
      "\"The whole thing is bizarre,\" the department employee told ABC News. \"Betsy DeVos -- and [Trump's] prior administration -- was a decent champion of these programs, and they didn't come with any warning to me to say, 'Hey, taking this training might lead to an adverse personnel action one day,' right? So it's just strange how they can retroactively apply something.\"",
      "The department employees on leave who spoke to ABC News said they have no official DEI responsibilities in their roles. All three department employees who spoke with ABC News also confirmed the only DEI-like program that would potentially be barred under Trump's executive order would be the change-agent training sessions.",
      "However, to their knowledge, the three employees on leave said there's no official list or way of matching the employees on administrative leave with the training programs. Even though they're convinced these trainings link them to the Trump administration's definition of DEI, the employees haven't confirmed why they're on leave, according to the ones who spoke to ABC News.",
      "The employee who works out of New York has more than a dozen years of experience in administering federal programs. Multiple other employees on administrative leave that this employee spoke to over the weekend said they also took the 2019 training, according to the employee.",
      "\"That's the only thing we can think of that any of us did,\" the employee said.",
      "After reaching out to other colleagues with the same titles, the employee in New York said, they \"pieced it together.\" This employee said they took at least three training programs like the diversity change-agent training program since the initial training.",

    "story": [
      "DOJ lawyers argue it creates a \"perverse incentive for illegal immigration.\"",
      "President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship will face its next legal hurdle this week when three separate federal judges hold hearings to consider whether to block the order.",
      "Ahead of the hearings, lawyers with the Department of Justice argued in legal filings that birthright citizenship creates a \"perverse incentive for illegal immigration\" while claiming that Trump's executive order attempts to resolve \"prior misimpressions\" of the Fourteenth Amendment.",
      "\"Text, history, and precedent support what common sense compels: the Constitution does not harbor a windfall clause granting American citizenship to, inter alia, the children of those who have circumvented (or outright defied) federal immigration laws,\" Acting Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate wrote in a recent filing.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Coughenour blocked the order last month -- describing it as \"blatantly unconstitutional \" -- with a temporary restraining order that is set to expire this week.",
      "Coughenour scheduled a Thursday morning hearing to consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction ordering the Trump administration to stop enforcing the order.",
      "Judges in two additional federal cases challenging the order also scheduled hearings this week, including a Wednesday hearing in a Maryland case filed by five undocumented pregnant women and a Friday hearing in a lawsuit filed by 18 state attorneys general.",
      "The hearings will likely provide the first opportunity for Department of Justice lawyers to outline their defense of Trump's Day-1 executive order that sought to eliminate birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants or immigrants whose presence in the United States is lawful but temporary.",
      "According to a recent court filing, Trump's executive order clarified the phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction\" within the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment, interpreting the phrase to mean that immigrants in the country unlawfully or temporarily would not be entitled to birthright citizenship.",
      "\"Prior misimpressions of the Citizenship Clause have created a perverse incentive for illegal immigration that has negatively impacted this country's sovereignty, national security, and economic stability,\" the lawsuit said. \"But the generation that enacted the Fourteenth Amendment did not fate the United States to such a reality.\"",
      "Lawyers for the Department of Justice attempted to defend the lawfulness of the order by comparing undocumented immigrants to the foreign diplomats, who are not entitled to birthright citizenship.",
      "\"Just as that does not hold for diplomats or occupying enemies, it similarly does not hold for foreigners admitted temporarily or individuals here illegally,\" the filing said.",
      "While the Supreme Court established birthright citizenship in the 1898 case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, DOJ lawyers claim that the case is only relevant for the children of parents with \"permanent domicile and residence\" in the United States, suggesting the executive order does not run afoul of the longstanding legal precedent.",
      "\"And if the United States has not consented to someone's enduring presence, it follows that it has not consented to making citizens of that person's children,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "Trump's executive order got a frosty reception last month when Judge Coughenour, in the course of issuing his temporary restraining order, reprimanded the Department of Justice attorney who suggested that Trump's executive order was constitutional.",
      "\"I have been on the bench for over four decades,\" said Judge Coughenour. \"I can't remember another case where the question presented is as clear as it is here.\"",
      "Trump, vowing to appeal the temporary restraining order, criticized Judge Coughenour -- who was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1981-- as partisan.",
      "\"Obviously, we'll appeal it. They put it before a certain judge -- in Seattle, I guess, right? And there's no surprises with that judge,\" Trump said from the Oval Office.",

      "They must provide care regardless \u201cof the availability of federal funding,\u201d James told providers, noting that New York State laws prohibit discrimination, which includes \u201cwithholding the availability of services from transgender individuals based on their gender identity or their diagnosis of gender dysphoria, while offering such services to cisgender individuals.\u201d",
      "In a Jan. 28 executive order, Trump threatened to stop providing federal funding and grants to medical institutions that provided gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",

      "USAID has provided more than $2.1 billion in aid to Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "International aid organizations are warning that humanitarian efforts in Gaza would be severely impacted if the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is shut down by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Musk said he was \"in the process\" of \"shutting down\" the agency -- which oversees foreign aid, disaster relief and international development programs -- and that President Donald Trump agreed with him.",
      "Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday that he had been appointed acting director of USAID, saying the agency is \"not functioning\" and that it needs to be aligned with U.S. national interests.",
      "Alex Smith, a former contractor for USAID who advised on nutrition, child health and maternal health, told ABC News that the dismantling of the agency could have a major impact on aid in Gaza.",
      "\"It's going to be devastating,\" said Smith, who left the agency last year. \"You know, countries are already trying to figure out how they're going to fill the gaps, but they just don't have the money, and finding new donors could take years.\"",
      "Smith noted that the Trump administration said previous federal funding freezes wouldn't affect emergency food programs, but that the USAID also provides humanitarian assistance on other fronts.",
      "\"There's a lot more than food aid that USAID does. That's a kind of common misconception -- that all we do is just drop off big bucks and food,\" he said. \"It's about fighting infectious disease, malaria, TB, HIV all over the world. You know, with the conditions in Gaza as they are, we've seen some polio. It's very likely that cholera is already there and it's going to get worse. So we used to have a lot of programs to try to combat those specific infectious diseases.\"",
      "Jesse Marks, senior advocate for the Middle East at the humanitarian organization Refugees International, told ABC News he's worried the stoppage of aid from USAID could put the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in jeopardy.",
      "\"An aid freeze in general, but particularly for Gaza, threatens to undermine what has already been a fragile ceasefire, and the potential for phase two and phase three release of hostages,\" Marks said.",
      "\"I think one of the facets of this that people are not necessarily connecting is that the humanitarian access to Gaza -- which is underpinned by USAID, State Department funds -- was a central feature of the bargain that underpins ceasefire,\" he continued. \"So, if you remove aid to Gaza, whether directly or as a second-order effect of the aid freeze, this raises the risk of a broader ceasefire collapse.\"",
      "USAID has been contributing aid to Gaza and the West Bank since at least 2021, with increased aid after the Israel-Hamas war broke out.",
      "In November 2024, USAID announced it was providing $230 million in additional funding \"to support economic recovery and development programs in the West Bank and Gaza.\" It has given more than $2.1 billion in humanitarian assistance since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs said funding from USAID would allow the agency's partners to provide food assistance, emergency health care and psychosocial services, and could help with providing access to clean drinking water, hygiene products and sanitation services.",
      "In a statement to ABC News last week, the nonprofit International Medical Corps (IMC) said it had received $68 million from USAID to set up and run two large field hospitals in Gaza so it could treat more than 33,000 civilians per month.",
      "The spokesperson also rejected claims from a U.S. State Department official that IMC had used funding from USAID to procure or distribute condoms.",
      "USAID was partly responsible for renewed international pressure on Israel to increase the flow of aid into Gaza.",
      "In April 2024, USAID Administrator Samantha Power testified before Congress, stating that parts of Gaza were experiencing a famine and that conditions were \"as dire as any I have seen in my career.\"",

      "Last week, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced she was canceling a recent extension of the program by former Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas which would have allowed nearly 600,000 current Venezuelan TPS holders to maintain their legal status until October 2026. She had until Feb. 1 to decide whether she'd extend protections for those who joined the program in 2023.",
      "Now, nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants may lose their legal status if they don't have any other type of relief.",
      "The program began in 1990 as a way to protect immigrants who are already in the United States when their home countries are deemed to dangerous to return to. TPS is under the DHS Secretary's discretion.",
      "In the notice, DHS acknowledges that some of the conditions in Venezuela that the Biden administration used to justify TPS designation in 2023, \"may continue.\" However, they claim things have gotten better in the country.",
      "\"There are notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime that allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country,\" the notice file says.",

      "\"Given Venezuela's increased instability, repression, and lack of safety, and within all applicable rules and regulations, we demand more information on why the Department has made this decision,\" the lawmakers said. \"The only justification that has been offered by the Administration is the false claim that all Venezuelans are 'dirt bags,' 'violent criminals' or the 'worst of the worst.'\"",
      "Immigrant advocates are also sounding the alarm about the move some consider \"cruel\" and \"reckless.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump's attempt to revoke protections for 300,000 Venezuelans is as cruel as it is reckless -- but we know he won't stop here. His shock-and-awe approach to dismantling the immigration system is already devastating families and communities across the country, and we're likely to see immigrants from Ukraine and Afghanistan targeted next,\" Keri Talbot, co-executive director of the Immigration Hub, told ABC News.",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A former deep-sea treasure hunter who has served nearly a decade in jail for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of missing gold coins has had that term ended by a federal judge in Ohio, but he will remain behind bars for now.",
      "U.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley agreed Friday to end Tommy Thompson's sentence on the civil contempt charge, saying he \u201cno longer is convinced that further incarceration is likely to coerce compliance.\u201d However, he also ordered that the research scientist immediately start serving a two-year sentence he received for a related criminal contempt charge, a term that was delayed when the civil contempt term was imposed.",
      "Thompson has been held in contempt of court since Dec. 15, 2015, and also incurred a daily fine of $1,000. In his ruling, Marbley assessed Thompson\u2019s total civil contempt fine at $3,335,000.",
      "Thompson\u2019s case dates to his discovery of the S.S. Central America, known as the Ship of Gold, in 1988. The gold rush-era ship sank in a hurricane off South Carolina in 1857 with thousands of pounds of gold aboard, contributing to an economic panic.",
      "Despite an investor lawsuit and a federal court order, Thompson still won\u2019t cooperate with authorities trying to find 500 coins minted from some of the gold, according to court records. He has previously said, without providing details, that the coins \u2014 valued at about $2.5 million \u2014 were turned over to a trust in Belize.",
      "After Thompson failed to appear for a 2012 Ohio hearing to discuss the coins, U.S. marshals eventually tracked him to Florida in 2015 and arrested him. He pleaded guilty in April 2015 to skipping that hearing and was given the two-year prison sentence.",
      "Federal law generally limits jail time for contempt of court to 18 months. But a federal appeals court in 2019 rejected Thompson\u2019s argument that that law applies to him, saying his refusal violated conditions of a plea agreement."

      "North Korea has lashed out at U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a \u201crogue\u201d state and warned that such remarks will never contribute to U.S. interests",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In its first direct criticism of the Trump administration, North Korea lashed out at U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a \u201crogue\u201d state and warned Monday that such \u201ccoarse and nonsensical remarks\u201d will never contribute to U.S. interests.",
      "The statement is the latest in a series of North Korean signals that it will maintain its tough stance on the U.S. for now, though Trump has said he\u2019s intent on reaching out to its leader Kim Jong Un to revive diplomacy.",
      "\u201cThe hostile words and deeds of the person who is in charge of the U.S. foreign policy served as an occasion of confirming once again the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK which remains unchanged,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said, using the acronym of the country's official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "\u201cRubio\u2019s coarse and nonsensical remarks only show directly the incorrect view of the new U.S. administration on the DPRK and will never help promote the U.S. interests as he wishes,\u201d it said.",
      "The statement took issue with what the ministry called Rubio\u2019s branding of North Korea as a \u201crogue\u201d state in a media interview. It likely referred to Rubio\u2019s appearance on \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show\u201d on Jan. 30, in which he called North Korea and Iran \u201crogue states\u201d as he addressed foreign policy challenges.",
      "It was not the first time for U.S. officials to describe North Korea as a rogue state. But the North\u2019s latest statement suggests the country won\u2019t likely quickly embrace Trump\u2019s overture.",
      "During a Fox News interview broadcast on Jan. 23, Trump called Kim \u201ca smart guy\u201d and \u201cnot a religious zealot.\u201d Asked whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied, \u201cI will, yeah.\u201d",
      "Trump's comments raised prospects for a possible revival of diplomacy between the United States and North Korea, as Trump met Kim three times during his first term to discuss how to end Kim's nuclear program. Their earlier high-stakes diplomacy in 2018-19 broke down due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea, but Trump has still repeatedly boasted of his personal ties with Kim.",
      "North Korea hasn\u2019t directly responded to Trump\u2019s interview comments. But it has maintained its confrontational rhetoric against the U.S. and continued its weapons testing activities. Last week, Kim visited a facility to produce nuclear materials and called for boosting North Korea\u2019s nuclear capability in the face of what he called challenges posed by \u201chostile forces,\u201d an apparent reference to the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "Many experts say Kim likely thinks he now has greater leverage than before because of his expanded nuclear arsenal and deepening military ties with Russia.",
      "The previous diplomacy with Trump likely gave Kim a propaganda coup for winning the much-needed recognition of his government on the world stage. But the eventual collapse of diplomacy was still a huge embarrassment.",
      "Kim has since then focused on perfecting nuclear-capable missiles targeting the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "Last November, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington\u2019s \u201cunchangeable\u201d hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats. During a key political meeting in December, Kim vowed to implement the \u201ctoughest\u201d anti-U.S. policy.",

      "The New Jersey man charged with severely injuring author Salman Rushdie in a 2022 knife attack is set to stand trial in New York",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- In 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran towards him and plunged a knife into the author\u2019s hand as he raised it in self-defense.",
      "\u201cAfter that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere,\u201d Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. \u201cI feel my legs give way, and I fall.\u201d",
      "In the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar.",
      "Jury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault.",
      "Under different circumstances, Rushdie\u2019s book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged.",
      "But \u201cthis isn\u2019t a back alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley,\u201d said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. \u201cThis is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.\u201d",
      "Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as still pictures and documentation, Schmidt has said. An estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand over the course of a trial that is projected to last several weeks, he said.",
      "Matar\u2019s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not detailed how he plans to defend his client against the charges. He has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal in light of the prosecution's case.",
      "\u201cThat's not what this is about. It's about due process,\" Barone said. \u201cIt's about receiving a fair trial ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.\"",
      "In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization\u2019s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death. A separate trial on the federal charges \u2014 terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2014 will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.",
      "Rushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "But jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn\u2019t anticipate needing to show Matar\u2019s possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges.",
      "\u201cFrom my standpoint, this is a localized event. It\u2019s a stabbing event. It\u2019s fairly straightforward,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that\u2019s applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I\u2019d like to avoid all of that.\u201d",
      "Barone, the defense attorney, said jurors should be screened for any prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So it\u2019s kind of like the barn door\u2019s been opened,\u201d he said.",
      "Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. Rushdie is a native of India who lived for years in London. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.",
      "Matar has been held without bail since his arrest after being subdued by onlookers who rushed the amphitheater stage. The event\u2019s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded."

      "Just days after President Donald Trump's second inauguration, Ruby Robinson went to Detroit's immigration court to post a notice that a help desk his organization ran for people facing deportation was no longer available.",
      "The desk staffed by the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center shut down after a Trump executive order prompted the Justice Department to instruct nonprofit organizations \u201cto stop work immediately\u201d on four federally funded programs that provided information to people in immigration proceedings.",
      "\u201cThere were individuals in the waiting room who we otherwise would have been able to assist, but we're not able to do so at this time,\u201d said Robinson, managing attorney for the center, which he said has helped about 10,000 people since it began operating the help desk in December 2021.",
      "Without the programs that educate people in immigration courts and detention centers about their rights and the complicated legal process, many will end up navigating the system on their own. Advocates worry that due process and the backlogged immigration courts will suffer as Trump tries to make good on his campaign promise to crack down on illegal immigration.",
      "A coalition of nonprofit groups that provide the services filed a lawsuit Friday challenging the stop-work order and seeking to immediately restore access to the programs.",
      "Despite the loss of federal funding, staff from the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights went to a Virginia detention center to provide services the day after the Jan. 22 stop-work order. They had spoken to about two dozen people when detention center staff escorted them out, telling them they could no longer provide those services, Amica executive director Michael Lukens said, describing the stoppage as \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe often hear that people don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. Why are they detained? What\u2019s going to happen next? And we are being stopped from even giving that basic level of orientation,\u201d Lukens said.",
      "Lawyers running a help desk inside Chicago\u2019s busy immigration court provided services to more than 2,000 people in 2024. The National Immigrant Justice Center started the effort in 2013 with private funding and expanded it three years later with federal funds.",
      "Since the stop-work order, the organization has provided scaled-down services, but they are unsure how long they will be able to continue that with the gap left by federal funding cuts, spokesperson Tara Tidwell Cullen said.",
      "Several organizations said they\u2019ve been told that posters informing people of their services and information about legal help hotlines have been removed from detention centers.",
      "Congress allocates $29 million a year for the four programs \u2014 the Legal Orientation Program, the Immigration Court Helpdesk, the Family Group Legal Orientation and the Counsel for Children Initiative \u2014 funding that's spread among various groups across the country providing the services, Lukens said, adding that the programs have broad bipartisan support. The amount is the same regardless of the number of people they're helping, and the organizations often do additional fundraising to cover their costs, he said.",
      "Trump previously targeted these programs during his first term, but this time things are different.",
      "In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the funding would be pulled from the programs, but the threat of legal action by a coalition of organizations that provide the services, as well as bipartisan support from members of Congress, caused the Justice Department to reverse course.",
      "This time, the action was more abrupt, with the stop-work order issued just hours before it took effect and program staff being barred from detention centers.",
      "Immigration law is incredibly complicated and, unlike in criminal courts, people do not have a right to have an attorney appointed if they cannot afford one, and many end up going through the system without legal representation.",
      "Immigration courts throughout the country are clogged by a backlog of about 3.7 million cases, which can leave people in limbo for years. When people know what to expect and have their affairs in order, hearings move more quickly because judges don't have to explain the basics to each person who appears before them, advocates assert. It can also reduce lines at filing windows in immigration courts because people know what forms they have to fill out and can get help completing them correctly.",
      "People can make informed choices to either move forward with a case knowing their chances and the risks involved or, if they don't want to go through a court battle or don't see any available relief that fits their situation, they may decide not to fight and to just go home, said Edna Yang, co-executive director of American Gateways, which operates in three detention centers and the immigration court in San Antonio, Texas.",
      "\u201cStopping programs that actually help people get the information they need isn\u2019t going to fix the system,\u201d Yang said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to make it worse.\u201d",
      "The organizations also make sure due process rights are respected, alert people to imminent filing deadlines, ensure that translators are available and help avoid deportation orders that could unlawfully return asylum seekers to a harmful situation, advocates said.",
      "Milagro, a 69-year-old woman from Venezuela, arrived in the U.S. in May 2024 when she got an appointment through a U.S. government app after spending four years in Mexico.

      "Staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development have been instructed to stay out of its Washington headquarters, and yellow police tape and officers have blocked the lobby",
      "WASHINGTON -- Staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed to stay out of the agency\u2019s Washington headquarters, and yellow police tape and officers blocked the agency's lobby on Monday, after billionaire Elon Musk announced President Donald Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.",
      "USAID staffers also said more than 600 additional employees had reported being locked out of the aid agency\u2019s computer systems overnight. Those still in the system received emails saying that \u201cat the direction of Agency leadership\u201d the headquarters building \u201cwill be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3.\u201d The agency's website vanished Saturday without explanation.",
      "The fast-moving developments come after thousands of USAID employees already have been laid off and programs shut down in the two weeks since President Donald Trump took office. And they show the extraordinary power of Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in the Trump administration. Musk announced closing of the agency early Monday, as Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was out of the country on a trip to Central America.",
      "At a stop in El Salvador, Rubio told reporters that USAID was an uncooperative and opaque agency that had failed to answer questions about its funding or operate in line with the Trump administration's policy agenda.",
      "\u201cAnd that sort of level of insubordination makes it impossible to conduct the sort of mature and serious review that I think foreign aid, writ large, should have,\u201d said Rubio, who added that he was acting director of USAID but also had delegated that authority.",
      "The upheaval follows Trump ordering a freeze on foreign assistance, with widespread effects around the world. The moves by the U.S., the world's largest provider of humanitarian aid, have upended decades of policy that put humanitarian, development and security assistance in the center of efforts to build alliances and counter adversaries including China and Russia.",
      "U.S. and international companies have been forced to shut down tens of thousands of programs globally, leading to furloughs, layoffs and financial crises that have left many fearing the aid community has been too damaged by the freeze to resume work even if funding resumes.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have protested the moves, saying Trump lacks constitutional authority to shut down USAID without congressional approval and decrying Musk\u2019s accessing sensitive government-held information through his Trump-sanctioned inspections of federal government agencies and programs.",
      "\u201cThis is a corrupt abuse of power that is going on,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said at a rally with agency supporters and other Democratic lawmakers in front of the USAID building. \u201cAs my colleague said, it\u2019s not only a gift to our adversaries, but trying to shut down the Agency for International Development by executive order is plain illegal.\u201d",
      "On Monday, two State Department employees who tried to get into the USAID offices said they were turned away by security guards. Later, uniformed Department of Homeland Security officers and security officers blocked the lobby of the USAID\u2019s headquarters using yellow tape with the words \u201cdo not cross.\u201d",
      "The white USAID flag still flew on the empty plaza in front of the agency headquarters Monday morning. Staffers said employees earlier Monday had been able to reach other parts of the agency to clear personal belongings from their offices.",
      "Musk, who's leading an extraordinary civilian review of the federal government with Trump's agreement, said early Monday that he had spoken with Trump about the six-decade U.S. aid and development agency and \u201che agreed we should shut it down.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt became apparent that it's not an apple with a worm it in,\u201d Musk said in a live session on X Spaces early Monday. \u201cWhat we have is just a ball of worms. You\u2019ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It\u2019s beyond repair.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re shutting it down,\u201d he said.",
      "Musk, Trump and some Republican lawmakers have targeted the U.S. aid and development agency, which oversees humanitarian, development and security programs in some 120 countries, in increasingly strident terms, accusing it of promoting liberal causes.",
      "Since Trump took office, appointees brought in from his first term such as Peter Marocco placed more than 50 senior officials on leave for investigation without public explanation, gutting the agency\u2019s leadership. When the agency\u2019s personnel chief announced that the allegations against them were groundless and tried to reinstate them, he was placed on leave as well.",
      "Over the weekend, the Trump administration placed two top security chiefs at USAID on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk\u2019s government-inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official said.",
      "Musk\u2019s DOGE earlier carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. The Washington Post reported that a senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk\u2019s team accessing sensitive information.",
      "USAID, meanwhile, has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we\u2019re getting them out,\u201d Trump said to reporters about USAID on Sunday night.",
      "The Trump administration freeze on foreign assistance has shut down much of USAID\u2019s aid programs worldwide, including an HIV-AIDS program started by Republican President George W. Bush credited with saving more than 20 million lives in Africa and elsewhere. Aid contractors spoke of millions of dollars in medication and other goods now stuck in port that they were forbidden to deliver.",
      "Other programs that would shut down provided education to schoolgirls in Afghanistan under Taliban rule and monitored an Ebola outbreak spreading in Uganda. A USAID-supported crisis monitoring program, which was credited for helping prevent repeats of the 1980s famine in Uganda that killed up to 1.2 million people, has gone offline.",

      "Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet for talks in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet Tuesday as the Israeli prime minister faces competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and the 15-month conflict to end.",
      "Trump is guarded about the long-term prospects for the truce, even as he takes credit for pressuring Hamas and Israel into the hostage and ceasefire agreement that went into effect the day before he returned to office last month.",
      "\u201cI have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,\" Trump told reporters on Monday.",
      "The leaders' talks are expected to touch on a long-sought Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization deal and concerns about Iran's nuclear program, but hammering out the second phase of the hostage deal will be at the top of the agenda.",
      "Netanyahu's arrival in Washington for the first foreign leader visit of Trump's second term comes as the prime minister's popular support is lagging. Netanyahu is in the middle of weekslong testimony in an ongoing corruption trial that centers on allegations he exchanged favors with media moguls and wealthy associates. He has decried the accusations and said he is the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",
      "Being seen with Trump, who is popular in Israel, could help distract the public from the trial and boost Netanyahu\u2019s standing.",
      "It's Netanyahu's first travel outside Israel since the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in November for him, his former defense minister and Hamas\u2019 slain military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza. The U.S. does not recognize the ICC's authority over its citizens or territory.",
      "Netanyahu and Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff on Monday began the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Netanyahu said in statement that the meeting with Witkoff and U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Waltz was \u201cpositive and friendly.\u201d",
      "The Israeli leader said he would send a delegation to Qatar to continue indirect talks with Hamas that are being mediated by the Gulf Arab country, the first confirmation that those negotiations would continue. Netanyahu also said he would convene his security Cabinet to discuss Israel\u2019s demands for the next phase of the ceasefire when he returns to Israel at the end of the week.",
      "Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hard-right members of his governing coalition to abandon the ceasefire and resume fighting in Gaza to eliminate Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of Netanyahu\u2019s key partners, vows to topple the government if the war isn\u2019t relaunched, a step that could lead to early elections.",
      "Hamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces\u2019 full withdrawal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, maintains that Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.",
      "Mira Resnick, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli and Palestinian affairs, said Trump may \u201chave little patience for political woes of Netanyahu if it gets in the way of the broader goals of this administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe president started his term by saying that he wanted the ceasefire to be in place by Jan. 20. That's what he got,\" Resnick said. \"He is invested in this because he was able to take credit for it.\u201d",
      "Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among the hostages, called on Trump to use American leverage to keep Netanyahu committed to the agreement.",
      "Matan, 24, is among those who are expected to be included in the second phase of the deal, when all remaining living hostages \u2014 including men under the age of 50 and male soldiers \u2014 are to be exchanged for a yet-to-be-determined number of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase is also expected to include the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.",
      "\u201cI want President Trump to know there are certain extreme elements from within Israel who are trying to torpedo his vision,\u201d said Zangauker, who traveled to Washington from Israel to join a planned Tuesday rally outside the White House. \u201cWe are representative of the vast, vast majority of Israel. The ultra-extremists are blackmailing the prime minister to do their bidding.\u201d",
      "Since returning to office, Trump has called for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, even as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II have rejected it. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League have joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "Yet Trump insists he can persuade Egypt and Jordan to come around to accept displaced Palestinians because of the significant aid that the U.S. provides Cairo and Amman. Hard-line right-wing members of Netanyahu's government have embraced the call to move displaced Palestinians out of Gaza.",
      "Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, said the push by Trump to move Palestinians out of Gaza is helpful to Netanyahu. But he added that it undercuts Trump and Netanyahu's desire to land a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia.",
      "The Saudis, the biggest Arab power in the Middle East, have said they would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.",
      "\u201cThis push by Trump doesn\u2019t square with the idea of a Palestinian state as we know it,\u201d Telhami said. \u201cIt's hard to see the Saudis going along with it.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu on Monday met with Trump\u2019s pick to serve as ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and evangelical leaders. Huckabee has long rejected a Palestinian state in territory previously seized by Israel.",
      "The prime minister is also expected to press Trump to take decisive action on Iran. Tehran has faced a series of military setbacks, including Israeli forces significantly degrading Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon as well as an operation that decimated Iran's air defenses. The moment, Netanyahu believes, has created a window to decisively address Tehran's nuclear program.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the most important and critical meetings between an American president and an Israeli prime minister,\u201d said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake here is not just bilateral relations between Israel and the United States but the reshaping of the Middle East.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday told hospitals that they would be violating state law if they stop offering gender-affirming care for people under age 19 in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at curtailing federal funding for such treatments.",

      "\"Regardless of the availability of federal funding, we write to further remind you of your obligations to comply with New York State laws,\" her letter reads.",

      "The letter from James came as some hospitals in Colorado, Virginia and Washington, D.C., said they were pausing gender-affirming treatments for young people while administrators evaluate the order. The White House on Monday released a statement that said the executive order was \u201calready having its intended effect.\u201d",

Fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents in the U.S. with commercial insurance received puberty blockers or hormones during a recent five-year period, according to a new study."

      "\u201cPresident Trump shares my passion for energy,\u201d Wright said at his confirmation hearing last month, promising that if confirmed, he would \u201cwork tirelessly to implement (Trump's) bold agenda as an unabashed steward for all sources of affordable, reliable and secure American energy.\u201d",
      "That includes oil and natural gas, coal, nuclear power and hydropower, along with wind and solar power and geothermal energy, Wright said.",
      "Trump\u2019s energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits, including the fact that U.S. oil production is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits.",

      "Just a day before President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China go into effect, the world appears to be bracing for the possible impacts",
      "WASHINGTON -- Just a day before President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China go into effect, the world is bracing for the possible impacts. There is uncertainty about whether a deal could be reached or whether the tariffs are a harbinger of a broader trade war as Trump has promised more import taxes to come.",
      "Trump posted on social media that he spoke Monday morning with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and would \u201cbe speaking to him again at 3:00 P.M.\u201d The U.S. president has said he also would talk Monday with his counterpart in Mexico. Both Canada and Mexico are about to levy their own tariffs in response to U.S. actions.",
      "Trump used his Monday social media post to repeat his complaints that Canada has been uncooperative, despite decades of friendship and partnerships that range from World War II to the response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States.",
      "\u201cCanada doesn\u2019t even allow U.S. Banks to open or do business there,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cWhat\u2019s that all about? Many such things, but it\u2019s also a DRUG WAR, and hundreds of thousands of people have died in the U.S. from drugs pouring through the Borders of Mexico and Canada.\u201d",
      "Financial markets, businesses and consumers are braced for the impact of the new tariffs that also include an import tax against China. Stock market indices were set for a modest selloff, suggesting some hope that the import taxes that could push up inflation and disrupt global trade and growth would be short-lived.",
      "But the outlook reflected a deep uncertainty about a Republican president who has talked with adoration about tariffs, even saying the U.S. government made a mistake in 1913 by switching to income taxes as its primary revenue source. Trump said Sunday the tariffs would lift if Canada and Mexico did more to crack down on illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling, though there are no clear benchmarks. Trump also said the U.S. can no longer run a trade imbalance with its two largest trade partners.",
      "Mexico is facing a 25% tariff, while Canada would be charged 25% on its imports to the United States and 10% on its energy products. China is facing a 10% additional tariff due to its role in the making and selling of fentanyl, the Trump White House said.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Monday that it was misleading to characterize the showdown as a trade war despite the planned retaliations and risk of escalation.",
      "\u201cRead the executive order where President Trump was absolutely, 100% clear that this is not a trade war,\u201d Hassett said. \u201cThis is a drug war.\"",
      "But even if the orders are focused on illegal drugs, Trump's own remarks have often been more about his perceived sense that foreign countries are ripping off the United States by running trade surpluses. On Sunday, Trump said that tariffs would be coming soon on countries in the European Union. He has discussed tariffs as both a diplomatic tool on national security issues, a way to raise revenues and a vehicle for renegotiating existing trade pacts.",
      "Multiple economists outside the administration have warned that the tariffs would push up prices and hamper growth, with Trump himself saying there would be some short term pain after having campaigned last year on the promise that he could tame inflation.",

      "The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the University of Michigan on behalf of five individuals who took part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Jonathan Zou, a second-year student at the University of Michigan, was among the thousands of students who joined pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses nationwide this past year. Although the campus protests have subsided, the repercussions for students like Zou remain.",
      "Since his arrest by university police last Oct. 7 after using a megaphone during a pro-Palestinian march, Zou has been banned from all University of Michigan campuses, except for attending class or seeking medical care.",
      "Zou is one of five individuals facing similar bans who the American Civil Liberties Union is representing in a lawsuit that accuses the University of Michigan of violating their right to free speech. The lawsuit, filed Monday by the ACLU in federal court, also argues that the university \u201cabused its authority to ban people from public property.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe university says it appreciates this history of activism, but it will arrest students, ban students, surveil students and repress them through legal or school disciplinary means,\" Zou said in an interview before the lawsuit was filed.",
      "In response to a request for comment, a University of Michigan spokesperson said the university has not been served with the lawsuit and has no comment at this time.",
      "Pro-Palestinian demonstrations swept college campuses last spring, with activists setting up tent encampments and, in some cases, escalating their protests further. Thousands were arrested; while many had their cases dismissed, others remain in legal limbo as they pursue their education.",
      "On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for aggressive action to fight antisemitism on college campuses and promising to prosecute offenders and revoke visas for international students found to be what he called \u201cHamas sympathizers.\u201d",
      "Michigan has been deeply affected by tensions over the Israel-Hamas war, with metro Detroit home to the nation\u2019s largest Arab American community and a significant Jewish population. These dynamics have sparked unrest on University of Michigan campuses, resulting in police clashes with protesters and demonstrators targeting university regents for protests.",
      "Last week, the University of Michigan suspended a pro-Palestinian group for two years and pulled its funding after accusing the group of violating the university\u2019s standards of conduct.",
      "The ACLU's lawsuit was brought on behalf of Zou and one other current student, two recent graduates and an Ann Arbor community member. According to the lawsuit, the individuals were each issued trespass bans after being accused of misconduct during protests, but never formally charged for it.",
      "Zou was participating in a march on the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus on the one-year anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and another 250 were taken hostage. The 2023 attack sparked a war that has devastated the Hamas-ruled Gaza strip.",
      "Zou was arrested after using a megaphone during the march, but never formally charged.",
      "The trespass bans have upended individuals \u201cdaily lives, disrupted their, education and work, and are blocking their ability to speak and protest freely on the University\u2019s vast campus,\u201d according to the lawsuit. The individuals are asking the federal court to lift their bans and prevent the university from issuing broad trespassing bans in the future.",
      "A ceasefire took effect last month between Hamas and Israel, leading to hostage-for-prisoner swaps and a flood of aid into the Gaza Strip after a 15-month ground war marked by devastation, hunger and mass displacement in the territory. Looming large is the possibility that fighting will resume if the ceasefire breaks down after the six-week first phase.",

Lindsey Graham, one of President Donald Trump's closest congressional allies, is kicking off his pursuit of a fifth term with two of his home state's top Republicans chairing his 2026 campaign, an early show of strength in a race where the longtime lawmaker is expected to face primary challengers.",
      "Graham's campaign told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Sen. Tim Scott and Gov. Henry McMaster will chair his 2026 run. Scott, the state's junior senator, is current chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the chamber's campaign arm and \u2014 after challenging Trump for the 2024 presidential nomination \u2014 campaigned for him during the GOP primary.",

      "Both McMaster and Scott were surrogates for Trump in the 2024 presidential campaign, and their early support for Graham in his own bid is intended as a signal of strength for the incumbent in a state where Trump has maintained high popularity since his 2016 run.",
      "It's also an early strike in the race, where Graham \u2014 as he typically does \u2014 is expected to face primary challengers. The Trump confidant has long been targeted by the far right in his state, critiqued by his own party and booed at a home-state rally.",
      "County-level Republican parties have censured Graham a number of times for his willingness to work on bipartisan deals. One such measure derided Graham\u2019s \u201ccondescending attitude\u201d to the party\u2019s grassroots organizers.",

      "Last month, Graham's campaign said he had more than $15.6 million cash on hand for his reelection bid, including nearly a million raised in the last quarter of 2024 alone.

      "Potential Republican primary challengers for this cycle include South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, and Adam Morgan, a former South Carolina legislator who lost a primary bid last year against U.S. Rep. William Timmons.",

While Walz comfortably won reelection in 2022, the issue resurfaced after presidential candidate Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate.",

    "summary": "America&rsquo;s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
    "story": [
      "America\u2019s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
      "WEST ORANGE, N.J. -- Along the long road from American icon to endangered species and back again, the bald eagle \u2014 the national bird of the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky \u2014 is having a moment.",
      "The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since the early 2000's, when the federal government took the thriving birds off its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally, too, the animals are soaring.",
      "In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the country's national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a bit). This month, New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence \u2014 and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship in the Super Bowl this weekend.",
      "How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales, it's complex.",
      "The story \u2014 there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance \u2014 centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972.",
      "To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to \u201cincubate\u201d while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so I think now it\u2019s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,\u201d said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska.",
      "Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're \u201cfairly adaptable\" and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey \u2014 from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.",
      "She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town \u2014 New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans \u2014 that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it.",
      "\u201cThose birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?\u201d",
      "The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. One bird, a male named Freedom, perched atop a branch in his enclosure at the zoo recently and called out loudly. He was found dangling by a rope, left with an injury that renders him unreleasable, Fazio said.",
      "There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.",
      "Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month.",
      "She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in a number of Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.",
      "The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an \u201cumbrella species,\u201d whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser known wildlife.",
      "\u201cAmericans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles,\" Clark said.",
      "Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green \u201cBirds\u201d cap and binoculars.",

      "San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors appears ready to grant newly elected Mayor Daniel Lurie greater powers to expedite the city\u2019s response to its fentanyl and homelessness crisis",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco's Board of Supervisors is poised to grant newly elected Mayor Daniel Lurie greater powers and flexibility to expedite the city's response to a fentanyl crisis that has turned sidewalks into open-air dens of drug consumption and homelessness.",
      "The legislation, which supervisors will vote on Tuesday, eliminates competitive bidding requirements for some contracts and allows the administration to solicit private donations to quickly add 1,500 shelter beds and hire more public safety and behavioral health specialists. It is the first piece of legislation for Lurie, a Levi Strauss heir and anti-poverty nonprofit founder who had never held elective office until he squashed Mayor London Breed's reelection bid last year.",
      "The proposal already has the six votes needed to pass, and will likely pick up more votes Tuesday.",
      "The 11-member board relinquishing oversight powers for an effort with no concrete plan or accountability metrics underscores how desperate supervisors are for a solution. It also signals their embrace \u2014 for now \u2014 of a political outsider who pledged to work collaboratively to create common-sense solutions.",
      "Supervisor Connie Chan said last week at the budget and finance committee she chairs that board oversight helps ensure taxpayer money is spent judiciously and transparently. But she also said this is \u201ctruly an unprecedented time\" that calls for unusual measures, and she appreciated the mayor's willingness to compromise. Breed had a frosty relationship with the board's progressive members, Chan included.",
      "San Francisco has long been known for its liberal politics, but homeless tent encampments and public drug use surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overdose deaths fueled by cheap and potent fentanyl reached a record high in San Francisco of over 800 in 2023.",
      "In response, frustrated residents voted to enhance police powers and backed crackdowns on street homelessness. They also elected more moderate Democrats to the board.",
      "Lurie's proposal would allow the city to bypass the competitive bidding and procurement process for contracts, grants and leases related to addiction, homelessness and public safety hiring. City departments could sign new leases without board approval. He wants to open a 24-hour drop-off center that would be friendly to police and an alternative to jail.",
      "Supervisors would have only 45 days to vote on contracts up to $25 million \u2014 down from the original $50 million proposed by the mayor \u2014 or relinquish their oversight. Expedited contracting would sunset in one year, down from the original five.",
      "San Francisco AIDS Foundation opposes the proposal because it lacks metrics and details, such as how it would actually reduce fentanyl use, said Laura Thomas, the nonprofit's drug policy expert and senior director of HIV & harm reduction policy.",
      "She applauds the mayor's desire for more housing and treatment services but hopes he will not endorse policies forcing people into treatment, which has shown to be ineffective and often counterproductive.",
      "\u201cWe want to know more about what the proposal is,\u201d Thomas said Monday. \u201cWe're raising notes of concern and we want to know more information before we can support it.\u201d",
      "At Wednesday's budget and finance committee, legislative analyst Nicolas Menard warned that waiving competitive bids would likely increase service costs and \u201ccreate opportunities for waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d The fiscal impact is unknown, but the grants and contracts budget for the affected city departments totals just over $1 billion.",
      "\u201cI need to be very clear that you\u2019re giving up a lot here,\" he said.",
      "Still, it passed out of committee to the full board with a unanimous recommendation and in a statement released later that day, Lurie said that with the ordinance \u201cwe are no longer looking the other way \u2014 we are treating the fentanyl crisis like the emergency it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a new era in City Hall.\u201d"

      "A BBC News investigation last year found that unprecedented levels of seizures had sparked fears of more organised criminal activity.",
      "A similar health check facility to the one at Sevington does exist on site at Dover, but it is understood that the government chose not to use it because of worries about potential traffic queues forming at the border.",
      "Ms Manzano said that decision was \"not based on biosecurity\" and added that \"the very purpose of import controls is to keep the bad stuff out and contain it at first point of entry\".",

      "The response from Beijing means companies wanting to import fossil fuels from the US would have to pay the tax in order to do so.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of coal, but it gets most of it from Indonesia, although Russia, Australia and Mongolia are also among its suppliers.",
      "When it comes to the US, China has been increasing imports of LNG from the country, with volumes nearly double 2018 levels, according to Chinese customs data.",
      "But its overall fossil fuel trade is modest, with US imports accounting for just 1.7% of China's total crude oil bought from abroad in 2023. This suggests China is not dependent on the US and so the impact of the tariffs on its economy could be minimal.",

      "Trump's trade war with neighbours is delayed - what did they all get out of it?",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "China is subject to significant US tariffs already and has been since Trump's first term. But the blanket nature of today's new levies from the White House on every single goods import from China - from toys, to mobile phones, to clothes - is new and significant.",
      "Beijing's promised tariff retaliation - including new levies on imports from the US of oil, agricultural machinery and some cars - is far less sweeping. Yet the retaliation moves us into the arena of tit-for-tat action, where the country experiencing the tariffs feels it has no choice but to hit back to show its own citizens it can't be pushed around by a foreign power.",
      "This is the dictionary definition of a trade war - and economic historians warn they tend to generate their own momentum and can rapidly spiral out of control.",
      "Trump has used just about every justification under the sun for tariffs, from raising more tax revenue to boosting American manufacturing and rebalancing trade. But one thing recent days confirm is the new president regards them as a powerful way to compel other nations to do what he wants.",
      "He threatened massive and punitive tariffs on Colombia when it initially refused to accept US flights of its deported nationals, but he lifted the threat when Bogota acquiesced.",
      "The White House might also point to the response of Mexico and Canada yesterday as evidence tariff threats yield results. He had threatened to ride roughshod over his own North American free trade deal unless those nations tightened up on border control. Although how much extra those two countries actually promised yesterday on border security relative to what they were already doing is open to question.",
      "Yet the problem with the White House using tariff threats in this way is that if other countries don't back down - or agreements are not reached - Trump might well feel he has no choice but to follow through or risk losing all credibility. And the targeted country might feel it has to respond with its prepared countermeasures, even if they would prefer not to.",
      "That high-risk dynamic - where things could slip out of control in an atmosphere of distrust and political pressure - is why many analysts and economists are far from comforted by how things have played out with Mexico and Canada this week.",
      "The other reason many economists fear Trump's intimidatory tariff diplomacy is its potentially chilling impact on business investment and confidence. US car firms have a deeply integrated industrial base across America, Mexico and Canada. Automotive parts cross those borders multiple times in the vehicle assembly process.",
      "The levying of 25% tariffs on each of those movements would be disastrous for these businesses. Those North American tariffs have been paused for now, but it's very hard to see US or Canadian automotive executives committing to further investment in those cross-border supply chains any time soon - and perhaps for many years to come.",
      "That will have negative implications for their productivity - and also for the wages of their employees in all three countries. The view of many economists is having cross-border supply chains makes these firms more productive than they would otherwise be and this raises US workers' wages relative to where they would be if they only manufactured in America.",
      "These same effects apply on a global scale. In light of Trump's tariff threats against the European Union, how many US firms are likely to be going ahead with planned investments in Europe - and vice versa?",
      "Countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia benefitted indirectly from the US tariffs imposed on China in Donald Trump's first presidential term, as multinationals shifted manufacturing out of China and into their territories to avoid the taxes and to continue exporting to America. But what if Trump now threatens tariffs against them too?",
      "The huge uncertainty Trump's tariff threats have injected into the global economy - even if they don't always translate into actual new taxes - will likely already be doing damage.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly.",
      "The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs.",
      "Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America.",
      "He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\".",
      "The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\"",
      "So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America.",
      "Does the UK have a trade surplus with the US?",
      "The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data.",
      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",

    "title": "Six things that could go up in price in the US under Trump tariffs",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 23:18:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Economists warn that the introduction of tariffs could lead to prices rising on a wide range of products.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has hit the pause button - for now, at least - on imposing tariffs against imports from US neighbours Canada and Mexico.",
      "Last-minute agreements with the leaders of Mexico and Canada have suspended for a month a tit-for-tat trade war in North America.",
      "The three trade partners have deeply integrated economies and supply chains, with an estimated $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders daily.",
      "Trump says he wants to protect American industry, but many economists warn such tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, who may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly, or to reduce imports, which would mean fewer products available.",
      "So what could get more expensive if Trump's tariffs do eventually go ahead?",
      "Cars",
      "Cars would probably go up in price - by about $3,000 according to TD Economics.",
      "That's because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",
      "As a result of higher taxes paid on the importing of parts to build the cars, it is likely the costs will be passed on to customers.",
      "\"Suffice it to say that disrupting these trends through tariffs... would come with significant costs,\" said Andrew Foran, an economist at TD Economics.",
      "He added \"uninterrupted free trade\" in the car-making sector had \"existed for decades\", which had led to lower prices for consumers.",
      "Trump agrees to pause tariffs on Canada and MexicoWhat are tariffs and will prices go up?",
      "Trump agrees to pause tariffs on Canada and Mexico",
      "What are tariffs and will prices go up?",
      "Beer, Tennessee whiskey and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "However, it's also possible that rather than passing on the cost increase, firms could just import less.",
      "Modelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now.",
      "It's more complex when it comes to spirits. The sector has been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s. Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\".",
      "They say that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises. The trade bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in all three countries.",
      "Houses",
      "Imports of Canadian lumber would be hit by import tariffs to the US. Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".",
      "The industry body has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "When it comes to the trade war with Canada, the \"most obvious\" household impact would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics.",
      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but that are produced using inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November last year came from Canada.",
      "While 25% has been slapped on Canadian goods imported to the US, its energy faces a lower 10% tariff.",
      "Now the US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but the type its refineries are designed to process means it depends on so-called \"heavier\" - i.e. thicker - crude oil from mostly Canada and some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided in retaliation to any US tariffs to reduce crude oil exports, that could lead to prices rising at the petrol pumps.",
      "Avocados",
      "One food import that American consumers could see a significant price increase in is avocados. Grown primarily in Mexico due to its warm, humid climate, Mexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US avocado market each year.",
      "However, if tariffs come into force, the US Agriculture Department has warned that the cost of avocados - along with popular avocado-based dishes like guacamole - could surge, especially by Super Bowl Sunday on 9 February.",
      "What about goods in Canada?",
      "Before Trump's agreement with Justin Trudeau to pause tariffs was announced on Monday, Canada had threatened retaliatory import taxes.",
      "An initial C$30bn tranche had been due to begin on Tuesday - meaning prices would have probably increased for consumers north of the border as well.",
      "Ottawa had released a list of all the US imports that would have immediately been targeted with matching 25% tariffs. They included grocery store staples, like oranges - a produce that Canada cannot grow in abundance due to its cooler climate.",
      "Alcohol originating from the US would also be harder for Canadians to find. Provinces like Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia said they would pull all American booze off their shelves starting on Tuesday.",
      "Any US alcohol - including beer and wine - that Canadians could find would likely see a price increase, as it's on the menu for retaliatory tariffs.",
      "Canadian shoppers might feel the pinch from a weaker Canadian dollar if shopping online.",

      "Failure to secure approval will see Thames edge closer to a temporary nationalisation, which could cost the government some \u00a32bn a year.",
      "The company is still considering whether to appeal against a decision by the water industry regulator Ofwat to increase bills by 35% above inflation over the next five years \u2013 short of the 53% increase it applied for.",
      "Thames Water has been struggling for some time and has been heavily criticised over its performance following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "The dire state of the company's finances emerged about 18 months ago when it began a search for funding to avoid collapse.",
      "The Thames fiasco is a combination of poor historical regulation, greedy shareholders, climate change and management failure. Its debt pile is currently about \u00a317bn.",
      "But regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies to households will continue as normal.",
      "In the latest bid to survive, lenders have offered Thames a further loan of up to \u00a33bn in two instalments.",
      "The first payment is to get it through to the autumn, and a second is to be used if the company decides to appeal against Ofwat's 35% bill rise to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - a process that could take up to a year.",
      "The company has until 18 February to launch an appeal to the CMA.",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "The water industry is in crisis. Can it be fixed?",
      "Investment bank Rothschild is also soliciting bids to take over the company and inject much-needed funds.",
      "The court hearing on Monday is scheduled for four days with a possible extension as a much smaller group of lenders is challenging the terms of the lifeline and proposing an alternative.",
      "Although Thames will not collapse immediately if the deal is not approved by the judge, insiders have acknowledged that the company will move a step closer to temporary nationalisation \u2013 a so-called Special Administration Regime \u2013 if it fails.",
      "The government has already sounded out a number of consultancies to take that on if the situation arises.",
      "The company has been keen to stress that whatever happens, its services to 16 million customers would continue uninterrupted, but big questions about the future of Thames and other key infrastructure providers have been thrown up.",
      "Some argue that Thames should be allowed to go bust and have the government take over the company due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt, took out big dividends and paid executives handsomely. Caving in to its demands for customers to pay more now for a failing service would be a gross injustice.",
      "Others say that poor regulation has allowed this mess. Bills were kept too low for too long which hampered investment in the aging infrastructure that is now being overwhelmed by a wetter climate. Ofwat is fighting yesterday's battle and making things worse by imposing fines of tens of millions of pounds for failures, thus further depriving the company of the funds to fix the very things it is being fined for.",
      "What Thames and ministers both agree on is that neither want this sprawling company on the government's books. Consultancy Teneo has predicted a temporary nationalisation would cost up to \u00a32bn a year.",
      "However, a wider, perhaps more important argument made by some is that the failure of Thames as a private company would send an unhelpful message to the international investors that Chancellor Rachel Reeves hopes will invest hundreds of billions in UK airports, wind farms, rail links and everything else on her long shopping list of growth-boosting projects.",
      "Sources close to the company and its creditors argue that we cannot agonise over and regulate for past mistakes. We are where we are - between a rock and a hard place. Carve out a special deal for Thames - or risk its collapse.",
      "Thames has just over two weeks to appeal to the CMA to bump up the bills it's allowed to charge. It's not without risk - the CMA could revise them down.",
      "Last week, the chair of the CMA was forced out by ministers unimpressed by the regulator's focus on growth. Thames says it needs higher bills to invest \u00a320bn over the next five years. It will be an interesting test case for the new chair."

      "How world responds to Trump's tariffs is what matters next",
      "How do tariffs work?",
      "In practical terms, a tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter the country, proportional to the value of the import.",
      "So a car imported to the US with a value of $50,000 (\u00a338,000) subject to a 25% tariff, would face a $12,500 charge.",
      "The charge is physically paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them.",
      "So, in that sense, it is a straightforward tax paid by domestic US firms to the US government.",
      "Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3.1tn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.",
      "And tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues.",
      "The question of where the final \u201ceconomic\u201d burden of tariffs falls, as opposed to the upfront bill, is more complicated.",
      "If the US importing firm passes on the cost of the tariff to the person buying the product in the US in the form of higher retail prices, it would be the US consumer that bears the economic burden.",
      "If the US importing firm absorbs the cost of the tariff itself and doesn\u2019t pass it on, then that firm is said to bear the economic burden in the form of lower profits than it would otherwise have enjoyed.",
      "'Is it for a day or four years?' Tariff uncertainty spooks small businesses",
      "Trump's tariffs hit China hard before - this time, it's ready",
      "Alternatively, it is possible that foreign exporters might have to lower their wholesale prices by the value of the tariff in order to retain their US customers.",
      "In that scenario, the exporting firm would bear the economic burden of the tariff in the form of lower profits.",
      "All three scenarios are theoretically possible.",
      "But economic studies of the impact of the new tariffs that Trump imposed in his first term of office between 2017 and 2020 suggest most of the economic burden was ultimately borne by US consumers.",
      "A survey by the University of Chicago in September 2024 asked a group of respected economists whether they agreed with the statement that \"imposing tariffs results in a substantial portion of the tariffs being borne by consumers of the country that enacts the tariffs, through price increases\". Only 2% disagreed.",
      "Raising prices",
      "Let\u2019s use a concrete example.",
      "Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018.",
      "Researchers estimate the value of washing machines jumped by around 12% as a direct consequence, equivalent to $86 per unit, and that US consumers paid around $1.5bn extra a year in total for these products.",
      "There is no reason to believe the results of even higher import tariffs from a future Trump administration would be any different in terms of where the economic burden would fall.",
      "The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump\u2019s new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth.",
      "A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.",
      "The left-of-centre think tank Centre for American Progress, using a different methodology, has an estimate of a $2,500 to $3,900 loss for a middle-income family.",
      "Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.",
      "Impact on jobs",
      "Yet Trump has used another economic justification for his tariffs: that they protect and create US domestic jobs.",
      "\u201cUnder my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,\" he said on the campaign trail.",
      "The political context for Trump\u2019s tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labour costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation in 2001.",
      "In January 1994, when Nafta came into effect, the US had just under 17 million manufacturing jobs. By 2016, this had declined to around 12 million.",
      "Yet economists say it is misleading to attribute this decline to trade, arguing that growing levels of automation are also an important factor.",
      "And researchers who studied the impact of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs found no substantial positive effects on overall employment in US industrial sectors that were protected.",
      "Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers.",
      "By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.",
      "It is theoretically possible that employment might have dropped even further without the Trump steel tariffs but detailed economic studies of their impact on US steel still showed no positive employment impact.",
      "And economists have also found evidence suggesting that, because the domestic price of steel rose after the tariffs were imposed, employment in some other US manufacturing sectors, which relied on steel as an input - including the agricultural machinery manufacturer Deere & Co - was lower than it otherwise would have been.",
      "Impact on trade deficit",
      "Trump has criticised America's trade deficit, which is the difference between the value of all the things the country imports and the value of its exports in a given year.",
      "\u201cTrade deficits hurt the economy very badly,\u201d he has said.",
      "In 2016, just before Trump took office, the total goods and services deficit was $480bn, around 2.5% of US GDP. By 2020, it had grown to $653bn, around 3% of GDP, despite his tariffs.",
      "Part of the explanation, according to economists, is that Trump\u2019s tariffs increased the international relative value of the US dollar (by automatically reducing demand for foreign currencies in international trade) and that this made the products of US exporters less competitive globally.",
      "Another factor behind this failure to close the trade deficit is the fact that tariffs, in a globalised economy with multinational companies, can sometimes be bypassed.",
      "For example, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on Chinese imported solar panels in 2018.",
      "The US Commerce Department presented evidence in 2023 that Chinese solar panel manufacturers had shifted their assembly operations to countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and then sent the finished products to the US from those countries, effectively evading the tariffs.",
      "There are some economists who support Trump\u2019s tariff plans as a way to boost US industry, such as Jeff Ferry of the Coalition for A Prosperous America, a domestic lobby group, but they are a small minority of the profession.",
      "Oren Cass, the director of the conservative think tank American Compass, has argued tariffs can incentivise firms to keep more of their manufacturing operations in America, which he argues has national defence and supply chain security benefits.",
      "And the Biden/Harris administration, while sharply criticising Trump\u2019s proposed extension of tariffs, kept in place many of the ones he implemented after 2018.",
      "It also imposed new tariffs on imports of things like electric vehicles from China, justifying them on the grounds of national security, US industrial policy and unfair domestic subsidies from Beijing.",

      "These policy objectives cannot all be achieved simultaneously.",
      "For example, learning from the experience of Trump's first term \"China deal\", Western diplomats have been scrambling to find lists of US goods they might buy more of, in order to give the White House some wins.",
      "Europe could say it is increasing its purchases of US shipments of liquefied natural gas, or arms, or specialised magnets for wind farms.",

      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",

      "Donald Trump's talk of applying new tariffs to goods from America's biggest trade partners has sparked months of uncertainty for business owners.",
      "On Saturday, the president made good on his threats, ordering a new 25% tax on shipments from Mexico and Canada and raising existing tariffs on goods from China by 10%.",
      "But that has not stopped the questions.",
      "\"Is it for a day, is it a political flex or is it something that will last for four years?\" asked Nicolas Palazzi, the founder of Brooklyn-based PM Spirits. He runs a 21-person business that imports and sells wine and spirits, about 20% of which come from Mexico.",
      "Trump's orders set in motion threats that the president has discussed for months, striking at shipments from America's top three trade partners, which together account for more than 40% of the roughly $3tn goods the US imports each year.",
      "Canadian oil and other \"energy resources\" will face a lower 10% rate. But otherwise, there will be no exceptions, the White House said.",
      "Trump said the tariffs were intended to hold Canada and Mexico accountable for promises to address illegal immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "The measures go into effect on 4 February and are to remain in place \"until the crisis is alleviated,\" according to the orders.",
      "If the plans were not a surprise, they still presented a potentially stunning blow to many businesses, especially for those in North America. The three countries have become tightly linked economically after decades of free trade under a treaty signed in the 1990s, known then as Nafta and updated and renamed under the Trump administration to USMCA.",
      "The growth of mezcal in the US, brought in by businesses like Palazzi's, has been part of this shift.",
      "Since 2003, consumption of tequila and mezcal has roughly tripled, increasing at a rate of more than 7% each year, according to Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group.",
      "Overall since the 1990s, trade in spirits between the US and Mexico has surged by more than 4,000% percent, said the organisation, which issued a statement after the president's announcement warning that the tariffs would \"significantly harm all three countries\".",
      "For months, Palazzi has been fielding nervous questions from his suppliers in Mexico, who are typically small, family owned businesses and may not survive if the tariffs are prolonged.",
      "If it sticks, he said the 25% tax on the bottles of mezcal, tequila and rum he brings in will push up prices - and sales will drop.",
      "\"Definitely this is going to impact the business negatively. But can you really plan? No,\" he said. \"Our strategy is roll-with-the-punches, wait and see and adapt to whatever craziness is going to unfold.\"",
      "Economists say the hit from the tariffs could push the economies of Mexico and Canada into recession.",
      "Ahead of the announcement, Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses, described the looming tariffs from the US, and expected retaliation, as \"existential\" for many of his members.",
      "\"Look, we get that the government has got to respond in some fashion \u2026. But at the same time we urge the government to use caution,\" he said, comparing tariffs on imports to chemotherapy: \"It poisons your own people in order to try and fight the disease.\"",
      "\"It's going to have an effect everywhere,\" said Sophie Avernin, director of De Grandes Vi\u00f1edos de Francia in Mexico, noting that many Americans own Mexican alcohol brands and Modelo beer is actually owned by a Belgian company.",
      "Trump, who has embraced tariffs as a tool to address issues far removed from trade, has dismissed concerns about any collateral damage to the economy in the US.",
      "But analysts have warned the measures will weigh on growth, raise prices and cost the economy jobs - roughly 286,000, according to estimates by the Tax Foundation, not including retaliation.",
      "Those in the alcohol business said the industry had already been struggling to emerge from the shadow of the pandemic and its after-shocks, including inflation, which has prompted many Americans to cut back on dining out and drinking.",
      "Smaller firms, who typically have less financial cushion and ability to swallow a sudden 25% jump in cost, will bear the brunt of the disruption.",

      "\"There's just a huge cost that's going to affect so many people in ways other than they're paying a couple bucks more for a cocktail, which doesn't sound like a tragedy.\"",
      "Fred Sanchez has spent years pushing to expand his business, Bad Hombre Importing, a small California-based importer and distributor of Mexican agave-based spirits like Agua del Sol, and was recently working on deals in New York and Illinois.",
      "But his potential partners started hesitating as Trump's tariff talk ramped up last year.",
      "Now, instead of expanding, he is contemplating selling off his stock of liquor and possibly shutting down. He said he had little capacity to absorb the jump in costs and saw little scope for raising prices in the current economy.",
      "\"25% is just not something that we can realistically pass onto the consumer,\" he said.",
      "Sanchez said he believed that Trump might be using tariffs as a negotiating tactic, and the tax could be short-lived. Still, for his business, damage is already done.",

      "Backed by celebrities, it was different to other social media sites, like MySpace or Facebook, because you could interact with any user without them having to approve a request. Companies rushed to join the service, hoping to get closer to their customers.",
      "\"If you were a brand that wanted to be part of any cultural moments that were happening, Twitter was a great place to be,\" Alex Wilson, a senior strategist at the marketing agency Pitch tells BBC News.",
      "On June 4, 2010 Elon Musk, the owner of Space X, logged on for the first time: \"Please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me.\"",
      "Twelve years later he would buy the platform for $44bn (\u00a338.1bn), reshape the algorithm, reinstate banned accounts, repurpose the policy around \"free speech\", and rename it X.",
      "He also fired thousands of staff - around 80% of the workforce.",
      "Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\".",
      "One of their main concerns was the content that would be seen around their posts that users could screengrab and share.",
      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",
      "In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,\" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News.",
      "However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, and his approval rating with the British public sits at -35.",
      "The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well.",
      "At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform.",
      "Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them of unlawfully agreeing to boycott the site.",
      "\"It's broadly fair to say Twitter is becoming less relevant across the world,\" Mr Wilson says in the Pitch office in central London, with posters of clients ranging from charities, telecommunications, and sports leagues.",
      "\"It's been a very long time since clients came to us and say: 'Twitter's fun and exciting. We want to be in that space'.",
      "\"Unless you are targeting specific audiences, maybe certain political audiences or sports  - football is still big on Twitter - it's hard to see the value in it.\"",
      "Trump's election victory has prompted other organisations to leave X, with others considering their positions as Mr Musk's influence in the White House grows.",
      "Beginning in 2013, German football team FC St Pauli, which plays in Germany's top league, the Bundesliga, posted more than 60,000 times, racking up nearly 250,000 followers.",
      "But less than 10 days after Trump's return to the White House was confirmed, the club posted: \"You can find our statement about saying goodbye to X on BlueSky. Feel free to follow us there. We're out of here.\"",
      "\"We discussed the decision for a year. We were mostly posting content with counter speech to hate. We had a lot of content for diversity, anti-racism, and anti-sexism,\" club spokesperson, Patrick Gensing told the BBC.",
      "\"We have seen assaults on X, antisemitism, conspiracy theories,\" he says.",
      "The argument that such posts are justified by freedom of speech, does not convince him.",
      "\"We don't think racism is freedom of speech,\" says Mr Gensing.",
      "One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it was no longer posting on X and directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform.",
      "When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its \"purpose is to serve the public conversation\".",
      "Mr Musk \"has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter\", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.",
      "But leaving X can have negative consequences for organisations and their relationships with customers.",
      "\"When users leave, the impact depends on who is leaving and why. A local authority posting news provides significant value to the network. If such an account leaves, it can hurt both the platform and its users,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"Users protesting by leaving should weigh the broader social implications of staying versus exiting.\"",
      "For some organisations who need to get their message out quickly, X still has value that other competitors simply can't offer.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:32:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce expansion plans but some question the short-term benefits.",
    "story": [
      "The expansion of Heathrow Airport has been backed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is hoping investment in a third runway, along with a series of other transport projects, will drive economic growth in the UK.",
      "Reeves has said expansion of the UK's biggest airport is \"badly needed\" and could lead to 100,000 jobs.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Friends of the Earth has said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "So is a third runway at Heathrow the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

    "story": [
      "The government has backed the expansion of Heathrow Airport after years of heated debate, saying it could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "The move, alongside potential confirmation of the expansion of other London airports including Gatwick and Luton, is likely to be met by fierce opposition.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed\", adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".",
      "How would Heathrow Airport be expanded?",
      "Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.",
      "A third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.",
      "The number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.",
      "Heathrow told the BBC that it would eventually be able to serve up to 140 million passengers a year once the third runway is in operation.",
      "The airport's owners, who include Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and private equity firm Ardian, said the costs of expansion would be met by charging airlines for use of the larger airport.",
      "But after years of wrangling over the original plans, the initial cost estimate of \u00a314bn will need to be revised.",
      "When could a third runway open?",
      "Even with government backing, the formal planning process could take up to two years.",
      "Any planning decision could then be subject to a judicial review, as well as needing to answer questions from opponents over environmental concerns.",
      "Local authorities and nearby residents will also have questions.",
      "After all that, construction is expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "Reeves has told the BBC she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.",
      "Does Labour support a third runway?",
      "A third runway was first proposed by Gordon Brown's Labour government in 2009 but was only finally given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court in 2020.",
      "Several members of the current government - including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - voted against a Heathrow expansion when in opposition.",
      "But Sir Keir recently told the BBC that the government has climate commitments, \"but growth is really important too\".",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Any aviation expansion will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets.\"",
      "However, London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office said he has \"a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London\" because of the impact on air quality and noise.",
      "Heathrow's boss, Thomas Woldbye, said in December he was waiting for a \"clear steer\" from the government before he could take plans forward.",
      "Could an extra runway help the economy?",
      "Some arguments for investing in the UK's transport infrastructure include a boost in growth, more jobs, and help for UK exports.",
      "Other European cities boast hub airports with more runways, including Amsterdam which serves fewer passengers than Heathrow but has five runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt have four.",
      "Currently, over \u00a3200bn of British trade passes through Heathrow annually. Heathrow has not devised figures on how much trade is expected to increase after a third runway, which it will do when it arrives at planning stage.",
      "The Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion and reported in 2015 that there would be benefits to the tune of \u00a361bn over 60 years.",
      "It said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.",
      "Forging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.",
      "However, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundation say the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What would the environmental impact be?",
      "Aviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "Reeves pointed to progress on creating sustainable fuels, and electric planes. A third runway at Heathrow would also mean \"that instead of circling London, flights can land\" she added, meaning less fuel is used.",
      "But it is far from clear that those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.",
      "Last year the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee, warned that the UK should not go ahead with airport expansion without a framework in place to manage capacity across the country.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",

      "What about Gatwick, Luton and London's other airports?",
      "Plans to expand London's other airports are already further along than Heathrow's and have in the past been viewed as an alternative to a third Heathrow runway.",
      "Work is set to start this year to expand capacity at Stansted's terminal.",
      "The government is due to make a decision on Gatwick airport by 27 February.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for actors Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively spent their first day in court sparring over the sexual harassment and other allegations that have erupted surrounding their film, It Ends With Us.",
      "In December, Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment and starting a smear campaign against her. Baldoni has denied her claims and, in response, sued her on a various grounds, including defamation.",
      "The movie co-stars were not required to attend the pretrial meeting at federal court in Manhattan on Monday.",
      "But the hour-and-a-half hearing still turned heated as lawyers for each side claimed the other was badmouthing their client outside of court.",
      "The case \"is supposed to be resolved here in court\", Lively's attorney, Michael Gottlieb told Jude Lewis Liman. \"It's not supposed to be resolved in the press.\"",
      "Mr Gottlieb accused Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, of making \"inflammatory extrajudicial comments\" about Lively's \"character and motives\" during appearances on news channels.",
      "In response, Mr Freedman said Mr Gottlieb was trying to impose a \"gag order\" preventing him from talking to the media. Baldoni, he said, was the one who had suffered harm to his reputation.",
      "\"My client is devastated financially and emotionally,\" Mr Freedman told the court.",
      "Based on a bestselling novel by Colleen Hoover, It Ends With Us became a box office hit after it was released in August. But despite its financial success, rumours of a bitter feud between Baldoni and Lively began swirling before the film was even released.",

      "Justin Baldoni ramps up Blake Lively feud with new website",
      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni: What you need to know",
      "Both sides in the legal fights have \"given the public plenty to feast upon\", Judge Liman said on court in Monday.",
      "He said that if the case ended up being \"litigated in the press\", he could be forced to move up a March 2026 trial date so that jurors do not become prejudiced against either of the defendants.",
      "The judge also said he would adopt a New York Bar Association measure - Rule 3.6 - that bars lawyers from making statements publicly that could sway the outcome of a trial.",
      "Monday's hearing came after Baldoni filed an amended complaint against Lively, which included a 168-page \"timeline\" of events in the case. His team also launched a website with the new complaint as well as other publicly available videos and text messages surrounding the case.",
      "Lively's lawyer brought up the website in court on Monday. \"Who created the website?\" Mr Gottlieb asked. \"Who funded it?\"",
      "Mr Gottlieb also took issue with out-takes Baldoni has released from a romantic scene in It Ends With Us, which he says proves that Lively's allegations of sexual harassment are unfounded.",
      "But Lively has responded by saying the footage of the pair filming a slow dance scene is \"damning\" and corroborates her claims.",
      "Lively's team on Monday pledged to file an amended complaint of its own, which  would involve even more people in the case.",
      "Several other parties already are embroiled in the legal drama. Baldoni is suing the New York Times for libel, claiming his co-star gave the outlet advance access to her civil rights complaint. The Times was the first a story to publish about her suit last December. The New York Times has denied these allegations.",
      "Several public relations firms who worked with Baldoni and Lively during their film  are also defendants in the case.",
      "Some of those matters will be dealt with in a separate trial after Lively and Baldoni's, Judge Liman said on Monday.",
      "He also said Baldoni and Lively's legal teams would need to agree to a protective order, a legal document that shields people involved in the case from another person accused of abusing or harassing them.",
      "Such an order is necessary, Judge Liman said, because of the \"significant number of high-profile individuals\" in the case and the \"nature of the allegations\".",
      "During the hearing, Baldoni's attorney also pressed the judge to stick to the pre-trial schedule that both sides suggested, saying his client wanted the case to progress \"as quickly as possible\".",
      "Judge Liman agreed to Baldoni's lawyer's request, with a few small schedule changes.",
      "\"There will come a time that the jury will speak on this issue,\" Judge Liman told the court.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 05:24:11 GMT",
    "summary": "In a show  filled with musical royalty, the star of the Grammys this year was the city of LA.",
    "story": [
      "In a show celebrating the biggest names in music, the star of the night was the city of Los Angeles.",
      "The historic fires that tore through Los Angeles became the theme of this year's Grammys. Reminders of the tragedy seeped into the musical performances and donation drives for relief efforts throughout the show.",
      "There were questions over whether the ceremony, the \"Oscars for Music,\" would go on as planned on Sunday after its host city saw its most devastating fire disaster ever recorded - blazes that were only fully doused on Friday after burning for 24 days.",
      "The week of glitzy parties and events that typically mark Grammys week were cancelled. Even the hallmark rowdy after-parties were axed.",
      "In the end, it became a moment of perseverance for the city - the epicentre of entertainment - and a chance to shed light on the intense need for those who have lost homes and loved ones.",
      "Twenty-nine people have died and more than 16,000 homes and businesses have been destroyed - with whole neighbourhoods now ash. Many artists and industry professionals are among those who lost homes, studios and equipment.",
      "Preformances honour LA",
      "The awards opened with a special performance by the Los Angeles band Dawes, two brothers whose homes were destroyed in the recent wildfires.",
      "The duo were joined on stage by former Grammy winners including Sheryl Crow, John Legend, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard to perform Randy Newman's classic song I Love LA.",
      "After the performance, Dawes - brothers Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith - reflected on this moment for the city and how they'd become LA's unofficial ambassadors in the fire aftermath.",
      "\"For a lot of musicians, you sort of feel helpless to not know how to help,\" they said. \"We really wanted to get involved, and so this really was a very proud moment for us.\"",
      "They noted they'd never been to the Grammys and now they helped open the show.",
      "\"It's wild to think about our childhood dreams meeting up with an opportunity to help our communities and at such a tragic moment.\"",
      "Throughout the evening, multiple performances provided a nod to the area.",

      "Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga sang a powerful rendition of the Mamas & the Papas classic California Dreamin'. During a segment honouring the late Quincy Jones, Stevie Wonder sang We Are the World with a choir of students from two schools lost in the fires.",
      "The Red Hot Chili Peppers, a band synonymous with LA, also took the stage to mark the evening. The Grammys audience sang along with Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis in an impromptu performance of their hit \"Under the Bridge\" - about Los Angeles.",
      "LA firefighters also took the stage during the show. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone spoke before the group and told the audience: \"I am confident that we will recover and rebuild together, because we are LA strong.\"",
      "Then firefighters presented the biggest award of the night - album of the year - with Beyonc\u00e9 winning the elusive honour after four losses in the category over the years.",
      "Fundraising efforts",
      "Nearly every commercial break during the show included a nod to the fires that happened here. Footage of burned down neighbourhoods or an inside look at a skate shop or small business that was destroyed in the blazes.",
      "Host Trevor Noah made mention of the fundraising effort throughout the show - acknowledging big donations that were made. He noted at one point during the broadcast that at least $7 million (\u00a35.7m) had been donated thus far.",
      "Much of the red carpet was plastered with fundraising signs and backdrops with QR codes to a Grammys website where people can donate.",
      "As celebrities strolled along the red carpet, groups of firefighters and first responders also took their walk before the media.",
      "They were greeted by loud applause and thank yous from everyone they passed. Many smiled and took selfies in their uniforms, some even nabbing pictures with celebrities.",
      "One firefighter's jaw dropped when he saw the Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi and they took a picture together.",
      "Los Angeles County Fire Captain Joshua Swaney walked alongside fellow firefighters on the red carpet. He told the BBC that while it was a phenomenal experience being honoured at the event, it was a helpful reminder for the rest of the world that LA is still reeling.",
      "\"This is definitely not what we're used to. That's for sure. It's been a humbling experience to be a part of this,\" he said. \"We are here making sure that people know that there's so much more to Los Angeles than just what's currently happening right now.\"",
      "To cancel the show or not?",
      "The Recording Academy, which runs the show, had said the show was needed more than ever.",
      "Showrunners sought to strike the right tone honouring the victims of the fire and displaying a defiant Los Angeles that will persevere. But there was concern the optics of rich celebrities dolled up with smiles on a red carpet could come off as tone deaf.",
      "Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. highlighted the economic impact, noting that thousands rely on Grammy-related work, particularly in the service industry. He framed the event as a symbol of resilience, arguing that cancelling would not benefit the city or music industry.",
      "\"Cancelling, pushing, moving does not accomplish what us standing together\" does, Mr Mason argued in a webcast before the show. The show will be \"unifying and coming together, honouring music, but also using the power of music to heal, rebuild and provide services to people who need it\".",
      "\"I think this might be one of the most important Grammy weeks we've ever had.\"",
      "Mr Mason told the New York Times that they consulted a range of public officials about whether they should hold the event - including the city's mayor and California Governor Gavin Newsom - and whether it would hinder fire response efforts.",
      "\"They strongly suggested that we continue forward with hosting the event,\" he told the outlet. \"Everyone said there's nothing good that comes from postponing.\"",
      "But there were still worries that the night will be a bad look for the music industry.",
      "\"I actually don't think that the Grammys should be happening,\" Elyn Kazarian, a creative director in the music industry, told the BBC.",
      "\"It's just very weird to me that there are going to be celebrities on a red carpet wearing expensive clothes while people in other parts of the city are suffering and whose livelihoods have been destroyed.\"",

      "This is not the first time a major disruption has impacted the music industry's biggest night.",
      "In 2021, the show was postponed due to Covid-19 and was significantly altered to accommodate safety protocols. It featured a socially distanced format, with no live audience and pre-recorded performances in an intimate outdoor setting rather than the usual large-scale arena production.",
      "Artists had to adjust to a new way of promoting their music, relying on digital platforms rather than in-person Grammy week events, which were either cancelled or moved online.",
      "\"I wouldn't necessarily compare the COVID pandemic to what's happening here,\" senior music writer for Variety, Steven J Horowitz, told the BBC. \"COVID lasted for so long and the effects were devastating for years. People had to cancel major releases, and everything shifted to a digital space.\"",
      "He said the fires are different.",

      "\"I know multiple musicians who lost their gear\", Chavez said. \"I know stylists who work in music who lost their houses, who had costumes and whatnot. I know musicians who are born and raised in LA who lost their house.\"",
      "There is also a ripple effect in the industry on those not personally impacted by the fires.",
      "The week of events typically held before the show, which were cancelled this year to help with fundraising efforts instead, helps new musicians and allows them to break out in a crowded market - getting time with top executives and those at major record labels.",
      "\"Visibility is very important for artists,\" Mr Horowitz told the BBC.",
      "\"Say you're a Best New Artist nominee who is relatively unknown to the public - being on these platforms and at these parties is a really big look if you're trying to get your music out in front of the industry. It really does help.\"",
      "One of the most sought-after parties is Spotify's event honouring the nominees for Best New Artist of the year. It is half party, half concert, with previous nominees showcasing their new music, and celebrities from all parts of the entertainment industry there to celebrate.",
      "Following the fires, Spotify chose to cancel this year's event.",
      "\"We've decided that the most impactful approach is cancelling all our Grammy Week events, including our annual Best New Artist party, and redirecting funds to support efforts to reach local fans and charitable organizations,\" Spotify's Global Head of Music Partnerships and Audience Joe Hadley wrote in an announcement.",
      "The music industry and the Grammys are deeply rooted in Los Angeles, and though the city is going through a devastating period, it has reinforced a sense of community, especially in the music industry.",
      "\"Even if people lost everything, they still have hope. And I think that feeds into what we're going to see in the music industry in the future,\" Mr Horowitz said. \"People aren't going to flee Los Angeles because of this one thing. It's not going to stop L.A. from being one of the main hubs for music in the world.\"",

      "Sunday night saw Beyonce and Kendrick Lamar win big at the Grammy Awards, which was dedicated to fundraising for wildfire relief efforts in Los Angeles.",
      "It also saw plenty of memorable performances, impassioned speeches and stunning red carpet looks for everyone to emulate over the course of the next year (leather chaps are back, in case you were wondering).",

      "HIGHLIGHT: Beyonc\u00e9 wins album of the year... At last",
      "Well, now we're in a pickle.",
      "On her eighth solo record, Cowboy Carter, Beyonc\u00e9 sang about the Grammys' constant, stubborn refusal to award her album of the year.",
      "\"AOTY, I ain't win,\" she sang. \"Take that s--- on the chin.\"",
      "But now she has won, for the album that contains that very lyric. Will she have to go back and re-record it? At the very least, we expect a rewrite on the tour she just announced.",
      "Joking aside, this victory was long, long overdue.",
      "In 2017, Adele even flirted with the idea of handing back her album of the year trophy, saying the music on her album, 25, couldn't compare to Beyonc\u00e9's \"monumental\u2026 beautiful and soul-baring\" Lemonade.",
      "Eyebrows were raised again in 2023, when Harry Styles' fun, but conceptually flimsy, Harry's House bested Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance \u2013 a meticulous exploration of how oppressed black and queer musicians found salvation through house music.",
      "In the end, it took Beyonc\u00e9 to approach a genre that conservative Grammy voters could understand \u2013 country \u2013 in order to secure a victory.",
      "But that's not to downplay the scale of her achievement. Cowboy Carter is a masterpiece that weaves hundreds of musical threads into a thesis about America's cultural past, and the futility of gatekeeping musical genres along racial lines.",
      "The arguments it makes are both timely and urgent, without suffocating the songs.",
      "As the second part of a planned trilogy, this surely won't be Beyonc\u00e9's last trip to the podium.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Sabrina Carpenter's stage malfunction",
      "Sabrina Carpenter has literally been practising for this moment all her life. She made her TV debut in 2011, aged 12 years old, and has been hovering on the fringes of pop superstardom pretty much ever since.",
      "So, after a huge breakthrough in 2024, she was primed and ready for the Grammy stage.",
      "Or was she?",
      "She emerged in a razzle-dazzle showgirl outfit and instantly missed her spotlight. Then she dropped the cane she was supposed to dance with. And, as she descended a grand pearlescent staircase, she suddenly disappeared through a trap door.",
      "Luckily, it was all a humorous ruse! Carpenter skipped back to the stage for a big band version of Espresso, complete with ankle-endangering tap routine.",
      "After changing into a blue, crystal-studded Victoria's Secret bodysuit, she segued effortlessly into Please, Please, Please\u2026 And then the set collapsed on her.",
      "As she leapt into the safety of a dancer's arms, she couldn't contain her laughter.",
      "It was a perfect piece of vaudeville, and the audience lapped it up. Host Trevor Noah, however, wasn't so impressed.",
      "\"That was amazing and funny, which I didn't appreciate,\" the comedian said. \"Really, Sabrina? You're just gonna take my job like that?\"",

      "Among those people were Abel Tesfaye \u2013 aka The Weeknd himself.",
      "He declared the awards were \"corrupt\" and criticised their lack of \"transparency\". Since then, he's refused to submit any of his music for consideration.",
      "So it was something of a coup when he gave an unannounced, unexpected performance in the middle of Sunday's ceremony.",
      "He was introduced by the Recording Academy's CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, who acknowledged the star's criticisms, and described his efforts to revamp the Grammys' electorate, by boosting the number of women and people of colour.",
      "After that, the star took to the stage with two songs from his brand new album, Cry For Me and Timeless.",
      "It was meant to be a celebration of people's ability to learn and grow, but the music was so oppressively drab \u2013 with the Weeknd constantly shrouded in smoke and shadow -  that you wondered whether he'd simply returned to sabotage the Grammys from within.",

      "BBC Sound of 2025 winner Chappell Roan cantered into the Grammys with a theatrical performance of Pink Pony Club - her love letter to LA, as well as a celebration of queer discovery.",

      "The pair then made a swift exit, electing to skip the ceremony, driving off into the LA night.",
      "Early reports suggested they had been kicked out, but the BBC understands they left of their own accord, with one source saying that West, \"walked the carpet, got in his car and left\".",
      "They may well have been home by the time West's track Carnival lost out to Kendrick Lamar in the best rap song category.",
      "But he probably won't mind: He already has 24 Grammy awards, and now he has the headlines he craves, too.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Brat Green picks up a prize",
      "Among the three awards Charli XCX picked up was one of the night's most obscure: Best artwork.",
      "At first glance, that might seem odd. The album cover is a plain green square, with the word \"brat\" printed in a deliberately low-resolution Arial font.",
      "But the cover took five months to put together, with designer Brent David Freaney testing around 500 shades of green to produce a garish, nausea-inducing effect.",
      "Charli wanted the artwork to be deliberately off-putting \u2013 reflecting the album's dual themes of partying and self doubt. And she said it was important to challenge the convention of women dressing provocatively to promote their music.",
      "\"Why should anyone have that level of ownership over female artists?\" she asked Vogue magazine.",
      "She added: \"I wanted to go with an offensive, off-trend shade of green to trigger the idea of something being wrong. I'd like for us to question our expectations of pop culture - why are some things considered good and acceptable, and some things deemed bad?",
      "\"I'm interested in the narratives behind that and I want to provoke people. I'm not doing things to be nice.\"",
      "Towards the end of the ceremony, the star's live performance of Von Dutch and Guess saw her transform the biggest and glitziest night in music into a packed and sweaty nightclub.",
      "Emerging from a black SUV, she strutted towards the camera, throwing a glass of champagne against the wall of a parking garage, before launching into what appeared to be an underground rave.",
      "As the performance progressed, she appeared on stage with model Julia Fox and hundreds of dancers, who were then showered in underwear (a reference to the song's lyrics).",

      "LOWLIGHT (if you\u2019re Drake): Kendrick Lamar\u2019s clean sweep",
      "The Grammys have a wobbly history with hip-hop. They didn't introduce a rap category until 1989, a full decade after the Sugarhill Gang introduced the genre to a wide audience with Rapper's Delight. And no rap act has won album of the year since OutKast in 2001.",
      "So it was a rare victory when Compton-born rapper Kendrick Lamar won all five of the awards in which he was nominated for Not Like Us, a furious takedown of his musical rival, Drake.",
      "Among those awards were the prestigious record and song of the year - categories that have only ever recognised a rap song once before (Childish Gambino's This Is America in 2019).",
      "Lamar didn't perform at the ceremony - he plays the Super Bowl halftime show next week instead - but, dressed head to toe in denim, he delivered a powerful message to Grammy voters.",
      "\"At the end of the day, nothing is more powerful than rap music. I don't care what it is. We are the culture\u2026 respect the art form\".",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Janelle Mona\u00e9's moonwalk moment",
      "Music lost one of its biggest legends in 2024, when Quincy Jones died at the age of 91.",
      "As the producer for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson, the Grammys gave him a star-studded send-off that lasted almost 20 minutes.",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Herbie Hancock played a beautiful version of Fly Me To The Moon; while Stevie Wonder's sang We Are The World with choirs from two schools affected by the devastating LA fires.",
      "But it was Janelle Mona\u00e9's performance of Michael Jackson's Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough that blew the roof off.",
      "Dressed in MJ's Billie Jean outfit, she pirouetted and moonwalked and jumped on the tables as if she'd been possessed by the man himself.",
      "Towards the end of the performance, she threw off her jacket to reveal a t-shirt bearing the legend \"I Love QJ\".",
      "And guess who caught it and wore it for the rest of the night?",
      "Taylor Swift.",
      "LOWLIGHT: Snubs for Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift",
      "Even with 94 awards to consider, some people will get overlooked - but nobody expected two of the Grammys' biggest darlings to go home empty-handed.",
      "Taylor Swift was blanked despite scoring six nominations. Voters clearly decided that The Tortured Poets Department wasn't worthy of comparison with her four previous album of the year winners (Fearless, 1989, Folklore and Midnights).",
      "Billie Eilish's wipeout was even more unexpected. She had been the bookmakers' favourite for album of the year, for her third release Hit Me Hard And Soft - but she lost all seven of the categories she was nominated for.",
      "Still, there was a lot of competition this year, especially in the pop categories. And Swift has spoken in the past about how losing album of the year for Red inspired her pop opus, and biggest-seller to date, 1989.",
      "Don't count either of these artists out just yet.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Trevor Noah's easy-going hosting",
      "There's a reason they keep inviting Trevor Noah back to host the Grammys: He's got the tone right.",
      "He's relaxed, he's engaged with the music, and his humour never punches down.",
      "Here are some of his best quips from the night:",
      "\"Yesterday, Beyonce announced her new tour. Everyone saw that. I will say, though, Beyonce, there's tariffs. We can't afford a new tour, right?

Which means she would break the record of four wins, set all the way back in 2024 by Taylor Swift. I'm just gonna say Taylor, if you break Taylor's record, the Swifties are gonna come for you. And you don't wanna mess with them.\"\"The Beatles are nominated tonight for Record of the Year. Yes, the legendary band from Liverpool used AI to put out a new song after 53 years. So good luck to the Beatles. I think if they win, this could open up a few doors for them.\"\"And who knows, through the power of AI, one day, we could even get another Rihanna album.\"",

    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

      "He also offered to inject increasing doses of local anaesthetic without a prescriber present - again illegal - and did not ask for our reporter's weight, thus putting her at risk of an overdose.",
      "Posing as a potential client and her friend, we had booked a 45-minute appointment with Mr Sawyer through his Instagram page. We told him we wanted a 200ml (7fl oz) liquid BBL injection costing \u00a31,200. We paid a \u00a3200 deposit.",
      "Despite having advertised that all liquid BBLs would be carried out under the guidance of an \"ultrasound specialist doctor\", none was present at his pop-up clinic. He was working out of a small room in an east London office block - a non-clinical environment which would have increased the risk of infection.",
      "Within five minutes of being in his office, Mr Sawyer had begun to encourage our reporter to think about increasing the amount of filler. \"You might be surprised about how much product you can have and still look natural,\" he suggested.",
      "By the end of the appointment, Mr Sawyer had offered to inject a litre of filler - 500ml (almost a pint) per buttock - at a cost of \u00a32,000.",

      "\"Putting that volume in, in one sitting, is really dangerous,\" said Mr Humzah. \"The buttocks are such a large area that if they become infected it can overwhelm the body and could end in sepsis - or even death.\"",
      "The filler used for liquid BBLs is often made up of hyaluronic acid, which is commonly used in facial filling treatments. Because large amounts of the acid are involved in BBLs, and there is a risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and sepsis, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous cosmetic procedures.",
      "Mr Sawyer boasted on camera that he did up to seven procedures a day, six days a week. He can charge thousands of pounds per appointment.",
      "One of the women who said she had experienced serious complications after receiving a liquid BBL from Mr Sawyer was Joanne. A mum of two from south Wales, who only wants us to use her first name, she travelled seven hours to Essex for the treatment.",
      "Having had other cosmetic treatments before and having been persuaded by Ricky Sawyer's many adverts and celebrity endorsements, a liquid BBL didn't seem like such a big step to her.",
      "All she wanted, she says, was a \"peachy bum\".",
      "But when Joanne arrived, she began to have second thoughts.",
      "She had only been sent a postcode and says she seemed to be walking into an industrial estate.",
      "In the end, she found a small door into a block of flats and says she was told to wait in a \"dingy little hallway\" for about half an hour.",
      "\"I should have turned and ran,\" she says, \"but I had paid \u00a3600 deposit and travelled all this way.\"",
      "She was taken into a small room where there \"was only a bed, a tiny stool and a worktop\", and that is where she says she first met Ricky Sawyer.",
      "After counting out the rest of her cash - \u00a32,000 in total - she says he told her to stand in front of him while he sat on the stool.",
      "As he started to inject her with a litre (1.8 pints) of filler, the pain quickly became unbearable.",
      "\"I felt dizzy, sick and like shaky. My legs didn't even move properly. And that was all within a minute of him starting,\" she says. \"I remember looking round and he had white gloves on that were full of blood.\"",
      "By the end of the procedure, Joanne was in agony: \"I was in so much pain, my bottom was completely disfigured.\"",
      "She says she could barely sit down. By the time she got home the swelling had started and she could hardly walk.",
      "\"I messaged Ricky loads of times to say how bad I was feeling and how worried I was. He just told me to take my antibiotics.\"",
      "By this point, sepsis had begun to set in.",
      "\"My temperature kept on going up and I felt terrible,\" says Joanne. \"I had to phone 999. I was dripping with sweat and screaming.\"",
      "In hospital, she was attached to intravenous antibiotics. At one point, a surgeon drew on her buttock to indicate where they might need to cut, because the infection was spreading so quickly.",
      "After messaging Ricky Sawyer saying she was in hospital with sepsis, she says he blocked her from his Instagram account.",
      "Fortunately, Joanne did not need an operation.",
      "Another of Mr Sawyer's clients, Louise Moller, did need life-saving emergency surgery.",
      "Four days after receiving a liquid BBL at his Essex clinic in October 2023, the 28-year-old from Bolton was in hospital.",
      "She rang her mother, Janet, from Salford Royal's A&E department saying: \"Mum, I think I'm going to die.\"",
      "Louise had contracted sepsis and was warned by surgeons that she could die at any minute. To stop the infection from moving through her body, they cut dead tissue out of an area almost covering her entire left buttock.",
      "Janet promised her daughter she would prevent this from happening to anyone else and reported Ricky Sawyer to their local police station in Bolton.",
      "\"How can he carry on knowing he could kill someone?\" she told the BBC.",
      "However, Louise's case highlights the difficulty in holding practitioners like him accountable.",
      "Janet says she was told by police in Bolton that the file would need to be passed to Essex Police, where the incident happened.",
      "A prosecution could be difficult however, she was warned, because Louise had signed a consent form.",
      "BBC News has approached both Greater Manchester Police and Essex Police to get an update on the case - both have said it is down to the other to investigate.",
      "From a legal point of view, there is little to stop Mr Sawyer from practising.",
      "Injecting dermal fillers is seen as non-surgical and is unregulated, which means anyone can do it - and they can't be struck off and stopped.",
      "In September 2024, Alice Webb is believed to have become the first person to die after receiving a liquid BBL in the UK. Her procedure was not carried out by Ricky Sawyer.",
      "Following her death, Save Face - a group that campaigns for greater regulation to cover non-surgical procedures - called for a new law banning liquid BBLs from being carried out by anyone other than surgeons registered with the General Medical Council (GMC).",
      "Save Face's founder, Ashton Collins, says her organisation has received complaints from 39 women about Ricky Sawyer.",
      "All the women, she says, have told her they have been left needing urgent hospital treatment. Each of them, she says, had a BBL and suffered complications such as sepsis, necrosis and disfigurement.",
      "\"We've encouraged these women to report their experiences to the police,\" she says. \"Some have, and nothing has been done.\"",
      "So far, the most effective action has been taken by local authorities, three of which - Glasgow City Council, Epping Forest District Council and Brentwood Council -  confirmed they had issued prohibition notices under Health and Safety law to protect the public from serious injury.",
      "But \"he just moves on to different areas of the country and carries on\", says Ms Collins.",
      "We put our evidence to the Department of Health and Social Care which said it was \"urgently looking at options for tougher regulation\".",
      "It said our findings were \"shocking\" and that those caught \"dispensing medication without a licence should feel the full force of the law\".",
      "We attempted to put our allegations to Ricky Sawyer in person, by confronting him at his east London clinic.",
      "As soon as he saw the camera he tried to slam the door on us, before hiding behind it.",
      "We asked him if he was breaking the law by handing out prescription-only medicine, and if he had anything to say to the women who say they were left with such serious injuries that they needed emergency care.",
      "\"No,\" he said - and told us to leave.",
      "The dangers of unregulated cosmetic surgery should be taken far more seriously, says Ashton Collins.",
      "\"The general vibe that you pick up is that these are silly women that have made silly choices, driven through vanity, and it's their own fault.\"",

    "summary": "Former nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering seven babies and trying to murder seven others.",
    "story": [
      "Child killer Lucy Letby did not murder any babies, a panel of international medical experts reviewing evidence in her case has claimed.",
      "Chairman Dr Shoo Lee told a press conference \"in all cases death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care\".",
      "Letby, who is serving 15 whole life sentences for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others between 2015 and 2016, has already lost two bids to appeal against her convictions.",
      "The panel's findings are likely to form part of an application which has been made by her lawyers to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for her case to be investigated as a potential miscarriage of justice.",
      "The lengthy and medically technical press conference was organised by Letby's legal team who had said the panel would present \"significant new medical evidence\".",
      "Dr Lee, a Canadian neonatal care expert, said there were alternative explanations for each of Letby's convictions for murder or attempted murder.",
      "He said he became involved in the case after learning that an academic paper he co-authored on air embolism, one of the methods Letby was said to have used to attack babies, had formed part of the prosecution case in her trial.",
      "Dr Lee said the 14 experts, including medical professionals from Canada, the US, Japan, Germany, Sweden and the UK, had looked at 17 cases at the heart of Letby's prosecution and had compiled an \"impartial evidence-based report\".",
      "The report presented at the conference was a summary of the panel's findings, and the full report would be submitted to Letby's legal team, Dr Lee said.",
      "Dr Lee provided what he said were highly detailed grounds baby-by-baby for concluding that none of the murders occurred.",
      "He added: \"We did not find any murders. In all cases, death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care.\"",
      "\"Lucy was charged with seven murders and seven attempted murders\", he said.",
      "\"In our opinion, the medical opinion, the medical evidence doesn't support murder in any of these babies.",
      "\"Our full report will go to Lucy's barrister later this month, and then it'll be up to him and the courts to decide what next to do.\"",
      "During Letby's trial, the prosecution referred to the 1989 paper by Dr Lee that looked at cases of air embolus, referring to injuries caused when air is injected into a baby's arteries or veins after staff at the Countess of Chester reported skin discoloration on some of the babies.",
      "In the cases Dr Lee analysed in his paper, those injuries had happened accidentally.",
      "The prosecution argued that one of the methods Letby used to injure or kill babies was to inject air into their veins and used Dr Lee's paper to back that claim.",
      "In the paper, Dr Lee described a distinct discoloration on the babies' skin in 10% of cases.",
      "'Scrutinised'",
      "However, at the press conference Dr Lee said in all of the cases in his paper air was injected into the babies' arteries, not their veins.",
      "He said that the skin discolouration described in the paper was not possible when air was injected into the veins.",
      "Dr Lee said he had recently updated his academic paper and found no cases of skin discolouration linked to air embolism by the venous system.",
      "He prefaced his remarks by saying that the thoughts of each panel member were with the families of the babies who had died.",
      "Former neonatal nurse Letby, now 35, lost two bids to challenge her convictions at the Court of Appeal last year.",
      "The prosecution's medical case was scrutinised by the Court of Appeal in May last year and found to be safe - and the judges noted Letby herself did not present any experts at her trial offering an alternative view.",
      "Dr Lee had offered to give evidence to the Court of Appeal as part of Letby's application for permission to appeal, but three senior judges said his conclusions did not undermine her convictions.",
      "The judges concluded there had been no prosecution expert evidence diagnosing air embolus solely on the basis of skin discolouration.",
      "Earlier, the CCRC said Letby's lawyers had applied to the commission to investigate her case as a potential miscarriage of justice.",
      "The body said it would now assess the application and determine whether there was new evidence which presented a reasonable chance of a conviction being overturned.",
      "A CCRC spokesperson said: \"We are aware that there has been a great deal of speculation and commentary surrounding Lucy Letby's case, much of it from parties with only a partial view of the evidence.",
      "\"We ask that everyone remembers the families affected by events at the Countess of Chester Hospital between June 2015 and June 2016.\"",
      "Mark McDonald, Letby's barrister, said that because her previous legal team had not called a medical expert at her trial, the information presented was \"new, fresh evidence\".",
      "He said the nurse was convicted because of the medical evidence, and if that was wrong any circumstantial evidence would \"fall away\".",
      "\"The most important thing, the reason why Lucy Letby was convicted, was because of the medical evidence that was presented to the jury that today has been demolished,\" he said.",

      "A gene-editing therapy for sickle cell disease, with a price tag of \u00a31.65m, is to be offered to patients on the NHS in England.",
      "About 50 people a year with the inherited blood disorder are likely to receive it, experts say.",
      "Prof Bola Owolabi, of NHS England, called it a \"monumental step forward\", and said the one-off treatment Casgevy, also known as Exa-cel, \"holds a very real prospect of  a cure\".",
      "A confidential agreement has been made with manufacturer Vertex on how much the NHS will pay.",
      "Campaigners have described the treatment as \"groundbreaking\" and its availability on the NHS as a \"milestone\".",
      "Sickle cell disease can be life-threatening and cause recurring intense pain, when blood vessels become blocked by misshapen red cells.",
      "About 15,000 people in England live with the condition, which mainly affects people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage.",
      "It is caused by genetic change that means people make haemoglobin - a key protein in red blood cells - that doesn't work properly.",
      "This results in red blood cells becoming sickle in shape and stiff and sticky - rather than flexible smooth discs.",
      "These sickle cells do not live as long as healthy red blood cells and can clump as they travel around blood vessels - reducing oxygen to vital parts of the body.",
      "This puts people at risk of organ damage, stroke, heart failure and a greatly  reduced quality of life.",
      "In trials all patients who received the therapy - which tweaks a specific gene and allows the body to make more healthy red blood cells - avoided stays in hospital for a year after treatment and most for three-and-a-half years. Further data is still being studied.",
      "NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the therapy \"could be absolutely transformative \u2013 it could enable patients to live free from the fear of sickle cell crises hanging over them\".",

      "This allows a specific gene to be pinpointed and very precise editing to take place.",
      "However, instead of directly editing a faulty gene, Casgevy instead takes advantage of a process that happens when babies are in the womb, where they make red blood cells with foetal haemoglobin (a key protein that carries oxygen). This switches to the adult form once they are born.",
      "Crucially foetal haemoglobin is not affected by sickle cell disease, so Crispr acts by dampening down the \"switch\" that makes the body produce the adult form.",
      "Patients have to undergo \"conditioning\" chemotherapy to make sure their bodies are ready to accept the edited stem cells.",
      "Modified stem cells are then transfused back into the body, where they multiply and increase the production of stable, well-functioning red cells.",

      "UK approves gene-edit drug for sickle cell disease",
      "First gene-editing therapy may cure blood disorder",
      "The only other current option for a cure is a stem cell transplant - but this can only happen if a closely matched donor is available. There is also a risk of the transplant being rejected.",
      "The gene therapy will be available in specialist centres in London, Manchester and Birmingham to people aged 12 and over who get recurrent sickle cell crises and who cannot find a donor for a stem cell transplant.",

      "However, he added: \"We remain acutely aware that not everyone with sickle cell will be eligible for the potentially life-changing benefits of Casgevy.",
      "\"There is still much work ahead to ensure that everyone living with sickle cell has access to the care, treatments, and support they deserve.\"",
      "The therapy has already been approved for another inherited blood disorder, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.",

      "The two supermarkets say they believe the laws banning tobacco advertising do not apply to the devices.",
      "Heated tobacco is less harmful than cigarettes, but experts say it is probably more harmful than vapes, and less effective at helping smokers quit.",
      "Tobacco adverts were banned in 2002. But if you walk into a Sainsbury's or a Morrisons you may well see adverts for iQos, a device that uses an electric current to heat tobacco.",
      "Some are on flashing video screens in places where they can easily be seen by children. The BBC has also seen adverts in Morrisons for a similar device called Ploom.",
      "Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales.",
      "The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), which represents local authority trading standards teams, says the ads are \"prohibited\" by the 2002 law.",
      "CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal.",
      "\"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC.",

      "Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Ploom, said the 2002 law defines a tobacco product as something that is \"smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed\", and because heated tobacco products do not produce smoke, they aren't covered by that definition.",
      "Morrisons cited the same argument. \"On that basis, we are comfortable that it is legal for heated tobacco products to be advertised in store,\" it said.",

      "But shadow business secretary Andrew Griffiths said: \"There's no vaccine for incompetence.",
      "\"In the same week they talked about growth, Labour seem to have fumbled a deal with AstraZeneca, one of the UK's largest companies and central to the critical life sciences sector.\"",
      "Labour has made boosting the UK economy its main objective in a bid to raise living standards but growth has remained sluggish.",

      "NHS experts have warned that services are overstretched trying to deal with unprecedented demand from patients wanting to try weight-loss drugs.",
      "How do Wegovy and Mounjaro work?",
      "There are two drugs on the market - semaglutide, marketed under the brand name Wegovy, and tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro.  Semaglutide is also used in the type 2 diabetes treatment Ozempic.",
      "Both Wegovy and Mounjaro are given as weekly injections via pre-filled pens that can be self-administered into the upper arm, thigh or stomach.",
      "They work as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).",

      "Clinical trials suggest that - when combined with changes to their diet, exercise and behavioural support - Wegovy users could lose more than 10% of their body weight after a year on the treatment.",
      "Other trials suggest Mounjaro users might lose even more - up to 20%. But it is difficult to compare the two treatments and, crucially, users of either drug can put weight back on once they stop treatment",
      "Who can get weight-loss drugs on the NHS?",
      "At the moment, only Wegovy is available on the NHS in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "It must be prescribed by a weight management specialist, and access to these is restricted.",
      "To qualify, adults must be obese (with a BMI of at least 35) and have at least one pre-existing weight-related health condition such as high blood pressure.",
      "People with cardiovascular disease who are classed as overweight, but not quite obese, can also be given the drug.",
      "Patients should follow a diet and physical activity programme, and the drug should be only prescribed for a maximum of two years, according to NHS guidelines.",
      "The body which assesses how all drugs are used, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), has recommended that Mounjaro should also be offered to NHS patients in England from March 2025. This would be alongside advice on diet and exercise.",
      "As with Wegovy, it will initially only be available to obese patients who have a weight-related health condition and are under the care of a specialist.",
      "However, from June, the drug will be offered more widely. It is not yet clear how this will be managed, or who will provide ongoing monitoring and support.",
      "Detailed NHS England guidance is expected in early 2025.",
      "Around 3.4 million people could eventually qualify for Mounjaro.",

      "To find out what having the test is really like for first timers, the BBC spoke to six people who have had their first cervical screening, formerly known as a smear test, in the last six months.",
      "Cervical screenings, offered by the NHS to all women and people with a cervix aged 25-64, test for the presence of certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes 99% of cervical cancers.",
      "During the test, a nurse uses a speculum - a tool to open the vagina - and a brush to take a sample of cells from the cervix.",
      "This is what having the test done for the first time was like for six people, and what they wish they'd known beforehand.",
      "How did you feel beforehand?",
      "Erica Donnelly, 26, who lives in Sunderland, waited about a year to book her screening appointment after receiving an invite.",
      "\"I was in a massive panic about it because I have PTSD relating to sexual trauma, so I was really extra nervous about that,\" she says.",
      "When she finally had the test done last month, she brought her partner with her for support and to help her in case she had a flashback or a panic attack. Having them there also made the experience feel more \"comfortable and casual\", she says.",
      "Bianca Ionici, 27, who lives in London, says she put off her cervical screening \"for at least two years\" because of concerns about pain.",
      "But after getting another invite which contained a lot of information about the process, Bianca booked her screening in January.",
      "Other people say they booked their screenings as soon as they could.",
      "Eleanor Gratton, who had her test at the end of last year aged 25, says her friends were scared the process would be \"uncomfortable and painful\". But as more and more people in her group had their screenings, she says they didn't find this to be the case.",
      "What did the test feel like?",
      "Jessica Tse was \"really anxious\" before her cervical screening in December.",
      "\"I didn't know if it was going to hurt\", she says.",
      "But the nurse was \"talking to me, distracting me throughout\" and explained the procedure \"really clearly\", she adds.",
      "\"Pain-wise, it was uncomfortable and it was something I hadn't felt before,\" Bianca recalls.",
      "But \"it was over before I knew\", she says.",
      "Others say they didn't experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton.",
      "\"It was nothing,\" says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. \"I couldn't feel anything.\" She says the fact she'd already had two children made her less anxious about the experience.",
      "\"These nurses have seen everything,\" Megan adds.",
      "Some people feel under pressure to shave their pubic hair or wear their best underwear, she says. But speaking as a former healthcare worker, Megan says \"you're there to do a job, you don't care about these things\".",
      "While most people only feel light pain at their appointments, some people do experience more discomfort at their appointments.",
      "\"Some people find cervical screening uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful,\" the Eve Appeal says. It notes that some conditions like endometriosis, vaginismus and being menopausal can make the screening painful.",
      "The NHS says that patients are in control of screening and \"can ask the nurse to stop at any time\".",

      "Some of the people the BBC spoke to said they weren't aware they could have asked for accommodations.",
      "Bianca says she asked the nurse to use a smaller speculum after reading about it online.",
      "But she thinks information about adjustments should be flagged more clearly when you book the appointment, because some need to be thought about in advance - like bringing a friend or booking a double slot.",
      "What is it like to have the test as a transgender man?",
      "Jack Latham, a 28-year-old personal trainer living in Kent, says he received his first screening invite aged 25, just after he came out as trans. He says his GP was \"incredibly supportive\" and there was even a poster in his surgery's waiting room encouraging trans men to have a cervical screening.",
      "Trans and non-binary people who have a cervix should still have regular cervical screenings.",
      "Jack says he'd put off the appointment out of fear, until he went for a blood test in summer 2024 and the nurse offered him a cervical screening on the spot.",
      "\"It was so much quicker and much less of a bigger deal,\" Jack says. \"It's nowhere near as bad as you think it will be.\"",
      "Some trans men previously told the BBC they had not been invited to get cervical screenings because they were listed as male on medical records, though they still had a cervix.",
      "How could the process be improved?",
      "The NHS wants to encourage more people to go for their cervical screenings. NHS England has promised to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040.",
      "Women aged 25-49 are encouraged to have a screening every three years, while women aged 50-64 should have one every five years.",
      "NHS England data from March 2024 showed 44.5% of women aged 25-29 had not been screened in the last 3.5 years. For those aged 30-34, this figure was 35.3%.",
      "The proportion of younger women who have been adequately screened has been falling a little in recent years.",
      "Dr Sue Mann, NHS national clinical director for women's health, told the BBC in a statement that medics know that some women find screenings \"very worrying and uncomfortable\".",
      "She emphasised that adjustments are always available and that women should book their screenings, even if they were invited months or years ago.",
      "A display at the Vagina Museum in east London last year encouraged visitors to write improvements they'd like to see to the NHS's cervical screening service on slips of paper.",
      "Artist Ella Clancy, who produced the display, says common requests included more information about the adjustments available - especially asking for smaller speculums - nurses talking people through exactly what they were doing as they performed the screening and staff being more trauma-aware.",
      "Eleanor says there should be more education around what HPV is. School pupils are typically vaccinated against HPV between year eight and year 10 but Eleanor says it wasn't clear at the time what the jab was for.",
      "Jessica thinks doctors should explain the results using plainer language, and says she had to call her GP for further explanation after receiving her results letter.",
      "Would you rather do the test yourself?",
      "Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King's College London trialled them in London in 2021 with \"fantastic\" results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab.",
      "The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely.",
      "Eleanor says she felt \"reassured\" knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available.",
      "Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he'd prefer an at-home kit for \"the convenience and flexibility\" but that he'd \"have some hesitation about whether I'd done it correctly\".",

      "European outbreaks of deadly animal diseases in recent months have left health authorities, Whitehall officials and many in the farming industry worried about the threat they pose to the UK.",
      "But the government has previously insisted the new system of post-Brexit border checks that came into effect in April last year is capable of keeping the UK disease-free.",
      "Under the post-Brexit system, checks on commercial vehicles do not take place at Dover itself.",
      "Instead, drivers are ordered to travel 22 miles (35km) away to a border control post at Sevington.",
      "But critics have warned that many lorries are simply failing to turn up for the checks, due to a lack of enforcement.",
      "Parliament's Environment Select Committee has now launched an inquiry into whether the system is working.",
      "Lucy Manzano, head of the Dover Port Health Authority, told MPs on the committee that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had been overstating the effectiveness of the system.",
      "She said: \"Defra have continually stated that there are robust controls in place. There are not. They don't exist.\"",
      "She added that the department had failed to provide \"any confirmation of how food would be controlled at the point it arrives, or more importantly, between the point it arrives and the inspection facility that is accessed 22 miles across\".",
      "Ms Manzano said she had presented evidence to the government \"to demonstrate that the system brought in place to safeguard this country from a biosecurity point of view\u2026 is not working\".",
      "Defra refused to answer a recent Freedom of Information request from the BBC's Countryfile programme, asking how many vehicles were failing to turn up for checks at Sevington.",
      "Almost 100 tonnes of illegal meat seized at port",
      "Action demanded over surge in illegal meat imports",
      "Ms Manzano claimed illegal meat has now become much more commonplace in high street shops - and that it is becoming increasingly difficult for consumers to spot of the product they are buying has gone through proper health checks.",
      "It is understood that the view inside Defra is that the post-Brexit checks are working as they should.",
      "Earlier this week figures showed that almost 100 tonnes of illegal meat was seized at the Port of Dover last year.",
      "Defra said the government \"will never waver in its duty to protect the UK's biosecurity\" and insisted it was working effectively with enforcement agencies.",
      "A BBC News investigation last year found that unprecedented levels of seizures had sparked fears of more organised criminal activity.",
      "A similar health check facility to the one at Sevington does exist on site at Dover, but it is understood that the government chose not to use it because of worries about potential traffic queues forming at the border.",
      "Ms Manzano said that decision was \"not based on biosecurity\" and added that \"the very purpose of import controls is to keep the bad stuff out and contain it at first point of entry\".",
      "Last month the UK government introduced strict restrictions on the import of German meat, following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.",
      "But Ms Manzano said failures in the IT system introduced since Brexit meant that products which should have been undergoing checks were allowed to freely enter the UK for \"at least six days\".",
      "When the current system was introduced last year, the government also gave funding to Dover Port Health Authority to carry out spot checks on smaller vehicles directly at the border.",
      "Figures show the vast majority of illegal meat seized in the UK is caught through those spot checks.",
      "But Ms Manzano said that funding was due to run out in seven weeks and that without further government cash the checks would have to stop.",
      "Government discussions are ongoing about how to best fund border checks.",
      "It is understood the decision to put the checks at Sevington has likely had a direct negative impact on how much money goes to the Dover Port Health Authority.",
      "A Defra spokesperson refused to comment on ongoing spending decisions."

    "title": "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 18:32:13 GMT",
    "summary": "How might the UK be affected by Trump's tariffs, even if they are not imposed on the UK?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly.",
      "The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs.",
      "Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America.",
      "He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\".",
      "The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\"",
      "So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America.",
      "Does the UK have a trade surplus with the US?",
      "The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data.",
      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",
      "Higher borrowing costs could slow the UK economy and also put pressure on the UK government to cut public spending or raise taxes in order to keep within its chosen borrowing rules.",
      "Correction: This article has been changed \u2013 the worth of power generation machinery to the US in 2023 was \u00a35.2bn.",

    "story": [
      "The leader of the Senedd's Conservatives and one of his colleagues has missed a vote on the Welsh government's draft budget after they went to the US for a prayer meeting.",
      "Darren Millar and Russell George are attending the National Prayer Breakfast where President Donald Trump is expected to give a speech.",
      "It meant the pair missed the first opportunity to debate Welsh government spending plans for next year.",
      "Labour won the vote on Tuesday, assisted by the abstention of Welsh Lib Dem Jane Dodds, as well as the absence of the two senior Conservatives.",
      "The governing party has half the seats in the Senedd and cannot win if the opposition is united in voting against.",
      "Before the news emerged that Millar was not present the vote had looked difficult for the government, as it was not clear what Dodds would do until late on Tuesday.",
      "The vote was largely symbolic ahead of a final vote in March, but losing on Tuesday would have embarrassed the government.",
      "Dodds has been in discussions with the government on a potential deal to help the spending plans pass next month, but has not yet announced an agreement.",
      "On Tuesday Plaid Cymru accused the Tories of giving up on being an opposition party, while Reform said the Conservatives \"don't care about Wales\".",
      "The prayer meeting on 6 February is an important date in the American political calendar and the first since Trump's inauguration.",
      "'I'm Christian - get over it', says Welsh Tory leader",
      "Who is Darren Millar, new Senedd Tory leader?",
      "Both Tories are trustees of a Christian charity, the Evans Roberts Institute.",
      "The institute last year funded Rhys ab Owen to go to the same American event, while he was under investigation for his conduct.",
      "Conservatives have strongly criticised the spending plans and said on Monday night: \"It must be voted down.\"",
      "But it emerged on Tuesday morning Millar would not be there because of what was described as \"a long-standing commitment in the US where he will be meeting a number of high-profile politicians\".",
      "Absent Senedd members can ask a member from another party to sit out the vote, an informal arrangement known as pairing.",
      "It is understood the Conservatives asked Labour to pair, but the request was rejected.",
      "In the debate, Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford told the Senedd he had been able to \"provide an uplift to every part of the public service here in Wales, as well as to many other important areas\".",
      "\"Key areas such as the NHS, local government, education, transport and climate change will all benefit from this additional funding,\" he said.",
      "But Conservative Finance Spokesman Sam Rowlands accused the Welsh government of an \"obsessive focus on centralisation and government jobs at the expense of trusting people to spend their own money in the way they see best for their families\".",
      "He called on ministers to use their tax powers \"to reduce the tax burden on people across Wales and put more money back in the pockets of hard working people\".",
      "Plaid also voted against the budget.",
      "Plaid Cymru's Heledd Fychan said \"every independent analysis [and] every sector that is in crisis demonstrates in stark terms that the draft budget is not going to lead to a brighter future for Wales, as we were told when it was published\".",
      "She said the Senedd should be \"recommitting\" to \"ensure fair funding for Wales, along with the powers to enable us to manage our resources more effectively here in Wales\".",
      "Labour won the vote: 29 for, 26 against, with one abstention.",
      "'Remarkable'",
      "Earlier, in First Minister's Questions, Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said Mr Millar's absence was \"remarkable\".",
      "He said the party had \"clearly given up even on being an opposition party\".",
      "A Newport Conservative councillor, David Fouweather, said on X: \"If this is true it's an absolute disgrace that two of our members are missing. By not being present they are letting Labour do as they wish.\"",
      "A spokesman for Reform, which has no Senedd seats, said: \"Today, the Senedd opposition had the opportunity to stand up against Mark Drakeford's disastrous draft budget.",
      "\"Instead, the Tory leader of the opposition is in Washington DC proving yet again that the Conservatives don't care about Wales. They are opposition in name only.\"",
      "Analysis",
      "By Gareth Lewis, BBC Wales political editor",
      "Politics can move in mysterious ways at times, but this development has come as a huge surprise.",
      "Yes, the vote on the draft budget was symbolic, but it was a rare opportunity to embarrass Labour.",
      "Now it's the Conservatives in that position, especially after a punchy press release last night saying the budget should be voted down \u2013 something they knew could not happen.",
      "To say Labour and Plaid Cymru have been taken aback by events would be an understatement.",
      "Conservative sources are trying to play it down, saying Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds would have abstained in any case.",
      "And this does not take away from one final manoeuvre \u2013 Labour still needs to do a deal to get its budget through the Senedd in March.",
      "'Longstanding commitment'",
      "A Welsh Conservative spokesperson said: \"There is a vote today to \"note\" the draft budget. It is not the final vote which will be next month. The Welsh Conservative group will certainly be voting it down because we believe Labour have the wrong priorities.",
      "\"Darren had a longstanding commitment in the US where he will be meeting a number of high-profile politicians.",
      "\"Following the decision of Keir Starmer to allow around a hundred Labour activists to campaign abroad against President Trump, Darren's presence will help rebuild relationships between the US and Wales more broadly.\""

    "story": [
      "The UK is \"not choosing between the US and the EU\", Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said after President Donald Trump threatened the European Union with trade tariffs.",
      "Over the weekend, Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico - which have both since been paused - and said he would take similar action against the EU but suggested a deal could be \"worked out\" with the UK.",
      "Asked if he would be willing to water down attempts to forge closer ties with the EU in exchange for keeping the US on side, Sir Keir said both relationships were important to the UK.",
      "\"Now, that for me isn't new, I think that's always been the case and will be the case for many, many years to come,\" he added.",
      "The prime minister told a press conference in Brussels it was \"early days\" when it came to tariff talks with the US and that he backed \"open and strong trading relations\".",
      "Sir Keir was in Belgium to meet Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte and attend talks with EU leaders - the first PM to do so since Brexit.",
      "Asked about tensions between the US and the EU, Rutte said there were \"always issues between allies\" but that would \"not get in the way of our collective determination to keep our deterrent strong\".",
      "On Ukraine, he said Nato - the military alliance of Western countries - had to \"not only sustain but continue to step up our support\" to ensure Ukraine could negotiate with Russia from \"a position of strength\".",
      "He added that spending 2% of national income on defence was \"not enough to keep us safe\" and that there was \"no time to waste\" in boosting funding.",
      "Currently Nato asks every member country to spend a least 2% of GDP on defence, however it is thought only 23 of the 32 members meet the target.",
      "Sir Keir said the UK currently spends 2.3% and that his government would shortly be setting out \"the path\" towards reaching 2.5%.",

    "story": [
      "The government will step in more quickly to help struggling schools based on the findings of new Ofsted report cards, the education secretary has said.",
      "Bridget Phillipson said in a speech on Monday that the old single-word Ofsted judgements, which were scrapped last year, were \"too blunt\" and \"too vague\" to serve a purpose.",
      "She said new regional teams, with a budget of up to \u00a3100,000 per school, would help turn around the 600 \"stuck\" schools in England which had received back-to-back negative judgements from Ofsted.",
      "However, the report cards have drawn strong criticism from school leaders, who said the proposals risk \"replicating the worst aspects of the current system\".",
      "Prof Julia Waters, whose sister Ruth Perry took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, said it appeared to be \"a rehash of the discredited and dangerous system it is meant to replace\".",
      "The changes follow a major public debate around Ofsted after a coroner ruled that an inspection contributed to the death of primary school head teacher Mrs Perry in 2023.",
      "Phillipson pushed back on the criticism of the report cards after her speech, saying parents wanted more information about schools.",
      "She also said she was \"delighted to see the debate raging\" over the proposed reforms, saying \"that is how we shape the best education system\".",
      "She said report cards would provide \"rich, granular insight\" which would help to deliver \"tailored\" support for struggling schools.",
      "Those schools which do not improve will be transferred to a successful academy trust, even if they are already run by a different academy or a council.",
      "Under Ofsted's proposals, the old one or two-word judgements, ranging across four grades from \"Outstanding\" to \"Inadequate\", will be replaced from the 2025 autumn term by a report card describing what inspectors have found on key aspects of each school, including:",
      "Quality of educationBehaviour and attendancePersonal developmentLeadership and management",
      "Quality of education",
      "Behaviour and attendance",
      "Personal development",
      "Leadership and management",
      "There will be five possible grades for each area, which are also one or two words in length: \"causing concern\", \"attention needed\", \"secure\", \"strong\" and \"exemplary\".",
      "The grading scales will focus on how schools support disadvantaged and vulnerable pupils, and there will be more emphasis on the local circumstances in which schools operate.",
      "A separate part of the report card will say whether the school's duties around safeguarding have been met.",
      "The new format will be used for inspections across all settings, from early years to further education colleges, but will be tailored to the type of provider, Ofsted said.",
      "Ofsted boss Sir Martyn Oliver said the proposals were designed to \"raise standards and improve the lives of children, particularly the most disadvantaged\".",
      "He said the \"suite of grades\" would give parents \"much more detail\" and help identify a school's strengths and areas for improvement.",
      "However, school leaders' unions said the new system would add \"enormous pressure\" to schools, and could \"worsen an already severe recruitment and retention crisis\" in teaching.",
      "Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the plans would generate a \"new league table based on the sum of Ofsted judgements across at least 40 points of comparison\".",
      "It would be \"bewildering for teachers and leaders, never mind the parents whose choices these reports are supposedly intended to guide\", he added.",
      "Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the plans would \"do little to reduce the enormous pressure school leaders are under\".",
      "Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said the five-point grading scale \"maintains the current blunt, reductive approach that cannot capture the complexity of school life nor provide more meaningful information to parents\".",
      "As well as criticism over its single-word judgements, Sir Martyn has also previously said Ofsted's inspection process should be \"far more empathetic\".",
      "Those comments came in the wake of the inquest into Ruth Perry's death, in which the coroner said the inspection at her school had \"lacked fairness, respect and sensitivity\" and was at times \"rude and intimidating\".",
      "Ofsted removed its practice of issuing overall grades for a school at the start of the current academic year, bringing in a temporary system of grading individual aspects of a school's performance, ahead of the introduction of report cards later this year.",
      "Wirral head teacher Stuart Mycroft had his school, Castleway Primary, inspected under the current system in the autumn term.",
      "He told the BBC he was not convinced that Ofsted had truly changed.",
      "He said the inspection had left him crying in his office, despite it ultimately resulting in a \"Good\" judgement.",
      "He said the inspection process had been confrontational and unpleasant.",
      "\"The impact emotionally was huge,\" he said. \"I was absolutely exhausted.\"",
      "Ofsted's consultation on its new report cards will run until 22 April. It said it would be trialling the new system over the coming months."

      "Possessing AI paedophile manuals - which teach people how to use AI for sexual abuse - will also be made illegal, and offenders will get up to three years in prison.",
      "\"What we're seeing is that AI is now putting the online child abuse on steroids,\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.",
      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Artificially generated CSAM involves images that are either partly or completely computer generated. Software can \"nudify\" real images and replace the face of one child with another, creating a realistic image.",

      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse.

      "In research last year it found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%.",
      "Experts say AI CSAM can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake.",
      "The interim chief executive of the IWF, Derek Ray-Hill, said: \"The availability of this AI content further fuels sexual violence against children.",
      "\"It emboldens and encourages abusers, and it makes real children less safe. There is certainly more to be done to prevent AI technology from being exploited, but we welcome [the] announcement, and believe these measures are a vital starting point.\"",

      "Violent and extremist videos are still online despite government calls for their removal, the home secretary has told the BBC.",
      "Yvette Cooper condemned tech giants for failing to take down disturbing videos, including footage watched by the Southport killer, calling their response \"disgraceful\" and a clear breach of their \"moral responsibilities\".",
      "Last week it emerged that Axel Rudakubana, who murdered three young girls and seriously injured eight other children and two adults at a dance class in July, had watched graphic footage of a knife attack in Australia and downloaded an academic study of an Al-Qaeda training manual.",
      "Cooper told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that, despite her letter to X, Meta, TikTok, Google, and YouTube, much of the harmful content is still available.",

      "In the home secretary's letter, which was co-written with Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, Cooper said that, while possession of the al-Qaeda study was illegal under existing anti-terror laws, Rudakubana had been \"able to easily obtain access\" to it.",
      "Kuenssberg asked Cooper why, given her position as home secretary, she appeared to be powerless to stop it. The home secretary said the Online Safety Act, which comes into force this spring, will require social media platforms to remove illegal content. She warned that the government is ready to take further steps if these companies don't comply.",
      "Visibly angry, Cooper said: \"They really should be doing more, but this will mean if they don't, then there will be new penalties brought in. Much stronger action can be taken against them and then further stronger measures on the protection of children later in the year.\"",

      "\"Different organisations all have partial responsibilities, but that network collectively failed to identify the scale of risk that this young man poses.\"",
      "Asked what she proposed as a remedy to the problem, Cooper said \"the system needs to be strengthened.\"",
      "She pointed out that when someone demonstrates clear ideological extremism, such as Islamist extremism, the Prevent programme is well-equipped to intervene. But when individuals, like Rudakubana, show a dangerous obsession with extreme violence \u2013 without a clear ideology \u2013 the current system struggles to address the threat.",
      "\"The impact of what they do may be terrorising in the same way,\" she said, explaining that such individuals can cause widespread fear, even if their motives are not linked to terrorism.",
      "Kuenssberg once again pressed the home secretary on a solution and Cooper acknowledged that, in some cases, mental health services might need to take the lead, while in others, the police or social services should be more involved.",
      "She claimed that the current approach is a legacy of previous failures and suggested that the inception of youth prevention partnerships, which would bring together different agencies, could be a step towards a more coordinated response.",

      "\"We are not keeping up with the challenge that we're seeing,\" she said.",

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced at the end of January that the government would look at changing laws to allow perpetrators of \"extreme individualised violence,\" like Rudakubana, to be charged with terrorism offences.",

      "The plans are part of one of the government's key missions, a drive to decarbonise the UK's electricity system by 2030. Just over half of our power currently comes from wind, solar, nuclear and biomass - organic matter.  The government wants to raise that to 95% by 2030 - just five years' time.",
      "The target is ambitious, and controversial. Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, told the BBC it is essential to \"cut bills, tackle the climate crisis and give us energy security\".",

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to take on the \"naysayers\" and \"Nimbys\" [Not in My Back Yard], who he says stand in the way of national growth by making repeated legal challenges to planning decisions.",
      "That message was underscored last week. Chancellor Rachel Reeves vowed to go \"further and faster\" in her effort to deliver the government's growth agenda as she announced a series of potentially controversial new infrastructure projects, including backing plans for a third runway at Heathrow.",

      "\"You need the solar farms, you need the rooftop solar. You need onshore wind, you need offshore wind, you need nuclear. You need all of these things,\" he says.",
      "It will also mean more pylons, cables and substations. But what about the local communities who told us they felt they were not being heard and feared their concerns would be overridden?",
      "\"The answer is to listen to local people but to make decisions. That's what our country needs,\" Mr Milliband says.",
      "He says the government has committed to provide direct benefits to affected communities via community funds, he adds. People who live near transmission lines could also have discounts on their energy bills.",
      "But Mr Miliband also says: \"I can't say to you local people will have a veto over individual projects in their area.\"",

      "The Climate Change Committee, an independent body that advises the government on the most efficient way to achieve its climate targets, says the industry has reasons for choosing pylons.",
      "\"One of which is cost, in many cases, it's the cheapest route to delivering clean electricity to people from where it's produced,\" says chief executive Emma Pinchbeck. \"And that's important because ultimately consumers are paying for that infrastructure on their energy bills.",
      "\"The second is technical. We're talking about high voltage lines in many cases. These are really big cables and it's often better for the physics of the energy system to have them up in the air and accessible.\"",

      "\"Governments can, with easy disdain, use the word 'Nimby',\" he says. \"It's easy, but they don't live here.\"",
      "The county is a potential hub for new energy projects. Miles of trenches may be dug for cabling, large new electricity substations and converter stations have been proposed, and plans for offshore wind farms have already been approved.",
      "Like Eileen in Aberdeenshire, Fiennes questions the impact on the local landscape and whether alternatives - like building offshore grid infrastructure and using undersea cabling so the electricity can be brought ashore on former industrial sites - are being overlooked.",
      "\"We need this energy. The planet is lost without it,\" he says. \"But what's the best version of bringing in this green, clean energy?\"",
      "William Rose meets us on the farm in Lincolnshire he has run for more than half a century. Nearby, three large solar farms have been approved and another is proposed. Soon the fields could be full of ordered ranks of metal frames holding millions of shiny solar panels.",

      "Ukrainians can again bring their children to join them in the UK, after the government reversed changes to visa rules.",
      "Last February - without notice - the government restricted eligibility so Ukrainians without the right to live in the UK permanently could no longer sponsor people under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows people to host those fleeing the war.",
      "Charities said this left families torn apart, with some desperate parents resorting to illegal routes to bring their children to the UK.",
      "They welcomed the announcement as a \"huge relief\" for parents separated from their children but warned it will not help those forced apart from other family members such as siblings or parents.",
      "More than 190,000 people have come to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme since it was launched in March 2022, following the Russian invasion.",
      "However, under changes brought in last February under the Conservatives, only British or Irish citizens, or those with the right to live in the UK permanently, have been able to act as sponsors, who provide somewhere for people to live.",
      "This meant Ukrainians living in the UK without permanent residence could no longer sponsor family members to join them in the UK.",
      "At the same time the Ukraine Family Scheme, which allowed Ukrainians to join family members who already had permanent residence in the UK, was also closed.",

      "Ukraine family visa scheme closes to new applicants",
      "The government has now announced a parent or legal guardian who is in the UK under any of the visa schemes for Ukrainians can apply to sponsor their child under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.",
      "Valentyna - not her real name - applied for her 12-year-old son to join her in the UK last August but her application had remained pending because Ukrainians were no longer allowed to act as sponsors.",
      "She first came to the UK before the invasion for seasonal work on a farm and extended her visa when the war broke out.",
      "Her son was staying with relatives in Odessa while she found somewhere permanent to live before applying for him to join her.",
      "Valentyna has not seen her son for six months and became emotional when asked how it felt to be separated from him.",

      "Dora-Olivia Vicol, chief executive of Work Rights Centre, a charity supporting migrants, said: \"It will come as a huge relief to those parents who have been separated from their children, and will finally be able to bring them to the UK to reunite in safety.\"",
      "She added: \"However, this action does not help those who have been forced apart from other family members, including siblings, parents or partners.",
      "\"We know there are many Ukrainians in the UK who left behind elderly, sick or disabled relatives with the belief they would be able to bring them later. They face a cruel choice: leave the safety of the UK to care for them in Ukraine, or remain in safety leaving their loved ones vulnerable at risk.\"",
      "The charity says it has heard from hundreds of Ukrainians separated from family members and trying to bring them to the UK.",
      "Settled, another charity which supports Ukrainians applying for visas, said some families had resorted to bringing their children to join them through illegal routes, rather than leave them in danger.",
      "Yuliia Ismail, an immigration advisor for the charity, said: \"We ask that the Home Office now acts quickly to decide outstanding applications from children stuck in Ukrainian conflict zones some of which have been in limbo for almost a year.\"",
      "A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Under the previous government, a change was made to the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which meant that parents could not sponsor their children to join them in the UK even if they had appropriate accommodation.",
      "\"We have taken urgent action to resolve this issue, which will now enable parents with Ukraine Scheme visas to sponsor their children to join them in the UK. These will apply to both applications that have already been made, as well as future applications.\""

    "story": [
      "When Sir Keir Starmer was preparing to run for the Labour leadership in 2020, his campaign director told the future prime minister what mattered to the party.",
      "Morgan McSweeney emphasised that whatever their faction, Labour members shared certain core principles - and top of the list was a commitment to combatting poverty and defending the welfare state.",
      "That is why any Labour politician treads carefully when looking at welfare reform.",
      "This government, though, is not just looking at reforming welfare  - it is preparing to put it at the heart of its economic agenda.",
      "In Rachel Reeves's big speech on growth this week, she vowed that to achieve \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, the government would look at areas that have been \"ducked for too long, like the rising cost of health and disability benefits\".",
      "What did that mean?",
      "The question is being frantically addressed between the Treasury and the Department of Work of Pensions (DWP) right now.",
      "Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, will present a \"green paper\" - or policy proposals - on welfare reform in just over a month, designed to demonstrate how serious the government is about finding ways to get more people into work - and save money from the welfare budget.",
      "That dual motive explains why this is being treated as such an urgent issue at the top of government.",
      "Ministers are concerned by a situation in which the amount of people who are in receipt of certain benefits has surged. Meanwhile, the Treasury needs to ensure that it is not on course to break its own self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "\"It's high up the agenda for us because of the cost implications but also the broader economic problem of having so many people economically inactive,\" a Treasury source said.",
      "And in 10 Downing Street, aides say that tackling this issue would be the clearest sign yet that Sir Keir is truly serious about reforming public services.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Some of this is the legacy of Covid. But the chancellor has made clear her view that another reason for this surge is the \"perverse incentives\" wired into the system.",
      "Again and again, ministers and officials complain of a system where those on universal credit are required to display evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.",
      "Ministers believe that this encourages some people to \"game the system\". Some Labour advisers fear this issue is being exacerbated, especially among young people, by videos on TikTok and other platforms which explain to claimants the best ways to fill out questionnaires in order to get sickness benefits.",
      "One option officials are examining is whether there should be \u2013 as in the past - a third path whereby some people on sickness benefits are required to seek work - but without the risk that they lose their sickness benefits.",
      "\"Lots of people tell us they're scared to go to work in case it doesn't work out and they then can't go back to the safety net,\" a senior government source said.",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "Labour says it will cut benefits bill in its own way",
      "DWP must focus on work not welfare, says minister",
      "Some in government say this may need more frequent assessments of claimants' health, but those involved in discussions acknowledge that being required to explain their condition to the DWP can often be \"traumatic\", \"humiliating\" and \"terrifying\" for vulnerable claimants.",
      "Better training and coaching can help, but the amount of money involved may not sit well with a Treasury that's in savings mode.",
      "That's complicated enough - and that's before you even get to the finances and the politics.",
      "On the finances, this round of welfare reform is designed to generate savings that can be \"scored\", in other words accounted for, by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the next Budget in the autumn.",
      "But those involved in past Budgets caution that it is \"basically impossible\" to persuade the OBR that the savings will actually happen.",
      "And then there's the politics.",
      "As McSweeney, now Sir Keir's chief of staff, found - the Labour Party is deeply committed to the welfare state and deeply anxious about anything which looks like the safety net is fraying.",
      "That's not just true of party members but MPs too. Among the vast 2024 intake of Labour MPs, one of their most common reasons for getting involved in the Labour Party was opposition to Conservative austerity and welfare cuts.",
      "That means that even some of those most loyal to Starmer and Reeves are privately expressing significant anxiety about the direction of travel.",
      "Some of these tensions are beginning to spill into public view.",
      "At PMQs this week Debbie Abrahams, the Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said that \"speculation\" about billions of pounds of savings to be found from the social security budget had left \"many vulnerable claimants [feeling] worried\".",
      "She warned the prime minister that \"language matters\".",
      "Senior Labour figures involved in the discussions are adamant that it is Reeves and Starmer who are in line with public opinion, not concerned Labour MPs.",
      "One complained: \"If you ask Labour MPs whether they'd rather be on the side of the public or on the side of a lot of the Labour movement and vocal disability campaigners - well, for some of them that's a marginal call.\"",
      "Others caution about public opinion on this issue though: \"The public think they support welfare cuts until they hear a story about someone they feel sympathy for losing money. Then they don't.\"",
      "Some older hands warn of how quickly the government could be left out of step with its base, pointing to the party's decision to abstain on a Conservative welfare bill in July 2015.",
      "Such was the scale of Labour members' fury that Conservative welfare cuts were not being opposed, it is seen by many as the main reason that Jeremy Corbyn's longshot leadership campaign took off.",
      "Jon Ashworth, a former shadow cabinet minister who is still close to top party figures, urged the government to put \"helping people move into good, well-paid jobs\" at the heart of their arguments for reform.",
      "He said: \"The welfare system as currently designed traps people out of work and actively denies people who want to work real, genuine help.\"",
      "These political considerations are not new territory for Reeves. She was shadow work and pensions secretary for two years before the 2015 general election.",
      "Her vow that Labour would be \"tougher than the Tories on benefits\" made her deeply controversial with the party's grassroots for years afterwards. Speaking to the New Statesman in 2021, Reeves acknowledged she may have made her point \"badly\", but insisted that \"spending more on benefits wasn't always a sign of success. And actually the benefits bill goes up when society fails.\"",
      "These dilemmas may not be new for Reeves, but they have left some of her colleagues feeling uneasy at best.",
      "\"Of course I'm worried about the politics of this,\" one minister said.",
      "\"Anyone with a brain would worry about this.\"",

    "title": "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",
      "Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify the amount of time EU citizens can spend in the UK, visa free.",

    "story": [
      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday that \"economic growth is the number one mission of this government\" as she unveiled a series of proposals to boost the UK's economy.",
      "But how quickly could the government get growth from the plans she announced?",
      "Critics have argued some of the projects - such as expanding Heathrow  - would not help in the near term.",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers and claims.",
      "How slow is the UK's growth?",
      "The most recent official data shows there was virtually no growth in GDP - the overall size of the UK economy - between the July 2024 election and November 2024.",
      "And the latest medium term official growth forecast from the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the government's official forecaster, is for 1.6% GDP growth in 2029, which would be well below the pre-2008 financial crisis average growth of 2.8% a year.",
      "However, the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the UK's growth rate for 2025 and 2026 will be higher than in France and Germany.",
      "Lower rates of GDP growth would translate into slower growth in our wages and incomes and general living standards.",
      "Heathrow expansion",
      "The chancellor said that allowing Heathrow to build a third runway would \"create 100,000 jobs\", boost investment and exports and \"unlock futher growth\".",
      "She cited a new report by the consultancy Frontier Economics which found it could increase the UK's potential GDP by 2050 by 0.43%, around \u00a317bn.",
      "That is broadly in line with the findings of an independent commission by Sir Howard Davies in 2015, which concluded a third runway at Heathrow would support UK trade and enhance productivity and push up GDP by 0.65-0.75% by 2050 relative to otherwise.",
      "However, most analysts believe it would likely take many years before shovels went into the ground to start building a new runway, even with new reforms to speed up the planning process.",
      "And the government will have a difficult balancing act to both expand Heathrow and meet its climate goals.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury for its source for the 100,000 jobs figure and it pointed to a 2017 report by the Department for Transport estimating that a new runway at Heathrow could add between 57,000 and 114,000 additional local jobs. Though that report added that \"these jobs are not additional at the national level, as some jobs may have been displaced from other airports or other sectors.\"",
      "Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor",
      "The chancellor in her speech claimed an Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor \"could add up to \u00a378bn to the UK economy by 2035\".",
      "This corridor is a resurrection of the previous government's plans to join Oxford and Cambridge with new transport links and allow those two university and research hubs to expand.",
      "In support of the chancellor's figure, the Treasury has cited research by an industry group called the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster.",
      "This research shows that this \u00a378bn is a \"cumulative figure\" over 10 years, not the boost in a given year.",
      "The analysis suggests the project could add \u00a325bn in Gross Value Added (GVA) a year to the UK economy by 2035.",
      "That would constitute roughly a permanent 1% boost to UK GDP by that date.",
      "Estimates of the impacts of an infrastructure project on growth are inherently uncertain and very sensitive to the assumptions of researchers about what would have happened to growth if it had never been built.",
      "Yet most economists do believe infrastructure projects, especially those that allow already productive places to expand, will ultimately help the UK economy grow more rapidly than otherwise.",
      "Ben Caswell, a senior economist at The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), said: \"Big infrastructure projects typically deliver growth over the long term, approximately 10 to 20 years.\"",
      "\"There may be a small demand side boost in the short term when shovels are in the ground, but nothing so significant that you would see it in headline GDP growth figures.",
      "\"However, after the project is complete, the supply capacity of the economy is permanently enhanced, and, all other things equal, that delivers higher sustained GDP growth than would have otherwise been.\"",
      "Pensions reform",
      "Another reform the chancellor says will be pro-growth is enabling UK companies to access the funds from their \"defined benefit pension\" pots, held on behalf of their workforces to fund their retirement.",
      "Defined benefit pension schemes guarantee an annual pension payment to retired workers, based on their salary while they were in work.",
      "Many of these defined benefit pension pots have moved into surplus in recent years due to the rise in interest rates since the pandemic, meaning their financial assets (their investments) are greater than their financial liabilities (what they have to pay out to pensioners).",
      "The Treasury has said that approximately 75% of schemes are now in surplus and that the total surplus adds up to \u00a3160bn.",
      "The chancellor wants to legislate to allow the firms to use these funds to invest, while keeping safeguards to protect and guarantee workers' pension pay-outs.",

      "What's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?",
      "At a glance: What was in Rachel Reeves's speech?",

      "The official Pension Regulator estimates that on one measurement the size in September 2024 was \u00a3207bn, but \u00a3137bn on a different measurement.",
      "The Treasury's estimate is roughly midway between the two.",
      "If such sums were deployed that could, in theory, make a positive difference to overall UK business investment, which is regarded by economists as both a short term and a long term driver of GDP growth.",
      "Total business investment in 2023, according to official data, was \u00a3258bn.",

      "Many of those Labour MPs most in favour of what the chancellor has said in her speech on economic growth are part of the Labour Growth Group, a new alliance formed last year to push the government to deliver major infrastructure projects and housebuilding as fast as possible.",
      "MP Chris Curtis, the group's co-chair, told the BBC: \"Anyone worrying about the opposition the Chancellor will face should know there's more than 100 MPs in the Labour Growth Group who are ready to back her every step of the way in bringing this bold vision to life.\"",
      "He added: \"This speech was bullish and that's exactly what it needed to be \u2013 bullish on the potential of our economy and in taking on those who will stand in the way of realising that potential.\"",

His instant restatement of his opposition to the scheme  - because of its \"severe impact\" on noise, air pollution and climate change  - may well embolden Labour critics in the House of Commons, including within the government.",
      "One senior government source insisted this morning that Reeves's decision to publicly invite Heathrow to submit an application should be seen as just that - an invitation that will kick off a long process with plenty more opportunities for internal opponents to make their case.",
      "Some inside Labour argue that there is a generational divide within the party on many controversial growth issues, including this one.",
      "One member of the 2024 Labour intake told me this afternoon that they expected opposition to Heathrow expansion among Labour MPs to be limited mostly to \"nimby boomers\".",
      "Opponents of the runway insist the generational split will prove to be the other way round, citing the concerns of young voters about the environment.",
      "Of course, Heathrow was not the only meaty part of the chancellor's speech. There is some private unease among Labour MPs who represent seats in the Midlands and the north of England that the projects are mostly, but not all, located in the south.",
      "Even one Labour MP for a seat in the south of England urged the government to talk not only about the benefits of the developments to Oxford and Cambridge, but also to stress the benefits for the communities in between the two cities  - noting acidly that Reeves, Sir Keir Starmer and all the previous five Conservative prime ministers went to Oxford University.",
      "While the response of Labour MPs will play a big role in determining how Reeves's speech is assessed in Westminster, the actual delivery of her plans will rely in large part on private finance and local government.",
      "The entire speech was designed to boost business confidence in Britain's prospects. The decisions firms make over the coming weeks, months and years will help to show whether that was a success.",
      "When it comes to local government, some of the signs are not auspicious.",
      "The BBC revealed last month that local councils, many of them Labour-led, had told the government its housebuilding plans were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "Ministers are eager to strike devolution deals across the country but in some areas on the growth corridor this is proving complicated.",
      "More housebuilding will also require new Labour MPs, many of whom claimed long-term Conservative seats in last year's election landslide, to face down local campaigners arguing against development and argue for prioritising growth instead.",
      "It was striking this afternoon how many centre-right think tanks, disappointed by the pace of building projects under the Conservatives, praised Reeves's approach this afternoon.",
      "Even among those most supportive of Reeves's agenda, some argue that plans for long-term growth need to be accompanied by short-term ways to boost Britons' living standards.",
      "The prime minister's \"plan for change\" shift at the end of last year was in part an attempt to move the main focus of the government away from targeting GDP and towards \"milestones\" tangible to people's everyday lives.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:02:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The asteroid named YR4 has a 1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032",
    "story": [
      "UN planetary defence organisations are closely monitoring an asteroid that has a tiny risk of hitting the Earth.",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) has said that it has an almost 99% chance of safely passing Earth on 22 December 2032, but a possible impact \"cannot yet be entirely ruled out\".",
      "The probability that the asteroid, called 2024 YR4, may impact Earth on 22 December 2032 is currently estimated to be 1.3%.",
      "Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society, says that he is \"not panicking or losing sleep over it\".",
      "\"There is no need for alarm,\" he said. \"The thing about this kind of event is that historically they tend to go away when the calculations are refined.\"",
      "We need to be aware alert and we need to give astronomers the resources they need to track these kinds of threats so that we can take action as soon as possible.\"",
      "YR4 was detected on 27 December 2024. Astronomers calculated that it was between 40m and 90m across. This would have the power of a nuclear bomb were it to hit the Earth and cause severe damage if the impact was in a populated area.",
      "But it is much more likely that YR4 would fall into the ocean or a remote part of the planet. It is too far away from Earth and there are too many uncertainties at this stage to determine where a potential impact could occur in the unlikely event of a collision.",
      "Since early January, astronomers have been using telescopes to calculate the asteroid's size and trajectory more precisely. YR4 is now rated at level 3 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale: \"a close encounter that warrants attention from astronomers and the public\". A collision is only certain when it reaches 8, 9 or 10, with the numbers rising in line with the damage likely caused.",
      "When asteroids are initially calculated to have a small probability of hitting the Earth, that impact probability usually drops to zero after additional observations.",
      "This happened in 2004 when an asteroid called Apophis was calculated to have a 2.7% chance of striking Earth in 2029; further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "Any object that may be more than 50m wide and has a greater than 1% chance of hitting the Earth, triggers a set of precautionary measures. These are to ensure that the threat, however tiny, is closely monitored and, if necessary, steps are taken to nullify it.",
      "The first stage is to activate two UN-endorsed asteroid reaction groups: the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), chaired by Nasa, and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), chaired by the European Space Agency.",
      "The SMPAG is having a series of meetings this week to determine its next steps.  It has already concluded that it is too early to take immediate action but said that it would \"monitor the evolution of impact threat and possible knowledge about the size closely\".",
      "Another meeting to take decisions on future activities will be held towards the end of April or early May, or earlier, \"if the evolution of the threat merits\".",
      "If the asteroid's impact probability remains above the 1% threshold, SMPAG will provide recommendations to the UN and may begin to evaluate options.",
      "In the unlikely event YR4 were headed our way, one option would be to divert it by hitting it with a robotic spacecraft, as was successfully tested out with Nasa's Dart mission in 2022. That changed the course of an asteroid that was not on a collision course with the Earth.",
      "\"Nasa's Dart mission showed that we have the means to divert an asteroid, but only if we spot it early enough,\" says Dr Massey.",
      "YR4 is currently moving away from Earth in almost a straight line, making it difficult to accurately determine its precise orbit before it returns towards Earth.",
      "Over the next few months, the asteroid will begin to fade from view, after which  it will be monitored by ground and space telescopes.",
      "According to ESA \"It is possible that asteroid 2024 YR4 will fade from view before we are able to entirely rule out any chance of impact in 2032. In this case, the asteroid will likely remain on ESA's risk list until it becomes observable again in 2028.\""

      "Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity.",
      "He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 \u2013 a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (\u00a3160m) for \u2013 and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date \u2013 most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy.",
      "\"We want it to be 600,000,\" he told reporters.",
      "Later, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"",
      "Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.",
      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",
      "\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"",
      "Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.",
      "Others fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.",
      "Where SpaceX fits in",
      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",
      "But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.",
      "And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.",
      "But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"",
      "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?",
      "Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.",
      "But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.",
      "\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"",
      "Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.",
      "\"The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things \u2013 and there are so many hard things\".",

    "summary": "Some scientists fear the risk of a collapse to warm Atlantic currents has not been taken seriously.",
    "story": [
      "Of all the possible climate futures, there's a scenario where the United Kingdom and north-west Europe buck the trend of global warming and instead face plunging temperatures and freezing winters.",
      "It's not the most likely outcome, but a number of scientists fear that the chance of it happening is growing, and that the consequences would be so great that it deserves proper consideration.",
      "They are concerned that the ocean currents that bring warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic could weaken - or even collapse - in response to climate change.",
      "Huge uncertainties remain about when - or even whether - a collapse could happen. So, how likely is it, and what would it mean?",
      "The system of Atlantic currents, called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), is a key reason why the UK is warmer than Moscow, despite being a similar distance from the Equator.",
      "Forming a vital part of our climate system, this conveyor belt distributes energy around the planet, bringing warm, salty water from the tropical Atlantic to cooler regions south of Greenland and Iceland, and also the Nordic Seas.",
      "The warmth from the ocean is transferred to the air above it, helping keep temperatures milder than they otherwise would be.",
      "As this salty water cools, it becomes denser, and sinks, before flowing back towards the southern hemisphere as a deep ocean current. This water eventually gets pulled back up to the surface, and the circulation continues.",
      "But Amoc appears to be getting weaker.",
      "We don't know for sure, because direct and continuous measurements of Amoc strength have only been taken since 2004. That's not long enough to be able to identify a definite change.",
      "But indirect evidence suggests it could have already slowed by around 15% over the last couple of centuries, although not all scientists agree.",
      "One indication is the sediments on the ocean floor. Larger grains indicate a stronger current. By measuring the size of the grains and calculating their age, scientists can estimate how much Amoc has slowed over time.",
      "Another piece of evidence is the so-called 'cold blob' or 'warming hole' in the north Atlantic. This describes a region which appears to have cooled in recent decades, unlike the vast majority of the world.",
      "A slowdown in Amoc - meaning less warmer water would be transported to this region - is seen as a possible culprit.",
      "This is \"a very clear signature and footprint of a classic Amoc slowdown\" says Matthew England, professor of oceanography at the University of New South Wales.",
      "The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects Amoc to weaken this century. But the major concern is that Amoc could suddenly \"switch off\", as appears to have happened repeatedly in the Earth's past.",
      "Today, global warming appears to be making the water in the north Atlantic less salty, due to extra freshwater from a melting Greenland ice sheet and more rainfall.",
      "As fresher water doesn't sink as easily, this is expected to slow the circulation and so bring less saltwater northwards from the tropics.",
      "Beyond a \"tipping point\", this loop could lead Amoc to runaway collapse.",
      "\"We really want to avoid a tipping point because then there's nothing we can do about it,\" warns David Thornalley, professor of ocean and climate science at University College London.",
      "Where might the tipping point be?",
      "No one really knows how close it may be.",
      "In 2021, the IPCC said it had \"medium confidence\" that Amoc would not collapse abruptly this century, although it expected it to weaken.",
      "But some more recent studies have pointed to a growing possibility of Amoc passing a tipping point in the coming decades, beyond which full collapse would be inevitable.",
      "Each study comes with various caveats and uncertainties, and different climate models can give different results for a system as complex as Amoc.",
      "\"We don't believe the idea of an Amoc collapse this century has substantially changed because of these new results,\" cautions Dr Laura Jackson, oceanographer at the Met Office.",
      "But many scientists are growing increasingly concerned. Prof Thornalley argues that, whatever the imperfections of individual studies, taken together they \"lead to a conclusion that we maybe need to be worried\".",
      "Following the new evidence, more than 40 leading ocean and climate scientists signed an open letter last October calling for wider recognition of the \"greatly underestimated\" risks.",
      "That is not to say the signatories believe Amoc will pass a tipping point this century. But they warn it is now enough of a possibility to warrant proper consideration.",
      "\"I'd say you're looking at a risk of reaching a tipping point in the coming decades that could be at the 10 or 20% level even if we hold the line at 2C warming [above temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate],\" warns Tim Lenton, professor of Earth system science at the University of Exeter.",
      "Given the magnitude of the consequences from Amoc collapse, these probabilities \"are not trivial,\" he adds.",
      "What would happen if Amoc collapsed?",
      "Even the most likely scenario - where Amoc continues to weaken this century - could have serious effects.",
      "\"If the Amoc gradually weakens over the next century, you're going to get global warming but less warming over Europe,\" says Dr Jackson.",
      "That would still mean the UK getting hotter summers with climate change, but a weaker Amoc could also fuel more winter storms as regional temperature patterns change.",
      "A full-scale collapse, meanwhile, would be \"like a war situation [\u2026] something almost unimaginable,\" says Prof Lenton.",
      "While it could take a century or more for impacts to play out, temperatures in northern Europe could fall by a couple of degrees a decade.",
      "In the UK, it could \"become horribly, horribly cold \u2026 like living in northern Norway,\" Prof Thornalley warns.",
      "\"Our infrastructure is not set up for that.\"",
      "There could be global consequences too, such as shifts to the tropical rain belts.",
      "\"That's a big story,\" warns Prof Lenton.",
      "\"If you lost the monsoon or seriously disrupted it, you'd have humanitarian catastrophes, in simple terms, in west Africa [and] probably in India.\"",
      "How we prepare for this alternative future poses challenges for governments.",
      "Prof Lenton draws parallels with preparations for the Covid-19 pandemic - another major event which scientists had warned about, but had no way of knowing when it might occur.",
      "But a recent report warned the UK has a \"glaring national security blind spot for climate threats\" such as those posed by Amoc collapse. The government admitted last year that it \"has not assessed the effect of any [Amoc] slowing or collapse\" on economic planning.",
      "Scientists are clear that the fundamental way to reduce these risks is to cut the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.",
      "\"We're playing a bit of a Russian roulette game,\" warns Prof England.",
      "\"The more we stack up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, the more we warm the system, the more chance we have of an Amoc slowdown and collapse.",
      "\"And so I think people need to not give up, because there's so much to be gained by reducing emissions.",
      "\"The scale of change is just so much worse if we do nothing.\"",

    "summary": "Vaccinating poultry against bird flu is still not allowed in the UK despite a rise in farm outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "Poultry farmers are appealing to the government to let them vaccinate their flocks against the \"devastating\" bird flu virus spreading across the UK.",
      "Vaccinating poultry against avian influenza is currently not allowed in the UK. The government says that strong biosecurity measures and culling are the most effective ways of fighting it. Meanwhile, there are concerns that poultry vaccinations might be linked to the virus evolving.",
      "Overall levels of the virus have not yet reached the peak of recent years.",
      "But one farmer, who has previously lost 30% of his flock because of bird flu, told the BBC that, without a vaccine, it was only a matter of time before \"it all kicks off again\".",
      "A bird flu prevention zone enforcing strict hygiene standards around domesticated birds has been declared for England, Wales and Scotland amid a rising number of cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).",
      "The risk to humans remains low, with chicken and eggs safe to eat if properly cooked, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).",
      "Defra has set up a cross-government and poultry industry taskforce that is looking at the potential use of vaccines, and is due to publish its report later this year. But poultry farmers say things are moving too slowly.",
      "Essex turkey farmer Paul Kelly, whose business was hit hard in the worst avian flu outbreak from 2021 to 2023, told the BBC that \"the foot has been taken off the gas\" when it comes to making poultry vaccines available to UK farmers.",
      "\"This is poor planning as we need to be ready for another huge outbreak as opposed to reacting to another outbreak and being behind the curve on rolling out vaccination,\" he said.",
      "\"Avian influenza is so highly pathogenic that if a farmer gets it [in his flock][ it is devastating.\"",
      "There have so far been 25 farm outbreaks of bird flu since the annual winter recording season began in October.",
      "In comparison, between October 2021 and January 2022, during the UK's worst outbreak, there had been more than 70 cases in poultry or other captive birds.",
      "But Gary Ford, of the British Free Range Egg Producers Association, said that there was still \"panic, concern and fear out there\" among farmers over the virus spreading.",
      "He added that the organisation was a \"huge supporter\" of vaccination for poultry but recognised there were challenges, including the cost to farmers and the impact on trade with other countries that prohibit imports from producers that vaccinate.",
      "Meanwhile, there have also been some scientific questions raised about bird flu vaccinations.",
      "Recent work by researchers from the UK's Royal Veterinary College and institutions in China found possible evidence that they may be linked to changes in how the virus evolves.",
      "They carried out genetic analysis of avian flu samples collected from wild birds and farmed poultry between 1996 and 2023.",
      "While they found that infections occurred more often in unvaccinated birds, they also found that in countries with high vaccination rates, there was a higher rate of change in the virus itself.",
      "They said such evolution could, in theory, lead to vaccines needing to be updated frequently to remain effective and to the virus spilling over into unvaccinated populations. They acknowledged that more research was needed to establish whether there was a direct causal link between vaccination and virus evolution.",
      "'Refocus efforts'",
      "Earlier this week, the government agency that deals with infectious diseases, UKHSA, confirmed a case of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in a farm worker in the West Midlands region.",
      "It said bird-to-human transmission of avian influenza was rare and that the risk to the wider public continues to be very low.",
      "Farmers in Shropshire, North Yorkshire, East Riding of Yorkshire, City of Kingston Upon Hull, Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk have to keep their birds caged under mandatory housing rules put in place to manage the spread.",
      "Biosecurity restrictions are also in place across England, Wales and Scotland as part of an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone.",
      "The National Farmers' Union said it was \"essential that Defra refocuses efforts\" on coming up with a workable avian influenza vaccination plan for the UK.",
      "The government currently only allows licensed zoos to vaccinate captive birds against HPAI.",
      "It said it would continue to invest in research and that any future decisions on the use of emergency or preventive vaccination would be based on the latest scientific evidence and veterinary advice.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:07:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Tomohiko Sho says the unreleased game was something fans were 'starting to get a bit bored of'.",
    "story": [
      "It is rare that a video game series becomes so popular it inspires copycats - but it is rarer still that it's so unique it kicks off its own genre.",
      "But that's what happened with Dynasty Warriors, a series which pioneered the so-called \"1 vs 1,000\" gameplay, in which the player defeats thousands of enemies in each level.",
      "Throughout years of development - the series has been going since 1997 on the original PlayStation - hardware limitations meant at its best only a few hundred enemies could appear on-screen at any one time.",
      "But all that is now changing, with the power of modern consoles enabling as many as 10,000 opponents on-screen at once.",
      "In other words, the \"1 vs 1,000\" moniker is finally coming true.",
      "And with that new power comes a new game - after seven years in the wilderness, publisher Koei Tecmo is back with Dynasty Warriors: Origins.",
      "Throughout this period the series has faced a problem - despite selling 21 million copies throughout its history - Dynasty Warriors has always sold significantly better in Japan than in the West.",
      "\"It's something that we've been trying to get a lot of people overseas to play,\" the head of developer Omega Force, Tomohiko Sho, told the BBC.",
      "But times may be changing, as the release of Dynasty Warriors: Origins in January 2025 has seen encouraging sales.",
      "In the UK, it broke the top 10 of the retail sales charts, while online it was the top-selling game on PC retailer Steam - with just under 70,000 people playing the game at the same time on launch.",
      "There have been nine numbered entries in the series since it began in 1997, culminating in 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9 on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.",
      "But advances in hardware mean Mr Sho believes now is the time for a sequel.",
      "Though he did not call it a reboot, the team has ditched the numbered titles and simply called the game Dynasty Warriors: Origins - perhaps signalling that the studio believes this is a turning point for the franchise.",
      "It released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2025, becoming the first mainline entry in the series in seven years.",
      "Mr Sho told the BBC the team had been working on a sequel - which would have been called Dynasty Warriors 10 - but he felt it was simply too similar to previous games, which fans were \"starting to get a bit bored of\".",
      "Instead, the long-awaited game was scrapped in order to take advantage of the new hardware.",
      "DW10 cancelled",
      "The reason Dynasty Warriors: Origins seeks to break away from what came before is simple, Mr Sho said - it was a result of fan reaction to the last mainline game released in the series, 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9.",
      "\"Either you really liked it, or you didn't,\" he said.",
      "The unreleased sequel was too similar to what came before, he said, but by the time development was in full swing, a change in the games industry ultimately halted production.",
      "Within two days of each other in November 2020, Sony released the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X - consoles so powerful Mr Sho ceased development to focus on the new hardware.",
      "\"The current technology allows us to have many troops and army officers on the screen,\" he said.",
      "\"This is something I've been wanting to do since Dynasty Warriors 2 and 3.\"",
      "Those two games, which released on PlayStation 2 back in 2000 and 2001, could at most manage twenty or thirty enemies on-screen at once.",
      "The new hardware can manage a lot more - with PlayStation 5 Pro owners seeing an even bigger leap in performance.",
      "\"We're able to have many troops on-screen - not just thousands, but tens of thousands,\" Mr Sho said.",
      "\"With the current generation of consoles, we're able to do that.\"",
      "But all that power comes with a cost - no multiplayer, which has been a staple of the series since its PlayStation 2 days.",
      "\"I am very aware that it is seen as an iconic part of the series,\" he said.",
      "He felt multiplayer would result in a \"performance loss\", meaning fewer enemies on screen, so he decided against including it.",
      "But he said that may change if the game were given a sequel.",
      "\"If everyone really enjoys the game, then for the next game in the series, we will definitely have multiplayer,\" he said.",
      "Spin-offs and future",
      "In the interim years between the release of Dynasty Warriors 9 and Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the team has focussed on other things - namely spin-offs.",
      "These are versions of the game, within the 1 vs 1,000 genre, outside of the main series that typically feature different characters - much like how the film franchise Puss in Boots was a spin-off of Shrek.",
      "The company has found success in this area with games featuring characters from series such as Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda and Sega's Persona 5.",
      "Mr Sho said Dynasty Warriors: Origins was a shift in direction as it focused on performance - while spin-offs were about being true to the franchises involved.",
      "\"When the teams were approaching development, they weren't thinking about the hardware,\" he said.",
      "\"But more, with Hyrule Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors being on the Switch, how would we be able to do that best as a Warriors game?\"",
      "He said Dynasty Warriors' future was about \"getting the most\" out of current consoles - perhaps with even more enemies on screen.",
      "Though he laughed off the suggestion that perhaps the studio should consider collaborating on the ultimate \"spin-off\" - a Sonic the Hedgehog game.",
      "\"I also actually like Sonic, just to let you know,\" he said.",
      "And Mr Sho said if he could make any Dynasty Warriors spin-off, there are two series he's huge fans of - Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.",

      "Four new laws will tackle the threat of child sexual abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the government has announced.",
      "The Home Office says the UK will be the first country in the world to make it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM), with a punishment of up to five years in prison.",
      "Possessing AI paedophile manuals - which teach people how to use AI for sexual abuse - will also be made illegal, and offenders will get up to three years in prison.",
      "\"What we're seeing is that AI is now putting the online child abuse on steroids,\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.",
      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Artificially generated CSAM involves images that are either partly or completely computer generated. Software can \"nudify\" real images and replace the face of one child with another, creating a realistic image.",
      "In some cases, the real-life voices of children are also used, meaning innocent survivors of abuse are being re-victimised.",
      "Fake images are also being used to blackmail children and force victims into further abuse.",
      "The National Crime Agency (NCA) said that there are 800 arrests each month relating to threats posed to children online. It said 840,000 adults are a threat to children nationwide - both online and offline - which makes up 1.6% of the adult population.",
      "Cooper said: \"You have perpetrators who are using AI to help them better groom or blackmail teenagers and children, distorting images and using those to draw young people into further abuse, just the most horrific things taking place and also becoming more sadistic.\"",
      "She continued: \"This is an area where the technology doesn't stand still and our response cannot stand still to keep children safe.\"",
      "Some experts, however, believe the government could have gone further.",
      "Prof Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse, said the changes were \"welcome\" but that there were \"significant gaps\".",
      "The government should ban \"nudify\" apps and tackle the \"normalisation of sexual activity with young-looking girls on the mainstream porn sites\", she said, describing these videos as \"simulated child sexual abuse videos\".",
      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse. Unlike in many other countries, this material remains lawful in the UK.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced, with them becoming more prevalent on the open web.",
      "The charity's latest data shows reports of AI-generated CSAM have risen 380% with 245 confirmed reports in 2024 compared with 51 in 2023. Each report can contain thousands of images.",
      "In research last year it found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%.",
      "Experts say AI CSAM can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake.",
      "The interim chief executive of the IWF, Derek Ray-Hill, said: \"The availability of this AI content further fuels sexual violence against children.",
      "\"It emboldens and encourages abusers, and it makes real children less safe. There is certainly more to be done to prevent AI technology from being exploited, but we welcome [the] announcement, and believe these measures are a vital starting point.\"",

      "Backed by celebrities, it was different to other social media sites, like MySpace or Facebook, because you could interact with any user without them having to approve a request. Companies rushed to join the service, hoping to get closer to their customers.",
      "\"If you were a brand that wanted to be part of any cultural moments that were happening, Twitter was a great place to be,\" Alex Wilson, a senior strategist at the marketing agency Pitch tells BBC News.",
      "On June 4, 2010 Elon Musk, the owner of Space X, logged on for the first time: \"Please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me.\"",
      "Twelve years later he would buy the platform for $44bn (\u00a338.1bn), reshape the algorithm, reinstate banned accounts, repurpose the policy around \"free speech\", and rename it X.",
      "He also fired thousands of staff - around 80% of the workforce.",
      "Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\".",
      "One of their main concerns was the content that would be seen around their posts that users could screengrab and share.",
      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",
      "In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,\" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News.",
      "However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, and his approval rating with the British public sits at -35.",
      "The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well.",
      "At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform.",
      "Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them of unlawfully agreeing to boycott the site.",
      "\"It's broadly fair to say Twitter is becoming less relevant across the world,\" Mr Wilson says in the Pitch office in central London, with posters of clients ranging from charities, telecommunications, and sports leagues.",
      "\"It's been a very long time since clients came to us and say: 'Twitter's fun and exciting. We want to be in that space'.",
      "\"Unless you are targeting specific audiences, maybe certain political audiences or sports  - football is still big on Twitter - it's hard to see the value in it.\"",

      "Beginning in 2013, German football team FC St Pauli, which plays in Germany's top league, the Bundesliga, posted more than 60,000 times, racking up nearly 250,000 followers.",
      "But less than 10 days after Trump's return to the White House was confirmed, the club posted: \"You can find our statement about saying goodbye to X on BlueSky. Feel free to follow us there. We're out of here.\"",
      "\"We discussed the decision for a year. We were mostly posting content with counter speech to hate. We had a lot of content for diversity, anti-racism, and anti-sexism,\" club spokesperson, Patrick Gensing told the BBC.",

      "The argument that such posts are justified by freedom of speech, does not convince him.",
      "\"We don't think racism is freedom of speech,\" says Mr Gensing.",
      "One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it was no longer posting on X and directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform.",
      "When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its \"purpose is to serve the public conversation\".",
      "Mr Musk \"has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter\", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.",
      "But leaving X can have negative consequences for organisations and their relationships with customers.",
      "\"When users leave, the impact depends on who is leaving and why. A local authority posting news provides significant value to the network. If such an account leaves, it can hurt both the platform and its users,\" he tells BBC News.",

      "In some ways, this latest tit-for-tat is nothing new and builds on the long-running trade dispute between the nations, with tariffs having already been imposed and threatened on various goods since 2018.",
      "Trump has said he plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping, so a deal could yet be struck. But if China proceeds with its response on 10 February as planned, what could the impact be?",

      "The response from Beijing means companies wanting to import fossil fuels from the US would have to pay the tax in order to do so.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of coal, but it gets most of it from Indonesia, although Russia, Australia and Mongolia are also among its suppliers.",
      "When it comes to the US, China has been increasing imports of LNG from the country, with volumes nearly double 2018 levels, according to Chinese customs data.",
      "But its overall fossil fuel trade is modest, with US imports accounting for just 1.7% of China's total crude oil bought from abroad in 2023. This suggests China is not dependent on the US and so the impact of the tariffs on its economy could be minimal.",
      "Rebecca Harding, a trade economist and chief executive of the Centre for Economic Security think tank, said China could easily source more supplies from Russia, where it has already been buying oil on the cheap as the Kremlin seeks to fund its war effort.",

      "But China is not a big importer of US pick-ups and it gets most of its cars from Europe and Japan, so a 10% tariff on an already small number of imports would not hit consumers too hard.",

      "Schools are scheduled to stay closed on the island until Friday. Authorities have also warned people to avoid certain areas of the island and empty their swimming pools.",
      "Santorini's Mayor, Nikos Zorzos, said the island was prepared for seismic activity that \"may last many weeks\". The island must approach it \"with patience and calm\", he said on Tuesday.",

      "Earthquakes occur as the result of tectonic plates moving either past, below each other or apart. This results in stress that is built up and then released as earthquakes along or near the boundaries of these plates \u2013 known as fault lines. Santorini and the Greek Islands are near such a line.",
      "As scientists cannot predict such events, the best way to prevent damage or loss of life is for authorities to reduce the vulnerability of their populations. This can be through designing and constructing earthquake-resistant buildings or evacuating residents when earthquakes begin.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 19:09:54 GMT",
    "summary": "El Salvador has offered to take in criminals deported from the US and house them in its mega-jail.",
    "story": [
      "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio could not have been more complimentary about the deal he struck with the president of El Salvador on Monday.",
      "The Trump administration's top diplomat appeared delighted yet stunned by the fact that President Nayib Bukele should have \"agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world\".",
      "Bukele had offered to take in people deported from the US, regardless of their nationality, and house them in El Salvador's mega-jail.",
      "\"We can send them and he will put them in his jails,\" Rubio said.",
      "While that was already a win for President Donald Trump, whose priority has been to speed up the removal of undocumented migrants from the US, the real surprise came in the part of the deal Rubio mentioned next.",
      "\"He [Bukele] has also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they're US citizens or legal residents,\" Rubio said.",
      "The Salvadorean leader later confirmed that he had \"offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system\".",
      "He clarified that El Salvador would be \"willing to take in only convicted criminals\" and that his government would do so \"in exchange for a fee\".",
      "Bukele also revealed where he would house those deported from the US: \"our mega-prison\".",
      "The mega-jail, also known as Cecot (short for Terrorism Confinement Centre), has become emblematic of Bukele's iron-fist approach to crime and punishment.",
      "The maximum-security prison, one of the largest in Latin America, opened in January 2023 and can house 40,000 inmates, according to government figures.",
      "Inmates are confined to windowless cells, sleep on bare metal bunks and are constantly monitored by armed guards - some of whom watch over them from atop the lattice ceiling.",
      "BBC News Mundo's Leire Ventas, who was allowed to take an official tour of the facility last year after the BBC had repeatedly asked for access, described how temperatures in the cells would reach 35C.",
      "Take a look at graphics and maps of the mega-jail",
      "With access to the prison severely restricted and journalists only allowed on occasional and carefully choreographed official tours, the number of inmates per cell is not clear.",
      "Some rights groups put it at 80 prisoners while others say it can go up to more than 150.",
      "Asked by our journalist what the maximum capacity was, the prison's director responded \"where you can fit 10 people, you can fit 20\".",
      "Face to face with inmates in El Salvador's mega-jail",
      "Prisoners are locked up inside their cells 24 hours a day - except for 30 minutes of group exercise in a windowless corridor.",
      "The layout of the jail is no coincidence.",
      "Following a particularly bloody weekend in 2022, when more than 70 people were killed in the small Central American nation, President Bukele wrote on social media: \"Message for the gangs: because of your actions, your \"homeboys\" will not be able to see a ray of sunshine\".",
      "Building of the Cecot mega-jail was started shortly afterwards.",
      "Conditions at the jail and the treatment of inmates has come under severe criticism from human rights groups.",
      "Miguel Sarre, a former member of the United Nations Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture, has described it as a \"concrete and steel pit\".",
      "So could the Trump administration send US citizens there?",
      "Bukele's offer was met with approval by Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser who retweeted Salvadorean leader's socia media post with the comment: \"Great idea!\".",
      "But any attempt to deport US citizens or people lawfully resident in the US to a foreign jail is bound to face legal challenges.",
      "US citizens who were born in the United States enjoy legal protection from deportation.",
      "There are some cases, however, in which naturalised citizens - those who were not born in the US and who obtained US citizenship after birth through a legal process - can have their citizenship revoked.",
      "This tends occur when the person in question used fraud to obtain the citizenship in the first place.",
      "Alex Cuic, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC that naturalised US citizens suspected of ties to criminal gangs or terrorist organisations -- such as the Tren de Aragua criminal gang or the Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13 - could also, in theory, be stripped of US citizenship.",
      "\"If they find out you were a member of any group that persecuted or threatened to persecute others, they can try to denaturalise you,\" Mr Cuic added.",
      "\"So, if you had gang ties and never disclosed them, they could use that as a reason to denaturalise you.\"",
      "Once a person has been \"denaturalised\", they are at risk of deportation.",
      "Mr Cuic pointed out that any such move would have to be preceded by a \"formal court process\" conducted in a federal court.",
      "But the lawyer warned that \"citizenship is not something that is definitively forever if you are naturalised\".",
      "He stressed though that he had \"never heard\" of cases of natural-born US citizens being sent abroad for imprisonment for crimes committed and prosecuted in the US.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, the director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, similarly said that she had \"never heard of such a suggestion\" as sending US citizens to serve US prison sentences overseas.",
      "While she acknowledged that there were various scenarios in which naturalised US citizens could lose their citizenship, she said that \"you can't denaturalise a natural-born citizen\".",
      "The status of lawful permanent residents in the US, however, is more precarious than that of US citizens.",
      "They can be deported if they violate certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which include committing drug offences, violent crimes or crimes such as theft, fraud or assault.",
      "Like naturalised citizens, they can also be deported if they obtained their residency through fraud.",
      "Permanent lawful residents who are involved in terrorism, espionage or any activity threatening US national interest could also be at risk of deportation.",
      "This last point is important in light of the executive order President Trump issued on his inauguration day in which he designated drug cartels as \"foreign terrorist organisations\".",
      "Two criminal organisations named in the executive order, Tren de Aragua and MS-13, were also mentioned last week by Trump's special envoy for Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone.",
      "Speaking at a briefing about Marco Rubio's trip to El Salvador, Claver-Carone not only praised Bukele's handling of the MS-13 - a gang which is deeply rooted in El Salvador and has long terrorised its citizens - but also said that Bukele could offer the answer on how to deal with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Claver-Carone also appeared to argue that the mere prospect of being sent to a Salvadorean jail could drive Venezuelan gang members back to their homeland.",
      "\"I bet they're going to want to go back to Venezuela instead of dealing with the Mara prisons in El Salvador,\" he said of members of the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "Marco Rubio, too, seemed to stress that the Trump administration would first and foremost want to send members of these two notorious gangs to El Salvador's prisons.",
      "\"Any unlawful immigrant and illegal immigrant in the United States who is a dangerous criminal -- MS-13, Tren de Aragua, whatever it may be -- he has offered his jails,\" Rubio said after his talks with Bukele.",
      "While it is by no means clear who - if anyone - will being sent from the US to El Salvador's mega-prison, what is certain is that with his \"unprecedented offer of friendship\", Bukele has landed firmly in the Trump's favour at a time when relations between the US and its neighbours have been rocked by the US president's threats to impose tariffs on their goods.",

      "It had originally been scheduled to begin in January 2024 but Mr Matar's defence team appealed for the trial to be delayed on the grounds that Mr Rushdie's then upcoming book - a memoir about the attack - could be used as evidence and the defendant's team wished to review its contents first.",

      "The Anglican Church of Southern Africa (Acsa) has apologised for failing to protect the public from the risk posed by a prolific British child abuser who had moved to South African in 2001.",
      "Senior barrister John Smyth, who died in South Africa in 2018 at the age of 77,  abused over 100 children and young men in the UK and Zimbabwe in the 1970s and 1980s. He met many of them at Christian camps that he organised.",
      "The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, resigned last year following the publication of an independent review into the matter.",
      "It found that Mr Welby and other church leaders \"could and should\" have formally reported Smyth in 2013 to police in the UK and authorities in South Africa.",
      "Smyth moved to Zimbabwe with his wife and four children from Winchester in England in 1984, two years after a report, which was not made public at the time, detailed the physical abuse he meted out.",
      "His 2001 move to South Africa came after an investigation into his activities in Zimbabwe, the findings of which were not widely circulated.",
      "A fresh enquiry commissioned last year by Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba found that while no similar cases of abuse were \"ascertainable on record\" in South Africa, \"there was a very high risk that they could have happened\".",
      "The independent report found that while the Church had no prior warnings of Smyth's abuses until 2013, its \"further communication of that warning within Acsa between 2013 and Smyth's death in 2018... fell short\".",

      "It says that Smyth joined an Anglican community in Durban, where he occasionally preached and was part of a team running confirmation classes that exposed him to young children.",
      "He and his wife Anne \"abruptly\" left that community at some point in 2003 or 2004 after the church's leaders confronted Smyth with information about his abusive behaviour, the report says.",
      "The couple then moved to Cape Town and joined another Anglican community.",
      "In August 2013, the \"first warning to Acsa\" on Smyth's behaviour was sent to Bishop Garth Counsell by the Diocese of Ely in the UK and by the end of the year, the couple left the Anglican Church for a different Christian community, Church-on-Main. They would later return to an Anglican church just shortly before Smyth's death.",
      "And while another bishop, Peter Lee, had also \"heard informally\" about the abuses prior to his arrival in South Africa in 1976, the report found that neither clergyman were \"remiss in any duty to pass on what had reached them regarding Smyth\".",
      "\"But... [they] erred in failing to inform the authorities at Church-on-Main of what they had learned about Smyth from the letter received from the Diocese of Ely.\"",
      "The report says that though there were no allegations of Smyth continuing his abusive behaviour in South Africa \"what... is evident... is that from 2001 on, young members of Acsa were exposed to the real risk of Smyth perpetrating in South Africa the serial abuse documented in the UK and Zimbabwe\".",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, Archbishop Makgoba acknowledged the Church's failure to protect its congregants and \"wider community\" from Smyth's potential abuse.",

    "summary": "Beijing's calculated and selective targeting of US goods may be an opening move ahead of talks.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing has made its decision. After days of warning of counter measures and urging Washington to enter negotiations and \"meet China halfway\", it has decided to hit back \u2013 or at least threaten to retaliate with its own tariffs.",
      "China said it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the US from 10 February.",
      "The date is important. It means there is still time for the world's two largest economies to step back from the brink of a trade war.",

      "Share falls ease after Trump tariff turmoil",
      "Five ways China is hitting back against US tariffs",
      "Firstly, China's counter measures are limited in scope compared to Donald Trump's levy of 10% on all Chinese goods heading to the US.",
      "America is the biggest exporter of liquid natural gas across the world, but China accounts for only around 2.3% of those exports and its major car imports are from Europe and Japan.",
      "This calculated and selective targeting of goods may just be an opening shot by Beijing, a way of gaining some bargaining power and leverage ahead of any talks.",
      "Officials in China may be encouraged by the cordial start to the US-China relationship since Trump took office.",
      "The US president said he had a \"very good\" phone call with President Xi days before his inaugural ceremony, which was attended by the highest-level Chinese official ever to be dispatched to such an event. He has also suggested that he hopes to work with Xi on resolving Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "President Xi might not want to pick a fight with Trump just yet as he is busy trying to shore up his own ailing economy.",
      "This is also familiar territory for both leaders \u2013 although they might not be keen to relive the past. There was a honeymoon period in US-China relations during Trump's last term, before the relationship soured.",
      "To deal or not to deal",
      "It will also be far more difficult for Trump to do a deal with China than with Mexico and Canada  - and much will depend on what he wants from Beijing.",
      "China is Washington's chief economic rival and cutting the country off from major supply chains has been a goal of the Trump administration.",
      "If Trump asks for too much, Xi might feel he can walk away and there will be limits on just how far he is willing to be pushed.",
      "The US president is dealing with a far more confident China than he did back then. Beijing has expanded its global footprint, and it is now the lead trade partner for more than 120 countries.",
      "Over the past two decades, it has also steadily tried to reduce the importance of trade to its economy and ramped up domestic production. Today, imports and exports account for around 37% of China's GDP, compared with more than 60% in the early 2000s, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "The 10% tariff will sting, but Beijing may feel it can absorb the blow \u2013 for now.",
      "The fear will be that President Trump is serious about ramping up that percentage to the 60% he pledged during his campaign or that he will continue to use the threat of tariffs as a recurring diplomatic tool to hold over Xi's head.",
      "If that happens, Beijing will want to be ready and that means having a clear strategy in case this escalates.",
      "Learning from the past",
      "The last time the leaders signed a deal it did not end well.",
      "The two countries issued tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of goods from 2018.",
      "It lasted more than two years until eventually China agreed to spend an extra $200bn (\u00a3161bn) a year on US goods in 2020.",
      "Washington hoped the deal would bring down the huge trade deficit between China and the US, but the plan was derailed by the Covid pandemic and that deficit now sits at $361bn, according to Chinese customs data.",
      "There are also key challenges for China as it is thinking several steps ahead in any negotiation.",
      "Beijing still sells nearly four times more goods to the United States than it buys - and during Trump's first term in office, it ran out of items to target.",
      "Analysts believe that China is now looking at a wider range of measures than just tariffs to retaliate if the trade war ramps up.",
      "The clock is ticking. This is not a full trade war, yet. Businesses around the world will be watching to see if the two leaders can reach some kind of settlement later this week.",

    "summary": "The president will soon have to decide whether to match his trade rhetoric with action or shelve his tariff plans.",
    "story": [
      "For the first week of Donald Trump's presidency, tariffs - a favourite talking point during last year's presidential campaign - were the dogs that didn't bark.",
      "Trade seemed to take a back seat while the new administration pressed ahead on immigration enforcement, pardons of Capitol riot convictions, a fossil-fuel energy policy and federal workforce upheaval - among a range of other disruptive new measures.",
      "That all changed this past weekend when Trump announced sweeping 25% tariffs on US allies Canada and Mexico, along with 10% duties on Chinese imports.",
      "And while he has since delayed imposing those tariffs on his North American neighbours for a month after both countries agreed new border measures, the president still faces a moment of reckoning in which he will ultimately have to decide whether to match his rhetoric with action.",
      "Trump often talks of the trade deficits between the US and its two neighbours as a key source of his dissatisfaction. If that's the case, then no amount of new border security or drug seizures - whatever the metrics or specific demands - will make the president fully abandon his tariff threats.",
      "Trump has also said he views tariffs not just as a tool to achieve policy objectives, but as a permanent source of US revenue and a means to fund government programmes and reduce the budget deficit. And if that is his ultimate objective, then tariffs on America's largest trading partners may be the only effective answer.",
      "Global financial markets reeled at this prospect on Monday, as the US appeared on the brink of waging a multi-front trade war with some of its closest economic partners.",
      "Then, after conversations with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump put the tariffs on pause. While the new duties on China have gone into effect - and have prompted retaliatory measures from Beijing - markets have viewed those US moves as less disruptive and smaller in scope.",
      "By contrast, if US had engaged in an escalating series of tariffs with Canada and Mexico, which accounted for more than $1.57tn (\u00a31.24tn) in goods in 2023, the global economic effect could have been catastrophic.",
      "That possibly dire development has been averted, for now, with Trump and his administration declaring at least a partial victory.",
      "The details of what Canada and Mexico conceded, however, paint a more complicated picture.",
      "While Canada agreed to form a joint anti-crime strike force with the US and appoint a \"fentanyl tsar\", the concrete steps it detailed were all part of a border-security package Canada had previously announced.",
      "Mexico pledged stepped up drug enforcement and 10,000 troops to patrol the US-Mexico border - but those numbers mirror the deployments the nation made in 2019 and again in 2021",
      "In a month's time, Trump will again have to decide if Canada and Mexico are doing enough to satisfy his demands - or whether the delayed tariffs will go into effect.",
      "Solid figures demonstrating progress, however, may be hard to come by.",

      "By the administration's own measures, US immigration officials only seized 43lbs (19.5kg) of fentanyl and caught 193,540 people crossing at the US-Canada border in 2024. The numbers are much higher for the US-Mexico border, but undocumented crossings - and drug seizures- are down there, as well.",
      "Global financial markets have calmed considerably since Monday morning's tariff-inspired disruption. Investors, it seems, have concluded that on trade Trump is more bluster than action.",
      "The president may be able to extract more concessions from Canadian and Mexican leaders in a month's time, but they may also conclude at some point that Trump doesn't have the will to follow through on his threats.",
      "Despite claims of success, his sabre-rattling on trade could ultimately produce diminishing returns.",
      "At that point, the president would have a decision to make. Does he shelve his most sweeping tariff plans for good? Were his dreams of returning the US to late-19th century trade policy - which he has said was a golden age of American economic power - unrealistic?",
      "Or does he press ahead with his vision of a new, more America-focused global trade order despite the risk of at least short-term economic pain?",

      "Twenty-four hours later, we're in a rather different place with the tariffs - or taxes - against America's closest neighbours and trading partners on hold for 30 days.",

      "Trump's trade war with neighbours is delayed - what did they all get out of it?",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "China is subject to significant US tariffs already and has been since Trump's first term. But the blanket nature of today's new levies from the White House on every single goods import from China - from toys, to mobile phones, to clothes - is new and significant.",
      "Beijing's promised tariff retaliation - including new levies on imports from the US of oil, agricultural machinery and some cars - is far less sweeping. Yet the retaliation moves us into the arena of tit-for-tat action, where the country experiencing the tariffs feels it has no choice but to hit back to show its own citizens it can't be pushed around by a foreign power.",
      "This is the dictionary definition of a trade war - and economic historians warn they tend to generate their own momentum and can rapidly spiral out of control.",
      "Trump has used just about every justification under the sun for tariffs, from raising more tax revenue to boosting American manufacturing and rebalancing trade. But one thing recent days confirm is the new president regards them as a powerful way to compel other nations to do what he wants.",
      "He threatened massive and punitive tariffs on Colombia when it initially refused to accept US flights of its deported nationals, but he lifted the threat when Bogota acquiesced.",
      "The White House might also point to the response of Mexico and Canada yesterday as evidence tariff threats yield results. He had threatened to ride roughshod over his own North American free trade deal unless those nations tightened up on border control. Although how much extra those two countries actually promised yesterday on border security relative to what they were already doing is open to question.",
      "Yet the problem with the White House using tariff threats in this way is that if other countries don't back down - or agreements are not reached - Trump might well feel he has no choice but to follow through or risk losing all credibility. And the targeted country might feel it has to respond with its prepared countermeasures, even if they would prefer not to.",
      "That high-risk dynamic - where things could slip out of control in an atmosphere of distrust and political pressure - is why many analysts and economists are far from comforted by how things have played out with Mexico and Canada this week.",
      "The other reason many economists fear Trump's intimidatory tariff diplomacy is its potentially chilling impact on business investment and confidence. US car firms have a deeply integrated industrial base across America, Mexico and Canada. Automotive parts cross those borders multiple times in the vehicle assembly process.",
      "The levying of 25% tariffs on each of those movements would be disastrous for these businesses. Those North American tariffs have been paused for now, but it's very hard to see US or Canadian automotive executives committing to further investment in those cross-border supply chains any time soon - and perhaps for many years to come.",
      "That will have negative implications for their productivity - and also for the wages of their employees in all three countries. The view of many economists is having cross-border supply chains makes these firms more productive than they would otherwise be and this raises US workers' wages relative to where they would be if they only manufactured in America.",
      "These same effects apply on a global scale. In light of Trump's tariff threats against the European Union, how many US firms are likely to be going ahead with planned investments in Europe - and vice versa?",
      "Countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia benefitted indirectly from the US tariffs imposed on China in Donald Trump's first presidential term, as multinationals shifted manufacturing out of China and into their territories to avoid the taxes and to continue exporting to America. But what if Trump now threatens tariffs against them too?",
      "The huge uncertainty Trump's tariff threats have injected into the global economy - even if they don't always translate into actual new taxes - will likely already be doing damage.",

      "Almost all (98%) was intercepted at the southwest border with Mexico. Less than 1% was seized across the northern US border with Canada. The remainder was from sea routes or other US checkpoints.",
      "According to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Mexican criminal organisations - including the Sinaloa Cartel - play a key role in producing and delivering fentanyl, methamphetamine and other illicit drugs into the US.",
      "The chemicals used to make fentanyl are sourced from China by traffickers and turned into the finished product in labs in Mexico before being smuggled into the US.",
      "According to the DEA, the Sinaloa Cartel uses a variety of tactics to conceal shipments coming into Mexico, such as hiding the chemicals among legitimate commercial goods, mislabelling the containers, using front companies, and shipping through third party countries.",
      "The Trump administration has accused the Mexican government of colluding with the drug cartels. Mexico's President Sheinbaum says the claims are \"slander.\"",

    "summary": "Some people didn't expect it to last a year. Here's how the popular life simulator has stayed alive.",
    "story": [
      "The Sims was never supposed to be a hit.",
      "Back in the 1990s, when creator Will Wright pitched the game to his bosses, they weren't convinced by his idea of a \"virtual dollhouse\".",
      "A so-called life simulator where players design their own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs.",
      "Who wants that?",
      "Quite a lot of people, it turns out.",
      "Now, 25 years from its debut, The Sims is one of the best-selling video game series of all time, with an active community of superfans known as Simmers.",
      "The latest instalment, The Sims 4, has been translated into 18 languages and played by 85 million people worldwide, according to publisher Electronic Arts.",
      "The original game's open-ended nature helped it to become a hit and reach so-called \"casual gamers\" outside the medium's more dedicated audience.",
      "Players had the freedom to carefully craft a detailed domestic setting for their digital people, managing their love lives, daily routines, basic needs and hobbies in exacting detail.",
      "But it also allowed them to imagine various torments for their virtual pals. One of the most famous - stranding your Sim in a swimming pool without a ladder - remains a popular meme to this day.",
      "UK-based streamer Jesse, best known as Plumbella, says she became obsessed with the legendary trick when she first played the game at five years old.",
      "The Sims has been part of Jesse\u2019s life ever since, thanks, she says, to the community around it.",
      "Players can create modifications or \"mods\" that alter different elements from the way the game plays to a characters appearance.",
      "Extra height options, having multiple jobs and neurodivergent personality traits are among some of the popular fan-made add-ons.",
      "For dedicated fans, Jesse says, the longevity comes from building on each other's creations.",
      "As she puts it: \"Take something and customise it and share it with other Simmers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see the ways that people can come up with to use their game in an interesting way.\"",
      "The ability to express yourself in The Sims also made it a popular title among its many players from diverse communities.",
      "Even at its launch in 2000, The Sims included same-sex relationships at a time when choices around sexuality or identity in gaming were rare.",
      "Creator Mollie, who streams as TheEnglishSimmer, makes a lot of LGBT-themed content for her channel.",
      "She says developer Maxis has \"always been kind of a spearhead in the gaming industry when it comes to telling diverse stories and wanting to show that representation\".",
      "Mollie says The Sims has given her a platform to find others like her.",
      "\"That's been so wonderful that I have been able to tell my stories and connect with people and they can see themselves represented,\" she says.",
      "The Sims has come in for more criticism over the years for its racial representation.",
      "American content creator Amira, known as Xmiramira online, created a custom skin tone pack for The Sims 4 that's still used by many players today.",
      "\"I couldn't make Sims that either look similar to me or my family, friends. And that's the case in a lot of games,\" says Amira.",
      "\"But the difference between The Sims and other games is I can do something about it.\"",
      "Amira's Melanin Pack was a hit when it was released, and she's since worked with Maxis and Electronic Arts on officially adopting more skin tones into the game.",
      "\"For me that's a big part of why I've played the game for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"I can do what I want, I can make a Sim with any body type, complexion, hair, whatever I want to do, it's one of the most customisable games I have.\"",
      "Amira says she's noticed more and more games offering the ability to choose different skin tones, body types and hairstyles without the need for third-party add-ons.",

      "Zoe Delahunty-Light, a video producer at website Eurogamer, commends The Sims for making \"great strides\" with diversity and working with creators to build authentic representation into the game.",
      "But she does point out that much of the work was done first, for free, by modders.",
      "The official Lovestruck add-on, Zoe says, introduces polyamorous relationships to the game and costs \u00a330 ($37).",
      "\"So it can feel like it is squeezing as much money as it can out of people who desire representation the most, which is pretty audacious,\" she says.",
      "The game has also been criticised over a lack of inclusion for players with disabilities, both in their ability to modify its controls and see themselves on screen.",
      "\"The game still lacks the option to change key binds, which is a basic accessibility issue,\" says Zoe.",
      "Developer Maxis has previously said it's discussing the introduction of more accessibility features to the game.",

      "The tech industry has followed suit, with companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, scrapping its DEI efforts and also cutting moderation teams.",
      "There's a question over whether this could impact gaming, where companies are often criticised for failing to adequately tackle racial and gender-based harassment on their platforms.",
      "\"The bigger concern is that this will be seen as a green light for certain groups of toxic gamers to become more open about their own hateful views, making inclusive spaces more important than ever,\" says Zoe.",

      "Both the film, and Madison's performance in particular, have been gaining huge amounts of awards momentum. It started when the movie premiered at Cannes.",
      "\"I have been working for almost a decade now, well trying to work. And that was my ultimate dream, to go to Cannes. And we had a film in the main competition, and then we won [the top prize, the Palme D'Or] and that was crazy in itself.\"",

      "\"She's so unique. Not only in her physicality, but there's something about her aura,\" says Baker. \"There's something.. she's actually quite subdued, even in real life. Her demeanour is, she's quite reserved.",
      "\"But then suddenly she can explode like no other other person I've ever seen, no other actor I've ever seen.",
      "\"And I was always looking forward to those moments shooting the film, knowing that a scene would call for that. You know, to see that you don't detect anything, and then suddenly just total eruption. It was incredible to watch.\"",
      "The contradictions in Ani, and the shifting genres of the movie were elements that Madison says she embraced strongly during the filming.",
      "\"As an actor sometimes I felt like I was shooting a very romantic film, and sometimes it was almost like a horror film, or a drama, or a slapstick comedy. To navigate through my character with all of these different genres was fun. It was a challenge, and I liked it!\"",

    "summary": "GBS is a rare disorder where the immune system attacks nerve cells, causing paralysis.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, a school teacher in the western Indian city of Pune found her six-year-old son upset about homework.",
      "\"I had erased some words and asked him to write them. I assumed he was angry and that's why he was not holding the pencil properly,\" she told the Indian Express newspaper.",
      "She never imagined his struggle to hold a pencil was the first sign of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), a rare disorder where the immune system attacks nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and paralysis.",
      "Within days, the boy was in intensive care, unable to move his arms or legs. As his condition worsened, he lost the ability to swallow, speak, and eventually breathe, requiring ventilator support. He is now recovering.",
      "The boy is among around 160 reported cases of GBS since early January in Pune, an education and IT hub, ringed by industrial towns and villages. There have been five suspected deaths. Currently, 48 patients are in intensive  care, 21 on ventilator, and 38 have been discharged, according to official figures.",
      "GBS begins with tingling or numbness in the feet and hands, followed by muscle weakness and difficulty moving joints. Symptoms worsen over two to four weeks, typically starting in the arms and legs. The reported mortality rate varies between three and 13%, depending on severity and quality of health care support.",
      "The outbreak in Pune is being traced to a pathogen called campylobacter jejuni, a leading cause of foodborne infections, and the biggest driver of GBS worldwide. The link between the two was discovered in the 1990s in rural China, where the pathogen was common in chickens, and GBS outbreaks occurred every monsoon as children played in water contaminated by chicken or duck droppings.",
      "GBS is not entirely uncommon in India. Monojit Debnath and Madhu Nagappa, of  Bangalore-based  National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), studied 150 GBS patients over a five year period between 2014 and 2019.",
      "Their findings showed 79% of the patients had evidence of prior infections, with a third testing positive for campylobacter. Notably, co-infections were more common, occurring in 65%, suggesting a complex interplay of bacteria and viruses.",
      "More recently, outbreaks linked to the pathogen have been reported from all over the world. In the first seven months of 2023, Peru reported over 200 suspected cases and at least four deaths of GBS, prompting the government to declare a national health emergency and strengthen public health measures. Two-thirds of the cases were linked to campylobacter.",
      "In countries with good hygiene, fewer GBS cases are linked to campylobacter, with respiratory infections being a major contributor, say experts. There have been other triggers as well. In 2015 Brazil reported a cluster of GBS cases linked to the Zika virus. Vaccines can rarely trigger GBS, but one Covid vaccine was reportedly linked to a few hundred GBS cases in the UK in 2021.",
      "\"Campylobacter is endemic with hundreds of thousands of cases taking place all the time. It is always existing in the environment,\" Hugh Willison, a professor of neurology at University of Glasgow told me.",
      "Yet, it is not easy to develop GBS, scientists say.",
      "There's a specific strain of campylobacter, which has a sugar-coated outer layer, and in rare cases, its molecular structure matches the coating of human nerve cells.",
      "When the patient's immune system attacks the bacteria, it may end up targeting the nerves as well \u2013 a process called molecular mimicry \u2013 leading to GBS. However, a small fraction of campylobacter strains have this nerve-like coat.",
      "\"In Pune, a strain of campylobacter with this molecular feature is likely to be circulating, and a surge in infections with this strain consequently leads to a higher number of GBS cases,\" says Prof Willison.",
      "Most experts estimate that about one in 100 campylobacter strains carry the GBS risk, and one in 100 people infected with such a strain develop GBS, making the overall risk roughly one in 10,000.",
      "That creates what Prof Willison describes as an \"immunological Russian roulette\", triggering an \"acute neurological tsunami\" that surges through the peripheral nervous system. Once the immune response subsides, the attack wanes \u2013 but the body still needs time, medical care, and support to repair the damage.",
      "What makes things worse is that there is no cure for GBS.",
      "In GBS, the body produces antibodies against campylobacter, which then attack the nerves. Physicians use \"plasma exchange\", a process that filters blood to remove the harmful antibodies, along with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a therapeutic antibody derived from normal blood, to help reduce the severity of the disease.",
      "The other challenge is that there is no single test to diagnose GBS. The diagnosis, say physicians, is mainly based on clinical features. It presents itself as a form of paralysis which can be also caused by polio, viruses or rare neurological disease.",
      "\"The diagnosis is a constellation of clinical features. Misdiagnosis or no diagnosis or late diagnosis can happen easily,\" says Prof Willison.",
      "India's uneven public health system presents a challenge, as doctors in rural areas may struggle to diagnose GBS. One reason, possibly, why the World Health Organization (WHO) teams are in Pune, is collaborating with federal and state health workers to trace, test, and monitor cases, and analysing trends to support effective treatment.",
      "Authorities say they have surveilled more than 60,000 houses, picked up 160 water samples for tests, and asked people to drink boiled water and eat fresh and clean food, and not have \"stale food and partially cooked chicken or mutton\".",
      "While most cases of GBS around the world come from undercooked poultry, it can also spread through water, similar to cholera or salmonella, experts say.",
      "Contaminated water used for washing or preparing street food makes it easy for the bacteria to spread. Clearly, in Pune, a campylobacter strain with the distinctive molecular feature is circulating, affecting a large number of people.",
      "What is not clear is whether this has been due to large scale contamination of water supply or a lot of people consuming infected poultry. \"We appeal to people not to panic,\" says a health department advisory. But in the face of uncertainty, it is easier said than done.",

Many companies are either teasing their spots or releasing their ads early, aiming to generate buzz before the big game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs.",
      "Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans is expected to draw\u00a0more than 120 million\u00a0viewers for the Feb. 9 broadcast, which will be aired on Fox and via the free livestream on Tubi, making it one of the most-viewed television events of the year.",
      "With an audience of that size, ad prices have reached a record, with a few ad spots reportedly selling for a record $8 million and even $8 million-plus for 30 seconds. That compares with a 30-second spot selling for about $7 million during last year's game.",
      "Beyond the investment on securing Super Bowl air time, advertisers spend additional millions on creating their commercials, adding to the pressure for their investments to pay off. For a company whose Super Bowl ad scores a touchdown, the benefits can include a sales boost by attracting new customers as well as creating stronger brand loyalty.",
      "This year's mix of ad categories for the most part includes the usual suspects: beverages, snacks, tech companies and telcos, according to Mark Evans, executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Sports.

      "She was the archetypal Sixties rock chick; a pop star at 17; Mick Jagger's muse at 19; and by 24, a junkie on the streets. But Marianne Faithfull (Dec. 29, 1946-Jan. 30, 2025), who burst out of the '60s British Invasion with the hit \"As Tears Go By,\" launched a second act in the late 1970s. Her lithe voice, later weathered from surviving sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, was brought forth in such albums as \"Broken English,\" \"Dangerous Acquaintances,\" and \"Easy Come, Easy Go.\"",
      "The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school, and was performing as a folk singer, when she was discovered at a party by the manager of the Rolling Stones. Jagger and Keith Richards wrote her breakthrough hit, \"As Tears Go By.\"",
      "Just as her career exploded, at 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby. \"I was very overenthusiastically eager for life,\" she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2009. \"I wanted to just bite into it and swallow it whole.\"",
      "She then left her marriage for Jagger. They became one of Swinging London's most photographed couples. Then, in February 1967, British police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home. The police found drugs, and Marianne naked in a fur rug. Though charges were later dropped, Faithfull's image was disgraced. She felt she'd let her parents down: \"I think that's the worst feeling in the world,\" she told Anthony Mason.",
      "She played up the \"bad girl\" image by acting in the film \"Girl on a Motorcycle.\" But she miscarried Jagger's child after eight months, and while on a trip to Australia with Jagger, she swallowed 150 sleeping pills. She spent six days in a coma. Faithfull recovered, but her relationship with Jagger did not.",
      "She fell into heroin addiction. She said, \"It's certainly not what I was dreaming of when I was eight or ten \u2013 I'm going to grow up and become a junkie and live on the street!\" she said. She would lose custody of her son, Nicholas, and the damage began to show in her singing voice. But in 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, \"Broken English.\" \"I became myself,\" she said, \"and it was not a person people thought I was. It was more intelligent, stronger, ravaged in its own way, but very quite interesting.\"",
      "It would be several more years before she freed herself of addiction, and in 2008 recorded \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" with Sean Lennon, Rufus Wainwright, Nick Cave, Cat Power, and Keith Richards. She also returned to acting, in \"Paris, Je T'aime,\" \"Marie Antoinette,\" and \"Faces in the Crowd.\"",
      "Faithfull said she appreciated the long, hard road she'd traveled: \"I think I've been very unconscious for a long time, and only now have I begun to get it. As long as I got it before I croaked, I think that's the main thing.\""

    "summary": "The actor-writer-director's latest film, a poignant comic-drama costarring Kieran Culkin, earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. But Jesse Eisenberg finds it difficult to not feel miserable.",
    "story": [
      "We'll tell you up front: Actor-director Jesse Eisenberg, who says he can appreciate a good Jewish deli, is a different kind of movie star. We joined him last week at the legendary Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, and shared some chocolate babka, with a dill pickle chaser. \"This is the real test,\" Eisenberg said.",
      "It was a little unusual, but for Eisenberg, it'd already been a pretty unusual day. Just a few hours earlier, he received his second Oscar nomination, this time for best original screenplay.",
      "And he was mortified.",
      "I asked, \"Are you able to enjoy moments like this?\"",
      "\"No, I'm not really wired to enjoy praise,\" he replied. \"I don't know why. I think it just, like, I don't know, triggers some guilt response in my brain and I try to find something to be miserable about. But I'll tell you what I do love: I love actually doing my job. Like, I feel so lucky that I found something I like to do.\"",
      "At the moment, his job is to promote the film he wrote, directed and starred in, \"A Real Pain,\" co-starring Kieran Culkin. The film is about two cousins who travel to Poland to see their ancestral home, and visit the actual home of their late grandmother, who barely survived the Holocaust.",
      "The film started out as a buddy movie about a trip to Mongolia. As he was writing the script, Eisenberg got stuck, until inspiration literally popped up on his computer. \"I was, like, 30 pages into the script and something was missing,\" he said. \"I knew the script was not going well. And so, I'm, like, kind of, like, banging my head against the keyboard. And an ad pops up online for 'Auschwitz tours.' And then in parentheses, 'with lunch.' And I was like, 'Auschwitz tours (with lunch)?' That's, like, the strangest pairing of four words I've ever seen. And once I saw that, and once I read that brochure, I was like, 'Oh, that's the movie. That is so interesting,' because I was trying to deal with these two characters who are both kind of, like, in pain in their own ways.\"",
      "\"Dude, we are Jews on a train in Poland, ******* think about it. \u2026 Does no one else see the irony here? Like, eating fancy food and sitting up here, when 80 years ago we would've been herded into the backs of these ******* things like cattle?\"",
      "Watch a scene with Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin in \"A Real Pain\" [Warning: Graphic language]",
      "Eisenberg has had those same thoughts. He is himself of Polish lineage, and he has relatives who were victims of the Holocaust. \"I come from a family who survived the war; a lot of, you know, cousins, aunts, and uncles who didn't,\" he said. \"And yet, I walk around New York City, like, kind of miserable. Like, I'm not, like, a happy person. I'm not asking for pity or anything; I'm just recognizing objectively, like, I'm not a happy person. And yet, I come from people who survived through miracles. Intellectually, I think I should be waking up every morning kissing the dirt that I'm here by virtue of a thousand miracles. And instead, I walk around, I'm like, Oh my God. What am I gonna do today? Oh my God. I shouldn't drink a coffee 'cause then I'll peak at noon.",
      "\"And so, I'm constantly trying to reconcile my fortunate life with how I feel about things, and my forebears' very unfortunate lives and how they appreciated things. And that's what this movie is kind of focusing on.\"",
      "It seems he's been feeling that same kind of anxiety all of his life. Raised in New Jersey, Jesse Eisenberg was, by his own admission, a \"sad kid\" who was uncomfortable at school, and took refuge in acting. By 2010 he'd made a name for himself in Hollywood, with roles like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network.\" The part earned him an Oscar nod, and the juice to branch out into writing and directing.",
      "But when COVID shut down the film industry in 2020, Eisenberg and his wife, Anna Strout, moved back to her native Indiana, and spent their days volunteering at her mom's domestic violence shelter in Bloomington. \"I was just volunteering every day at the shelter,\" he said. \"It sounds weird to say this, and I don't mean this for any kind of \u2013 it was, like, the happiest time of my life. I was painting walls and fixing garbage disposals. And I just loved it so much. I loved being able to, like, accomplish something where there was no, like, critique of it, you know what I mean?\"",
      "\"It makes total sense,\" I said. \"You fix the garbage disposal, the garbage disposal's fixed. End of it.\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "But of all the roles he's played, on-screen and off-, he says the confident illusionist in the \"Now You See Me\" franchise is the most challenging, because it's absolutely nothing like him. \"We just did the third 'Now You See Me,' and it's such a blast,\" he said. \"And it's such a challenge, because I'm doing something that's, like, the exact opposite of my psychology. It's the only time I ever walk away thinking, 'I did a good job today.' But that's because my character thinks that they're doing well. And yes, they're Hollywood movies, and they're really fun. But, like, for me, it's been a kind of like a therapy.\"",
      "\"Does that confidence linger at all past the shoots?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, normally it will linger through dinner,\" he replied. \"Once I get on set and I'm in those clothes, and I'm speaking in the way they've written for me \u2026 I stand up straighter. I'm, like, an inch taller. It's amazing. I can make eye contact with my father!\"",
      "You'd think the success of \"A Real Pain\" would give Eisenberg some swagger. His movie also snagged Culkin an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. But like the babka and pickles at Canter's, Eisenberg can't seem to enjoy the sweet without just a little bit of sour.",
      "I asked, \"Is there a part of you that finds this whole experience, with the way that 'A Real Pain' has been received, kind of unreal? That at some moment you're gonna wake up?\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah, I assume a piano is gonna fall on my head every day,\" Eisenberg said. \"Because I feel like, I am so lucky. And, like, the way my mind does equations is that this lucky thing must mean this horrible upcoming thing. And so, yes, I'm not walking under any air conditioners in New York City. I don't know how to think about it any other way. And that's really unfortunate, but true!\"",

      "\"When he decided that I should come to the company, I asked for a contract,\" she recalled. \"He said, 'I don't do contracts.' And I was there for 21 years without one, on a handshake.\"",
      "Part of her job was to find new talent, and that's what she did, when de Passe first heard about a group of brothers from Gary, Indiana. They called themselves The Jackson 5.",
      "\"The hair on the back of my neck stood up. They were great,\" she said.",
      "\"The hair literally stood up?\"",
      "\"Yeah, the hair. This is my big barometer, back there, absolutely. When you feel something, it's not intellectual, at all. I said, 'Oh, my gosh, Mr. Gordy, I saw this great act.' He said, 'Great.' I said, 'Wait till you see these kids.' He said, 'Kids? I don't want any kid acts. Are you crazy?'\"",
      "She wasn't. And Motown introduced The Jackson 5 to the world.",
      "de Passe took them to the dentist, worked on their early dance moves, and even picked out their wardrobe. She found Michael Jackson's hat on 8th Street in Greenwich Village. \"It was iconic, but nobody knew it at the time,\" she said.",
      "In the 1970s, she was discovering and developing artists for Motown in L.A., signing The Commodores, De Barge, and Rick James. \"I feel like I'm lucky to be alive,\" she laughed. Why? \"Because Rick was bigger than life. He was a great consumer of drugs, and just a brilliant, brilliant artist.\"",
      "It is a notorious business, and difficult to navigate, especially back then, especially for her.",
      "I asked, \"You weren't just a woman, you were a Black woman. Are you saying you faced, like, things coming at you, sexism, racism?\"",
      "\"I have had every 'ism' to deal with,\" said de Passe. \"Sexism, racism, pessimism, optimism, you know? And what I've found is that the moment you let yourself be defined by your 'isms' is when you've lost.\"",
      "de Passe always persevered. She was also a good persuader, convincing Diana Ross that the song \"I'm Coming Out\" would be a smash hit. Ross' first reaction, said de Passe, was, \"in very blatant terms, 'I hate these songs.' But I felt it would be [a hit]. Nobody knows. That's the thing about it. Nobody knows.\"",
      "\"But clearly you have really good sixth sense?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe in what I believe in,\" de Passe replied. \"And some of it works and some of it doesn't. But I'm happy to say I have a good percentage.\"",
      "In 1982, de Passe was made president of Motown Productions. One of her first big projects was the TV special \"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.\" Nearly 50 million people watched Michael Jackson do the moonwalk. \"Oh, my God. and it was only six seconds,\" said de Passe. \"But the whole 'Billy Jean' of it all was just magic, I think, because nobody had ever seen anything like that before.\"",
      "de Passe also produced the landmark miniseries \"Lonesome Dove.\"",
      "I said, \"A lot of people would ask, 'What does Motown know about westerns?'\"",
      "\"Probably nothing; but I did,\" de Passe replied. \"I think the death of art is that you have to be gay to play gay. I think the death of art is that you have to be Black to direct or write a Black movie. The death of art is to not have the best person do what it is they are well-suited and passionate to do, regardless of all that other exterior stuff. And I am sick of it.\"",
      "At 78, she is still listening to her ear (and gut), finding new opportunities and stories to tell. And, with her induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Suzanne de Passe is recognized as a true pioneer.",
      "\"I am so grateful to have had that moment to really feel that energy coming back to me,\" she said. \"I will also say, I have worked really, really hard.\"",
      "\"For someone who worked behind the scenes and in the shadows, you felt seen?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh, definitely. I felt very seen, and very blessed.\"",

    "summary": "The multimedia artist talks about his cinematic timepiece, a 24-hour film comprised of scenes from movies and TV that track the viewer's own experience of time, minute by minute, currently screening at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "From time to time, you might notice a shot of a clock in a movie. In a film like \"Back to the Future,\" they're key to the plot; lightning strikes the clock tower at exactly 10:04 p.m. But often, clocks are just ticking away in the background, or not ticking at all, like the watch from \"Pulp Fiction,\" stopped at 11:46.",
      "Compile enough of these seemingly minute details, and minutes can turn into hours, spanning decades of moving-image history. That is the case with artist Christian Marclay's \"The Clock,\" a 24-hour film comprised entirely of clips from movies and television.",
      "\"It's not to create a trick or to make you forget about time,\" Marclay said. \"I want you to be totally conscious about it throughout.\"",
      "Currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, \"The Clock\" runs on a continuous loop, synced to the precise time of day. When the kids in \"The Breakfast Club\" are whistling at 11:31 a.m., it's 11:31 in real life. An hour later, \"Rain Man\" announces \"Oh, it's 12:31.\" Minute by minute, the footage functions as an actual clock.",
      "Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA, calls watching Maclay's mash-up an uncanny experience. \"[You're] watching some of your favorite movies and realizing that it's telling the time that you're living in right now,\" Comer said. \"It's eliminating that barrier between you and the world on-screen.",
      "\"The effort that it took with Christian and the team of researchers locating 'The Clock' footage and all of these different clips is somewhat superhuman,\" he said.",
      "When Marclay won best artist for \"The Clock\" at the 2011 Venice Biennale, it turned him into a contemporary art superstar. But the 70-year-old first made a name for himself decades earlier as part of New York's underground DJ scene. \"In those days, you would find records \u2026 people would put them in their trash,\" he said.",
      "Born to an American mother and Swiss father, Marclay was raised in Switzerland and moved to the U.S. to attend art school in the late 1970s. \"I kept putting aside my work as a visual artist, 'cause I lived in a tiny East Village apartment, and I didn't have a studio,\" he said. \"So, music at that time was convenient.\"",
      "It was, he admitted, easier to store records than canvases. \"But you need tolerant neighbors!\" he laughed.",
      "Marclay's music was experimental. He was an early pioneer of \"turntablism,\" invited to spin on the short-lived show \"Night Music.\" \"I would destroy the records in performance, but then I had all these incredible covers, such an interesting history of graphic design. And I started collaging with them.\"",
      "One of Marclay's early successes in the visual art world arrived via his Body Mix series, in which he physically stitched together album covers to create new forms.",
      "He's unspooled cassette tapes to make prints and pillows. He's cut up everything from Japanese manga to movie subtitles, stacking cinematic fragments nearly 20 feet tall. He said he felt more comfortable as a collagist: \"I'm more interested in working with what exists rather than [to], you know, invent or draw something,\" he said.",
      "In 1995, Marclay created \"Telephones,\" a masterful mashup of film phone conversations.",
      "It's been more than a decade since \"The Clock\" was last in New York. Marclay is extremely precise about where and how it can be screened, insisting that any museum showing the work stay open at least once for 24 hours so audiences can see the nighttime section.",
      "Are there \"Clock\" completists? \"Oh, there are definitely 'Clock' squatters, I would say \u2013     people who really commit to watching it!\" Comer laughed.",
      "But Marclay insists the point isn't to see all of it; it's more to make you hyper-aware of the time you're spending literally watching a clock. \"Here, you're reminded that you have an appointment at a certain time, that you can't spend your whole day watching this thing,\" Marclay said. \"You're more than a viewer. You're a participant in a way, because your life infringes on this clock.\"",

    "summary": "A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in a state with one of the strictest abortion bans.",
    "story": [
      "BATON ROUGE, La.\u00a0\u2014 A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the U.S.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "Prosecutors in Louisiana say a mother ordered the pill online and gave it to her child.",
      "\"The young child was told by the mother that she had to take the pill or else, and the child took the pill,\" District Attorney Tony Clayton said.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "\"To ship a pill from another state is equivalent to me of shipping fentanyl or any other type of drugs over here that end up in the mouths and stomachs of our minor kids,\" Clayton said.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "CBS News New York reached out to Carpenter, but has not heard back yet.",
      "Testing New York's shield laws",
      "The indictment could be the first direct test of New York's shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\"Earlier today, a New York doctor was indicted in Louisiana for using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication to a patient. That's right: a doctor is being prosecuted for providing basic health care to her patient. We always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That's why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients. It's more critical than ever for states to step up and protect reproductive freedom \u2014 and I'll never back down from this fight,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Hochul signed the bill protecting doctors from out-of-state lawsuits\u00a0in 2023.",
      "\"I will never under any circumstances turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition request,\" Hochul said in a video posted to social media. \"I will do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, said in a statement:",
      "\"Abortion care is health care. The criminalization of abortion care is a direct and brazen attack on Americans' bodily autonomy and their right to reproductive freedom. This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American. We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers' ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\"",
      "Legal experts say Carpenter may still face some hurdles.",
      "\"What happens when she tries to renew her medical license and she has a pending felony indictment in Louisiana? What happens to the doctor when she tries to fly somewhere and TSA says, hey, you have an active warrant?\" attorney Franz Borghardt said.",
      "Louisiana classifies abortion pills as \"controlled dangerous substances\"",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They're also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\"Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we've witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women's rights,\" the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \"It's no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\"",
      "Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician in New York, said abortion bans are making it more dangerous for young girls and women.",
      "\"It's making it less safe to be pregnant, and it's increasing things like infant mortality and maternal mortality in states where abortions are restricted,\" she said.",

      "\"People will get sick. And, especially in cases like congenital syphilis where you cannot lose a day to treat, babies will die,\" said Harvey.",
      "Some changes were minor and kept webpages online, like rewording information about Zika virus from saying \"pregnant person\" to \"pregnant woman\" instead.",

      "Letters obtained by CBS News sent to nonprofits and state and local health departments receiving federal health dollars also left some grant recipients confused.",
      "One letter suggested that all their staff and communications would also be forced to comply with the Trump administration's sweeping new rules banning gender from all their activities, like dropping the mention of pronouns from email signatures and removing gender from their websites as a condition of continuing to receive federal funds.",
      "Another targeted mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion, saying that similar to federal rules, they also were now required to \"immediately terminate, to the maximum extent, all programs, personnel, activities, or contracts promoting\" those ideas \"at every level and activity, regardless of your location or the citizenship of employees or contracts\" supported by the funds.",
      "Some hospitals also said this week they are moving to suspend medications and procedures for youth seeking gender-affirming care, following an executive order signed on Tuesday by President Trump to curb procedures and prescriptions for gender transitions in minors.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green said that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" she said. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

      "China said Tuesday it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday.",
      "\"The U.S.'s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\" the statement from a Ministry of Finance office said. \"It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing said it would file a complaint with the WTO over the \"malicious\" levies, Agence France-Presse reports.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with its top suppliers being Australia, Qatar and Malaysia. The U.S., which is the biggest exporter of LNG globally, does not significantly export LNG to China.",
      "In addition, China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws. The announcement didn't mention the tariffs but came just minutes after Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs on China were to take effect.",
      "It's unclear how the probe will affect Google's operations. Google has a limited presence in China, and its search engine is blocked in the country like most other Western platforms. Google exited the Chinese market in 2010 after refusing to comply with censorship requests from the Chinese government and following a series of cyberattacks on the company.",
      "Google didn't immediately comment.",
      "Mr. Trump paused his plans Monday to\u00a0implement steep tariffs\u00a0on imports from Mexico and Canada for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. He planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "In addition to the tariffs and Google probe, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they're essential to U.S. economic or national security and have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium, which is used in manufacturing.",
      "The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.",
      "Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over \"improper Xinjiang-related behavior\" after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton.",
      "Possible ramifications",
      "Analysts said China's retaliatory measures would not only cause adverse effects on the U.S. economy but would impact the rest of the world.",
      "This isn't the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind.",
      "This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter.",
      "\"They have a much more developed export control regime. We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others. So ... they could put some significant harm on our economy,\" said Philip Luck, a former State Department official and director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Monday at a forum.",
      "The response from China appears calculated and measured, said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute.",
      "\"I don't think they want the trade war escalating,\" he said. \"And they see (the) example from Canada and Mexico and probably they are hoping for the same thing.\"",
      "But, he adds, \"A risk is that this is the beginning of a tit-for-tat trade war, which could result in lower GDP growth everywhere, higher U.S. inflation, a stronger dollar and upside pressure on U.S. interest rates,\" Dover said.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 08:34:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's control of a federal payment system is raising concerns about funding for programs like Social Security and the safety of personal data.",
    "story": [
      "With Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gaining control of the Treasury Department's payment system, consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers are raising alarms about the group's access to the federal government's financial spigot, as well as sensitive data such as the Social Security numbers of most taxpayers.",
      "DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to reduce federal spending, now has access to a Treasury unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks and federal salaries, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Musk's access to the payment system is raising concerns as it comes just days after the White House ordered a broad freeze\u00a0on federal grants and loans, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. That same day, state Medicaid programs said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "While the White House later rescinded the memo and a judge halted the freeze, DOGE's control of the Treasury's payment system raises questions about the Trump administration's ability to halt the flow of federal funds for programs including Medicare and Social Security. It's also causing concerns about DOGE's access to the personal and financial information of most taxpayers.",
      "\"There's no community of Americans that this system does not touch, and so I think the concern is that access to this system including personally identifiable information has been ceded to the president's billionaire friend for reasons that are passing understanding,\" Donald K. Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There are \"quite real risks\" that DOGE \"could potentially undermine that system and threaten millions of Americans from getting payments that they are due,\" he added.",
      "Musk's access to the Treasury payment system has sparked concern from Democratic lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, while a lawsuit was filed on Monday alleging \"unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information\" to Musk and DOGE. The lawsuit, filed by two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, names U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Treasury as defendants.",
      "\"Controlling the system could allow the Trump Administration to 'unilaterally' \u2014 and illegally \u2014 cut off payments for millions of Americans, putting at risk the financial security of families and businesses based on political favoritism or the whims of Mr. Musk and those on his team who have worked their way inside,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a Feb. 2 letter to Bessent.",
      "She added, \"It could also give them access to millions of Americans' personal and financial information that is protected by law.\"",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?",
      "The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year.",
      "The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division.",
      "In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according\u00a0to\u00a0the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted.",
      "How did DOGE get control of the payment system?",
      "The executive\u00a0order\u00a0signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems.\" DOGE itself is not a federal department.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported.",
      "On Sunday, Musk\u00a0stated\u00a0that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees.",
      "Could this impact Social Security?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried.",
      "Musk and DOGE \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. \"Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits \u2014 or their personal data.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he's concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, \"whether intentional or unintentional.\"",
      "\"It appears that Musk's behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump's goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,\" he wrote.",
      "Does Musk have access to taxpayers' personal data?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients.",
      "Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn't respond to requests for comment but did\u00a0repost an Associated Press article on X\u00a0with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.",
      "\"Traditionally, access to this information has been highly restricted and among the most secure information the U.S. government holds,\" said James E. Lee, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"This is the kind of information that, if it found its way into the hands of a bad actor, could lead to a wide range of identity crimes \u2014 impersonation to open new accounts or access existing ones, theft of the funds in an existing banking account, applying for new state or federal government benefits, and filing false tax returns among other forms of identity fraud.\"",
      "The data is also sensitive because it could be useful to intelligence agencies in other nations, including the personal data of government employees or ties that businesses have with the U.S. government, Lee noted.",
      "That concern was echoed by Sen. Wyden, who in the Jan. 31 letter to Bessent questioned granting access to sensitive information to Musk due to significant business interests in China, noting that Tesla operates its largest factory in China. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",

      "Sotheby's says the violin's preservation is remarkable and its ownership history extraordinary.",

      "It's believed that legendary composer Johannes Brahms was influenced by the Joachim-Ma when he wrote his \"Violin Concerto in D Major\" because of its rich, resonant tone, and that Joachim played that violin during the concerto's 1879 premiere, according to Sotheby's.",
      "Ma acquired the violin in 1969 and his estate gifted it to the New England Conservatory in Boston after his death. Ma attended the conservatory, where he earned a master's degree in 1950. The conservatory is now putting the violin up for auction, with all the proceeds going to student scholarships.",

      "Stocks tumbled on Monday as Wall Street braced for the impact of steep new tariffs ordered by President Trump, with mounting fears the new import duties could spark a trade war that could crimp corporate profits and dampen consumer spending.",
      "However, the losses moderated after Mr. Trump later on Monday said that he would pause the tariffs on Mexico and Canada for one month. His announcement, made on his Truth Social app, came after he said Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum agreed to send 10,000 soldiers to the border. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his nation is implementing a $1.3 billion plan to protect the border.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 122 points, or 0.3%, to 44,421 after dropping as much as 1.5% in earlier trading.

      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that imposes 25%\u00a0tariffs on imports\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. Hours later, Canada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own, while Mexico said it was also planning to issue tariffs on the U.S. as well, adding to the potential fallout from a trade war with two of the U.S.' closest trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement prompted some economists to project that the stiff new tariffs could dampen U.S. economic growth and cause an increase in job losses.",
      "\"This development came sooner than we anticipated in our baseline forecast and will lead us to downgrade our 2025 global forecast,\" Oxford Economics wrote in a Feb. 3 research note. \"The latest set of tariffs will lead to weaker GDP growth, higher unemployment, higher interest rates, and higher inflation this year in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. than in our January baseline forecast.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Senate on Monday confirmed fossil fuel executive Chris Wright to serve as energy secretary, a key post to promote President Trump's efforts to achieve U.S. \"energy dominance\" in the global market.",
      "Wright, CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, has been one of the industry's loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change. He says more fossil fuel production can lift people out of poverty around the globe and has promised to help Mr. Trump \"unleash energy security and prosperity.\"",
      "The Senate approved his nomination, 59-38.",
      "The centerpiece of Mr. Trump's energy policy is \"drill, baby, drill,\" and he has pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats' \"green new scam\" in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "\"President Trump shares my passion for energy,\" Wright said at his confirmation hearing last month, promising that if confirmed, he would \"work tirelessly to implement [Mr. Trump's] bold agenda as an unabashed steward for all sources of affordable, reliable and secure American energy.\"",
      "That includes oil and natural gas, coal, nuclear power and hydropower, along with wind and solar power and geothermal energy, Wright said.",
      "Mr. Trump's energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits, including the fact that U.S. oil production is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits.",
      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican, called Wright an innovator who \"tells the truth about energy production.\"",
      "While Wright \"acknowledges that climate change is real, he knows more American energy is the solution \u2014 not the problem,'' Barrasso said, calling Wright's \"energy realism\" welcome news.",
      "Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican who chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Wright \"understands that energy policies should focus on making energy abundant and affordable for families\" and businesses.",
      "\"Our nation deserves a champion for American energy and innovation, and we've got the Wright guy for the job,'\" Lee posted on X.",
      "Colorado's two Democratic senators both supported their home-state nominee.",
      "\"Chris Wright is a scientist who has dedicated his life to the study and use of energy. He believes in science and supports the research that will deliver the affordable, reliable and clean energy\" that will lower costs and make the country more secure, Sen. John Hickenlooper said.",
      "\"While we don't always agree, we will work together because none of us have four years to wait to act,\" Hickenlooper said.",
      "Sen. Michael Bennet called Wright a successful Colorado entrepreneur with deep expertise in energy innovation and technology. He pledged to work with Wright to \"ensure Colorado continues to lead the country in energy production and innovation.\"",
      "While acknowledging that climate change is real, Wright said at his hearing that he believes \"there isn't dirty energy or clean energy.\" Rather, he said, there are different sources of energy with different tradeoffs.",
      "Wright, 60, has been chair\u00a0and CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 and has no prior experience in government. He grew up in Colorado, earned an undergraduate degree at MIT and did graduate work in electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley and MIT. In 1992, he founded Pinnacle Technologies, which helped launch commercial shale gas production through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.",
      "He later served as chairman of Stroud Energy, an early shale gas producer, before founding Liberty Resources in 2010.",
      "As energy secretary, Wright will join Interior Secretary Doug Burgum as a key player on energy policy. Both will serve on a new National Energy Council that Burgum will chair. The panel will include all executive branch agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, with a focus on \"cutting red tape\" and boosting domestic energy production, Mr. Trump said. The council's mission represents a near-complete reversal from actions pursued by former President Joe Biden, who made fighting climate change a top priority.",
      "Wright said he would sever all ties across the energy industry if confirmed.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 18:15:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada would respond with 25% tariffs \"against $155 billion worth of American goods.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. Canada responded hours later with retaliatory tariffs of its own, while Mexico said it was also planning to issue tariffs on the U.S. as well.",
      "China's commerce secretary said that China would challenge the tariffs through the World Trade Organization, according to Reuters, claiming that the move \"seriously violates\" WTO rules.",
      "However, Mr. Trump on Monday announced he would\u00a0pause the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after both countries agreed to direct additional resources to their borders.",
      "The salvo, which Mr. Trump had threatened even before returning to power earlier this month, underlines his willingness to use trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies. It also signals the president's first major turn away from his promise on the campaign trail to rapidly reduce everyday costs for Americans once in office.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump acknowledged \"some pain\" could come with the new wave of tariffs but insisted his vision for the country \"will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "\"THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA! WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),\" he wrote. \"BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID. WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE \u2014 AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!\"",
      "The tariffs\u00a0were slated to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. While the order imposes 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, \"energy resources\" such as oil and gas would only be hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "The order notes that should any of the three nations \"retaliate against the United States\" with \"import duties\" or \"similar measures,\" the president \"may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\"",
      "According to the White House, the salvo is aimed at curbing the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.; spurring a resurgence in domestic manufacturing; and raising federal revenue.",
      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted to social media after the announcement, Mr. Trump said the order was issued through the\u00a0International Emergency Economic Powers Act\u00a0\"because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\"",
      "Trudeau announced in a news conference Saturday night that Canada would retaliate by placing 25% tariffs \"against $155 billion worth of American goods,\" with the first set of tariffs taking effect Tuesday.",
      "\"This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion worth of American products in 21 days' time to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives,\" Trudeau said.",
      "And in a statement posted to social media, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she instructed her economic secretary to put together a response that included both retaliatory tariffs and other measures \"in defense of Mexico's interests.\"",
      "\"We categorically reject the defamatory claims made by the White House accusing the Government of Mexico of having alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any attempts to interfere in our territory,\" Sheinbaum wrote.",
      "John Murphy, senior vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which bills itself as the world's largest business organization, slammed Mr. Trump's decision, writing in a statement that \"the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won't solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains.\"",
      "Murphy added that the Chamber \"will consult with our members, including main street businesses across the country impacted by this move, to determine next steps to prevent economic harm to Americans.\"",
      "Three trade associations for the distilled spirits industry \u2014 Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S., the Chamber of the Tequila Industry, and Spirits Canada \u2014 said in a joint statement that they were \"deeply concerned that U.S. tariffs on imported spirits from Canada and Mexico will significantly harm all three countries and lead to a cycle of retaliatory tariffs that negatively impacts our shared industry.\"",
      "Bob Hemesath, an Iowa farmer and board chairman of Farmers for Free Trade, an agriculture group that advocates for more open trade, said in a statement that Canada, Mexico and China are \"indispensable markets for the livelihood of the American ag economy,\" and \"placing tariffs on the three largest export markets for American farmers and ranchers, particularly for an extended period of time, would have severe consequences.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the order, writing on social media that Mr. Trump is \"holding Mexico, Canada, and China accountable for their role in the flow of illegal aliens and illicit drugs across our borders. These countries are now on notice to work quickly to stop the madness. This is long overdue.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move in a series of social media posts, one of which read: \"You're worried about grocery prices. Don's raising prices with his tariffs.\"",
      "Experts warn that the impact of the tariffs could affect the economies of Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 the nation's three biggest trading partners \u2014 as well as the U.S. itself. Canada's economy could shrink by 3.6%, while Mexico could take a 2% hit, according to Cornell University economics professor Wendong Zhang.",
      "At the same time, inflation in the U.S. could rise by as much as 1 percentage point, pushing it as high as 4% on an annual basis, or double the Federal Reserve's goal for a 2% annual rate, Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 research note.",
      "\"We have stressed that steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock \u2014 a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse \u2014 while also triggering financial market volatility,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in a Jan. 31 report.",
      "Daco added, \"These tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China would mark the first major wave of trade levies in Trump's new term, with effects rippling far beyond those economies, as other nations brace for potential targeting and U.S. businesses navigate supply chain disruptions and retaliation risks.\"",
      "American consumers have been bracing for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, telling pollsters that they expected to see higher prices if the president followed through on his plans to enact them. Those expectations may have prompted some consumers to purchase goods before Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists say.",
      "\"The mere prospect of tariffs appears to be influencing the behavior of consumers and businesses,\" analysts with Oxford Economics in a research note. \"Imports surged in December, likely an attempt to front-run any tariffs, while consumers may be bringing forward spending in anticipation of tariff-related price hikes.\"",
      "U.S. consumers could see higher prices\u00a0for produce and agricultural products imported from Canada and Mexico, including beef from the former and avocados and strawberries from the latter. Automobiles could see an average price increase of $3,000 each due to the tariffs, given the huge volume of cars now being built in Canada and Mexico, according to TD Economics.",

    "story": [
      "Americans could soon be paying more for everything from automobiles to avocados after the Trump administration levied\u00a0stiff new tariffs\u00a0on the nation's three largest trading partners.",
      "President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Saturday, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China. However, Mr. Trump on Monday said he was pausing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after both countries agreed to direct additional resources to their borders.",
      "While Mr. Trump describes tariffs as import duties that are paid by foreign countries, they are in fact paid directly to the federal government by U.S. businesses,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank. Rather than swallowing the costs, corporations typically hike their prices for those imported goods to recoup all or some of the expense.",
      "Who pays the cost?",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "\"From Canada, we import oil, lumber, wood and cement,\" he added. \"Over 20% of the agriculture products we bring into the U.S. come from Mexico.\"",
      "One unknown is whether the Trump administration will carve out some exceptions, such as for oil and gas products. Canada provides about 20% of the oil used in the U.S., which means that a 25% tariff on Canadian imports could add 30 to 40 cents a gallon at the pump within days of the new duties taking effect, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has said.",
      "As painful as higher costs might be to U.S. consumers, the biggest impacts would likely be felt by the Canadian and Mexican economies, according to Wendong Zhang, assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University. A 25% tariff could cause Canada and Mexico to lose 3.6% and 2% of real GDP,\u00a0 respectively, versus a decline of 0.3% for the U.S., Zhang estimated.",
      "Here's what could get pricier for American shoppers if the Trump administration's tariffs take effect.",
      "Avocados, beef and other foods",
      "Inflation-pinched consumers may face a surge in prices for fruits, vegetables and nuts imported from Mexico, including avocados \u2014 just in time for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico in 2023, including fresh strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes and beef, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. also imports Mexican beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. imported about $40 billion of Canadian agricultural products that same year, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "A 25% tariff could push prices up for all those products.",
      "\"Grocery stores operate on really tiny margins,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute. \"They can't eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them \u2014 90% \u2014 come from Mexico. You're talking about guacamole tariffs right before the Super Bowl.\"",
      "Cars",
      "American consumers are increasingly buying cars that are either built in Canada or Mexico or that use parts imported from those nations. The U.S. imported $69 billion of cars and light trucks from Mexico in 2023, and another $37 billion from Canada, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "On top of that, about $78 billion in auto parts stemmed from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. For instance, the engines used in Ford's F-series pickup trucks come from Canada.",
      "Because U.S. importers are expected to roll any added tariff costs into vehicle sticker prices, the average U.S. automobile price could jump by about $3,000, TD Economics estimates. That would come at a time when the average new car already sells for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Lumber",
      "About one-third of softwood lumber used in the U.S. is imported from Canada each year, according to Rajan Parajuli, an associate professor of forest economics and policy at North Carolina State University.",
      "Tacking a 25% tariff on Canadian lumber could cause a \"supply shock,\" the Forest Resources Association, a trade group, wrote in a December blog post. \"Regarding lumber, the U.S. still needs Canadian supplies to meet its domestic consumption demand,\" the group said.",
      "Still, the slow U.S. housing market, dampened by mortgage rates that remain close to 7%, could make it hard for companies to pass on the new tariffs through higher lumber prices, some economists said.",
      "\"Lumber prices are expected to rise, although a slower U.S. housing recovery, burdened by higher prices, will limit the extent to which exporters will be able to pass on price increases,\" Oxford Economics noted in a Jan. 31 research note.",

Instead, U.S. businesses directly pay the tariffs on their imported goods to the federal government, according to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank.",

      "Mr. Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25%\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on imports from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. Canada responded hours later with retaliatory tariffs of its own, while Mexico said it was also planning to issue tariffs on the U.S. as well.",
      "However, Mr. Trump on Monday wrote on his Truth Social app that he is\u00a0pausing U.S. tariffs\u00a0targeting imports from Mexico for a month after the country's president agreed to send 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to combat the flow of fentanyl and migrants. The tariffs on Canada were also paused a short time later.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of additional tariffs, such as an across-the-board duty of 10% on all goods imported into the U.S. Here's what to know about tariffs.",
      "What exactly are tariffs?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S..",
      "The most common type are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value, which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of the imports. These are the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed as a 25% import tax on goods shipped from Mexico or Canada, such as avocados or lumber.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, such as if the U.S. were to propose a $1 tariff on each imported Mexican avocado.",
      "Another such type of levy are \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold. For instance, this type of quota was used by the first Trump administration in 2018 on\u00a0washing machines, when the first 1.2 million imported units faced a 20% duty, while units above that number were taxed at a 50% rate, according to the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which advocates for more restrictive trade policies.",
      "Who pays for tariffs?",
      "Companies that import the goods from abroad pay the tariffs to their own nation. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs from importers \u2014 say, Walmart or Target \u2014 and then deposits the money into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has\u00a0claimed\u00a0that foreign countries pay the duties. As part of his campaign, he vowed that tariffs would help raise \"trillions and trillions of dollars\" from foreign governments.",
      "In fact, American consumers would likely bear the brunt of the cost, as big U.S. importers are likely to pass on the tariffs they pay to the customs department to consumers, economists say. In some cases, foreign manufacturers may also choose to lower their prices to offset the impact of those tariffs in order to maintain their sales. And some U.S. businesses could absorb some of the tariff costs to avoid driving away consumers and potentially losing market share to competitors.",
      "If Mr. Trump enacts all the tariffs he's vowed to levy on imports, the typical U.S. consumer could face up to $2,400 in increased costs for every year the tariffs remain in force, according to an estimate from financial services firm ING.",
      "Could tariffs boost inflation?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs would sharply push the current effective U.S. tariff rate from 2.4% to 31%. That would be a historic high and surpass those seen under President McKinley in the 1890s, when U.S. trade policies were far more protectionist, and during the 1930s under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, according to Capital Economics.",
      "As a result, inflation would likely jump, rising from an annual rate of about 2.9% currently to as high as 4%, or about double the Federal Reserve's 2% target, Capital Economics noted. That would put inflation back to its mid-2023 levels, when the Fed was keeping interest rates near a two-decade as it tried bring inflation under control.",
      "\"[I]mposing any of these suggested tariffs would generate a rebound in consumer price inflation this year, taking it further above target and making it harder for the Fed to resume loosening monetary policy,\" Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "Why does Trump support tariffs?",
      "President Trump cites tariffs as a way to accomplish several policy goals, including raising more money to fund the government and protecting domestic industries.",
      "Both he and his allies, including his new Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0contend that tariffs enacted during the first Trump administration didn't boost inflation. But those tariffs, which applied to only some Chinese imports, \"were too small to matter\" and so didn't have an inflationary impact, Capital Economics said in its research note.",
      "Mr. Trump has also cited the need to boost U.S. manufacturing, saying in an October interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "The data to support that claim is mixed. The tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal to some extent, with the Brookings Institution\u00a0noting\u00a0that jobs in a few industries may have rebounded, such as adding 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other washing machine manufacturers.",
      "Overall, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers. A range of factors could account for that decline, such as the impact of the pandemic and broader economic issues facing manufacturing.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:41:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Norway is inching incredibly close to its goal of selling only zero-emission new vehicles, but advocates say incentives must be kept in place.",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014 Almost 96% of new cars registered in Norway in January were electric, an unparalleled proportion in the world and close to the country's goal of selling only zero-emission vehicles as of this year. A total of 9,343 new cars were sold in January, of which 8,954 were all-electric, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said.",
      "Of the 50 most-sold models, only two were non-electric, the first of which came in 33rd place, the OFV said.",
      "By comparison, the share of electric cars sold in Europe was just 13.6% in the full-year 2024 \u2014 a decline for the first time since 2020, according to the car manufacturers' lobby ACEA. Even that far out-paces EV sales in the U.S., where, according to MotorTrend data from last year, only about 6% of new vehicles sold were electric.",
      "With President Trump now in office after vows to reduce incentives on EV sales brought in under his predecessor, a continued downward trend in U.S. uptake is entirely possible.",
      "\"We've never seen this before... If the rest of the year continues like this, we will very soon be close to the 2025 goal,\" OFV director Oyvind Solberg Thorsen said in a statement. \"But if we want to cross the finish line with 100 percent electric cars, it will be necessary to maintain the incentives that make it profitable to choose an electric car over other models.\"",
      "Despite being a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\" starting in 2025, which is 10 years ahead of the goal set by the European Union, of which Norway is not a member.",
      "In contrast to Brussels' plans, Oslo has not banned the sale of cars with internal combustion engines, having instead opted for a system of generous tax breaks that have made them competitive against heavily taxed internal combustion cars.",
      "They have also benefitted from toll exemptions, free parking in public car parks, and the use of public transport traffic lanes.",
      "How Norway has driven the EV transition",
      "While some tax breaks and incentives have been rolled back over the years, electric cars have become commonplace on Norwegian roads.",
      "\"It was a decision primarily motivated by climate and environment considerations,\" Frode Hvattum, a 50-year-old father of three who owns two EVs, told AFP.",
      "\"Another reason was of course the benefits that come with them,\" he said, describing himself as a \"climate enthusiast.\"",
      "In his upscale neighborhood of Baerum in suburban Oslo, the streets are full of Teslas, Audis and Volkswagens. Competitively priced Chinese brands are increasingly appearing too.",
      "Many homes have a garage with an EV charger, in addition to Norway's vast national network of superfast charging stations that keep the nation rolling.",
      "That was a precondition for Hvattum, who, like many Norwegians, travels frequently by car to his chalet in the mountains several hours from Oslo.",
      "\"It's less complicated now that the network is so well-developed. You don't have to plan your trip as much as before,\" he said, adding that he uses the 15-20 minute charging breaks needed to make it up to the mountains to shop for food.",
      "Even if EV sales fail to meet the 100% mark this year, experts say that Norway can be seen as having met its goal.",
      "\"We should finish the year at between 95 and 100%, and probably even in the high end of this range,\" Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, told AFP.",
      "A new tax increase on internal combustion cars and rechargeable hybrids \u2014 which are cleaner but still run partially on gas or diesel \u2014 on April 1 should help.",
      "In January, diesel cars \u2014 still common in much of Europe \u2014\u00a0accounted for just 1.5% of new cars registered in Norway, and gasoline cars just 0.4%, according to the OFV.",
      "\"Political leaders can't rest on their laurels,\" Bu warned. \"They have to maintain the advantages, such as the toll discounts, so the transition to EVs spreads on the second-hand market.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 10:51:00 -0500",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Canadian sports fans, angry at President Trump's unilateral imposition of 25% tariffs on virtually everything imported from Canada, reacted icily to the Star-Spangled Banner as it was sung at hockey and basketball games over the weekend. Many booed the U.S. national anthem in an uncharacteristic show of frustration after more than 150 years of peaceful, friendly relations along the vast border separating the neighbors.",
      "The reaction was representative of hurt feelings both north and south of the U.S. mainland's borders on Monday. Top officials in Canada and Mexico, which both faced 25% tariffs\u00a0with the stroke of Mr. Trump's pen on Saturday, were expected to hold conversations with the White House on the way forward in a new trade war that Mr. Trump had threatened for months. Both countries vowed to respond with their own trade measures.",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum announced in a brief statement Monday on social media that, after a phone call with Mr. Trump, the tariffs imposed on her country were \"on pause for one month from now.\" She said Mr. Trump had agreed to put the measures on hold after she committed to reinforcing Mexico's border with the U.S. \"with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed the pause in his own social media post, saying the newly deployed Mexican forces \"will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said Mr. Trump had \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.\"",
      "China was also hit by a new raft of tariffs and has warned that it, too, will respond in kind. America's major allies and trade partners in Europe, meanwhile, have been warned by Mr. Trump that the European Union is next on his list, while the United Kingdom appears to have a chance to negotiate a trade deal, but will find itself torn between its next-door neighbors and its storied \"special relationship\" with the U.S. if it hopes to dodge the same fate.",
      "Canada is the biggest export market for products coming from 36 U.S. states, according to the Reuters news agency, while Mexico is broadly considered the U.S.' largest trading partner overall.",
      "Below is a look at some of the reaction from the countries now facing new U.S. tariffs, which will come into effect on Tuesday, and those which might still be hoping to avoid them.",
      "Canada:",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government had no choice but to strike back with 25% tariffs of its own on more than $150 billion worth of U.S.-made imports.",
      "\"First, I want to speak directly to Americans, our closest friends and neighbors,\" said Trudeau. \"This is a choice that, yes, will harm Canadians, but beyond that, it will have real consequences for you, the American people.\"",
      "\"Like the American tariffs, our response will also be far reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine and bourbon. Fruits and fruit juices including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes. It will include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.\"",
      "\"Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,\" Trudeau added to his own constituents in a post on social media. \"Check the labels. Let's do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.\"",
      "The first round of Canada's tariffs will kick in at the stroke of midnight on Monday evening \u2013 on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods. In 21 days, the remainder of the tariffs, covering an additional $125 billion worth of products, will kick in unless some new agreement is reached between the countries. The delay, said Trudeau, was aimed at giving Canadian companies time to seek supply chain options to soften the financial blow.",
      "Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman said many people in her country \"just don't understand where this is coming from... and probably, there's a little bit of hurt.\"",
      "Mexico:",
      "Canada's government is now looking south of the U.S. border, hoping to band together and increase trade ties with Mexico to help both nations absorb the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. The two countries have agreed \"to enhance the strong bilateral relations\" they share and officials have had extensive bilateral meetings with their counterparts.",
      "President Sheinbaum, who haD already mocked Mr.Trump's move to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, said on social media before the pause was announced that countermeasures against the U.S. tariffs would soon be implemented.",
      "\"I've instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we've been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,\" Sheinbaum said, without specifying which U.S. goods her government might target, or whether she would seek to match the 25% retaliatory tariffs set to be imposed by Canada.",
      "Mexican goods exported to the U.S. are wide-ranging, and include vehicles and other auto industry components, crude oil, natural gas, avocados, tomatoes, pork and cheese.",
      "China:",
      "For Beijing, it was deja-vu. During Mr. Trump's first term, he slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, then 10% on an additional $300 billion worth of imports, which meant virtually everything Chinese was tariffed.",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement over the weekend saying Beijing was \"strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes\" the new 10% tariffs, that the U.S.'s \"unilateral increase in tariffs seriously violates WTO rules,\" and that China \"will file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and take corresponding countermeasures,\" which implies Beijing will impose 10% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S.-made goods.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "In a Sunday statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't drop any hints as to what measures might be coming, but it said called \"on the United States to correct its wrongdoings, maintain the hard-won positive dynamics in the counternarcotics cooperation, and promote a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship.\"",
      "The ministry said the U.S. should \"view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way,\" rather than \"threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was imposing the new 10% tariff on Chinese goods in part due to what he considers Beijing's failure to stem the flow of fentanyl and chemicals used to make the drug.",
      "The foreign ministry in Beijing said China was \"one of the world's toughest countries on counternarcotics, both in terms of policy and its implementation.\"",
      "The European Union:",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend that tariffs on the European Union were coming, but he did not say when or how steep they would be.",
      "\"It will definitely happen with the European Union. I can tell you that because they've really taken advantage of us,\" the U.S. president told reporters Sunday. \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them.\"",
      "European leaders were meeting Monday in Brussels, where they were discussing how to collectively address the threat.",
      "\"We were listening carefully to those words, and of course we are preparing also on our side,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday in Brussels, adding a warning that \"there are no winners in trade wars.\"",
      "If the Trump administration \"starts a trade war [with Europe], then the one laughing on the side is China,\" said Kallas. \"We are very interlinked.\"",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

      "In Bill Gates' new autobiography, \"Source Code: My Beginnings\" (published February 4 by Knopf), the computer pioneer and philanthropist writes of his formative years, and the experiences that led him to the then-burgeoning world of computers.",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",
      "The page included a sample program written in BASIC telling the computer how to add two numbers.",
      "Ready . . .",
      "10 INPUT X,Y",
      "20 LET A=X+Y",
      "30 PRINT A",
      "40 END",
      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, in the latest purge of a Biden Administrator holdover.",
      "Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. In a letter to the president shared on social media, Chopra said it was an \"extraordinary privilege\" to serve as director of the CFPB.",
      "\"With so much power concentrated in the hands of a few, agencies like the CFPB have never been more critical,\" he wrote. \"I'm proud that the CFPB has done so much to restore the rule of law.\"",
      "Chopra was notified of his firing via an email from the White House, a person familiar with the notice who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly told the Associated Press.",
      "During his term, Mr. Trump had picked Chopra as a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "An ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Chopra then was\u00a0tapped by former President Joe Biden\u00a0to lead the consumer agency that he helped launch after the 2008-09 financial crisis. He served as its deputy director, sounding the alarm about skyrocketing levels of student loan debt.",
      "Warren, one of Mr. Trump's favorite targets, said in a statement that the CFPB under Chopra held \"Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families\" and prevented \"the de-banking of Americans across the country, including consumers locked out of the financial system due to overdraft fees, religious organizations, and conservatives.\"",
      "Under the law, Chopra was to serve a five-year term, which meant he could have stayed on as the CFPB director. But he had publicly stated that he would leave his post if the new president asked.",
      "\"I hope that the CFBP will continue to be a pillar of restoring and advancing economic liberty in America, and I wish you good luck in serving our great country,\" Chopra said in his letter to Mr. Trump.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 17:15:59 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump will enact 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada starting Saturday, as well as a 10% tariff on China.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump will enact 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1, as well as a 10% tariff on imports from China, according to White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" Leavitt said at a White House briefing on Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he's\u00a0targeting Canada and Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the nation's biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S. The president has also said tariffs will generate money for the federal government, although the import duties are paid by U.S. importers. Companies such as Walmart, Target and other U.S. importers typically pass tariff-related costs onto American consumers.",
      "Asked whether Mr. Trump's new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would include any exemptions, Leavitt said she didn't have information about that issue.",
      "Mr. Trump's goals include narrowing the trade surplus between those nations and the U.S. The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Experts warn that steep new tariffs on imports could cause U.S. economic growth to slow and inflation to flare, noting that companies in the U.S. are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers. A sustained burst of inflation, in turn, could also deter the Federal Reserve from pushing down borrowing costs, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Even the prospect of higher import duties is influencing spending by consumers and businesses, according to Oxford Economics. Analysts with the investment adviser note that U.S. imports surged in December, a sign Americans are buying appliances, furniture and other goods now to get ahead of possible price increases.",
      "Retaliation risks",
      "A volley of new U.S. tariffs is likely to invite swift retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that his country is prepared to fire back if Mr. Trump proceeds with his plan, but he did not give details.",
      "\"We're ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\" he said. \"It's not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico has conferred with Trump's team since before he returned to the White House, but she emphasized that Mexico has a \"Plan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\"",
      "\"Now it is very important that the Mexican people know that we are always going to defend the dignity of our people, we are always going to defend the respect of our sovereignty and a dialogue between equals, as we have always said, without subordination,\" she said.",
      "The ultimate economic damage from the U.S. tariffs would hinge on how long they are in place, Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator, told the Associated Press.",
      "If it's just a few days, \"that's one thing. If they are in place for weeks onto months, we're going to see supply chain disruptions, higher costs for U.S. manufacturers, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers,\" said Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"It could have macroeconomic impacts. It could affect the stock market. Then internationally it could lead to more tension with our trading partners and make it harder for us to work with them.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 15:44:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, faces scrutiny for fees he may earn from lawsuits against Merck.",
    "story": [
      "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearings to serve as the nation's top health official play out on Capitol Hill, President Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services is facing scrutiny not only for his anti-vaccine views, but whether he profits from them.",
      "If confirmed, Kennedy would wield control over federal vaccine policy and the regulation of drugmakers, even as he stands to potentially profit from vaccine-related litigation.",
      "How Kennedy made money from lawsuits",
      "Kennedy for years has earned referral fees from Wisner Baum, a Los Angeles personal injury law firm that is currently suing Merck, alleging the pharmaceutical giant failed to properly warn the public about risks from its vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), Gardasil, according to financial disclosure documents filed by Kennedy with the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Wisner Baum is representing a plaintiff in a trial against Merck and other lawsuits are in the works in North Carolina.",
      "\"An overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy profiles of our HPV vaccines,\" Rahway, New Jersey-based Merck said Tuesday in a\u00a0statement on the litigation. \"The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims in the upcoming trial.\"",
      "In a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, repeatedly asked Kennedy if he would agree to forgo payments stemming from litigation against drugmakers after disclosing in Ethics Office filings that he might collect legal fees for referring potential plaintiffs in Wisner Baum's suits against Merck over its HPV vaccine, which is to prevent cervical cancer.",
      "Kennedy has made about $2.5 million since 2022 in his work with the law firm, including $850,000 last year, public records show. Kennedy, himself a longtime personal injury lawyer, could earn even more if the litigation against Merck prevails given that he is opting to keep his stake in the pending court case, according to ethics documents filed before his confirmation hearings.",
      "Kennedy has a consulting arrangement to refer cases to Wisner Baum, which is pursuing cases related to the HPV vaccine Gardasil. If Kennedy is confirmed, he said he would resign from that arrangement.",
      "\"I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,\" Kennedy stated in his ethics pledge. According to the document, Kennedy will retain an interest in cases that do not involve the U.S. as a party and in which the U.S. does not have a \"direct and substantial interest.\"",
      "At the same time, Kennedy vowed to divest his rights to payment in contingency fee cases in which the U.S. is a party or has a direct or large interest to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\"",
      "Financial conflict of interest?",
      "Kennedy's plan to continue collecting contingency fees while serving as Health and Human Services secretary raises questions as a matter of ethics and policy, according to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, \"It's very unusual for a cabinet secretary to retain an interest in contingency fee litigation,\" Clark told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's troubling.\"",
      "For example, if Kennedy stands to financially gain in lawsuits against Merck or other drugmakers, his impartiality as HHS secretary could face scrutiny if the companies faced a federal enforcement action or submitted a drug for government approval, Clark added.",
      "Wisner Baum said it hasn't paid Kennedy for his work linked to the firm's suits against Merck, which is just getting started in California.",
      "The firm \"has only compensated Mr. Kennedy for Monsanto Roundup-induced non-Hodgkins lymphoma cases, Woolsey Fire cases and Paradise/Camp Fire cases. All of these cases alleged corporate wrongdoing that caused life-changing harm to victims,\" Wisner Baum said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We are currently in trial in the first Gardasil case in Los Angeles. We hope, like in Roundup, soundbites take a backseat to truth, take a backseat to actual evidence, and a jury returns a verdict sending the same message multiple juries did in Roundup \u2014 consumers deserve to know the truth, and politics has nothing to do with it,\" said Wisner Baum's managing partner, R. Brent Wisner, alluding to long-running ligation against Monsanto, now owned by Germany's Bayner, over a weedkiller alleged to cause cancer.",
      "Kennedy also made another $326,056 in salary and benefits from the Children's Health Defense, which he founded and formerly chaired, according to his ethics filings. The nonprofit has filed dozens of state and federal lawsuits challenging vaccine and public health mandates. Its targets include the federal agencies that Kennedy would run at HHS.",
      "During the hearing, Warren pointed to several changes Kennedy could make that might enrich him in connection with such lawsuits if he is approved as health secretary. That includes appointing anti-vaccine advocates to vaccine advisory panels, removing vaccines from recommendations or changing the way the vaccine injury compensation program works.",
      "Kennedy would not commit to Warren's request to forgo contingency fees while serving as HHS secretary. However, in written responses\u00a0to Warren on Friday, Kennedy agreed to amend his ethics agreement, a document that should be \"thoroughly reviewed\" before the Senate moves forward on Kennedy's nominatioin, the senator's office stated.",
      "\"It would be insufficient for RFK Jr. to only divest his interest in the Gardasil case while leaving the window open to profit from other anti-vax lawsuits, including future cases he could bring after leaving office,\" Warren said in a statement on Friday.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a phone message requesting comment. Representatives for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "MAHA trademark pending",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican of Idaho, asked Kennedy if there was \"anything that you are aware of in your background that might present a conflict of interest within the duties of the office to which you have been nominated?\"",
      "Kennedy replied \"No, Mr. Chairman.\"",
      "As part of the confirmation proceedings, Kennedy in December disclosed earning $100,000 from variations of his slogan, \"Make America Healthy Again\" and its abbreviation \u2014 MAHA \u2014 on stickers, hats and hoodies. Kennedy had in recent months applied for trademark protection for the phrase, setting the stage for marketing supplements, vitamins, essential oils and cryptocurrency, according to documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",
      "Kennedy has since transferred ownership of the trademark application to a limited liability company managed by Del Gibtree, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.",

      "Leavitt's confirmation of the tariffs comes after Trump on Thursday reiterated his earlier threat this month that he could announce 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1, telling reporters from the Oval Office that the duties \"may or may not rise with time.\" He had previously warned China could face a 10% tariff.",
      "Economists have warned that stiff tariffs\u00a0could reawaken U.S. inflation on a range of consumer goods and slow economic growth. Here's what experts have to say.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to hit countries with tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple nations for a range of reasons. He said he is specifically\u00a0targeting Canada, Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the U.S.' biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S., as well as to narrow their trade surplus with the U.S.",

      "Before Mr. Trump returned to power, he also had threatened tariffs of up to\u00a060% on Chinese goods\u00a0imported into the U.S., a measure experts say is intended to advance American interests in negotiating better trade terms with Beijing, as well as throttle the illegal entry of fentanyl into the country.",
      "In a show of how his administration uses tariff threats to pressure countries on other issues, Mr. Trump last week proposed potential 25% levies against Colombia unless it agreed to receive deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Colombia ultimately agreed to receive the immigrants,\u00a0and the tariffs were withheld.",
      "Colombia's about-face suggests that Canada and Mexico could also reach agreement with the U.S. and avert a painful trade war. To that end, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that Canada and Mexico could avoid tariffs by closing their borders to fentanyl.",
      "\"As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\" Lutnick told senators.",
      "Even so, Mr. Trump's brandishing of potential tariffs \u2014 even if they are never imposed \u2014 highlights his willingness to use tough trade measures to punish even the country's closest allies unless they make concessions.",
      "\"As we have previously noted, trade policy will be transactional over the next four years with protectionist measures used to extort trade, immigration and other political concessions,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "What exactly is Trump planning?",
      "Along with targeting Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has floated the possibility of a blanket tariff on a range of countries in Asia, South America, Europe and other regions.",
      "\"I think we have to proceed on the assumption that some kinds of tariffs are going to be imposed on the United States' major trading partners,\" Brett House, professor of economics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In the end, there is a lot that gets announced by the president on social media that does not come to pass. I don't take it as bluffing, so much as a storm of possibilities, and it's hard to tell which bit of that storm is going to be pursued most aggressively, and most immediately.\"",
      "What's clear, by contrast, is that the new administration is picking up where Mr. Trump left off in his first term in using trade policy as an instrument of both economic and foreign policy. That is likely to lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply-chain software firm E2open.",
      "\"A lot of alternatives are still possible,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. \"We don't know, but game theory would suggest the president would implement tariffs in some form against Mexico and Canada \u2014 not blanket tariffs, but on a select number of imports from both nations... because otherwise his bluff is going to be called.\"",
      "On how soon any tariffs could take effect, Daco notes that Mr. Trump could move quickly by claiming authority under a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "\"When he said he'll impose tariffs on Feb. 1, it is still an open question as to what means would be used. Do you want to implement tariffs immediately, as threatened against Colombia over the weekend, or are you threatening with a deadline to obtain concessions?\" Daco said.",
      "Would the U.S. face retaliation?",
      "Almost certainly, economists say. If Trump officials move ahead with tariffs on its northern neighbor, \"We anticipate Canada would then respond in kind by also implementing a 25% across-the-board tariff on U.S. imports,\" Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist with S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.",
      "Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, previously vowed to remove U.S.-made alcoholic beverages from stores in the Canadian province, according to the Associated Press. Canada is the world's second-largest market for America's distilled spirits, behind European Union.",
      "Elijah Oliveros-Rosen, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings, predicted Mexico also would fire back with targeted tariffs. \"In the case of Mexico, we think it's very unlikely the government would place tariffs on U.S.-manufactured imports, given most are intermediate goods eventually exported to the U.S. Therefore, we expect the Mexican government could impose tariffs on agricultural and food imports, but not manufacturing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that strengthening the U.S.' stance on trade issues will help protect American workers and lead to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Yet such policies could come at the cost of damaging critical relationships with other nations around the world, said Douglas Irwin, a U.S. trade policy expert and professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "What is the risk to American consumers?",
      "Irwin and other economists say tariffs are all but certain to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. That's because companies that end up on the hook typically pass added costs along to consumers in order to protect their bottom lines.",
      "\"The notion this administration has been adhering to is somewhat surprising \u2014 the idea that if you implement gradual tariffs over time, such as in 5% increments, that these are less inflationary,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This idea is misguided, because if you have incremental price increases month after month, if anything that leads to higher inflation expectations. It leads to higher inflation on a month-to-month basis.\"",
      "If Mr. Trump's tariffs are implemented in full, including a universal 10% tax on all goods, consumer price inflation could rise to between 3% and 4%, according to an analysis this week from Capital Economics. To be sure, analysts with the investment advisory firm expect Mr. Trump to stop short of imposing a blanket tariff and instead pick his targets.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, suggested that a volley of tariffs between the countries would also impact U.S. consumers.",
      "\"From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose,\" he said in an email.",

They are also pulling back on efforts to include hiring and promoting women, minorities, LGBTQ+ people and veterans.",

In the past, Target was known for its diversity initiatives and reputation for supporting diverse communities,\" said civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. \"Now Target has shown its true face by deciding to roll back its focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion by putting profits and politics over people.\"",
      "Armstrong encouraged Minnesotans to start boycotting Target stores indefinitely starting Saturday, Feb. 1.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

    "summary": "With tax season underway, here's what you need to know about tracking your tax refund and your new 2025 tax brackets.",
    "story": [
      "Tax season is now underway, with the IRS accepting returns for all taxpayers as of Jan. 27. That's prompting many people to turn to the \"Where's my refund?\" app from the tax agency to track when they'll get their check.",
      "Americans are expected to file about 140 million returns before the April 15 deadline. Last year, about two-thirds of taxpayers got a refund, with the average check at about $3,100,\u00a0according\u00a0to IRS data.",
      "A household's tax refund may represent their biggest check for the entire year, with many consumers planning to use the money for debt repayment, emergency savings or a big purchase. To be sure, while a large refund may feel like a financial windfall, it actually represents income that taxpayers have overpaid to the IRS throughout the year.",
      "That's why some financial experts describe refund checks as tax-free loans to the U.S. government. Yet other experts note that tax refunds can act as a form of forced savings that a household might not otherwise be able to accomplish, allowing those taxpayers to reap the benefit in their annual refund.",
      "Whatever the case might be, tracking your refund can be done through the IRS' \"Where's my refund\" app, which the agency has sought to improve over the last few years. Here's what to know.",
      "How does \"Where's my refund?\" work?",
      "The IRS operates the \"Where's my refund?\" service on its website, but taxpayers can also use a mobile app called IRS2Go\u00a0on their phones or other devices. Both services will provide information about your 2024 return about 24 hours after you e-file, the IRS says.",
      "However, people who file paper returns will need to wait about 4 weeks for their information to appear on \"Where's my refund?\" or the IRS2Go app.",
      "Both services require taxpayers to enter information to be able to track their refunds:",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification numberFiling status, such as single filer or married filing jointly\u00a0The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",

      "Filing status, such as single filer or married filing jointly",
      "The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "The IRS tracking services will then show you information on whether the agency has received your tax return, if the refund has been approved and when the money is scheduled to land in your account.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "That depends on whether you've file electronically or sent in a paper tax return, as well as if the IRS identifies any problems with your return.",
      "People who e-filed their returns typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. In other words, a taxpayer who filed their 1040 on Jan. 27 could receive their payment by Feb. 17, if all goes smoothly.",
      "However, the IRS opened its Free File service on Jan. 10, which is a program offered through tax software companies for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024. Those using Free File could be on tap to receive their refunds by Jan. 31.",
      "What can delay your tax refund?",
      "Filing a paper return can delay your refund because it requires IRS employees to process them, which takes more time than e-filed returns, which are largely handled by computers.",
      "Claiming either the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) can also slow down a tax refund. That's because, by law, the IRS can't issue refunds for returns that have claimed those tax credits before mid-February.",
      "\"The IRS expects most EITC/ACTC-related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by March 3 if they chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with their tax return,\" the agency said on Monday.",
      "Some issues can also trip up tax refunds, such as if there are math errors on your return, missing or incorrect Social Security numbers or misspelled names, according to the IRS. While these might be innocent mistakes, it can cause the IRS to flag your return and delay your refund.",
      "What's my new 2025 tax bracket?",
      "The IRS has set new tax brackets for 2025, but that won't impact the return you'll file by April 15, since that 1040 reflects your 2024 income and taxes.",
      "Each year, the IRS adjusts its tax brackets and dozens of other provisions to account for inflation. The idea is to shield taxpayers from \"bracket creep\" \u2014 when workers are pushed into higher tax bands due to the impact of cost-of-living adjustments aimed at offsetting inflation \u2014 without a change in their standard of living.",
      "This year's tax brackets are adjusted 2.8% higher from 2024, representing the smallest jump in several years. Because inflation jumped during the pandemic, the bracket adjustments reached 7% in 2023\u00a0and\u00a05.4% in 2024.",

      "In a 9-8 vote, the Senate Intelligence Committee advanced Gabbard's nomination to the full Senate. The vote fell along party lines.",
      "Republicans on the panel who were seen as potential \"no\" votes began to drop their objections Monday, with Sen. Susan Collins of Maine saying that Gabbard had addressed her concerns and shared her vision of downsizing the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana announced Tuesday he would back Gabbard after he secured \"commitments that will advance our national security.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's choice to lead the intelligence community was seen as one of the most vulnerable nominees heading into her confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, when she was grilled on a number of controversial positions she has taken over the years. She faced skepticism from senators over her decision to meet with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017, her past push to pardon National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, her comments about Russia's war in Ukraine and her past opposition to renewing a key government surveillance authority, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.",
      "The most contentious moments of the hearing came as she was repeatedly pressed by Republican and Democratic senators on whether she would characterize Snowden as a \"traitor.\"",
      "Gabbard declined to directly answer the question, responding each time that \"Edward Snowden broke the law.\" She never said that he was a \"traitor\" and at one point seemed to defend his actions, telling the panel that he had exposed \"egregious illegal and unconstitutional programs\" that led to reforms. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Gabbard vowed to pardon Snowden, who leaked a trove of information on the U.S. government's top-secret mass surveillance programs. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and later Russia, where he lives in exile, after the leak.",
      "\"I do not agree with or support all of the information and intelligence that he released, nor the way in which he did it,\" Gabbard told senators.",
      "Gabbard also sought to alleviate concerns about her criticisms of FISA Section 702, which allows the U.S. to collect foreign communications without a warrant. U.S. officials say it's crucial to protecting national security because it helps disrupt terrorist attacks, cyberattacks and espionage activities. It does not allow U.S. citizens to be targeted, but their communications can be swept up when they are in contact with a targeted foreigner.",
      "Gabbard told senators during her confirmation hearing last week it was \"essential\" to national security, years after she tried to repeal the controversial law.",
      "\"There are a number of areas that we would be blind from a national security perspective without this capability,\" she said. \"It also must exist next to having safeguards in place to ensure Americans' civil liberties are protected.\"",

Some of her responses, and non-responses, created more confusion than clarity and only deepened my concerns about her judgement and what that will mean in this vital role.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. government is moving quickly to implement President Trump's order to turn facilities at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base into a large-scale immigration detention center, with plans to transport the first group of migrant detainees there on Tuesday, two U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump instructed his administration to dramatically expand detention space inside the naval base to detain as many as 30,000 \"high-priority\" unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. Since then, officials from across the government, including the Departments of Defense, State and Homeland Security, have scrambled to implement the president's directive.",
      "One of the U.S. officials said those sent to the naval base would be unauthorized immigrants arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the agency at the center of the president's vow to oversee the largest deportation effort in American history. The agency has ramped up immigration operations across the country under Mr. Trump, averaging between 800 and 1,000 daily arrests in the past week \u2014 up from the 312 average in former President Joe Biden's final year in office.",
      "Over the past several days, there has been an internal debate about whether the Pentagon or DHS would have legal and physical custody over the migrant detainees, and what sort of legal rights they would have.",
      "For decades, the Guantanamo base has included a facility, known as the Migrant Operations Center, where U.S. immigration officials have screened some asylum-seekers intercepted at sea. That area is separate from Guantanamo Bay's detention center, the post-9/11 military prison where the U.S. still holds more than a dozen terrorism suspects.",
      "A relatively small number of migrants are housed in barrack-like facilities while they undergo interviews with asylum officers. Asylum-seekers who passed those initial interviews have been referred for resettlement in third countries like Australia and Canada. The U.S. has long had a policy of not allowing those caught at sea to seek asylum in the U.S. in order to deter maritime migration.",
      "After Mr. Trump's recent directive, U.S. officials have been setting up tent facilities to hold migrants in Guantanamo Bay beyond the Migrant Operations Center.",
      "In the early 1990s, the Clinton administration held thousands of Haitian migrants inside the Guantanamo base, including in a notorious camp for those diagnosed with HIV, who were banned from entering the U.S. at the time.",
      "While visiting the southwest border on Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called Guantanamo Bay \"the perfect place\" to hold migrants and suggested using the maximum security prison to hold members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "\"It's the perfect place to provide for migrants who are traveling out of our country through gray tails or other assets, but also hardened criminals,\" Hegseth said, referring to military aircraft used to transport personnel. \"Where are you going to put Tren De Aragua before you send them all the way back? How about a maximum security prison at Guantanamo Bay, where we have the space.\"",

      "In response, on Sunday, agents across the country were asked to complete questionnaires about their involvement in the Jan. 6 and Trump probes as part of a Justice Department evaluation of the workforce.",
      "According to a U.S. official familiar with the process, the FBI subsequently turned over the requested agent and personnel information to Justice Department leadership on Tuesday afternoon. Over 5,000 names were on the list, the official said.",
      "There is no indication yet about what actions the Justice Department may take against anyone on the compiled lists and so far, a handful of senior career officials have been fired, while rank-and-file agents remain on the job.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Finance Committee advanced Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination Tuesday, moving forward with his confirmation to lead the Department of Health and Human Services after a pair of fiery hearings last week that left his approval on shaky ground.",
      "The committee voted 14 to 13 to advance Kennedy in a party-line vote.",
      "Though the bulk of Republicans on the committee were expected to support advancing Kennedy's nomination, Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and medical doctor, expressed concern over the president's pick for HHS secretary during RFK Jr.'s confirmation hearings.",
      "Cassidy said last week that he had been \"struggling\" with Kennedy's nomination because he fears RFK Jr., who has raised doubts about vaccines in the past, could undermine faith in vaccines. Cassidy spoke to Kennedy on Sunday, according to a person familiar with their conversation, though the Louisiana senator did not disclose how he planned to vote following their conversation.",
      "But Cassidy, who is up for reelection in 2026, ultimately opted to support advancing Kennedy's nomination on Tuesday.",
      "Moments ahead of the vote, Cassidy announced that he would support Kennedy in a post on X, saying he had \"very intense conversations with Bobby and the White House over the weekend and even this morning,\" while thanking Vice President JD Vance for his \"honest counsel.\"",
      "\"With the serious commitments I've received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes,\" Cassidy said.",
      "Kennedy appeared before the finance committee for a confirmation hearing last week, before testifying to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions the following day. During both appearances, Democrats on the committees \u2014 and even some Republicans \u2014 grilled the longtime environmental lawyer and activist on his stances on vaccines, abortion, and other issues.",
      "President Trump's pick for HHS secretary has faced scrutiny from Democrats and Republicans, alike. Though Kennedy, 71, initially sought the Democratic presidential nomination and has close ties to the party as the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy, he dropped out of the presidential race to endorse Mr. Trump in August, and has long been the recipient of the Democratic establishment's ire.",
      "Amid the pushback, some had looked to possible support from Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent. But Sanders said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that he was \"not particularly happy\" with Kennedy's presentation before the Senate committees last week.",
      "Without support from Democrats on the committee, which has a one-member GOP advantage, Cassidy's opposition threatened to tank a favorable recommendation for advancing Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Meanwhile, two Democrats on the committee, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, raised alarm about possible conflicts of interest in recent days, penning a letter to Kennedy concerning his potential to profit from vaccine-related litigation. Paired with his long-held stances on vaccine safety, the senators said the possible conflicts give them \"grave concern\" about his ability to serve as HHS secretary.",
      "Kennedy has earned referral fees from a Los Angeles personal injury law firm, Wisner Baum, for years. The firm is currently suing Merck concerning warnings about the safety of the HPV vaccine. Kennedy agreed to divest his interests in the cases he has referred to Wisner Baum to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\" The senators noted in their letter that Kennedy in his written response to committee questions indicated he was divesting the interest to one of his adult sons \u2014 a detail which they called \"troubling.\"",
      "\"The arrangement outlined in your Ethics Agreement Amendment is plainly inadequate, as it would appear to allow an immediate family member to benefit financially from your position as Secretary,\" the senators wrote, adding that \"vaccine-related decisions\" that Kennedy could make as HHS secretary \"could result in significant financial compensation for your family.\"",
      "The Democrats also asked Kennedy to commit in writing to recuse himself from all vaccine-related communications and decisions and pledge not to litigate cases involving vaccines or have a financial interest in the cases for at least four years after leaving office. Kennedy said during Wednesday's hearing that he would \"comply with all the ethical guidelines.\"",
      "With the advancement out of committee, the fight over Kennedy's confirmation will move to the Senate floor, where his approval isn't guaranteed. Republicans can afford to lose just three votes to confirm him without support from across the aisle, with Vice President J.D. Vance serving as a tie-breaker.",
      "The developments come as Senate Republicans have pushed to quickly confirm Mr. Trump's nominees to his Cabinet and top administration posts, with appointees like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sailing to confirmation, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth eked by with a 51-50 vote on his confirmation.",
      "The president decried pushback from Democrats regarding his nominees in a post on Truth Social Sunday, saying \"no matter how good and well qualified someone is, they are taking maximum time for approval \u2014 and laughing about it.\"",
      "\"Republicans must GET TOUGH \u2014 AND MUST GET TOUGH VERY FAST,\" Trump said. \"We need our Nominees NOW, for the Safety and Good of our Country!\"",

    "summary": "The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging President Trump's move to close down the American asylum system.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging President Trump's move to close down the American asylum system, saying it violates legal obligations the U.S. has to offer refuge to migrants fleeing persecution.",
      "The lawsuit marks the first legal challenge against an executive action taken by Mr. Trump on his first day back at the White House that has allowed U.S. border officials to summarily deport migrants, without allowing them to request asylum.",
      "In that order, Mr. Trump invoked a muscular presidential power that allows officials to bar the entry of foreigners whose entry is determined to be \"detrimental\" to the U.S. He justified the sweeping move by accusing migrants of staging an \"invasion\" of the U.S. and posing a risk to the country's national security, public safety and public health.",
      "It's one of a flurry of actions the president has taken to launch his long-promised immigration crackdown. They include instructing the American military to aid in border enforcement, directing deportation officers to ramp up immigration arrests across the U.S. and suspending legal migration channels for foreigners, including Ukrainians and others from countries in turmoil.",
      "Though other American presidents, including former President Joe Biden, have sharply restricted asylum to try to curb illegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border, Mr. Trump's order is unprecedented, in its scope and legal rationale.",
      "By concluding that the country is facing an \"invasion\" of migrants, Mr. Trump effectively paused U.S. asylum law, which has required American immigration officials to at least interview people who say they fear being persecuted if deported.",
      "In its lawsuit, the ACLU asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block officials from enforcing Mr. Trump's decree, which the civil rights organization said seeks to \"unilaterally override the protections Congress has afforded those fleeing danger.\"",
      "\"This proclamation is an unprecedented attempt to eliminate the entire asylum system created by Congress to protect desperate people fleeing grave persecution,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney overseeing Monday's lawsuit.",
      "Kush Desai, a spokesman for the White House, said in response to the suit that \"President Trump was given a resounding mandate to end the disregard and abuse of our immigration laws and secure our borders\" and the Trump administration \"will continue to put Americans and America First.\"",
      "Following record levels of illegal crossings at the southern border during his first years in office, Biden enacted his own asylum crackdown in June 2024, invoking the same authority known as 212(f) that Mr. Trump is currently citing to shut down asylum processing.",
      "While it was also challenged by the ACLU, Biden's order was not as far-reaching as Trump's asylum ban and it contained some exemptions, including for migrants who were able to get an appointment through a government phone app to enter the U.S. at a legal border entry point. That app was shut down immediately after Mr. Trump took office.",
      "Biden's asylum restriction also allowed asylum officers to interview migrants who said they were scared of being harmed if deported from the U.S.",
      "While Mr. Trump has continued to describe the southern border as in \"crisis\" and facing an \"invasion,\" illegal crossings there have been at the lowest level in years. They first began to drop sharply early last year after Mexico increased efforts to interdict migrants and fell further following Biden's move to limit asylum.",
      "In January, which included over two weeks under Biden, Border Patrol recorded nearly 30,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border illegally, the lowest level since May 2020, a year that saw a dramatic reduction in migration due to COVID-era travel restrictions, according to unpublished government data obtained by CBS News.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 09:52:32 -0500",
    "summary": "After meeting Secretary of State Marco Rubio, El Salvador's president has offered to house U.S. deportees and even American inmates in his country's \"mega-prison.\"",
    "story": [
      "San Salvador, El Salvador \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late Monday that El Salvador's president has offered to accept and incarcerate deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including criminals with American citizenship currently imprisoned in the U.S. President Nayib Bukele confirmed the offer in a social media post, saying El Salvador was willing to rehouse deportees and American prisoners in a two-year-old \"mega-prison\" he had built as potent symbol of his crackdown on criminal gangs.",
      "Bukele \"has agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,\" Rubio said after meeting the Salvadoran leader at his lakeside country house outside San Salvador for several hours.",
      "\"We can send them and he will put them in his jails,\" Rubio said of migrants of all nationalities detained in the United States. \"He's also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they're U.S. citizens or legal residents.\"",
      "Bukele confirmed the offer in a post on X, saying El Salvador has \"offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system.\"",
      "He said his country would accept only \"only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee\" that he said \"would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.\"",
      "Elon Musk, the billionaire working with Mr. Trump to remake the federal government, responded on his X platform, \"Great idea!!\"",
      "After Rubio spoke, a U.S. official said the Trump administration had no current plans to try to deport American citizens, but said Bukele's offer was significant. The U.S. government cannot deport American citizens, and such a move would be met with significant legal challenges.",
      "CBS News reported\u00a0last month that El Salvador had agreed to accept U.S. deportations of \"criminal illegal migrants from any country,\" including members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Rubio was visiting El Salvador to press a friendly government to do more to meet President Trump's demands for a major crackdown on\u00a0immigration.",
      "The State Department describes El Salvador's overcrowded prisons as \"harsh and dangerous.\" On its current country information webpage it says, \"In many facilities, provisions for sanitation, potable water, ventilation, temperature control and lighting are inadequate or nonexistent.\"",
      "Unlike many of the country's prisons, however, the massive facility known as CECOT that Bukele referred to after his talks with Rubio remains more than half-empty, according to the French news agency AFP, with capacity for 40,000 inmates but only about 15,000 currently estimated to be incarcerated there.",
      "Formally called the Terrorism Confinement Center, CECOT is surrounded by high concrete walls and it sits on the edge of a jungle about 45 miles southeast of San Salvador. According to AFP, inmates at the prison are only permitted to leave their cells for court hearings, which are conducted via video link, or for 30 minutes of daily exercise in an enclosed hall.",
      "Rubio arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight with 43 migrants leave from Panama for Colombia. That came a day after Rubio delivered a warning to Panama that unless the government moved immediately to eliminate China's presence at the Panama Canal, the U.S. would act to do so.",
      "Migration, though, was the main issue of the day, as it will be for the next stops on Rubio's five-nation Central American tour of Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic after Panama and El Salvador. His tour is taking place at a time of turmoil in Washington over the status of the government's main foreign development agency.",
      "The Trump administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States and has worked with regional countries to boost immigration enforcement on their borders as well as to accept deportees from the United States.",
      "The agreement Rubio described for El Salvador to accept foreign nationals arrested in the United States for violating U.S. immigration laws is known as a \"safe third country\" agreement. Officials have suggested this might be an option for Venezuelan gang members convicted of crimes in the United States should Venezuela refuse to accept them, but Rubio said Bukele's offer was for detainees of any nationality.",
      "Human rights activists have warned that El Salvador lacks a consistent policy for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees and that such an agreement might not be limited to violent criminals.",
      "Manuel Flores, the secretary general of the leftist opposition party Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, criticized the \"safe third country\" plan, saying it would signal that the region is Washington's \"backyard to dump the garbage.\"",
      "After meeting with Bukele, Rubio signed a memorandum of understanding with his Salvadoran counterpart to advance U.S.-El Salvador civil nuclear cooperation. The document could lead to a more formal deal on cooperation in nuclear power and medicine that the U.S. has with numerous countries.",
      "The deportation flight Rubio watched being loaded in Panama City was carrying migrants detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department says such deportations send a message of deterrence. The U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets since an agreement was signed to fund them.",
      "Rubio was on the tarmac for the departure of the flight, which was taking 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia. It's unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation, especially in front of cameras.",
      "\"Mass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,\" Rubio said, speaking afterward in a nearby building. \"It impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it's not good for anyone.\"",
      "Monday's deportation flight came as Mr. Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals from the United States, and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States.",
      "His trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting, but details of those were not immediately available.",
      "While Rubio was out of the country, staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed Monday to stay out of the agency's Washington headquarters after Musk announced Mr. Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.",
      "Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs shut down. Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.",
      "The change means that USAID is no longer an independent government agency as it had been for decades - although its new status will likely be challenged in court - and will be run out of the State Department by department officials.",
      "In his remarks, Rubio stressed that some and perhaps many USAID programs would continue in the new configuration but that the switch was necessary because the agency had become unaccountable to the executive branch and Congress.",
      "On his weekend discussion with Panama's president on the Panama Canal, Rubio said he was hopeful that the Panamanians would heed his and Mr. Trump's warnings on China. Panamanians have bristled at Mr. Trump's insistence on retaking control of the American-built canal, which the U.S. turned over in 1999, although they have agreed to pull out of a Chinese infrastructure and development initiative.",
      "\"I understand that it's a delicate issue in Panama,\" Rubio told reporters in San Salvador. \"We don't want to have a hostile and negative relationship with Panama,\" he said. \"I don't believe we do. And we had a frank and respectful conversation, and I hope it'll yield fruits and result in the days to come.\"",
      "But back in Washington, Mr. Trump was less diplomatic, saying: \"China's involved with the Panama Canal. They won't be for long and that's the way it has to be.\"",
      "\"We either want it back, or we're going to get something very strong, or we're going to take it back,\" he told reporters at the White House. \"And China will be dealt with.\"",

    "story": [
      "China said Tuesday it would counter President Trump's tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs of its own on multiple U.S. imports. It also announced an antitrust investigation into Google and other trade measures aimed at the U.S., ratcheting up trade tensions between the two economic heavyweights.",
      "U.S. tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico were also set to go into effect Tuesday but Mr. Trump paused his plans to\u00a0implement them\u00a0for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. He planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "China said Tuesday it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday.",
      "\"The U.S.'s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\" the statement from a Ministry of Finance office said. \"It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing said it would file a complaint with the WTO over the \"malicious\" levies, Agence France-Presse reports.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with its top suppliers being Australia, Qatar and Malaysia. The U.S., which is the biggest exporter of LNG globally, does not significantly export LNG to China.",
      "In addition, China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws. The announcement didn't mention the tariffs but came just minutes after Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs on China were to take effect.",
      "It's unclear how the probe will affect Google's operations. Google has a limited presence in China, and its search engine is blocked in the country like most other Western platforms. Google exited the Chinese market in 2010 after refusing to comply with censorship requests from the Chinese government and following a series of cyberattacks on the company.",
      "Google didn't immediately comment.",
      "Mr. Trump paused his plans Monday to\u00a0implement steep tariffs\u00a0on imports from Mexico and Canada for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. He planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "In addition to the tariffs and Google probe, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they're essential to U.S. economic or national security and have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium, which is used in manufacturing.",
      "The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.",
      "Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over \"improper Xinjiang-related behavior\" after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton.",
      "Possible ramifications",
      "Analysts said China's retaliatory measures would not only cause adverse effects on the U.S. economy but would impact the rest of the world.",
      "This isn't the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind.",
      "This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter.",
      "\"They have a much more developed export control regime. We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others. So ... they could put some significant harm on our economy,\" said Philip Luck, a former State Department official and director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Monday at a forum.",
      "The response from China appears calculated and measured, said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute.",
      "\"I don't think they want the trade war escalating,\" he said. \"And they see (the) example from Canada and Mexico and probably they are hoping for the same thing.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's control of a federal payment system is raising concerns about funding for programs like Social Security and the safety of personal data.",
    "story": [
      "With Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gaining control of the Treasury Department's payment system, consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers are raising alarms about the group's access to the federal government's financial spigot, as well as sensitive data such as the Social Security numbers of most taxpayers.",
      "DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to reduce federal spending, now has access to a Treasury unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks and federal salaries, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Musk's access to the payment system is raising concerns as it comes just days after the White House ordered a broad freeze\u00a0on federal grants and loans, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. That same day, state Medicaid programs said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "While the White House later rescinded the memo and a judge halted the freeze, DOGE's control of the Treasury's payment system raises questions about the Trump administration's ability to halt the flow of federal funds for programs including Medicare and Social Security. It's also causing concerns about DOGE's access to the personal and financial information of most taxpayers.",
      "\"There's no community of Americans that this system does not touch, and so I think the concern is that access to this system including personally identifiable information has been ceded to the president's billionaire friend for reasons that are passing understanding,\" Donald K. Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There are \"quite real risks\" that DOGE \"could potentially undermine that system and threaten millions of Americans from getting payments that they are due,\" he added.",
      "Musk's access to the Treasury payment system has sparked concern from Democratic lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, while a lawsuit was filed on Monday alleging \"unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information\" to Musk and DOGE. The lawsuit, filed by two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, names U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Treasury as defendants.",
      "\"Controlling the system could allow the Trump Administration to 'unilaterally' \u2014 and illegally \u2014 cut off payments for millions of Americans, putting at risk the financial security of families and businesses based on political favoritism or the whims of Mr. Musk and those on his team who have worked their way inside,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a Feb. 2 letter to Bessent.",
      "She added, \"It could also give them access to millions of Americans' personal and financial information that is protected by law.\"",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?",
      "The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year.",
      "The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division.",
      "In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according\u00a0to\u00a0the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted.",
      "How did DOGE get control of the payment system?",
      "The executive\u00a0order\u00a0signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems.\" DOGE itself is not a federal department.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported.",
      "On Sunday, Musk\u00a0stated\u00a0that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees.",
      "Could this impact Social Security?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried.",
      "Musk and DOGE \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. \"Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits \u2014 or their personal data.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he's concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, \"whether intentional or unintentional.\"",
      "\"It appears that Musk's behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump's goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,\" he wrote.",
      "Does Musk have access to taxpayers' personal data?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients.",
      "Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn't respond to requests for comment but did\u00a0repost an Associated Press article on X\u00a0with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.",
      "\"Traditionally, access to this information has been highly restricted and among the most secure information the U.S. government holds,\" said James E. Lee, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"This is the kind of information that, if it found its way into the hands of a bad actor, could lead to a wide range of identity crimes \u2014 impersonation to open new accounts or access existing ones, theft of the funds in an existing banking account, applying for new state or federal government benefits, and filing false tax returns among other forms of identity fraud.\"",
      "The data is also sensitive because it could be useful to intelligence agencies in other nations, including the personal data of government employees or ties that businesses have with the U.S. government, Lee noted.",
      "That concern was echoed by Sen. Wyden, who in the Jan. 31 letter to Bessent questioned granting access to sensitive information to Musk due to significant business interests in China, noting that Tesla operates its largest factory in China. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has notified Congress that he is eyeing a potential reorganization, which could include merging it with the State Department.",
      "But critics of Mr. Trump's actions warn that the sweeping moves, which come just two weeks after he returned to office, threaten to put the nation at risk and undermine its credibility around the world.

      "\"If the United States is going to prevail in great power competition, we cannot afford to take a timeout from USAID programs that have long served to advance U.S. foreign policy goals,\" the top Democrats on the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees said in a letter last week to Jason Gray, who was then serving as acting USAID administrator. \"America needs to be active, and we must lead through our example.\"",
      "What is USAID?",

      "USAID has more than 10,000 people in its workforce, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, and most of those employees \u2014 roughly two-thirds \u2014 are serving overseas. The agency has more than 60 country and regional missions.",
      "The agency is funded by taxpayer dollars authorized by Congress and reports to the secretary of state.",
      "According to an archived version of its website, USAID money has been used to provide nearly 9,000 ventilators to 43 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, fund more than 150 local organizations to implement interventions for HIV and to launch the Countering Chinese Influence Fund. USAID said the fund will invest $300 million in programs to advance national security goals across several areas \"to build more resilient partners that are able to withstand pressure from the [Chinese Community Party] and other malign actors.\"",
      "USAID was created at the height of the Cold War as part of a recognition by Kennedy and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, of humanitarian aid as a form of diplomacy. With the agency outlasting the Cold War and new threats to U.S. interests emerging, Democrats in Congress have warned that Mr. Trump's gutting of USAID threatens the nation's ability to compete with China and Russia.",
      "What is the USAID budget?",
      "In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",
      "Most of that funding went to governance programs, followed by the humanitarian and health sectors, according to the report. The countries that received the most money in fiscal year 2023 were Ukraine, Ethiopia and Jordan.",
      "While the health sector received the most funding in the early 1990s, humanitarian assistance became the highest-funded area in fiscal year 2022 because of increases in aid following \"natural and human-induced humanitarian crises,\" according to the Congressional Research Service. Governance took the top spot for fiscal year 2023, though, because of U.S. support for Ukraine's government amid the country's war with Russia.",
      "The money approved for USAID by Congress is spent through the agency's \"implementing partners,\" which include private contractors, nonprofit organizations, foreign governments and international groups.",
      "What is going on with USAID now?",
      "The agency has come under significant scrutiny by Musk and DOGE, which Mr. Trump has tasked with shrinking the size of the federal government.",
      "Musk has repeatedly criticized USAID on X, the social media platform he owns, calling it a \"criminal organization\" that should \"die.\" He said early Monday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump about USAID and claimed the president agrees \"we should shut it down.\"",
      "\"USAID is a ball of worms. There is no apple and when there is no apple, you've just got to basically get rid of the whole thing,\" Musk said, adding the agency is \"beyond repair.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters Saturday that the agency has \"been run by a bunch of radical lunatics.\"",
      "There has been a flurry of activity targeting USAID and its employees over the past few days. Roughly 60 senior staff were placed on administrative leave last week and hundreds of contractors had their employment furloughed or terminated, sources told CBS News.",
      "Then, on Saturday, USAID's website went dark, and two top security officials with the humanitarian aid agency were placed on administrative leave after they refused to let personnel from DOGE access classified information in restricted areas, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Katie Miller, who works for DOGE, said on X that \"no classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Matt Hopson, who was tapped by Mr. Trump to serve as USAID chief of staff, resigned Sunday, two staffers told CBS News. Agency staff were told USAID's headquarters in Washington, D.C., would be closed to them Monday, according to a notice they received.",
      "The turmoil at USAID is set against the backdrop of the Trump administration's 90-day freeze on foreign assistance, which has roiled programs worldwide and forced layoffs and furloughs. The order directed all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts to immediately issue \"stop-work\" orders for existing foreign assistance awards, pending review by the secretary.",
      "But the secretary of state later issued a waiver that applies to \"life-saving humanitarian assistance,\" defined as \"life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.\"",
      "What will happen to USAID?",
      "House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast, a Republican from Florida, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that USAID would likely be \"rolled more closely\" under Rubio. He lamented that a fraction of what the agency spends goes to aid.",
      "\"I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department\" and moving parts of it to the State Department, Mast said.",
      "A day later, three U.S. officials told CBS News that USAID would remain a humanitarian aid entity, but would be merged into the State Department with cuts to its funding and workforce. The Trump administration is expected to announce the changes in the coming days. Rubio has been named acting administrator of USAID, and he told Congress in a letter obtained by CBS News that he authorized Peter Marocco, director of Foreign Assistance at the State Department, to perform the duties of deputy administrator.",
      "The State Department said in a statement that Rubio has \"notified Congress that a review of USAID's foreign assistance activities is underway with an eye towards potential reorganization.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, former USAID Global Health director, told CBS News the move to target the agency is \"dangerous for the country.\"",
      "\"What we're talking about are disaster relief workers, we're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America around the world,\" Gawande said. \"You're talking about 20 million people in the\u00a0global HIV program\u00a0that has reduced HIV around the world, they are going without medication that keeps them alive. You're talking about disease outbreaks that are not being stopped,\u00a0like bird flu, where monitoring has been turned off in 49 countries.\"",
      "In a series of posts on X, Gawande said a pause on foreign assistance \"does serious damage to the world and the US.\" He also posted a list of examples on how this can impact global health, including stopping work on a deadly Marburg outbreak in Tanzania, a wide outbreak of a mpox variant killing children in west Africa and stopping critical work to eradicate polio.",
      "\"Make no mistake \u2014 these essential, lifesaving activities are being halted right now. Consequences aren't in some distant future. They are immediate,\" he concluded his thread.",
      "\"Every administration goes through an overhaul that says they want to change policy, they want to change some direction, but you don't decimate and demolish the institution in the process,\" Gawande told CBS News. \"There was no need to close down all of its functions, which is harming people.\"",
      "The Trump administration will not be the first to attempt to oversee a reorganization of USAID. A similar effort was made by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during the Clinton administration under a two-year plan that would keep USAID as a separate agency but bring it under the secretary of state's direct authority.",
      "In 1998, Congress passed the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, which established USAID as an independent agency and clarified that its administrator \"shall report to and be under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state.\"",
      "By the end of Bill Clinton's presidency, USAID's workforce had dropped from 11,500 employees to less than 8,000, and the number of countries with agency programs was cut from 120 to 70, according to the book \"State vs Defense: The Battle to Define America's Empire\" by journalist Stephen Glain.",

      "The institutions being probed are Columbia University; Northwestern University; Portland State University; the University of California, Berkeley; and the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.",
      "The Education Department said in a news release that investigations respond to the \"explosion of antisemitism on American campuses following the Hamas massacre of Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, 2023.\" It cited Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which protects individuals from discrimination based on national origin and applies to schools and institutions of higher learning that receive federal funding.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order last week calling for aggressive action against antisemitism on college campuses, vowing to prosecute offenders and revoke visas for international students found to be \"Hamas sympathizers.\" The order drew criticism from civil rights groups, who said the protests were mostly peaceful, included students of all backgrounds, including Jewish students, and that the president's directive violates the First Amendment.",
      "The department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Craig Trainor, accused the Biden administration of failing to hold institutions responsible for tolerating \"widespread antisemitic harassment and the illegal encampments that paralyzed campus life last year.\"",

      "At\u00a0Berkeley, as has been the case at a number of universities, protesters have demanded the university divest from Israel and an end to the war in Gaza.",
      "Tensions have remained high at Columbia University over the Israel-Hamas war and the school's response to protests on campus that have been taking place since early last year. At the end of last year's term, the NYPD disbanded an encampment on the quad and dozens of student protesters were arrested. Columbia would end up canceling its graduation ceremony.",
      "Presidents of Columbia and Northwestern were among those called to testify on Capitol Hill last year as Republicans sought accountability for allegations of antisemitism. Several university presidents, including\u00a0Columbia's Minoche Shafik, resigned amid criticism of their handling of the protests.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Chicago, Northwestern said it had taken several actions to address antisemitism on campus, including updating its student code of conduct and its disciplinary procedures.",
      "\"There is no place for antisemitism or any form of identity-based discrimination or hate at Northwestern University,\" the school said in its statement. \"Free expression and academic freedom are among our core values, but we have made clear that these values provide no excuse for behavior that threatens the well-being of others.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former USAID Global Health director  Dr. Atul Gawande criticized the Trump administration's plan to merge the United States Agency for International Development into the State Department and the funding freezes that are putting key aid programs in jeopardy. Asked about the changes, he said, \"It's not an overhaul. It's a destruction.\"",
      "Gawande, a surgeon, medical professor and best-selling author, told CBS News on Monday that the \"destruction\" began a week ago after the White House Office of Management and Budget released a memo that ordered a freeze on federal assistance. The memo was walked back days later and the ordered freeze has been halted by a federal court, but programs appear to still be halted or in limbo.",
      "\"You're talking about 20 million people in the global HIV program\u00a0that has reduced HIV around the world, they are going without medication that keeps them alive,\" Gawande said. \"You're talking about disease outbreaks that are not being stopped, like bird flu, where monitoring has been turned off in 49 countries.\"",
      "\"There is a great deal of harm being done, and this change to take away the independent status [of USAID] is just a nail in the coffin after a purge of personnel that has decimated the agency,\" Gawande said.",
      "Other former USAID workers expressed similar concerns.",
      "Maura Reap, who was a USAID contractor with the Bureau for Global Health until last week, had just arrived on a two-week assignment in Ethiopia when Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u00a0ordered a pause\u00a0on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID. During the first week of the assignment, Reap was supposed to be focused on designing a project supporting survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. Reap, whose expertise is in mental health, said the program had been planned for months.",
      "\"We had some meetings over the weekend, and there was just a lot of uncertainty,\" Reap said in an interview with CBS News. \"It was like a slow train wreck.\"",
      "Eventually, she got an email saying she had to return to Washington, D.C. While she was in the air, she and her two colleagues had received termination notices.",
      "\"This terrible waste of a [temporary duty travel] with all the planning and investment that had gone into it, and it was for nothing,\" she said.",

      "Gawande countered, \"What we're talking about are disaster relief workers, we're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America around the world.\"",
      "The Trump administration is expected to announce details in the coming days about the disruption to the USAID, a 60-year-old organization that provides humanitarian aid to more than 100 countries. The agency provides humanitarian assistance abroad, particularly to countries recovering from disaster and trying to escape poverty. In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",

Earlier Monday, the White House released a list of examples of what it deemed wasteful spending by USAID in recent years. Democratic lawmakers, however, have warned that any attempt to change USAID's structure and funding would require an act of Congress.",
      "Reap expressed dismay that \"somebody who's not even elected can come in and just take this 60-year-old institution that has accomplished so much ... and to have so much disregard and to take it and to turn it and to throw it on his back and to say, this is not \u2014 this is, we're throwing it out.\"",
      "Gawande said it's \"dangerous for the country to denigrate\" the agency, saying it's the country's \"largest civilian operational capacity for advancing\" the work of the U.S. abroad.",
      "\"We're talking about world-class expertise. For example, the malaria program. Two-thirds have been fired, and the activity shutdown includes one of the global experts in malaria for us. How does that make us safer? How does that make us stronger?\" Gawande said.",

      "\"Because, I mean, there's so many things related to the work we do,\" Reap said. \"Stopping outbreaks, reducing the push and pull factors for migration at our southern \u2014 at our borders. The work we do counters extremism, and it leads \u2014 it contributes to stable communities by the work we're doing by keeping people healthy so they can contribute to their communities.\"",

      "Wright, CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, has been one of the industry's loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change. He says more fossil fuel production can lift people out of poverty around the globe and has promised to help Mr. Trump \"unleash energy security and prosperity.\"",

      "The centerpiece of Mr. Trump's energy policy is \"drill, baby, drill,\" and he has pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats' \"green new scam\" in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "\"President Trump shares my passion for energy,\" Wright said at his confirmation hearing last month, promising that if confirmed, he would \"work tirelessly to implement [Mr. Trump's] bold agenda as an unabashed steward for all sources of affordable, reliable and secure American energy.\"",
      "That includes oil and natural gas, coal, nuclear power and hydropower, along with wind and solar power and geothermal energy, Wright said.",
      "Mr. Trump's energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits, including the fact that U.S. oil production is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits.",

The panel will include all executive branch agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, with a focus on \"cutting red tape\" and boosting domestic energy production, Mr. Trump said. The council's mission represents a near-complete reversal from actions pursued by former President Joe Biden, who made fighting climate change a top priority.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:40:48 -0500",
    "summary": "A group of nonprofits challenged the Trump administration's freeze on federal assistance.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to temporarily stop its freeze on federal assistance, allowing aid to continue flowing to nonprofit organizations and other entities after the funding was targeted by the White House budget office last week.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., formally granted the request from a coalition of nonprofits that had challenged the directive from the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB. She said the administration's actions \"run roughshod over a 'bulwark of the Constitution' by interfering with Congress's appropriation of funds.\"",
      "Issued nearly one week ago, the OMB memo directed all agencies to temporarily pause all federal assistance that may be implicated by certain executive orders issued by President Trump in his first days in office.",
      "While OMB acting Director Matthew Vaeth rescinded the memo after it led to widespread confusion as to which entities would be affected by the funding freeze, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the pause on federal assistance would remain in place and just the memo was being revoked.",
      "In a 30-page opinion granting the challengers' request to block the funding freeze, AliKhan wrote that a review of the programs that should or should not receive federal dollars \"could be conducted without depriving millions of Americans access to vital resources.\"",
      "She notes that the administration's memo potentially covered up to $3 trillion in financial assistance, a \"breathtakingly large sum of money to suspend practically overnight.\"",
      "\"Rather than taking a measured approach to identify purportedly wasteful spending, defendants cut the fuel supply to a vast, complicated, nationwide machine \u2014 seemingly without any consideration for the consequences of that decision,\" AliKhan, who was nominated for her current seat by former President Biden in 2023, wrote.",
      "The judge also cited Leavitt's statements, writing that \"OMB and the various agencies it communicates with appear committed to restricting federal funding.\"",
      "\"By rescinding the memorandum that announced the freeze, but 'NOT . . . the federal funding freeze; itself, it appears that OMB sought to overcome a judicially imposed obstacle without actually ceasing the challenged conduct. The court can think of few things more disingenuous,\" she wrote, quoting a social media post from the White House press secretary.",
      "The initial memo from Vaeth brought on legal challenges from the nonprofit groups in Washington and from 22 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia, which was filed in Rhode Island. The federal judge overseeing the states' case temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance Friday after concluding that OMB's actions were likely unlawful.",
      "AliKhan's decision came just before an earlier order that temporarily halted the freeze and maintained the status quo was set to expire at 5 p.m. Monday. She held a hearing earlier in the day to consider the request from the nonprofits to issue a temporary restraining order and suggested then that she would grant their motion.",
      "AliKhan had warned that the harm to groups that receive federal assistance could be \"catastrophic.\"",
      "The White House budget office's directive targeting federal assistance is one of several measures taken by the new Trump administration that have upended the federal government. Mr. Trump has pledged to shrink the federal workforce and spending and tapped billionaire Elon Musk to oversee those efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency, which the president established on his first day back in the White House.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration paused new funding for nearly all foreign aid and has targeted the U.S. Agency for International Development for a potential reorganization.",
      "The moves from the Trump administration pausing the flow of federal assistance have left organizations in the U.S. and abroad reeling. Domestically, groups that provide meals to the elderly and school-aged children, universities and small businesses were left scrambling to determine whether they would lose access to funding that has already been approved by Congress. Overseas, humanitarian and development groups that receive assistance from the State Department or USAID were forced to furlough workers.",

    "summary": "Trump may have distanced himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, but many of his policies align with those included in the initiative's policy guide.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Project 2025 became a major talking point for Democrats in making the case for why voters should deny President Trump a second term in the White House last year, Mr. Trump repeatedly distanced himself from the initiative spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, saying during the campaign that he had \"nothing to do with Project 2025,\" had not read it and didn't intend to read it.",
      "But as Mr. Trump has begun implementing aspects of his second-term agenda through a flurry of executive orders and directives, many of the plans he has rolled out so far closely align with those detailed in Project 2025's playbook, which lays out ways to overhaul the executive branch.",
      "Overseen by the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 was a multi-pronged initiative that was designed to provide a roadmap for the next Republican president, now Mr. Trump. On the campaign trail, the president called some of the proposals detailed in its more than 900-page book \"abysmal\" and said he knew nothing about it, though CBS News analysis showed many of its proposals\u00a0were similar to his own.",
      "The authors of some of the policy book's chapters served in his first administration and will be serving in his second. Russ Vought, Mr. Trump's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate soon, and John Ratcliffe is in place as CIA director.",
      "Paul Dans, who served as the director of Project 2025 but left his post in July, said of Mr. Trump's actions so far that they were a testament not only to the initiative's efforts, but also the readiness of the conservative movement in preparing for the next administration.",
      "\"They're home runs,\" he said of the president's plans. \"They are in many cases more than we could have even dared hope for.\"",
      "Some of Mr. Trump's actions taken in his first days in office reinstate measures he put in place during his first term that were revoked by President Biden. But in other instances, Mr. Trump's executive actions echo the policies outlined in the pages of Project 2025's policy blueprint.",
      "Redirecting federal aid under FEMA to the states",
      "After trips to western North Carolina and Southern California last week, Mr. Trump established a review council to advise him on the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, \"to capably and impartially address disasters occurring within the United States.\" The council will also advise the president on recommended changes related to FEMA, his order states.",
      "Western North Carolina was devastated by Hurricane Helene last fall, and parts of Southern California were destroyed by deadly wildfires that hit the area earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump's action comes after he suggested that he could \"get rid\" of FEMA and leave disaster response management to the states.",
      "\"That's what states are for, to take care of problems,\" he said last week.",
      "Project 2025's sweeping book of policy proposals calls for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\"",
      "It also urges Congress to change the cost-sharing arrangement so the federal government covers 25% of the costs for small disasters and up to 75% for \"truly catastrophic disasters.\" Currently, for Public Assistance, which provides financial and direct assistance to state and local governments for disaster response and recovery work, FEMA covers a minimum of 75% of costs, and the president can increase the federal cost-share at his discretion, according to a 2023 report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The recommendation follows a warning from Project 2025's authors that FEMA is \"overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.\" Additionally, it states that since passage of the Stafford Act in 1988, which gave the president powers to \"alleviate the suffering and damage\" caused by disasters, the number of declared federal disasters has risen drastically as costs were shifted from state and local governments to the federal government.",
      "Project 2025's book also calls on Congress to end preparedness grants for states and localities.",
      "\"DHS should not be in the business of handing out federal tax dollars: These grants should be terminated,\" it states.",
      "Ending diversity, equity and inclusion practices",
      "The president frequently rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices, and he signed an executive order on the day he returned to the White House ending all DEI programs within the federal government.",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in his order that DEI policies can violate federal civil rights laws and shut out Americans \"who deserve a shot at the American dream\" because of their race or sex.",
      "Project 2025's policy book calls for the next conservative president to delete a variety of terms, including DEI, abortion and gender equality \"from every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.\"",
      "It also calls for the \"DEI apparatus\" at a variety of agencies to be dismantled.",
      "Targeting PBS and National Public Radio",
      "Brendan Carr, head of the Federal Communications Commission, informed the heads of National Public Radio and PBS in a letter Thursday that the agency had opened an investigation into the airing of their programming across their roughly 1,500 broadcast member stations, according to the New York Times.",
      "Those stations are licensed by the FCC to operate, but are limited to operating as noncommercial educational broadcast stations. These stations, or NCEs, are exempt from licensing fees and operate on a specific \"reserved\" frequency band. Federal law prohibits these noncommercial educational broadcast stations from commercial advertisements.",
      "In his letter, Carr wrote that he is \"concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials. In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.\"",
      "Carr also said that he also does not see a reason for Congress to continue approving federal dollars for NPR and PBS \"given the changes in the media marketplace.\"",
      "Carr authored the section of Project 2025's policy book that deals with the FCC, but another portion of the blueprint urges Congress to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to NPR and PBS.",
      "According to Project 2025, \"stripping public funding would, of course, mean that NPR, PBS, Pacifica Radio, and the other leftist broadcasters would be shorn of the presumption that they act in the public interest and receive the privileges that often accompany so acting.\" The outlets should therefore no longer be qualified as noncommercial educational broadcast stations, according to the book.",
      "\"NPR and PBS stations are in reality no longer noncommercial, as they run ads in everything but name for their sponsors,\" the blueprint states. \"They are also noneducational. The next president should instruct the FCC to exclude the stations affiliated with PBS and NPR from the NCE denomination and the privileges that come with it.\"",
      "Whether Carr ultimately decides to take that step as a result of his investigation remains to be seen.",
      "Freezing federal assistance",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions as president was to establish the Department of Government Efficiency, an entity that is housed within the executive branch and run by billionaire Elon Musk. The body aims to cut regulations and spending and restructure federal agencies.",
      "On the heels of that move, the White House's Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, issued a two-page memo late Monday that ordered a freeze on grant, loan or federal assistance programs implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders, which would allow his administration \"time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the president's priorities.\"",
      "\"The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,\" OMB acting Director Matthew Vaeth said in the memo.",
      "The memo sparked widespread confusion and prompted concerns about whether programs providing meals for the elderly, pre-school funding for low-income children and medical research would be impacted by the order.",
      "On Wednesday, the White House said it was rescinding the memo but maintaining the funding pause \"to end any confusion\" created by a federal court order temporarily pausing implementation of the freeze.",
      "Mr. Trump's pick for director of OMB, Russ Vought, authored the section of Project 2025's policy book covering the Executive Office of the President, which includes the agency he has been tapped to lead.",
      "In it, he likens the budget office to an air-traffic control system for the president \"with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.\"",
      "The memo may be aimed at sparking a legal challenge to the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that limits the president's ability to unilaterally freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress, and in most cases requires the president instead to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation",
      "Vought said during his confirmation hearing last week that Mr. Trump believes the law is unconstitutional, and he agrees with that assessment.",
      "In Project 2025's policy blueprint, Vought also wrote the director of OMB must have \"sufficient visibility into the deep caverns of agency decision-making,\" and can achieve this by ensuring political appointees on his staff sign off on apportionments of funding authorized by Congress.",
      "Vought cited a 1870 law known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending federal dollars in advance and requires funding be doled out in installments.",
      "\"This process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars,\" he wrote. \"OMB can then direct on behalf of a president the amount, duration, and purpose of any apportioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency with the president's agenda and applicable laws.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's pick to lead OMB has advocated for the White House to take aggressive steps to cut federal spending. He wrote the director should not be afraid to wield apportionments \"on behalf of the president's agenda\" and be willing to \"defend the power against attacks from Congress.\"",
      "During Vought's first stint as OMB director, the agency withheld roughly $214 million in security assistance to Ukraine. The Government Accountability Office later found the budget office had violated the Impoundment Control Act when it withheld the aid, and the House launched impeachment proceedings that accused the president of conditioning the assistance to Ukraine on its president announcing investigations that would benefit him politically.",
      "Mr. Trump was impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate.",
      "Restricting gender-affirming care for minors",
      "Mr. Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday that bars the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care \u2014 puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures \u2014 for people under the age of 19.",
      "Called \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" the order directs certain executive agencies to take steps to ensure medical institutions that receive federal grants \"end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\"",
      "It also instructs the secretary of defense to take regulatory action to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from insurance coverage provided by TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and federal employee health benefit programs.",
      "Mr. Trump's order directs the head of the Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw March 2022 guidance on gender-affirming care.",
      "Project 2025's chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services calls for its Office of Civil Rights to \"remove all guidance issued under the Biden administration concerning sexual orientation and gender identity,\" including the March 2022 document.",
      "The book generally criticizes gender-affirming care as causing \"irreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them\" and argues there is a lack of evidence surrounding it.",
      "Revoking security clearances for the former intelligence officials who signed a letter on Hunter Biden's laptop",
      "Mr. Trump took executive action to start the process of revoking the security clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",
      "Project 2025 also proposed stripping former intelligence officials of security clearances, in a section on the intelligence community authored by Dustin Carmack, who worked at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "\"The president should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former directors, deputy directors, or other senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media without prior clearance from the current director,\" he wrote.",
      "Stripping civil servants of employment protections",
      "Among the slew of actions Mr. Trump took on his first day back in the White House was to reinstate an executive order issued during his first term that created \"Schedule F in the Excepted Service.\" The order creates a new employment category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of employment protections.",
      "The order states that in recent years, \"there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.\"",
      "\"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\" Mr. Trump's order reads.",
      "The order makes some minor changes to the president's prior measure from October 2020. But it notably adds a section that states that while employees in these new \"Schedule Policy/Career Positions,\" are not required to personally or politically support the current president or his policies, they are \"required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the president.\"",
      "Failure to do so is grounds for termination of employment, Mr. Trump's executive order states.",
      "Project 2025 repeatedly calls for Mr. Trump's Schedule F proposal to be reinstated.",
      "Reinstating service members who refused COVID-19 vaccines",
      "The president earlier this week issued an order directing the secretaries of Defense or Homeland Security to reinstate all service members, both active-duty and reserve, who were discharged after refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. (The vaccine requirement was lifted in 2023.) His order also states they should be reverted to their former rank and receive full back pay, benefits, bonus payments or compensation.",
      "The Project 2025 blueprint's section on the Defense Department, authored by Chris Miller, calls for the next administration to \"reinstate servicemembers to active duty who were discharged for not receiving the COVID vaccine, restore their appropriate rank, and provide back pay.\"",
      "Miller served as acting defense secretary in the final weeks of Mr. Trump's first term. His chief of staff, Kash Patel, has been tapped by the president to lead the FBI.",
      "Transgender military ban",
      "During his first four years in the White House, Mr. Trump prohibited transgender people from serving in the military. President Biden repealed that ban, but the president earlier this week issued an order that effectively bars transgender people from serving in the armed forces and withdraws his predecessor's order.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order states that \"expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",
      "Identifying as transgender, it continues, \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\"",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria,\" the president's order states. \"This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex.\"",
      "Project 2025 calls for a reversal of policies \"that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military. Gender dysphoria is incompatible with the demands of military service.\"",
      "A hiring freeze",
      "On his first day in the White House, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum freezing hiring of federal civilian employees. Positions that were vacant as of his inauguration at noon on Jan. 20 should also not be filled, he said.",
      "The order was part of his plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce, also a recommendation made in the Project 2025 policy roadmap.",
      "The book, though, warns that while \"reducing the number of federal employees seems an obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service,\" prior attempts to do by presidents of both parties \"did not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense federal employees.\"",
      "Instead, Project 2025 suggests a \"freeze on all top career-position hiring to prevent 'burrowing-in' by outgoing political appointees.\"",
      "Withdrawing from World Health Organization",
      "Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization in 2020 due to what his first administration said was a mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden reversed that decision when he took office, and Mr. Trump rolled back that move on his first day back in the White House.",
      "His latest order directed the secretary of state to inform the secretary-general of the United States and World Health Organization leadership of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the group.",
      "Project 2025, too, criticized the World Health Organization of its handling of the pandemic.",
      "\"The manifest failure and corruption of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the danger that international organizations pose to U.S. citizens and interests,\" its book states.",
      "It said that when institutions act contrary to U.S. interests, the government \"must be prepared to take appropriate steps in response, up to and including withdrawal.\"",
      "Sending active-duty troops to the southern border",
      "Immigration was the topic of several executive actions taken by Mr. Trump on the first day of his presidency, including one order that assigns troops \"the mission to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the United States.\"",
      "The chapter of Project 2025's blueprint that covers the Department of Homeland Security was authored by Ken Cuccinelli, who served in the first Trump administration, and it, too, sees a role for the Defense Department in securing the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The Pentagon, Cucinelli writes, should \"explicitly acknowledge and adjust personnel and priorities to participate actively in the defense, including using military personnel and hardware to prevent illegal crossings between ports of entry and channel all cross-border traffic to legal ports of entry.\"",
      "A section on the Justice Department urges the next administration to \"take a creative and aggressive approach\" to tackling criminal organizations at the southern border.",
      "\"This could include use of active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen to assist in arrest operations along the border \u2014 something that has not yet been done,\" Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department states.",
      "Limiting refugee admissions",
      "As of Monday, entry into the U.S. by refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program was suspended in accordance with an order by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20.",
      "His directive also orders the secretary of Homeland Security to suspend decisions on applications for refugee status.",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed that during the Biden administration, the U.S. has been \"inundated\" with high levels of migration, including through the Refugee Admissions Program.",
      "Project 2025, too, blames the Biden administration for overseeing what it says was a \"collapse\" of U.S. border security and immigration enforcement.",

      "The leader of Canada's most populous province of Ontario said Monday that he's ripping up a contract with Elon Musk's Starlink internet service in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Canada.",
      "A senior Canadian government official also said that Canada isn't confident that it can avoid the looming tariffs on Tuesday like Mexico did, because it feels like the goal posts shift more for Canada than Mexico. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, wasn't authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Monday that their planned tariffs were on hold for a month to give time for further negotiations. The statement was confirmed by the White House.",
      "Trump posted earlier on social media that he spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday morning and would speak with him again in the afternoon. Both Canada and Mexico had plans to levy their own tariffs in response to U.S. actions, but Mexico is holding off for the moment.",
      "Ban on American companies",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who said that he was also banning American companies from provincial contracts, signed a Canadian $100-million ($68 million) with Musk's company in November to deliver high-speed internet to remote residents in rural and northern Ontario.",
      "\"We'll be ripping up the province's contract with Starlink. Ontario won't do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy,\" Ford said.",
      "\"President Trump is the only person to be blamed. Maybe Elon Musk can call his buddy? This is one of the ramifications.\"",
      "Ford said that U.S.-based businesses would lose out on \"tens of billions of dollars\" in new revenue as a result of Ontario's response.",
      "\"We just aren't going to be using American companies,\" Ford said. \"And no matter if we are building a hospital, if we're building anything, if we're building a doghouse I want to make sure we are using Ontario steel, Canadian products, Canadian wood, Ontario wood, anything.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday took the first steps toward his administration creating a government-owned investment fund, tasking the heads of the Treasury Department and Commerce Department with beginning the process to create an American sovereign wealth fund.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order that charges Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee to lead the Commerce Department, with beginning a process \"that will hopefully result in the creation of an American sovereign wealth fund,\" announced Will Scharf, Mr. Trump's staff secretary.",
      "\"We're going to create a lot of wealth for the fund, and I think it's about time this country had a sovereign wealth fund,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office Monday, calling the news \"very exciting.\"",
      "The president said the U.S. may somehow put TikTok in the sovereign wealth fund. A law that took effect in January was meant to ban the app in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company sold it, but Mr. Trump has delayed enforcement of the law, keeping it alive for now.",
      "Bessent said the creation of the fund will \"monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people.\" He said the sovereign wealth fund will be up and running within 12 months, putting U.S. assets to work for Americans. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration will study best practices around the world to develop the fund.",
      "Sovereign wealth funds generally use a nation's reserves and invest the funds to generate returns, which can be used to address deficits, pay down debts or bolster savings. It's unclear what types of safeguards would be placed around a U.S.-owned investment fund to ensure it has transparent reporting obligations and that the investments aren't benefiting political allies.",
      "Other countries that have a sovereign wealth fund include China, Singapore, New Zealand, Norway and Saudi Arabia, among others.",
      "Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the Government Pension Fund of Norway, is the largest in the world, with assets valued at $1.7 trillion, a substantial figure for a country of 5.5 million people. The Norwegian government is only permitted to spend a small part of the fund each year, but the total amounts to nearly 20% of its annual budget.",

    "story": [
      "Following the deadly wildfires in Los Angeles in January, President Trump ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to release billions of gallons of water from two reservoirs in California's Central Valley, more than 100 miles away from the fire zones.",
      "Mr. Trump had claimed that California withheld water supplies that could have made a difference in fighting the flames. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other officials disputed those claims.",
      "Now, the water released from dams at Lake Kaweah and Lake Success is rushing into a dry lakebed in the Central Valley, where experts say it can't flow to Southern California and will likely go to waste.",
      "\"There is absolutely no connection between this water and the water needed for firefighting in L.A.,\" said Peter Gleick, a climate and hydrology expert. \"There's no physical connection. There's no way to move the water from where it is to the Los Angeles basin.\"",
      "Gleick, who co-founded the Pacific Institute, a research center in Oakland, says the move ignores the reality of water management in California.",
      "\"The farmers in the basin own the water and that water is stored in these dams in the winter, during the rainy season, so that farmers can use it in the very hot, long, dry summer season,\" he explained.",
      "From the perspective of the farmers, he said, the water is \"assumed to be lost.\"",
      "California Sen. Adam Schiff, a Democrat, said the release of the water also presented a risk of flooding.",
      "\"I think even the water managers got only a short bit of notice to say, 'Please don't. You can't do that. That's way too much water,'\" he said. \"And frankly, had they not talked the Army Corps off the ledge, there would've been serious flooding. It would have been an even bigger problem.\"",
      "Schiff criticized Mr. Trump's order as \"stupid and ridiculous and dangerous and wasteful.\"",
      "\"We're gonna need people to speak publicly about the harm this is doing,\" Schiff said. \"This is a waste of precious water. We just don't have the water to waste.\"",

      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published Monday in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",
      "As for the higher levels found in the brains of dementia patients, the researchers noted the study was not designed to prove whether that was the cause of symptoms \u2014 it may be the reverse, that the disease process allows more accumulation to happen.",

      "NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft returned 122 grams (4 ounces) of dust and pebbles from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, delivering the sample canister to the Utah desert in 2023 before swooping off after another space rock. It remains the biggest cosmic haul from beyond the moon. The two previous asteroid sample missions, by Japan, yielded considerably less material.",
      "Small amounts of Bennu's precious black grains \u2014 leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago \u2014 were doled out to the two separate research teams whose studies appeared in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. But it was more than enough to tease out the sodium-rich minerals and confirm the presence of amino acids, nitrogen in the form of ammonia and even parts of the genetic code.",
      "Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu \u2014 similar to what's in the dry lakebeds of California's Mojave Desert and Africa's Sahara \u2014 would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites.",
      "\"This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth,\" the Institute of Science Tokyo's Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.",
      "Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, \"that's really the pathway to life,\" said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural History's curator of meteorites. \"These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before.\"",
      "NASA's Daniel Glavin said one of the biggest surprises was the relatively high abundance of nitrogen, including ammonia. While all of the organic molecules found in the Bennu samples have been identified before in meteorites, Glavin said the ones from Bennu are valid \u2014 \"real extraterrestrial organic material formed in space and not a result of contamination from Earth.\"",
      "Bennu \u2014 a rubble pile just one-third of a mile (one-half of a kilometer) across \u2014 was originally part of a much larger asteroid that got clobbered by other space rocks. The latest results suggest this parent body had an extensive underground network of lakes or even oceans, and that the water evaporated away, leaving behind the salty clues.",
      "Sixty labs around the world are analyzing bits of Bennu as part of initial studies, said the University of Arizona's Dante Lauretta, the mission's chief scientist who took part in both studies.",
      "Most of the $1 billion mission's cache has been set aside for future analysis. Scientists stress more testing is needed to better understand the Bennu samples, as well as more asteroid and comet sample returns. China plans to launch an asteroid sample return mission this year.",

Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus also beckon as enticing water worlds.

    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore took a stroll outside the International Space Station on Thursday, marking their 239th day in orbit by carrying out a task originally planned for a spacewalk last summer. In the process, Williams became the world's most experienced female spacewalker, logging more than 62 hours outside the lab over nine excursions across multiple missions.",
      "Her latest outing began at 7:43 a.m. EST when she and Wilmore switched their spacesuits to battery power and headed out to retrieve a faulty S-band antenna assembly mounted on an external storage platform. Two earlier attempts to retrieve the unit were unsuccessful.",
      "The device wasn't designed for spacewalk retrieval and it took Williams and Wilmore longer than had been planned to get the job done. But thanks to improvisation and muscle power, the third time was the charm.",
      "\"The team has just been incredible,\" Williams radioed from the Quest airlock when the five-hour 26-minute EVA came to an end. \"I know we were not the first, we weren't even the second crew to do this, but somehow, with all of their great work, we were able to get it done.\"",
      "Added Wilmore: \"This is probably the most involved spacewalk that probably every discipline in the ISS program was sweating as much as Suni and I were. Fantastic job, coming up with the next plan, and the next plan, and the next plan. And it worked! So, outstanding.\"",
      "After the antenna retrieval, Wilmore collected swabs from nearby vents to help researchers determine if any microbial life from inside the station had managed to make it outside and survive in the space environment. A third task, prepping a spare robot arm joint for possible use if arm repairs are ever needed, was deferred to a future spacewalk.",
      "Going into Thursday's spacewalk, or EVA, Williams had logged 56 hours and 40 minutes outside the station during eight previous outings while Wilmore had chalked up 25 hours and 35 minutes of EVA time during four excursions.",
      "With her latest spacewalk, Williams moved past retired astronaut Peggy Whitson's mark of 60 hours and 21 minutes of spacewalk time to become the world's most experienced female spacewalker, moving up to number four overall.",
      "Stuck aboard the station since last June because of NASA concerns about the safety of their Starliner capsule, Williams and Wilmore are now planning to return to Earth around the end of March aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship that carried two other station fliers \u2014 Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 to the lab last September.",
      "That Crew Dragon was launched with two empty seats specifically to carry Williams and Wilmore back to Earth at the end of the Crew 9 mission, originally planned for late February. But an extra month was tacked on later to give SpaceX more time to complete pre-flight checks of the Crew 10 Dragon, which will be making its maiden flight.",
      "President Trump earlier this week blamed their long stay in space on the Biden administration and said that he'd asked SpaceX owner Elon Musk to bring Williams and Wilmore back home as soon as possible.",
      "But the astronauts are not stranded. Their ride home has been docked to the station since last September and could bring them back to Earth in short order if NASA so ordered.",
      "But that would cause major disruptions to U.S. research aboard the lab because only a single NASA astronaut \u2014 Don Pettit \u2014 would remain aboard the station with two Russian crewmates until the Crew 10 fliers arrive around the end of March.",

Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong.

From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",

Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts.

From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned.

I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

Facebook (which is now Meta) initially suspended and then announced in June 2021 that it would ban Mr. Trump from its platform for at least two years, after finding that his posts on Jan. 6 had stoked violence and posed a risk to public safety. Twitter, now named X and owned by Elon Musk, also barred Mr. Trump from its social media site for the same reason.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers and experts say China's DeepSeek AI app could expose U.S. users to risks and promote censorship.",
    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

      "Last week, Mr. Trump instructed his administration to dramatically expand detention space inside the naval base to detain as many as 30,000 \"high-priority\" unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. Since then, officials from across the government, including the Departments of Defense, State and Homeland Security, have scrambled to implement the president's directive.",
      "One of the U.S. officials said those sent to the naval base would be unauthorized immigrants arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the agency at the center of the president's vow to oversee the largest deportation effort in American history. The agency has ramped up immigration operations across the country under Mr. Trump, averaging between 800 and 1,000 daily arrests in the past week \u2014 up from the 312 average in former President Joe Biden's final year in office.",
      "Over the past several days, there has been an internal debate about whether the Pentagon or DHS would have legal and physical custody over the migrant detainees, and what sort of legal rights they would have.",
      "For decades, the Guantanamo base has included a facility, known as the Migrant Operations Center, where U.S. immigration officials have screened some asylum-seekers intercepted at sea. That area is separate from Guantanamo Bay's detention center, the post-9/11 military prison where the U.S. still holds more than a dozen terrorism suspects.",
      "A relatively small number of migrants are housed in barrack-like facilities while they undergo interviews with asylum officers. Asylum-seekers who passed those initial interviews have been referred for resettlement in third countries like Australia and Canada. The U.S. has long had a policy of not allowing those caught at sea to seek asylum in the U.S. in order to deter maritime migration.",
      "After Mr. Trump's recent directive, U.S. officials have been setting up tent facilities to hold migrants in Guantanamo Bay beyond the Migrant Operations Center.",
      "In the early 1990s, the Clinton administration held thousands of Haitian migrants inside the Guantanamo base, including in a notorious camp for those diagnosed with HIV, who were banned from entering the U.S. at the time.",
      "While visiting the southwest border on Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called Guantanamo Bay \"the perfect place\" to hold migrants and suggested using the maximum security prison to hold members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "\"It's the perfect place to provide for migrants who are traveling out of our country through gray tails or other assets, but also hardened criminals,\" Hegseth said, referring to military aircraft used to transport personnel. \"Where are you going to put Tren De Aragua before you send them all the way back? How about a maximum security prison at Guantanamo Bay, where we have the space.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard survived a crucial Senate Intelligence Committee vote on Tuesday after her nomination to be President Trump's director of national intelligence appeared to be in jeopardy.",
      "In a 9-8 vote, the Senate Intelligence Committee advanced Gabbard's nomination to the full Senate. The vote fell along party lines.",
      "Republicans on the panel who were seen as potential \"no\" votes began to drop their objections Monday, with Sen. Susan Collins of Maine saying that Gabbard had addressed her concerns and shared her vision of downsizing the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana announced Tuesday he would back Gabbard after he secured \"commitments that will advance our national security.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's choice to lead the intelligence community was seen as one of the most vulnerable nominees heading into her confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, when she was grilled on a number of controversial positions she has taken over the years. She faced skepticism from senators over her decision to meet with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017, her past push to pardon National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, her comments about Russia's war in Ukraine and her past opposition to renewing a key government surveillance authority, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.",
      "The most contentious moments of the hearing came as she was repeatedly pressed by Republican and Democratic senators on whether she would characterize Snowden as a \"traitor.\"",
      "Gabbard declined to directly answer the question, responding each time that \"Edward Snowden broke the law.\" She never said that he was a \"traitor\" and at one point seemed to defend his actions, telling the panel that he had exposed \"egregious illegal and unconstitutional programs\" that led to reforms. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Gabbard vowed to pardon Snowden, who leaked a trove of information on the U.S. government's top-secret mass surveillance programs. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and later Russia, where he lives in exile, after the leak.",
      "\"I do not agree with or support all of the information and intelligence that he released, nor the way in which he did it,\" Gabbard told senators.",
      "Gabbard also sought to alleviate concerns about her criticisms of FISA Section 702, which allows the U.S. to collect foreign communications without a warrant. U.S. officials say it's crucial to protecting national security because it helps disrupt terrorist attacks, cyberattacks and espionage activities. It does not allow U.S. citizens to be targeted, but their communications can be swept up when they are in contact with a targeted foreigner.",
      "Gabbard told senators during her confirmation hearing last week it was \"essential\" to national security, years after she tried to repeal the controversial law.",

      "The Department of Veterans Affairs manages a more than $350 billion budget and oversees nearly 200 medical centers and hospitals nationwide. It also manages national cemeteries and works closely with the Defense Department on personnel matters.",
      "Collins has promised to cut regulations across the department and elevate the quality of care for veterans.",

      "The Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., was granted ownership of the group's trademark in a Feb. 3 ruling from Judge Tanya M. Jones Bosier of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The decision also gives the Metropolitan AME Church a lien on the trademark and the power to block the Proud Boys from using the trademark or selling licensed goods, like T-shirts or hats, without the church's approval.",
      "Enrique Tarrio, the Proud Boys' leader, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement to the New York Times, which earlier reported the court ruling, and which Tarrio\u00a0posted on X, he said the judge should be impeached and the church's nonprofit status revoked.",
      "Tarrio, who had been serving a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy tied to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol building, was pardoned by President Trump after his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The ruling on the Proud Boys' copyright stems from an incident on Dec. 12, 2020, when members of the all-male right-wing group attended a \"stop the steal\" event in Washington, D.C., and also attacked the Metropolitan AME Church by climbing over a fence to get onto church property, where they destroyed a \"Black Lives Matters\" sign, according to court documents. A court ordered the Proud Boys to pay the church $2.8 million, money that the group has failed to pay, the documents note.",
      "As a result, the court gave the Metropolitan AME Church ownership of the trademark, giving them the right to deny use of the group's name and yellow or black laurel wreath symbol.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Finance Committee advanced Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination Tuesday, moving forward with his confirmation to lead the Department of Health and Human Services after a pair of fiery hearings last week that left his approval on shaky ground.",
      "The committee voted 14 to 13 to advance Kennedy in a party-line vote.",
      "Though the bulk of Republicans on the committee were expected to support advancing Kennedy's nomination, Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and medical doctor, expressed concern over the president's pick for HHS secretary during RFK Jr.'s confirmation hearings.",
      "Cassidy said last week that he had been \"struggling\" with Kennedy's nomination because he fears RFK Jr., who has raised doubts about vaccines in the past, could undermine faith in vaccines. Cassidy spoke to Kennedy on Sunday, according to a person familiar with their conversation, though the Louisiana senator did not disclose how he planned to vote following their conversation.",
      "But Cassidy, who is up for reelection in 2026, ultimately opted to support advancing Kennedy's nomination on Tuesday.",
      "Moments ahead of the vote, Cassidy announced that he would support Kennedy in a post on X, saying he had \"very intense conversations with Bobby and the White House over the weekend and even this morning,\" while thanking Vice President JD Vance for his \"honest counsel.\"",
      "\"With the serious commitments I've received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes,\" Cassidy said.",
      "Kennedy appeared before the finance committee for a confirmation hearing last week, before testifying to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions the following day. During both appearances, Democrats on the committees \u2014 and even some Republicans \u2014 grilled the longtime environmental lawyer and activist on his stances on vaccines, abortion, and other issues.",
      "President Trump's pick for HHS secretary has faced scrutiny from Democrats and Republicans, alike. Though Kennedy, 71, initially sought the Democratic presidential nomination and has close ties to the party as the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy, he dropped out of the presidential race to endorse Mr. Trump in August, and has long been the recipient of the Democratic establishment's ire.",
      "Amid the pushback, some had looked to possible support from Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent. But Sanders said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that he was \"not particularly happy\" with Kennedy's presentation before the Senate committees last week.",
      "Without support from Democrats on the committee, which has a one-member GOP advantage, Cassidy's opposition threatened to tank a favorable recommendation for advancing Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Meanwhile, two Democrats on the committee, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, raised alarm about possible conflicts of interest in recent days, penning a letter to Kennedy concerning his potential to profit from vaccine-related litigation. Paired with his long-held stances on vaccine safety, the senators said the possible conflicts give them \"grave concern\" about his ability to serve as HHS secretary.",
      "Kennedy has earned referral fees from a Los Angeles personal injury law firm, Wisner Baum, for years. The firm is currently suing Merck concerning warnings about the safety of the HPV vaccine. Kennedy agreed to divest his interests in the cases he has referred to Wisner Baum to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\" The senators noted in their letter that Kennedy in his written response to committee questions indicated he was divesting the interest to one of his adult sons \u2014 a detail which they called \"troubling.\"",
      "\"The arrangement outlined in your Ethics Agreement Amendment is plainly inadequate, as it would appear to allow an immediate family member to benefit financially from your position as Secretary,\" the senators wrote, adding that \"vaccine-related decisions\" that Kennedy could make as HHS secretary \"could result in significant financial compensation for your family.\"",
      "The Democrats also asked Kennedy to commit in writing to recuse himself from all vaccine-related communications and decisions and pledge not to litigate cases involving vaccines or have a financial interest in the cases for at least four years after leaving office. Kennedy said during Wednesday's hearing that he would \"comply with all the ethical guidelines.\"",
      "With the advancement out of committee, the fight over Kennedy's confirmation will move to the Senate floor, where his approval isn't guaranteed. Republicans can afford to lose just three votes to confirm him without support from across the aisle, with Vice President J.D. Vance serving as a tie-breaker.",
      "The developments come as Senate Republicans have pushed to quickly confirm Mr. Trump's nominees to his Cabinet and top administration posts, with appointees like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sailing to confirmation, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth eked by with a 51-50 vote on his confirmation.",
      "The president decried pushback from Democrats regarding his nominees in a post on Truth Social Sunday, saying \"no matter how good and well qualified someone is, they are taking maximum time for approval \u2014 and laughing about it.\"",
      "\"Republicans must GET TOUGH \u2014 AND MUST GET TOUGH VERY FAST,\" Trump said. \"We need our Nominees NOW, for the Safety and Good of our Country!\"",

      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs in 2020.",
      "The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies this year.",
      "Mounting threats",
      "Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect's caterpillars. The plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires, agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society.",
      "At a festival last September in Minneapolis meant to celebrate the monarch butterflies' migration before winter, some monarch enthusiasts noted that the insects' prevalence seemed to have dwindled compared with previous years, CBS News Minnesota reported.",
      "\"It seems like people are seeing fewer and fewer monarchs than they have in the past,\" Wendy Caldwell, the executive director of Monarch Joint Venture, a St. Paul-based nonprofit organization focused on monarch conservation, told the station.",
      "It's unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year may have slowed breeding.",
      "Monarchs are threatened by warming temperatures linked to climate change, Elise Zipkin, an associate professor at Michigan State University's environmental science and policy program, told CBS News Detroit last April. Zipkin noted that the insects \"need a very specific kind of temperature and precipitation conditions to develop from an egg all the way into a butterfly, and if those change during certain times of the years, they may not be able to survive quite as successfully or be able to reproduce as successfully.\"",
      "These butterflies suffer when the mercury gets up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit and any temperatures above 108 degrees Fahrenheit are lethal to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July that drove temperatures in some areas well past 100 degrees. Palm Springs, for example, hit a record 124 degrees Fahrenheit on July 5. Another heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple cities breaking heat records.",
      "Hopefully a wake-up call\"",
      "Pelton said that it's too early to tell what long-term impact the dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population. Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to 247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs.",
      "\"This is bad news,\" Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. \"But we have seen incredible recovery. this doesn't mean we're not going to have western monarchs. It's hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set them back pretty significantly.\"",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced\u00a0in December 2024 that it was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit anyone from killing, transporting them or making changes that would render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect 4,395 acres in seven coastal California counties that serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs, meaning federal agencies would be prohibited from destroying or modifying those habitats. Designating the sites as protected doesn't shield against development across the board, but landowners with federal licenses or permits to carry out projects in the area would need to coordinate with the wildlife service to reduce the risks of damage.",
      "\"The iconic monarch butterfly is cherished across North America, captivating children and adults throughout its fascinating life cycle,\" U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams said in a statement at the time. \"Despite its fragility, it is remarkably resilient, like many things in nature when we just give them a chance. Science shows that the monarch needs that chance, and this proposed listing invites and builds on unprecedented public participation in shaping monarch conservation efforts.\"",
      "A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened if officials decide to move forward.",
      "Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.",

      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published Monday in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's control of a federal payment system is raising concerns about funding for programs like Social Security and the safety of personal data.",
    "story": [
      "With Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gaining control of the Treasury Department's payment system, consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers are raising alarms about the group's access to the federal government's financial spigot, as well as sensitive data such as the Social Security numbers of most taxpayers.",
      "DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to reduce federal spending, now has access to a Treasury unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks and federal salaries, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Musk's access to the payment system is raising concerns as it comes just days after the White House ordered a broad freeze\u00a0on federal grants and loans, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. That same day, state Medicaid programs said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "While the White House later rescinded the memo and a judge halted the freeze, DOGE's control of the Treasury's payment system raises questions about the Trump administration's ability to halt the flow of federal funds for programs including Medicare and Social Security. It's also causing concerns about DOGE's access to the personal and financial information of most taxpayers.",
      "\"There's no community of Americans that this system does not touch, and so I think the concern is that access to this system including personally identifiable information has been ceded to the president's billionaire friend for reasons that are passing understanding,\" Donald K. Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There are \"quite real risks\" that DOGE \"could potentially undermine that system and threaten millions of Americans from getting payments that they are due,\" he added.",
      "Musk's access to the Treasury payment system has sparked concern from Democratic lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, while a lawsuit was filed on Monday alleging \"unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information\" to Musk and DOGE. The lawsuit, filed by two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, names U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Treasury as defendants.",
      "\"Controlling the system could allow the Trump Administration to 'unilaterally' \u2014 and illegally \u2014 cut off payments for millions of Americans, putting at risk the financial security of families and businesses based on political favoritism or the whims of Mr. Musk and those on his team who have worked their way inside,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a Feb. 2 letter to Bessent.",
      "She added, \"It could also give them access to millions of Americans' personal and financial information that is protected by law.\"",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?",
      "The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year.",
      "The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division.",
      "In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according\u00a0to\u00a0the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted.",
      "How did DOGE get control of the payment system?",
      "The executive\u00a0order\u00a0signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems.\" DOGE itself is not a federal department.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported.",
      "On Sunday, Musk\u00a0stated\u00a0that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees.",
      "Could this impact Social Security?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried.",
      "Musk and DOGE \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. \"Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits \u2014 or their personal data.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he's concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, \"whether intentional or unintentional.\"",
      "\"It appears that Musk's behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump's goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,\" he wrote.",
      "Does Musk have access to taxpayers' personal data?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients.",
      "Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn't respond to requests for comment but did\u00a0repost an Associated Press article on X\u00a0with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.",
      "\"Traditionally, access to this information has been highly restricted and among the most secure information the U.S. government holds,\" said James E. Lee, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"This is the kind of information that, if it found its way into the hands of a bad actor, could lead to a wide range of identity crimes \u2014 impersonation to open new accounts or access existing ones, theft of the funds in an existing banking account, applying for new state or federal government benefits, and filing false tax returns among other forms of identity fraud.\"",
      "The data is also sensitive because it could be useful to intelligence agencies in other nations, including the personal data of government employees or ties that businesses have with the U.S. government, Lee noted.",
      "That concern was echoed by Sen. Wyden, who in the Jan. 31 letter to Bessent questioned granting access to sensitive information to Musk due to significant business interests in China, noting that Tesla operates its largest factory in China. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "The FBI issued seeking information posters for two Iranian intelligence officers believed to be responsible for the 2007 abduction of Robert Levinson.",
    "story": [
      "Federal authorities have released a pair of seeking information posters for two Iranian intelligence officers accused of authorizing the 2007 abduction of retired FBI special agent Robert Levinson. The posters come as part of a decades-long investigation into Levinson's disappearance, the FBI's Washington field office said Tuesday, noting their \"commitment to resolving the case for his long-suffering family.\"",
      "Since Levinson vanished, the United States has maintained the view that he was abducted during an unauthorized CIA mission in Iran and held wrongfully by the Iranian government. The former agent was thought to be alive until U.S. officials said in 2020 that intelligence suggested he may have been dead for \"some time.\"",
      "The posters include images of Mohammad Baseri and Ahmad Khazai, the Iranian senior intelligence officers believed to be responsible for Levinson's abduction, subsequent detention and probable death. The men are described as high-ranking officers in Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security, according to the FBI.",
      "Levinson has not been seen or heard from since March 9, 2007, one day after the retired agent traveled to the Iranian island of Kish, according to the FBI. U.S. officials say Levinson's family received video and photographs of Levinson in anonymous emails several years later, in 2010 and 2011, which showed him in captivity. They ultimately released the footage and an image publicly but could not trace the emails back to their senders.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Baseri and Khazai under the Trump administration in 2020, the first time the country formally blamed Iran for Levinson's disappearance. At the time, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that Iranian officials \"authorized Levinson's abduction and detention and launched a disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the regime.\"",
      "His statement identified Baseri and Khazai by name.",
      "The U.S. has also accused Iran of sanctioning the scheme that resulted in Levinson's abduction and claimed its government knew the missing agent's location and lied about it for nearly 18 years.",
      "Federal officials claim Baseri has been involved in counterespionage activities within and outside of Iran, in addition to sensitive investigations related to Iranian national security, and \"has worked directly with intelligence officials from other countries to harm U.S. interests.\" Khazai has allegedly led Iranian intelligence and security delegations to other countries, the FBI said.",
      "The State Department is offering a reward of up to $20 million for information that leads to Levinson's recovery and return, while the FBI put forward a prize of up to $5 million for the same.",
      "\"The FBI remains steadfast in our commitment to return Bob to his family,\" said Sanjay Virmani, special agent in charge of the counterterrorism division at the FBI's Washington field office, in a statement.\u00a0\"Our extensive investigation continues to develop new leads and intelligence, and we will pursue all options to hold every Iranian official involved in his abduction accountable.\"",

    "summary": "Swedish police say about 10 people have been killed in a shooting at a school for adults in the city of Orebro, including the suspected gunman.",
    "story": [
      "Police in Sweden said Tuesday that \"about 10 people\" were killed in a shooting earlier in the day at a school for adults in the city of Orebro, west of Stockholm. The police offered\u00a0very little information on the incident throughout the most of the day, saying only that five people were wounded, including the suspected shooter, before suddenly confirming the initial death toll at about 6 p.m. local time (noon Eastern).",
      "The shooting occurred at the Campus Risbergska school, which, according to its website, is for students over the age of 20. The Reuters news agency said the adult education center is on campus that includes children's schools.",
      "Local police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters that the suspected shooter was among those who had died, but he stressed that the ongoing investigation was complicated and they were still working to identify the victims and confirm the death toll. The national police force said in a separate message that the \"total number of injured\" remained uncertain.",
      "Officials said the motive remained unknown, but at present, there were not believed to be any additional perpetrators. However, in a news statement later in the evening, police said they \"cannot rule out more perpetrators connected to the incident.\"",
      "Before the fatalities were confirmed Forest said the \"the investigation is somewhat unclear,\" according to The Associated Press, including \"whether the shooting took place inside the school (building) or whether there may be more perpetrators.\"",
      "\"One of the injured persons is a person whom we suspect may be the assailant,\" Forest said at a news conference with medical officials, as the massive police operation continued more than three hours after the attack. \"We can't rule out other suspects, and that's something we are continuing to work on in this intensive phase now \u2014 why it happened and if there are other possible suspects.\"",
      "Medical officials said four of five wounded people had undergone surgery, including one whose injuries were serious. The AP cited a regional medical director as saying two others were in stable condition and a third was only slightly wounded. No police officers were shot, the force confirmed.",

      "\"A major operation is currently underway at a school in V\u00e4sthaga, Orebro,\" the police said in an earlier statement posted online, urging members of the public \"to stay away from the V\u00e4sthaga area\" or, if not possible, to remain inside their homes.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 09:52:32 -0500",
    "summary": "After meeting Secretary of State Marco Rubio, El Salvador's president has offered to house U.S. deportees and even American inmates in his country's \"mega-prison.\"",
    "story": [
      "San Salvador, El Salvador \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late Monday that El Salvador's president has offered to accept and incarcerate deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including criminals with American citizenship currently imprisoned in the U.S. President Nayib Bukele confirmed the offer in a social media post, saying El Salvador was willing to rehouse deportees and American prisoners in a two-year-old \"mega-prison\" he had built as potent symbol of his crackdown on criminal gangs.",
      "Bukele \"has agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,\" Rubio said after meeting the Salvadoran leader at his lakeside country house outside San Salvador for several hours.",
      "\"We can send them and he will put them in his jails,\" Rubio said of migrants of all nationalities detained in the United States. \"He's also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they're U.S. citizens or legal residents.\"",
      "Bukele confirmed the offer in a post on X, saying El Salvador has \"offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system.\"",
      "He said his country would accept only \"only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee\" that he said \"would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.\"",
      "Elon Musk, the billionaire working with Mr. Trump to remake the federal government, responded on his X platform, \"Great idea!!\"",
      "After Rubio spoke, a U.S. official said the Trump administration had no current plans to try to deport American citizens, but said Bukele's offer was significant. The U.S. government cannot deport American citizens, and such a move would be met with significant legal challenges.",
      "CBS News reported\u00a0last month that El Salvador had agreed to accept U.S. deportations of \"criminal illegal migrants from any country,\" including members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Rubio was visiting El Salvador to press a friendly government to do more to meet President Trump's demands for a major crackdown on\u00a0immigration.",
      "The State Department describes El Salvador's overcrowded prisons as \"harsh and dangerous.\" On its current country information webpage it says, \"In many facilities, provisions for sanitation, potable water, ventilation, temperature control and lighting are inadequate or nonexistent.\"",
      "Unlike many of the country's prisons, however, the massive facility known as CECOT that Bukele referred to after his talks with Rubio remains more than half-empty, according to the French news agency AFP, with capacity for 40,000 inmates but only about 15,000 currently estimated to be incarcerated there.",
      "Formally called the Terrorism Confinement Center, CECOT is surrounded by high concrete walls and it sits on the edge of a jungle about 45 miles southeast of San Salvador. According to AFP, inmates at the prison are only permitted to leave their cells for court hearings, which are conducted via video link, or for 30 minutes of daily exercise in an enclosed hall.",
      "Rubio arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight with 43 migrants leave from Panama for Colombia. That came a day after Rubio delivered a warning to Panama that unless the government moved immediately to eliminate China's presence at the Panama Canal, the U.S. would act to do so.",
      "Migration, though, was the main issue of the day, as it will be for the next stops on Rubio's five-nation Central American tour of Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic after Panama and El Salvador. His tour is taking place at a time of turmoil in Washington over the status of the government's main foreign development agency.",
      "The Trump administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States and has worked with regional countries to boost immigration enforcement on their borders as well as to accept deportees from the United States.",
      "The agreement Rubio described for El Salvador to accept foreign nationals arrested in the United States for violating U.S. immigration laws is known as a \"safe third country\" agreement. Officials have suggested this might be an option for Venezuelan gang members convicted of crimes in the United States should Venezuela refuse to accept them, but Rubio said Bukele's offer was for detainees of any nationality.",
      "Human rights activists have warned that El Salvador lacks a consistent policy for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees and that such an agreement might not be limited to violent criminals.",
      "Manuel Flores, the secretary general of the leftist opposition party Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, criticized the \"safe third country\" plan, saying it would signal that the region is Washington's \"backyard to dump the garbage.\"",
      "After meeting with Bukele, Rubio signed a memorandum of understanding with his Salvadoran counterpart to advance U.S.-El Salvador civil nuclear cooperation. The document could lead to a more formal deal on cooperation in nuclear power and medicine that the U.S. has with numerous countries.",
      "The deportation flight Rubio watched being loaded in Panama City was carrying migrants detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department says such deportations send a message of deterrence. The U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets since an agreement was signed to fund them.",
      "Rubio was on the tarmac for the departure of the flight, which was taking 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia. It's unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation, especially in front of cameras.",
      "\"Mass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,\" Rubio said, speaking afterward in a nearby building. \"It impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it's not good for anyone.\"",
      "Monday's deportation flight came as Mr. Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals from the United States, and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States.",
      "His trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting, but details of those were not immediately available.",
      "While Rubio was out of the country, staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed Monday to stay out of the agency's Washington headquarters after Musk announced Mr. Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.",
      "Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs shut down. Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.",
      "The change means that USAID is no longer an independent government agency as it had been for decades - although its new status will likely be challenged in court - and will be run out of the State Department by department officials.",
      "In his remarks, Rubio stressed that some and perhaps many USAID programs would continue in the new configuration but that the switch was necessary because the agency had become unaccountable to the executive branch and Congress.",
      "On his weekend discussion with Panama's president on the Panama Canal, Rubio said he was hopeful that the Panamanians would heed his and Mr. Trump's warnings on China. Panamanians have bristled at Mr. Trump's insistence on retaking control of the American-built canal, which the U.S. turned over in 1999, although they have agreed to pull out of a Chinese infrastructure and development initiative.",
      "\"I understand that it's a delicate issue in Panama,\" Rubio told reporters in San Salvador. \"We don't want to have a hostile and negative relationship with Panama,\" he said. \"I don't believe we do. And we had a frank and respectful conversation, and I hope it'll yield fruits and result in the days to come.\"",
      "But back in Washington, Mr. Trump was less diplomatic, saying: \"China's involved with the Panama Canal. They won't be for long and that's the way it has to be.\"",
      "\"We either want it back, or we're going to get something very strong, or we're going to take it back,\" he told reporters at the White House. \"And China will be dealt with.\"",

      "China said Tuesday it would counter President Trump's tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs of its own on multiple U.S. imports. It also announced an antitrust investigation into Google and other trade measures aimed at the U.S., ratcheting up trade tensions between the two economic heavyweights.",
      "U.S. tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico were also set to go into effect Tuesday but Mr. Trump paused his plans to\u00a0implement them\u00a0for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. He planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "China said Tuesday it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday.",
      "\"The U.S.'s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\" the statement from a Ministry of Finance office said. \"It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing said it would file a complaint with the WTO over the \"malicious\" levies, Agence France-Presse reports.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with its top suppliers being Australia, Qatar and Malaysia. The U.S., which is the biggest exporter of LNG globally, does not significantly export LNG to China.",
      "In addition, China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws. The announcement didn't mention the tariffs but came just minutes after Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs on China were to take effect.",
      "It's unclear how the probe will affect Google's operations. Google has a limited presence in China, and its search engine is blocked in the country like most other Western platforms. Google exited the Chinese market in 2010 after refusing to comply with censorship requests from the Chinese government and following a series of cyberattacks on the company.",

      "In addition to the tariffs and Google probe, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they're essential to U.S. economic or national security and have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium, which is used in manufacturing.",
      "The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.",
      "Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over \"improper Xinjiang-related behavior\" after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton.",
      "Possible ramifications",
      "Analysts said China's retaliatory measures would not only cause adverse effects on the U.S. economy but would impact the rest of the world.",
      "This isn't the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind.",
      "This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter.",
      "\"They have a much more developed export control regime. We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others.

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 08:03:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Citing an expert review of the prosecution's arguments, a lawyer for nurse Lucy Letby says there's \"overwhelming evidence\" she was wrongly convicted of murder.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 A panel of experts has disputed the medical evidence used to convict British nurse Lucy Letby of murdering seven newborns and trying to kill seven others, a doctor who led the examination said Tuesday. Dr. Shoo Lee, a retired neonatologist from Canada, said the group of 14 doctors concluded the newborns either died of natural causes or from bad medical care.",
      "\"In summary then, ladies and gentlemen, we did not find murders,\" Lee said at a London news conference.",
      "Letby, 35, is serving multiple life sentences with no chance of release after being convicted of murder and attempted murder while working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England between June 2015 and June 2016.",
      "Defense lawyer Mark McDonald said there was now \"overwhelming evidence\" that Letby was wrongly convicted.",
      "It was the second news conference held in part by McDonald to challenge the conclusions of Dr. Dewi Evans, who was the prosecution's key expert witness.",
      "Prosecutors said Letby left little trace when she killed babies and in some cases had injected air into their bloodstreams or stomach, causing an embolism. But Lee said Evans had misinterpreted his 1989 academic paper on embolism.",
      "Lee said he assembled a prestigious group of international medical experts who volunteered to review the records of 17 babies Letby was accused of injuring or killing.",
      "Evans diagnosed the babies with air embolism in the absence of finding another cause of death, Lee said. But Lee said embolism is very rare and the skin discoloration described at trial was not consistent with what is seen when there is an embolism.",
      "\"The notion that these babies can be diagnosed with air embolism because they collapsed and had these skin discolorations has no evidence in fact,\" Lee said.",
      "Letby has already lost two bids for an appeal. Her lawyer submitted an application on Monday to get the Criminal Case Review Commission to examine her conviction, which could lead to another shot at an appeal.",
      "A separate public inquiry into failures at the hospital that led babies to repeatedly be harmed is due to conclude next month. That probe is not examining evidence used to convict Letby but is aimed at accountability of hospital staff and management and looking at how parents were treated.",
      "During her trial, Senior Prosecutor Nicola Wyn Williams alleged that Letby had removed one baby's breathing support and that a doctor found her standing by doing nothing as the child struggled,",

      "Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze defended the actions of his government, accusing the protesters of seeking \"to inflict harm on the state\" and trying to stage a revolution akin to the uprising in Ukraine in 2014 that ousted a pro-Kremlin leader.",
      "Georgian Dream last year adopted a series of laws similar to ones in Russia imposing restrictions on rights groups and media outlets and severely curtailing LGBTQ+ rights. Those laws, condemned by the EU, also drew protests.",
      "Georgia's former President,\u00a0Salome Zurabishvili, an independent politician, was among the most vocal critics of Georgian Dream, accusing it of election interference and calling the elections last year a \"total fraud.\" According to the Reuters news agency, two international polling groups based in the U.S. agreed with that assessment, calling the results statistically impossible.",
      "On Dec. 3, 2024, however Georgia's Constitutional Court rejected Zurabishvili's call to annul the parliamentary election results, exacerbating the tension on the streets.

      "\"This is not just a matter of freedom and imprisonment \u2014 this is a matter of life and death. And I very much hope that the authorities will act with the necessary speed in this extremely difficult situation,\" O'Flaherty was quoted by the outlet as saying.",

      "More than 80 years after a Brazilian warship was sunk by a German submarine during World War II, the vessel's location has finally been confirmed, Brazil's navy has revealed. The historic vessel was positively identified over a decade after a fisherman's net became ensnared on the shipwreck, without him realizing what the obstacle was.",
      "On the night of July 19, 1944, the \"Vital de Oliveira\" was torpedoed by a Nazi German sub. It was the only Brazilian military ship to be sunk by enemy forces during World War II, the navy said in a news release. About 100 of the ship's crew of approximately 270 were killed.",
      "The ship had mainly been used to transport soldiers and supplies along the coast, and according to Brazil's O Globo newspaper, the crew included teenagers who worked as cabin boys.",
      "The site of the wreck was initially found in 2011 by a pair of brothers after a fisherman's net got stuck at the bottom of the sea, the navy said. Ultimately, a deep-sea diver named Domingos Afonso J\u00f3rio discovered that the net was stuck on a cannon, and he reported the wreck site to the navy. But officials could not confirm any shipwreck at the time.",
      "The navy said Friday that the location of the hull of the sunken ship was finally confirmed last month, about 40 miles off the coast of Rio de Janeiro.\u00a0 The discovery was confirmed during a survey by an oceanographic research vessel, also called \"Vital de Oliveira.\"",
      "Archaeologists used sophisticated equipment to gather data about the position and condition of the vessel, the navy said. A multibeam echo sounder was used to create 3-D models of the ocean floor, and a side scan sonar generated high-resolution acoustic images of the wreck.",
      "\"The equipment used allowed us to obtain unprecedented images of the hull,\" the navy said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Former USAID Global Health director  Dr. Atul Gawande criticized the Trump administration's plan to merge the United States Agency for International Development into the State Department and the funding freezes that are putting key aid programs in jeopardy. Asked about the changes, he said, \"It's not an overhaul. It's a destruction.\"",
      "Gawande, a surgeon, medical professor and best-selling author, told CBS News on Monday that the \"destruction\" began a week ago after the White House Office of Management and Budget released a memo that ordered a freeze on federal assistance. The memo was walked back days later and the ordered freeze has been halted by a federal court, but programs appear to still be halted or in limbo.",
      "\"You're talking about 20 million people in the global HIV program\u00a0that has reduced HIV around the world, they are going without medication that keeps them alive,\" Gawande said. \"You're talking about disease outbreaks that are not being stopped, like bird flu, where monitoring has been turned off in 49 countries.\"",
      "\"There is a great deal of harm being done, and this change to take away the independent status [of USAID] is just a nail in the coffin after a purge of personnel that has decimated the agency,\" Gawande said.",
      "Other former USAID workers expressed similar concerns.",
      "Maura Reap, who was a USAID contractor with the Bureau for Global Health until last week, had just arrived on a two-week assignment in Ethiopia when Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u00a0ordered a pause\u00a0on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID. During the first week of the assignment, Reap was supposed to be focused on designing a project supporting survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. Reap, whose expertise is in mental health, said the program had been planned for months.",
      "\"We had some meetings over the weekend, and there was just a lot of uncertainty,\" Reap said in an interview with CBS News. \"It was like a slow train wreck.\"",
      "Eventually, she got an email saying she had to return to Washington, D.C. While she was in the air, she and her two colleagues had received termination notices.",
      "\"This terrible waste of a [temporary duty travel] with all the planning and investment that had gone into it, and it was for nothing,\" she said.",
      "Gawande also hit back at Mr. Trump and\u00a0billionaire Elon Musk's comments, who have both slammed the agency, with Mr. Trump recently saying the USAID is \"run by a bunch of radical lunatics.\" Musk said the agency \"is not an apple with a worm in it, what we have actually, just a ball of worms.\"",
      "Gawande countered, \"What we're talking about are disaster relief workers, we're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America around the world.\"",
      "The Trump administration is expected to announce details in the coming days about the disruption to the USAID, a 60-year-old organization that provides humanitarian aid to more than 100 countries. The agency provides humanitarian assistance abroad, particularly to countries recovering from disaster and trying to escape poverty. In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",
      "Mr. Trump has vowed to cut the size of the federal government, and USAID has been a recent target of his and Musk's, who is tasked with leading the newly created\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Earlier Monday, the White House released a list of examples of what it deemed wasteful spending by USAID in recent years. Democratic lawmakers, however, have warned that any attempt to change USAID's structure and funding would require an act of Congress.",
      "Reap expressed dismay that \"somebody who's not even elected can come in and just take this 60-year-old institution that has accomplished so much ... and to have so much disregard and to take it and to turn it and to throw it on his back and to say, this is not \u2014 this is, we're throwing it out.\"",
      "Gawande said it's \"dangerous for the country to denigrate\" the agency, saying it's the country's \"largest civilian operational capacity for advancing\" the work of the U.S. abroad.",
      "\"We're talking about world-class expertise. For example, the malaria program. Two-thirds have been fired, and the activity shutdown includes one of the global experts in malaria for us. How does that make us safer? How does that make us stronger?\" Gawande said.",
      "Reap also argued that the work USAID does saves lives and supports policies that benefit the United States.",
      "\"Because, I mean, there's so many things related to the work we do,\" Reap said. \"Stopping outbreaks, reducing the push and pull factors for migration at our southern \u2014 at our borders. The work we do counters extremism, and it leads \u2014 it contributes to stable communities by the work we're doing by keeping people healthy so they can contribute to their communities.\"",
      "Gawande noted, \"Every administration goes through an overhaul that says they want to change policy, they want to change some direction, but you don't decimate and demolish the institution in the process. There was no need to close down all of its functions, which is harming people.\"",

      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014 Almost 96% of new cars registered in Norway in January were electric, an unparalleled proportion in the world and close to the country's goal of selling only zero-emission vehicles as of this year. A total of 9,343 new cars were sold in January, of which 8,954 were all-electric, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said.",
      "Of the 50 most-sold models, only two were non-electric, the first of which came in 33rd place, the OFV said.",
      "By comparison, the share of electric cars sold in Europe was just 13.6% in the full-year 2024 \u2014 a decline for the first time since 2020, according to the car manufacturers' lobby ACEA. Even that far out-paces EV sales in the U.S., where, according to MotorTrend data from last year, only about 6% of new vehicles sold were electric.",
      "With President Trump now in office after vows to reduce incentives on EV sales brought in under his predecessor, a continued downward trend in U.S. uptake is entirely possible.",
      "\"We've never seen this before... If the rest of the year continues like this, we will very soon be close to the 2025 goal,\" OFV director Oyvind Solberg Thorsen said in a statement. \"But if we want to cross the finish line with 100 percent electric cars, it will be necessary to maintain the incentives that make it profitable to choose an electric car over other models.\"",
      "Despite being a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\" starting in 2025, which is 10 years ahead of the goal set by the European Union, of which Norway is not a member.",

      "\"Another reason was of course the benefits that come with them,\" he said, describing himself as a \"climate enthusiast.\"",
      "In his upscale neighborhood of Baerum in suburban Oslo, the streets are full of Teslas, Audis and Volkswagens. Competitively priced Chinese brands are increasingly appearing too.",

      "That was a precondition for Hvattum, who, like many Norwegians, travels frequently by car to his chalet in the mountains several hours from Oslo.",
      "\"It's less complicated now that the network is so well-developed. You don't have to plan your trip as much as before,\" he said, adding that he uses the 15-20 minute charging breaks needed to make it up to the mountains to shop for food.",
      "Even if EV sales fail to meet the 100% mark this year, experts say that Norway can be seen as having met its goal.",
      "\"We should finish the year at between 95 and 100%, and probably even in the high end of this range,\" Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, told AFP.",
      "A new tax increase on internal combustion cars and rechargeable hybrids \u2014 which are cleaner but still run partially on gas or diesel \u2014 on April 1 should help.",

Many booed the U.S. national anthem in an uncharacteristic show of frustration after more than 150 years of peaceful, friendly relations along the vast border separating the neighbors.",
      "The reaction was representative of hurt feelings both north and south of the U.S. mainland's borders on Monday. Top officials in Canada and Mexico, which both faced 25% tariffs\u00a0with the stroke of Mr. Trump's pen on Saturday, were expected to hold conversations with the White House on the way forward in a new trade war that Mr. Trump had threatened for months. Both countries vowed to respond with their own trade measures.",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum announced in a brief statement Monday on social media that, after a phone call with Mr. Trump, the tariffs imposed on her country were \"on pause for one month from now.\" She said Mr. Trump had agreed to put the measures on hold after she committed to reinforcing Mexico's border with the U.S. \"with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed the pause in his own social media post, saying the newly deployed Mexican forces \"will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said Mr. Trump had \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.\"",
      "China was also hit by a new raft of tariffs and has warned that it, too, will respond in kind. America's major allies and trade partners in Europe, meanwhile, have been warned by Mr. Trump that the European Union is next on his list, while the United Kingdom appears to have a chance to negotiate a trade deal, but will find itself torn between its next-door neighbors and its storied \"special relationship\" with the U.S. if it hopes to dodge the same fate.",
      "Canada is the biggest export market for products coming from 36 U.S. states, according to the Reuters news agency, while Mexico is broadly considered the U.S.' largest trading partner overall.",
      "Below is a look at some of the reaction from the countries now facing new U.S. tariffs, which will come into effect on Tuesday, and those which might still be hoping to avoid them.",
      "Canada:",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government had no choice but to strike back with 25% tariffs of its own on more than $150 billion worth of U.S.-made imports.",
      "\"First, I want to speak directly to Americans, our closest friends and neighbors,\" said Trudeau. \"This is a choice that, yes, will harm Canadians, but beyond that, it will have real consequences for you, the American people.\"",
      "\"Like the American tariffs, our response will also be far reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine and bourbon. Fruits and fruit juices including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes. It will include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.\"",
      "\"Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,\" Trudeau added to his own constituents in a post on social media. \"Check the labels. Let's do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.\"",
      "The first round of Canada's tariffs will kick in at the stroke of midnight on Monday evening \u2013 on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods. In 21 days, the remainder of the tariffs, covering an additional $125 billion worth of products, will kick in unless some new agreement is reached between the countries. The delay, said Trudeau, was aimed at giving Canadian companies time to seek supply chain options to soften the financial blow.",
      "Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman said many people in her country \"just don't understand where this is coming from... and probably, there's a little bit of hurt.\"",
      "Mexico:",
      "Canada's government is now looking south of the U.S. border, hoping to band together and increase trade ties with Mexico to help both nations absorb the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. The two countries have agreed \"to enhance the strong bilateral relations\" they share and officials have had extensive bilateral meetings with their counterparts.",
      "President Sheinbaum, who haD already mocked Mr.Trump's move to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, said on social media before the pause was announced that countermeasures against the U.S. tariffs would soon be implemented.",
      "\"I've instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we've been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,\" Sheinbaum said, without specifying which U.S. goods her government might target, or whether she would seek to match the 25% retaliatory tariffs set to be imposed by Canada.",
      "Mexican goods exported to the U.S. are wide-ranging, and include vehicles and other auto industry components, crude oil, natural gas, avocados, tomatoes, pork and cheese.",
      "China:",
      "For Beijing, it was deja-vu. During Mr. Trump's first term, he slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, then 10% on an additional $300 billion worth of imports, which meant virtually everything Chinese was tariffed.",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement over the weekend saying Beijing was \"strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes\" the new 10% tariffs, that the U.S.'s \"unilateral increase in tariffs seriously violates WTO rules,\" and that China \"will file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and take corresponding countermeasures,\" which implies Beijing will impose 10% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S.-made goods.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "In a Sunday statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't drop any hints as to what measures might be coming, but it said called \"on the United States to correct its wrongdoings, maintain the hard-won positive dynamics in the counternarcotics cooperation, and promote a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship.\"",
      "The ministry said the U.S. should \"view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way,\" rather than \"threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was imposing the new 10% tariff on Chinese goods in part due to what he considers Beijing's failure to stem the flow of fentanyl and chemicals used to make the drug.",
      "The foreign ministry in Beijing said China was \"one of the world's toughest countries on counternarcotics, both in terms of policy and its implementation.\"",
      "The European Union:",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend that tariffs on the European Union were coming, but he did not say when or how steep they would be.",
      "\"It will definitely happen with the European Union. I can tell you that because they've really taken advantage of us,\" the U.S. president told reporters Sunday. \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them.\"",
      "European leaders were meeting Monday in Brussels, where they were discussing how to collectively address the threat.",
      "\"We were listening carefully to those words, and of course we are preparing also on our side,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday in Brussels, adding a warning that \"there are no winners in trade wars.\"",
      "If the Trump administration \"starts a trade war [with Europe], then the one laughing on the side is China,\" said Kallas. \"We are very interlinked.\"",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino Sunday amid his first overseas trip, as the Trump administration makes a push for control of the Panama Canal.",
      "Rubio, the first Latino secretary of state, made the trip in part to reiterate President Trump's concern that China has too much influence over the Panama Canal, and needs control of the waterway for economic security, though Mulino has refuted the claim. Rubio toured the canal on Sunday and doubled down on the administration's plan to make immediate changes, according to his office spokesperson, Tammy Bruce.",
      "\"Secretary Rubio also emphasized the importance of collaborative efforts to end the hemisphere's illegal migration crisis and thanked President Mulino for his support of a joint repatriation program, which has reduced illegal migration through the Darien Gap,\" Bruce said in a statement.",
      "Speaking at the U.S. embassy, the secretary of state said that Panama is very important to the U.S. and thanked all the staff that serve the embassy.",
      "The Panama Canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. And although the U.S. led the construction of the major waterway that around 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic now moves through, its control was given to Panama in 1999.",
      "In the meeting, Rubio told the Panamanian leader that Mr. Trump has determined that China's influence on the Panama Canal is \"a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which come after months of threatening to do so as he seeks to leverage trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged Sunday that there may be \"some pain\" with the tariffs in a social media post. But he argued that \"it will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "The tariffs come in part to curb the flow of undocumented immigrants, as well as illicit drugs, into the U.S. And Rubio's first overseas visit to Central America and the Caribbean, of which Panama is the initial stop, also comes as the Trump administration seeks cooperation on its immigration policy from nearby countries, like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, criticized the president's move on Sunday, saying in an appearance on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the tariffs are \"going to end up costing consumers,\" with increased prices on goods from avocados and beer to cars and trucks.",

Even some GOP lawmakers have shown support for retaining women's access to the pill, which is much more widely available today than it was just a few years ago.",
      "President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has yet to stake out a formal position on how he will approach the controversial abortion pill. Although he took several measures in his first few days in office to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding or promoting abortion, he has yet to respond to pro-life demands to reinstate specific restrictions on mifepristone.",
      "\"The potentially tragic results of these drugs have been illustrated by the recently reported deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller,\" Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life OBGYNs, told Fox News Digital. \"Denying the risks of mifepristone will only ensure that more women like Amber and Candi are left to undergo painful and potentially dangerous drug-induced abortions without the bare minimum quality of medical care.\"",

      "While pro-choice advocates have suggested the deaths of Thurman and Miller were the result of anti-abortion laws and the chilling effect they have incurred on women seeking abortions, Francis said their deaths were instead the result of a powerful medication that lacks the necessary safeguards.",
      "\"Many of the studies that abortion advocates like to quote to state that mifepristone has very few complications don't actually reflect real world use of mifepristone,\" she said. \"Most of those studies, women will have had an in-person visit, as well as an ultrasound, actually documenting how far along they are in their pregnancy, as well as ensuring that they did not have an ectopic pregnancy before they receive those drugs. When, in fact, that's not real-world use right now.\"",
      "Francis pointed out that real-world use actually \"means that they order them online.\"",

      "When mifepristone was first approved in 2000 by the Food And Drug Administration (FDA), numerous safeguards were put in place. Those included requirements that the medication be dispensed in-person and that patients receive appropriate follow-up care. It also limited the gestational time frame during which pregnant women could use the pill to seven weeks. However, over time, those restrictions were loosened more and more. By 2021, women could get mifepristone without in-person visits, and it was left up to the doctor to trust the patient's account of how far along her pregnancy was.",

      "\"They're not seen by any kind of medical professional to confirm their gestational age or to rule out an ectopic pregnancy, which we know happens in one in 50 pregnancies,\" Francis said. \"If you look at the FDA's own label \u2013 and again, this was when there was still the in-person dispensing requirement \u2013 their own label says that one in 25 women will go to the emergency room due to complications related to these drugs. That is not a safe drug. Safe drugs don't send one in 25 people to the emergency room.\"",
      "\"The only way to tell the bleeding, cramping, and pain is from a miscarriage, the abortion pill, or even from an ectopic pregnancy, is to actually do an ultrasound,\" Dr. William Lile, a pro-life OB-GYN who has delivered more than 5,000 babies, told Fox News Digital.",
      "The removal of in-person visits is a major aspect of the more lax restrictions that people like Francis and Lile want to see reversed. A big reason for that is due to the similarity of the side effects exhibited by both mifepristone usage and life-threatening ectopic pregnancies, which have increased due to the growing prevalence of Intrauterane Devices (IUDs) and sexually transmitted diseases like chlamydia and gonorrhea, Francis wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal.",

She's going to think that it's the result of the abortion drugs that she took, and it's normal, and she's going to stay home while she's bleeding into her abdomen and losing precious time. That could be the difference between life and death,\" Francis said.",
      "Mifepristone is also prone to causing retained tissue and atypical sepsis as well, something Thurman suffered from before her death.",
      "\"When we know that this drug carries these kinds of complications, we are saying women deserve better care and better oversight when they're being given these drugs,\" Francis said. \"These are not benign drugs. Women deserve follow-up care. They deserve ongoing care.\"",

However, according to Lile and Francis, mifepristone's assistance is not statistically significant, or necessary when treating miscarriages. Neither does it remove the need for in-person visits, they said.",
      "\"When people think of it outside of the abortion context, they understand how important that in-person evaluation is, how important it is to know exactly how far along someone is,\" Francis said. \"So that's what we're calling for, and [in-person evaluations] being put back into place would not impact a physician's ability to use that drug to treat miscarriage, if that is their protocol for treating miscarriage.\""

These are not complicated strategies, just simple cybersecurity practices that are easy to follow.",
      "1) Buy tickets from trusted sources:\u00a0Only purchase from official sites/apps and other reputable channels. Double-check URLs to avoid lookalike sites (which are designed to mimic legitimate event pages). Platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Eventbrite and Nextdoor are also hot spots for scams, so be cautious of sellers \"requiring a deposit\" through peer-to-peer financial apps like Cash App, Venmo or Zelle.",
      "2) Watch out for event-related phishing attacks: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Cybercriminals often time their phishing attacks around large events like the Super Bowl, offering fake discount tickets, VIP experiences, free food vouchers, etc. Always verify offers through the event\u2019s official website or app and never agree to anything over the phone. Double-check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over links before clicking to ensure they lead to legitimate event sites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Keep your phone software and apps updated:\u00a0Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system (i.e., iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, others). \"While constant notifications can be an annoyance at the moment, these updates are essential for keeping your devices secure,\" Lewis said. If you\u2019re not sure how to get started,\u00a0check out this extensive guide on how to update all your devices.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Create complex passwords for all your accounts, especially those related to ticket purchases or event information. Use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store these securely. Enable\u00a02FA wherever possible, particularly for email and payment accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. For the Super Bowl, this is especially crucial for any official NFL or ticketing apps you might be using.",
      "5) Be wary of QR codes:\u00a0While convenient, QR codes can be exploited by hackers for malicious purposes. Only scan QR codes from trusted sources, such as the official event organizer. If unsure, check for signs of tampering, like stickers placed over legitimate codes or poor print quality. When in doubt, don\u2019t scan it. As a precaution, always keep your antivirus software running to prevent malware infections from scanning a scam QR code.\u00a0If you don\u2019t have antivirus software, check out my top recommendations here.",
      "6) Beware of scammers using social engineering techniques: For example, they may encourage you to transfer money immediately as they allegedly have other prospective buyers. They may also use emotional appeals, such as sympathy, guilt or urgency, to manipulate you into making a decision. Scammers often use these tactics to pressure victims into paying before verifying the tickets.",
      "7) Be wary of individuals showing receipts or proof of purchase: This is not a guarantee that an individual is in possession of a ticket, and it can be easily faked.\u00a0Scammers can use fake receipts to convince victims that they bought the tickets from legitimate sources, such as Ticketmaster, StubHub or SeatGeek.",
      "8) Exercise caution when interacting with individuals asking for you to \"name your price\" or are selling below ticket value: This may be a sign that they are trying to lure you into a scam with a too-good-to-be-true offer. Scammers often use this strategy to attract victims who are looking for cheap or affordable tickets.",
      "9)\u00a0Be cautious when interacting with people claiming to sell tickets on behalf of a friend or family member: This may provide an excuse for scammers using compromised bank accounts with the account holder's name different from the social media account being used. Scammers often use this pretext to explain the discrepancy between the names on the accounts.",
      "10)\u00a0Review the account\u2019s recent history: Some scammers may claim to be selling tickets to multiple high-profile events, such as sports games, music concerts and conferences at one time. This may indicate that they are running a large-scale scam operation and are not genuine sellers. Scammers often post multiple ads for different events on the same or different platforms, using the same or similar images and descriptions.",
      "11) Exercise caution and validate ownership: Do this even when purchasing items from friends or friends of friends on social media. A family member or friend\u2019s account can be compromised and used by a scammer. Friends of the victim can vouch for the account user as a legitimate seller, not realizing the account had been hacked.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says cybercriminals are exploiting iMessage phishing protection, tricking users to reactivate links.",
      "Elon Musk, known for leading companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and xAI and buying and rebranding Twitter as X, often finds his name linked to innovation and futuristic ideas. But his reputation also makes him a prime target for scammers.",
      "In the past, fraudsters have used Musk\u2019s name in cryptocurrency schemes. Now, a new scam is making the rounds. This time, scammers are promoting bogus \"energy-saving\" devices, falsely associating Musk with these products to gain credibility. These devices, which don\u2019t work as advertised, are being marketed as revolutionary solutions, duping people into spending money on what is essentially a scam.",
      "We received this email from Rick in Wilkesboro, North Carolina: \"I\u2019ve been receiving emails offering an energy-saving device developed by Elon Musk. It claims the device can reduce energy bills by 50%. I never attempted to contact anyone associated with Elon Musk, nor have I done any internet searches for such a device. Are these emails legit or another attempt by scammers hoping I click on their links?\"",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Rick, it sounds like those emails are likely scams. There have been numerous reports of scammers using Elon Musk's name to promote fake energy-saving devices. These scams often claim that the device can drastically reduce energy bills, but there is no evidence that Elon Musk or any of his companies are involved in such products.",
      "Let's dive into how this scam works and share some ways you can stay safe.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does Elon Musk's energy-saving scam work?",
      "The Elon Musk energy-saving scam works by using flashy online ads, unsolicited emails and other deceptive tactics to lure victims. Scammers promote so-called \"revolutionary\" devices through social media, pop-ups, emails and even search engine ads, claiming the products are backed by Musk.",
      "These ads often include fake customer reviews, exaggerated claims of slashing electricity bills by 50% or more and time-limited discounts to create urgency. Names of devices advertised in these scams include the Power Pro Save, Heunwa Power Save, Stop Watt, Miracle Watt, True Watt, Real Watt, Watt Rescue, Esaver Watt, Pro Power Save, Voltmod and more.",
      "Clicking on these ads leads you to sales websites designed to look legitimate. They feature fake logos, doctored before-and-after photos and bogus celebrity endorsements to build trust. The sites throw around pseudo-scientific jargon like \"stabilizing electrical currents\" or \"rebalancing loads\" to sound convincing. They also use tactics like showing inflated \"regular\" prices crossed out to make the current offer seem like a huge bargain.",
      "If you look closely, though, the red flags are clear. These sites lack basic details like a company address, contact number or business registration information. Instead, they push you to place an order through an online form, demanding full payment upfront via credit card or PayPal.",
      "After paying, customers might receive a cheap, non-functional plastic device, or sometimes nothing at all. These devices don\u2019t reduce electricity usage. They might even waste more power. But by the time you realize it, the scammers have already pocketed your money.",
      "Elon Musk scam email ads (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON\u2019T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "The truth about energy-saving devices",
      "Over the years, plenty of power-saving scams have promised to cut down or even eliminate your electricity bill by simply plugging in their devices. The reality is that there\u2019s no device you can plug in that will actually reduce your electricity usage or lower your household bill.",
      "These products often claim to \"stabilize voltage\" or \"reduce power waste.\" While voltage stabilization can be useful in industrial settings, it doesn\u2019t make much difference for typical home appliances. Most household appliances are already designed to run efficiently without the issues these devices claim to fix.",
      "If you\u2019re serious about saving on electricity, focus on\u00a0practical solutions like upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, using smart home devices or adjusting your energy usage schedule.",

      "Red flags to watch out for",
      "Too good to be true: Claims of reducing energy bills by 50% or more are often exaggerated and unrealistic.",
      "Unsolicited emails: Receiving emails out of the blue, especially when you haven't shown interest in such products, is a common tactic used by scammers.",
      "Use of celebrity names: Scammers frequently use well-known names like Elon Musk to lend credibility to their schemes.",
      "Suspicious links: Be cautious of clicking on links in unsolicited emails. They can lead to phishing sites designed to steal your personal information. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10 ways to stay safe from such scams",
      "1. Verify the email: Phishing emails are a common tool scammers use to trick people into buying fake products or giving away personal information. These emails often look like they\u2019re from legitimate sources, but they contain links that lead to fraudulent websites or prompt you to download malicious attachments. Always check the sender's email address and look for signs of a fake message, like poor grammar or urgent calls to action.",
      "2. Verify claims: If you're curious about a product, do some research from reputable sources before taking any action.",
      "3. Do not click links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from these emails. Instead, hover over the link to see its true destination. This can help you identify if it leads to a legitimate site or a malicious one.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices: Ensure you have reliable antivirus software installed on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Examine the website carefully: Scammers often create websites that look professional, but they\u2019re easy to spot with a few simple checks. Look for missing or suspicious information, like the absence of a business address, phone number or business registration details. If there are fake testimonials or celebrity endorsements, that\u2019s a red flag.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" deals:\u00a0Scammers rely on offering deals that seem too good to pass up, like massive discounts or a \"limited time offer.\" If an ad claims you can save 50% or more on a product, be skeptical. Real, quality products usually don\u2019t come with such extreme savings, and high-tech devices like those promoted by scammers rarely live up to the hype. If it feels like too good a deal, it probably is.",
      "7. Watch out for unusual payment methods: One of the easiest ways to spot a scam is by how the scammers ask you to pay. If a website asks for payment upfront via credit card or PayPal with no option to verify or ship the product first, it's a major red flag. Scammers take your money upfront and have no intention of sending you anything of value. Stick to reputable payment methods that offer buyer protection and avoid sites that ask for payment without proper verification.",
      "8. Mark spam email as junk or spam: Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "9. Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources: This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable email or email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "10. Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Impersonation scams are a common way scammers steal your money. They often use well-known names like Elon Musk or big companies like Microsoft and Walmart to make you trust them, then trick you into giving away your financial details. To stay safe, avoid unsolicited emails or texts that promote products or offers. If you need to buy something, stick to trusted sellers like Amazon, Best Buy or other reputable platforms. Always double-check the legitimacy of any offer before making a purchase, especially if it comes from an unfamiliar source.",

A \"use after free\" memory corruption error enabled hackers to manipulate the system into executing unstable code, granting them elevated privileges to bypass security protocols. Apple\u2019s advisory suggests hackers weaponized the flaw through malicious apps disguised as legitimate media players. These apps likely abused the Core Media framework by triggering corrupted files, enabling attackers to infiltrate devices.",
      "The attacks reportedly targeted iOS versions predating 17.2, released in December 2023, meaning the vulnerability may have been active since late 2022. Security experts speculate that hackers focused on high-value individuals \u2014 such as activists, executives or journalists \u2014 to avoid detection. The prolonged stealth of the campaign underscores the challenges of identifying sophisticated, narrowly tailored exploits.",
      "This underscores the critical need for you to update your devices to iOS 17.2 or later, as these versions include essential fixes to safeguard against this actively exploited vulnerability.",

      "1. Keep your iPhone updated:\u00a0I can\u2019t say this enough.\u00a0Updating your iPhone regularly is one of the most effective ways to protect it from security threats. Apple frequently releases updates that fix vulnerabilities, including critical zero-day flaws.",
      "2. Download apps only from the App Store: To minimize the risk of installing malware, only download apps from the official App Store. Apple\u2019s strict app review process helps prevent malicious apps from being published, but some threats can still slip through. Always verify app details, check reviews and be cautious about app permissions before installation.",
      "3. Enable lockdown mode for extra protection: For those of you who may be at higher risk, such as journalists or executives,\u00a0Lockdown Mode provides an additional layer of security. This feature limits certain device functionalities to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks. It can be turned on via\u00a0Settings >\u00a0Privacy & Security >\u00a0Lockdown Mode and is especially useful for those concerned about targeted threats.",
      "4. Enable message filtering: Use your device's built-in filtering options to sort messages from unknown senders. This feature allows you to automatically sort messages from unknown senders, easily filter unread messages\u00a0and manage your message inbox more efficiently. Here are steps:",
      "Open\u00a0Settings.Scroll down and click\u00a0Apps.\u00a0Tap\u00a0Messages.Turn on\u00a0Filter Unknown Senders",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Stay cautious of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing remains one of the most common tactics used by hackers. Be cautious when receiving unsolicited messages or emails on your iPhone, especially those with suspicious links or attachments. Always verify the sender before opening anything. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Review your security and privacy settings: Regularly reviewing your iPhone\u2019s security settings can help you maintain strong protection. You should also review app permissions in\u00a0Settings > Privacy & Security to restrict access to sensitive data, such as location or contacts. Enable\u00a0Face ID or Touch ID for secure access and turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) for Apple ID and other accounts.\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message or authentication app, in addition to your password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: By reducing your online footprint, you make it harder for cybercriminals to obtain your contact information, potentially preventing them from sending you deceptive phishing texts and emails in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "This iOS vulnerability is a serious reminder of the importance of staying up to date with software updates. If you\u2019re using an iPhone from 2018 or later, make sure you\u2019ve updated to iOS 17.2 or later as soon as possible. Hackers exploited a hidden flaw for over a year, using fake media apps to gain access to devices. While Apple has now patched the issue, the fact that it remained undetected for so long is concerning.",

Upon clicking links within these invites, they are taken to fake web pages that prompt them to input personal data. Once compromised, this information can be used for\u00a0identity theft, financial fraud and unauthorized access to other accounts. Security experts warn that attackers are now using AI to craft highly convincing fake invitations, making it even harder to spot the fraud.

      "As European Union leaders convened for a meeting in Brussels, Frederiksen addressed President Donald Trump's prospect of acquiring control of Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally, through military or economic force.\u00a0\"I think we have been very clear from the Kingdom of Denmark, with great support from the European partners and the European Union, that everybody has to respect the sovereignty of all national states in the world, and that Greenland is today a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, it is a part of our territory, and it's not for sale,\" Frederiksen told reporters, speaking in English. \"The chairman, the leader of Greenland, has been very clear that they are not for sale.\"",

They [the U.S.] are already there, and they can have more possibilities. And at the same time, we are willing to scale up from the Kingdom of Denmark. And I think NATO is the same. So if this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward.\"",
      "Frederiksen also responded to Trump's threat of implementing tariffs on imports from the European Union. The Danish leader said EU members \"are willing to help each other and to stick together, and I will never support the idea of fighting allies, but of course, if the U.S. puts tough tariffs on Europe, we need a collective and robust response.\"Last week, her government announced a nearly $2 billion agreement with parties, including the governments of Greenland and the Faeroe Islands, to \"improve capabilities for surveillance and maintaining sovereignty in the region.\" It would include three new Arctic naval vessels, two additional long-range surveillance drones and satellite capacity, the Danish Defense Ministry said.Meanwhile, European Council President Antonio Costa, noting that the EU has stood beside Ukraine in defense of its borders, said of Greenland on Monday: \"Of course, we will stand also for these principles, all the more so if the territorial integrity of a member state of the European Union is questioned.\"",

      "\"You have to ask yourself, how are we going to solve that problem, solve our own national security if that means that we need to take more territorial interests in Greenland? That is what President Trump is going to do, because he doesn't care about what the Europeans scream at us. He cares about putting the interests of America's citizens first,\" Vance said, adding, \"You've got probably 55,000 people living on Greenland who are not actually happy with Danish government. They've got great natural resources there. They've got an incredibly bountiful country that the Danes aren't letting them develop and explore. Of course, Donald Trump would take a different approach if he was the leader of Greenland.\"",

We are not, we never have been, and we never will be in the future. The Arctic Cooperation is important. It is something we are willing to prioritize,\" Frederiksen said, arguing that it would align with the interests of Denmark, the U.S. and NATO.",
      "\"It is sensible, but it is also important that we work together against terrorism, against the destabilization we see in the Baltic Sea right now with sabotage, and it is important that we work together on NATO\u2019s Eastern flank and thereby holding firm in relation to Russia,\" she added, turning to the Ukraine war. \"So we would be able to work together in many ways, but I do not want to be sitting on Denmark\u2019s name and remuneration that we should be a bad ally, because we are not.\"",

      "A decades-old feud over the island nation of Cyprus between Greece and Turkey, both of which have been members of NATO since 1952, has plagued the alliance for over half a century and spill-over conflicts pushed the two countries nearly to the brink of war in the 1990s.",
      "Though relations between Greece and Turkey have become less outwardly hostile in recent years, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s pursuit of regional natural resources coupled with his controversial geopolitical actions in the Middle East and Aegean Sea have long drawn criticism that he is looking to \"recreate\" the Ottoman Empire.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m pleased that the Senate Intelligence Committee voted to advance the nomination of Tulsi Gabbard to be the Director of National Intelligence,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., chair of the intelligence committee, said in a statement. \u201cOnce confirmed, I look forward to working with Ms. Gabbard to keep America safe and to bring badly needed reforms to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\u201d",
      "At her confirmation hearing last week, Gabbard had faced pointed questions from some Republicans about her stances on Edward Snowden and the controversial surveillance program he helped expose. The questioning fueled speculation about whether Gabbard would win the backing of the committee, where Republicans have a 9-8 majority.",
      "Gabbard had previously called for Snowden to be pardoned but reversed herself at the hearing, saying she would not seek a pardon or clemency for the former National Security Agency contractor accused of espionage. She also softened her position on the government\u2019s surveillance authorities under section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, saying she viewed them as an important tool.",

      "When the full Senate takes up her confirmation, Gabbard could afford to lose up to three Republican votes, assuming no Democrats vote for her. It\u2019s unclear if there are four Republicans prepared to vote against her nomination, but the committee vote has been viewed as the biggest obstacle for her.",
      "As director of national intelligence, a position created in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Gabbard would oversee 18 intelligence agencies with a budget of about $100 billion and serve as the principal adviser to the president on intelligence matters.",
      "As a presidential candidate, a member of Congress and a commentator supporting Trump\u2019s campaign, Gabbard has been accused of\u00a0echoing propaganda spread by Russia\u00a0and the former Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, including questioning U.S. intelligence assessments that the Syrian government had carried out multiple chemical weapons attacks on its own people.",
      "At the hearing last week, Gabbard rejected criticism that she has sided with U.S. adversaries and said it was outrageous to question her loyalty to the United States given her career in the Army and in politics.",
      "She maintains she is coming under attack for questioning Washington\u2019s national security establishment and opposing U.S. military \u201cregime change\u201d interventions, including the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.",
      "At the hearing last week, Gabbard she was not \u201cPutin\u2019s puppet\u201d or \u201cAssad\u2019s puppet,\u201d or anyone else\u2019s.",
      "\u201cThe fact is what truly unsettles my political opponents is I refuse to be their puppet,\u201d Gabbard said.",
      "Gabbard, who served in the Hawaii Army National Guard and was deployed to Iraq with a medical unit, has long criticized American foreign policy as imperial and heavy-handed.",
      "The Republican majority on the committee backed Gabbard after she reversed or shifted her positions not only on Snowden and the foreign intelligence surveillance program but the cause of the war in Ukraine and Trump\u2019s decision in 2020 to order a U.S. drone strike against top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani.",
      "Gabbard has suggested that NATO was to blame for triggering Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0But at the hearing\u00a0last week, she said: \u201cPutin started the war in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "After the U.S. strike that killed Soleimani in Baghdad, Gabbard had sharply criticized the action as reckless and illegal. But at her hearing, she said Trump had taken the right action."

      "The agents have been informed they are \u201clikely to be terminated in the very near future\u201d for their work on the Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago cases, the complaint continues.",
      "\u201cThey intend to represent a class of at least 6,000 current and former FBI agents and employees who participated in some manner in the investigation and prosecution of crimes and abuses of power by Donald Trump, or by those acting at his behest,\u201d lawyers Pamela Keith and Scott Lempert write in the complaint.",
      "Keith, a former Democratic candidate for Congress, has shared unfounded conspiracy theories on social media about pro-Republican election results, the July 2024 assassination attempt against Trump and other major events.",
      "The FBI agents are alleging First and Fifth Amendment violations by the Justice Department and seek to enjoin \u201cthe aggregation, storage, reporting, publication or dissemination of any list or compilation of information that would identify FBI agents and other personnel, and tie them directly to Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago case activities.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit says they have been informed that some of their personal information has already been posted by Jan. 6 convicted felons on the dark web and are particularly concerned about further publication of their personal information.",
      "The second suit, which includes seven unnamed FBI agents and the FBI Agents Association as plaintiffs, hits similar notes, asking the court for \u201cprotection\u201d from the Justice Department\u2019s \u201canticipated retaliatory decision to expose their personal information for opprobrium and potential vigilante action by those who they were investigating.\u201d",
      "The first suit alleges that \u201cthe very act of compiling lists of persons who worked on matters that upset Donald Trump is retaliatory in nature, intended to intimidate FBI agents and other personnel, and to discourage them from reporting any future malfeasance and by Donald Trump and his agents.\u201d",
      "\"Plaintiffs therefore respectfully seek immediate relief to enjoin the aggregation, storage, reporting, publication or dissemination of any list or compilation of information that would identify FBI agents and other personnel, and tie them directly to Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago case activities,\" the complaint says."

    "story": [
      "The White House is preparing an executive order to eliminate the Department of Education, two sources familiar with the plans told NBC News.",
      "President Donald Trump cannot unilaterally abolish a federal agency without the approval of Congress.",
      "The planned order follows years of campaign promises from Trump to abolish the federal Education Department, which was established in 1979, during President Jimmy Carter's administration.",
      "In September 2023, the then-candidate posted a video to social media saying, \u201cOne other thing I\u2019ll be doing very early in the administration is closing up the Department of Education in Washington D.C., and sending all education and education work and needs back to the states.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn total American society pours more than $1 trillion a year into public education systems but instead of being at the top of the list, we are literally right smack \u2014 guess what \u2014 at the bottom,\u201d Trump said earlier in the video.",
      "Trump's proposal was adopted into the Republican Party platform last summer, and was an idea also pushed by Project 2025.",
      "The department says its elementary and secondary programs serve more than 50 million students in about 98,000 public schools and 32,000 private schools. The department also provides \"grant, loan, and work-study assistance to more than 12 million postsecondary students,\" it says.",
      "Becky Pringle, the president of the National Education Association, a major labor group, warned in a statement Tuesday that Trump's forthcoming order would hurt students and families, especially in vulnerable populations.",
      "\u201cIf it became a reality, Trump\u2019s power grab would steal resources for our most vulnerable students, explode class sizes, cut job training programs, make higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle class families, take away special education services for students with disabilities, and gut student civil rights protections,\" she said. \"Americans did not vote for, and do not support, ending the federal government\u2019s commitment to ensuring equal educational opportunities for every child.\"",
      "Republican support for eliminating the department started soon after it was founded, with President Ronald Reagan advocating for dismantling it. Republicans in Congress have not been able to pass legislation to do so, however.",
      "Last month, Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and David Rouzer, R-N.C., filed bills that would eliminate the department. Massie's measure has garnered 27 co-sponsors, all Republicans. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., introduced a similar bill in the last Congress and his office said it expects him to do the same in the current one.",
      "Republicans control the House and Senate, but any effort to abolish the department would face major obstacles in the upper chamber, where 60 votes are required to overcome a filibuster and advance to a final vote. Given their narrow majority, Republicans would need Democratic support to do that, which would make it unlikely for such a bill to pass.",
      "Last week, Trump signed another education-related order to expand school choice, directing the Education Department to issue guidance to states within 60 days about how they can use federal funds to boost school choice programs in their states.",
      "School choice has long been a cornerstone of the GOP agenda, with a significant number of Republican-led states freeing up more funding in recent years for low-income families to send their students to private or charter schools.",
      "In recent years, \u201ccleaning out\u201d or fully abolishing the federal Department of Education has also become a leading Republican policy plank and was popular among several of the Republican candidates who challenged Trump in last year's presidential primary.",
      "In the Republican presidential primary, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy called for eliminating the Department of Education while on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania in 2023. And former United Nations Amb. Nikki Haley said she would \u201cclean out the Department of Education\u201d if elected during a 2023 campaign stop in New Hampshire.",
      "In a July 2024 campaign email, Trump laid out his other priorities for American education, which included cutting federal funding for any schools or programs pushing \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d opening civil rights investigations into schools discriminating against Asian Americans, implementing a new credentialing system to certify teachers who \u201cembrace patriotic values,\u201d and \u201cfind[ing] and remov[ing] radicals who have infiltrated the federal Department of Education.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 10:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Musk has moved with lightning speed to try to remake the federal government. Many Democrats and even some Republicans say his efforts are unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "In the shorthand of the tech industry, Elon Musk has hacked into the government.",
      "The billionaire tech magnate has never been elected to office or been confirmed by the Senate for a high-level government job, but in the span of a few days, Musk has still gained access to sensitive federal data through his position as head of President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency project, or DOGE, to push a far-reaching agenda and potentially spark a constitutional crisis.",
      "Musk has embraced Silicon Valley\u2019s most notorious instincts to \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d in a lightning battle to muscle into the computer systems and power structures of federal agencies. As he did with his corporate takeover of Twitter in 2022, he has brought in a team to assess details such as office building leases, budget line items, vendor contracts and the performance of individual employees \u2014 with the stated intention of radically downsizing the organization.",
      "With a cadre of engineers as young as 19 years old, and with the encouragement of Trump, Musk has demanded and been given access to sensitive government databases and the Treasury Department\u2019s payment system with an unprecedented series of bureaucratic maneuvers.",
      "There are deep concerns among many Democrats and some Republicans that Musk \u2014 and his staff members who are not government workers and are not bound by the same ethics and rules that apply to federal workers \u2014 are acting in secret, without accountability and potentially against the law in the Trump administration\u2019s effort to shrink the federal government.",
      "DOGE is an office within the Executive Office of the President, according to a Trump executive order from Jan. 20, and Musk has been named a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d according to a White House official. It is a temporary position that allows him greater access, but it also bypasses some of the disclosure obligations required of full-time government employees.",
      "DOGE\u2019s targets include the U.S. Agency for International Development, which closed its headquarters Monday in anticipation of shutting down entirely. Musk\u2019s DOGE has staff members working at the Treasury Department, which pays the government\u2019s bills, and he has said on X that he wants to slash or overhaul several other agencies including the General Services Administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Education Department.",
      "A person who has been affiliated with Musk\u2019s SpaceX is working as an adviser to the FBI director, NBC News has reported. The White House Office of Personnel Management has offered federal employees the option of taking \u201cdeferred resignations,\u201d or buyouts, in an echo of Musk\u2019s Twitter shakeup.",
      "Inside the offices of USAID, more than 1,000 staff members and contractors have been fired or furloughed because of a near-total freeze on foreign assistance, and the agency\u2019s security leaders were put on administrative leave Saturday after they tried to prevent DOGE employees from accessing secure systems, NBC News has reported. At least some of the DOGE employees had insufficient security clearances, sources have said.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Musk was operating a \u201cshadow government\u201d that put all government services at risk.",
      "\u201cIf DOGE attacks USAID today, then you can be sure they\u2019ll move on to another target tomorrow. Who knows, maybe it\u2019ll be the Postal Service or the IRS or even the Social Security Administration?\u201d he said.",
      "Musk did not respond to an email request Monday for an interview.",
      "It was not clear what Musk and his DOGE team planned to do with their access to sensitive data, such as Treasury records of all payments made by the government, but in social media posts, Musk has openly mused about cutting federal jobs, canceling contracts, stopping payments or selectively releasing records to illustrate his points about alleged waste. It is a playbook he has already used; he selectively released internal Twitter documents after he bought the company, arguing that the previous management had been politically biased.",
      "Many Democrats \u2014 and even some Republicans \u2014 say the attempted unilateral remake of the federal government is unlawful, as Trump and Musk have shoved aside not only career civil servants but also the authority of Congress itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a potential constitutional crisis,\u201d said Brian Riedl, a former Senate Republican staff member who is now a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. In a phone interview, he said he was concerned that Musk\u2019s power is going unchecked.",
      "\u201cSomeone with as much power as Elon Musk has should be Senate-confirmed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be some accountability to Congress and the voters.\u201d",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Musk was breaking the law.",
      "\u201cAn unelected, unaccountable billionaire with expansive conflicts of interest, deep ties to China and an indiscreet ax to grind against perceived enemies is hijacking our nation\u2019s most sensitive financial data systems and its checkbook so that he can illegally block funds to our constituents based on the slightest whim or wildest conspiracy,\u201d she said at a news conference Monday at the Capitol.",
      "Musk has been using as his primary example of suspected government waste a dubious claim that $50 million of taxpayer money went to pay for condoms sent to the Gaza Strip. The Associated Press reported last week that there was no evidence for the claim.",
      "And he has acted largely in secret, withholding not only the names of newly hired government officials who are helping him make decisions, but also the details of the decisions themselves and the supposed legal authority under which he is operating. On Monday, after people began posting the names of DOGE employees online, Musk accused them of breaking the law.",
      "Edward Martin, the Trump-appointed interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., said in a statement on X late Monday that he was prepared to prosecute people who were \u201ctargeting DOGE employees.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur initial review of the evidence presented to us indicates that certain individuals and/or groups have committed acts that appear to violate the law in targeting DOGE employees,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe also have our prosecutors preparing.\u201d Earlier Monday, Martin wrote a public letter to Musk vowing to \u201cpursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s posts on social media indicate he is working unconventional, long hours, and he said he worked through the weekend. He has told multiple people that he is sleeping at DOGE\u2019s offices, Wired reported last week.",
      "The acronym for Musk\u2019s project, DOGE, is a joking reference to a volatile digital currency, and DOGE is not an official department created by Congress, but by any measure Musk has more influence with Trump than most Cabinet members.",
      "Musk, the wealthiest person in the world, appeared to be taken aback early Monday at how easily he had grabbed influence in Washington.",
      "\u201cAlthough it is a humorous name, ironically I think DOGE will have a very serious and significant impact on government waste and fraud and abuse \u2014 which is really astonishing,\u201d he said in an audio-only event on X.",
      "Trump pledged Monday that the White House would closely oversee Musk\u2019s activity.",
      "\u201cElon can\u2019t do and won\u2019t do anything without our approval, and we\u2019ll give him the approval where appropriate. Where not appropriate, we won\u2019t,\u201d he told reporters Monday in the Oval Office.",
      "But the questions hanging over DOGE are extraordinary, especially as they relate to the Constitution: Members of Congress are in charge of writing spending bills and control the nation\u2019s checkbook. Cabinet leaders and department heads are subject to confirmation by the Senate.",
      "Trump, asked Monday about potential financial conflicts of interest for Musk, said: \u201cWhere we think there\u2019s a conflict or a problem, we won\u2019t let him go near it.\u201d",
      "As a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d in the Trump administration, Musk must abide by ethics and conflict-of-interest policies that are generally less onerous than they are for full-time government staff members. He still has full-time jobs as the CEO of two major corporations, Tesla and SpaceX, and he is the owner of various other tech companies, including X, xAI and Neuralink.",
      "The Trump administration has not published a list of DOGE employees or even made it clear how many of them are full-time employees, as opposed to outside advisers or volunteers. On Sunday, Wired published the names of six young men, ages 19 to 24, who it said were working for DOGE.",
      "One of the DOGE staffers, Gavin Kliger, was the person who sent an email early Monday informing all USAID employees that the headquarters would be closed to most of them, according to a copy of the email seen by NBC News. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2020, according to his LinkedIn profile. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "Musk has boasted about his staff, calling them some of the \u201cworld\u2019s best software engineers\u201d and comparing them to warriors from ancient Greece.",
      "\u201cNot many Spartans are needed to win battles,\u201d he posted Sunday on X.",
      "DOGE is not being transparent about other aspects of its work, including how many job cuts it may have recommended or prompted and any halts to congressionally approved spending that it may have suggested. Even measuring the impact of DOGE may be difficult because it is not clear how people outside the government could validate some of the metrics Musk is citing, such as the value of cuts. (Last week, Musk said DOGE was cutting the deficit by about $1 billion a day, without providing details, and then said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about getting to $4 billion a day.)",
      "On Monday, Musk said on X that a small office within the government focused on technology, known as 18F, \u201chas been deleted,\u201d without providing any additional details. The 18F office, launched during the Obama administration, said last year it had completed 455 digital projects, including modernizing the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s online permit process and helping create the popular Direct File project for free tax-filing.",
      "Over the weekend, Musk called government workers \u201cthe opposing team\u201d and taunted them for not working over the weekend."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he wants access to Ukraine\u2019s bonanza of rare earth and critical minerals in exchange for the billions of dollars in military aid Washington has been supplying to Kyiv.",
      "It\u2019s an idea previously suggested by Republican senators and Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelenskyy, who sought to appeal to Trump\u2019s dealmaker persona as a way of keeping alive Washington\u2019s support of Kyiv.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they\u2019re going to secure what we\u2019re giving them with their rare earth and other things,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. \u201cI want security of the rare earth, and they\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d",
      "As well as being a global breadbasket \u2014 Ukraine is a huge supplier of wheat and other agricultural commodities \u2014 the country also has a rich seam of rare earth and critical minerals.",
      "Elements such as lithium, gallium and neodymium are crucial in producing a vast range of technologies that include electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and cutting-edge military hardware. As such, the U.S. and China among others have increasingly coveted them.",
      "Trump\u2019s comments Monday came as Ukraine and its European neighbors anxiously awaited details of his plan to end the war in Ukraine that Russia launched with its full-scale invasion three years ago.",
      "Though the president has offered few details of how peace might be achieved, his overriding complaint has been that European nations have not contributed as much as the $175 billion in assistance that makes America Ukraine\u2019s biggest donor.",
      "He also reiterated his long-held desire Monday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to stop that ridiculous war.\u201d",
      "That impulse has prompted nervousness among Kyiv\u2019s supporters that Trump may try to force a ceasefire favorable to Russian President Vladimir Putin. With Russia making steady battlefield gains, Putin has shown no appetite for a truce without significant territorial gains and a promise Ukraine will never join NATO.",
      "Zelenskyy has said in the past that he sees the war as one between Russia and the West, not just Ukraine, and as such has implored Western countries to provide more weaponry.",
      "The Ukrainian president has also made positive comments about working with Trump \u2014 some analysts say that he has little choice \u2014 and now there appears to be some agreement on the subject of rare earth minerals.",
      "China dominates the global market for rare earth metals, securing rights to mine some 60% and produce up to 90% of the world's supply, according to the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies.",
      "That's partly due its vast \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure project through which it has developed ties to resource-rich countries. But also its willingness to process these environmentally damaging materials on behalf of Western countries, which until recently have been happy to offload this burden.",
      "Ukraine is a key player, too, with upward of 5% of the world\u2019s mineral supply, according to its national Geological Association. Many of those crucial minerals are under the frigid trenches and minefields in eastern Ukraine, however, and at risk of falling into the hands of Putin.",
      "Commenting on Trump\u2019s interest in rare earth minerals, Zelenskyy on Tuesday told reporters in Kyiv that his country was open to investment by American companies, Reuters reported.",
      "On Monday his office welcomed Trump\u2019s comments as \u201cpart of the Victory Plan that President Zelensky presented to President Trump in the fall,\u201d but warned that \u201cwe must ensure the security of Ukraine and these resources so that Russia does not simply seize them physically.\u201d",
      "That so-called \u201cvictory plan,\u201d proposed by Zelenskyy in October, offered \u201cstrategic partners\u201d such as the U.S. \u201ca special agreement\u201d to access deposits of uranium, titanium, lithium, graphite that Ukraine says are worth trillions of dollars.",
      "Trump appearing to adopt this plan shows Zelenskyy\u2019s success in appealing to the president\u2019s dealmaker instinct, according to Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy knows how Trump likes to make deals, and this plan was to make Ukraine an asset, not a liability,\u201d Lutsevych said. \u201cBut we still do not know Trump\u2019s strategy. We know bits of it but he says very little, and we only know what he says.\u201d",
      "When asked about Trump's comments, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday that it was merely \"an offer to buy aid\" rather than \"provide it on a free of charge basis.\"",
      "\"It is better, of course, not to provide it at all and thereby contribute to the end of the conflict,\u201d Peskov added.",
      "Though many in Europe still fear that Trump may hand Putin a win, Ukrainians themselves appear to trust the American president more than their E.U. counterparts. A December poll by the New Europe Center, a Ukrainian nongovernmental organization, found more than 44% of respondents said they trusted Trump \u2014 higher than most other European countries.",
      "One of those maintaining a positive outlook is Taras Byk, 41, a consultant and civil activist in Kyiv. He told NBC News that the rare-earth proposal would be a \u201cwin-win scenario for both Ukraine and the USA.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe would like to cooperate as equal partners,\u201d he said, \u201cif this exchange will lead to the retreat of Russia, such an option is much better than war.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump will meet Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 the first foreign leader to meet with him since he started his second term.",
      "Speaking with reporters Sunday, Trump previewed the discussion at the White House as a \"very big meeting.\" In his letter inviting Netanyahu to Washington last week, he wrote, \u201cI look forward to discussing how we can bring peace to Israel and its neighbors, and efforts to counter our shared adversaries.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu said Sunday that they will discuss \"the critical issues that lie ahead of us \u2014 defeating Hamas, returning all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian axis in all its components, an axis that also threatens Israel\u2019s security, the Middle East and the entire world.\"",
      "The two are scheduled to meet at 4 p.m. ET and then to hold a joint press conference about an hour later.",
      "Trump's transition team helped the Biden administration secure a ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and the militant group Hamas. The next phase of the agreement is expected to be one of the topics the two leaders discuss Tuesday.",
      "The conflict\u00a0began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. Israel retaliated with an air and land assault on Gaza,\u00a0killing more than 47,000 people, most of them civilians, according to local officials. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been displaced.",
      "The scale of Israeli counteroffensive has led to international condemnation, but Netanyahu has defended his actions, most recently en route to Washington.",
      "\"The decisions we have made during the war, combined with the heroism of the IDF soldiers, they have already changed the face of the Middle East. They have changed it beyond recognition. I think that by working hard with President Trump, we can change it even more, for the better,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Trump had said he wants Jordan and Egypt to accept more Palestinian refugees as part of an effort to\u00a0\u201cclean out\u201d Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu and Trump were close allies during Trump's first term in office, but their relationship became strained after Netanyahu congratulated Joe Biden on winning the 2020 election while Trump was still challenging the results.",
      "Just days after the Oct. 7 attack, Trump told a crowd at a campaign rally that Netanyahu had \u201clet us down\u201d during his first administration, arguing that he had been unhelpful before\u00a0the United States killed a top Iranian general. That led to criticism from his Republican rivals, and Trump later posted on social media, \u201c#IStandWithIsrael\u201d and \u201c#IStandWithBibi,\u201d using Netanyahu's nickname.",
      "Their relationship appeared mended in July when Netanyahu visited Trump at his Florida residence after having met with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and after a failed attempt on Trump's life.",
      "Netanyahu said Sunday the \"fact that this will be [Trump's] first meeting with a foreign leader since his inauguration has great significance for the state of Israel\" and \"testifies to the strength of the alliance between Israel and the United States.\"",
      "The trip is far from Netanyahu's first trip to the White House.",
      "When he was welcomed Monday at Blair House, the historic official guest residence of the White House, its director said it was Netanyahu's 14th visit to the residence \u2014 many more than any other foreign leader has made since it was built in the 19th century."

      "Marcus Jordan, son of basketball legend Michael Jordan and a frequent figure on reality television, was arrested after he was allegedly out drinking at a Florida strip club before getting his car stuck on railroad tracks early Tuesday, authorities said.",
      "The 34-year-old Jordan, who last played competitive basketball at the University of Central Florida in 2012, was booked on suspicion of DUI, drug possession and resisting arrest.",
      "Maitland police officers came upon a blue Lamborghini stuck in railroad tracks near Greenwood Drive and Mechanic Street at about 1:14 a.m., according to an affidavit supporting Jordan's arrest.",
      "The officers were told that the car had fled from Seminole County Sheriff's deputies minutes earlier, the court document said.",
      "\"I stood at the window and immediately detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle,\" an arresting officer wrote in the affidavit. \"The defendant kept saying he made a wrong turn and needed assistance getting his vehicle off the railroad tracks. I noticed the driver had slurred speech and he was confused where he was located. I noticed the driver had red bloodshot and glassy eyes.\"",
      "Jordan, who has made several appearances on Bravo's \"The Real Housewives of Miami\" and was featured on Peacock's \"The Traitors,\"  told police he bad been drinking and was \"coming from a few venues in Winter Park and Casselberry to include the last place he visited of Rachels Gentleman\u2019s Club,\" according to the affidavit.",
      "The officers also found a \"plastic baggie with a white powdery substance inside\" the \"right pocket of his pants,\" before field tests showed it to be cocaine, officials said.",
      "The 6-foot-3 Jordan was not cooperative during the arrest and tried to extend his legs in the back of the squad guard to keep officers from closing the door,  officials said.",
      "Police eventually \"transported the Defendant to the Orange County DUI Center\" and \"on \"the way to the center, my patrol vehicle began smelling strongly like an alcoholic beverage in which it did not smell that way prior to the defendant being in the vehicle.\"",
      "\"The Defendant was singing the entire way to the DUI Center and his speech was slurred,\" according to the affidavit.",
      "Jordan appeared to still be in custody by late Tuesday morning, jail records showed.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if he had hired or been assigned a criminal defense lawyer to speak on his behalf. A representative for Michael Jordan could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday."

    "story": [
      "Two Los Angeles County prosecutors claimed in new legal filings that they were demoted and faced retaliation for supporting the resentencing of Erik and Lyle Menendez.",
      "Prosecutors Nancy Theberge and Brock Lunsford filed government claims Monday alleging they were transferred out of the district attorney's office's resentencing unit due to their work supporting the brothers\u2019 resentencing and for their perceived political association with George Gasc\u00f3n, the former Los Angeles County District Attorney.",
      "Theberge\u2019s filing further claimed she was subjected to discriminatory treatment due to her age and gender. Her filing said office leadership treated her differently from younger, male colleagues, \u201cundermining her authority and professional standing.\u201d",
      "Both Theberge and Lunsford had supported the resentencing of Eric and Lyle Menendez and from October 2024 began to attend meetings about the the motion for resentencing.",
      "The Menendez brothers were convicted of their parents\u2019 murders in 1989 and in 1996 they were sentenced to life in prison without parole. They remain incarcerated in a California prison.",
      "The prosecutors co-authored a memorandum on the legal and procedural basis for the brothers\u2019 resentencing.",
      "\u201cTheberge\u2019s position, based solely on her interpretation of the law, was met with resistance from the new leadership within the District Attorney\u2019s Office,\u201d her filing said.",
      "Her filing claims that after she wrote internal and external reports saying there\u2019d be a violation of law if\u00a0there was opposition to the brothers\u2019 resentencing, the District Attorney\u2019s Office transferred her out of her position and reassigned her to the Alternative Public Defender\u2019s Office starting Dec. 19.\u00a0In her new role she was placed at the bottom of the organizational hierarchy \u2014 which the filing described as \u201ca clear demotion.\u201d",
      "Following Hochman\u2019s election to DA in November, Lunsford was \u201cstripped of all supervisory responsibilities,\u201d his filing said. He was reassigned as of Dec. 14 as a calendar attorney in Department T of the Norwalk Courthouse, \u201ca position he had held years earlier with no opportunities for promotion or advancement,\u201d the filing said.",
      "Their filings alleged they faced retaliation, in part, due to current district attorney Nathan Hochman's belief that they supported his political opponent and predecessor, Gasc\u00f3n. Both had openly support George Gascon as district attorney and his re-election for that same office.",
      "The filings are government claims that are precursors to lawsuits. They each seek\u00a0economic damages of over $250,000 and non-economic damages over $5million.",
      "\u201cNancy and Brock are committed public servants and accomplished attorneys who followed the law \u2014 the law they believed required them to advocate for the resentencing of the Menendez brothers,\u201d their attorney, Justin Shegerian, told NBC Los Angeles.",
      "The Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office told NBC News it \u201cdoes not have comment to provide on this matter.\u201d",
      "The case of the Menendez brothers re-enraptured the public last year with the release of two Hollywood projects: the Netflix crime series\u00a0\u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,\u201d and a Netflix documentary entitled \u201cThe Menendez Brothers.\u201d",
      "Hochman said last month he has not made a decision regarding whether the prison sentences for the brothers should be reduced. He said he was still reviewing extensive court and prison records.",
      "Lawyers for the brothers have sought to have their sentences reduced to 50 years to life, a request that would make them eligible for parole immediately, which former Los Angeles County District Attorney Gasc\u00f3n had endorsed.",
      "A judge will ultimately determine whether the brothers should have their sentences reduced."

      "Waffle House announced it will be adding a $0.50 surcharge to all egg items on the menu sold at its more than 2,000 locations because of soaring egg prices caused by the bird flu.",
      "The surcharge went into effect Monday.",
      "In a statement, the comfort food franchise said the surcharge was triggered by the highly infectious virus, which has affected the chicken population and caused an egg shortage. More than 13 million hens have been lost or slaughtered since December following the bird flu outbreak, according to the Agriculture Department\u2019s latest\u00a0egg markets overview.",
      "Economists and market analysts have cited the bird flu as the chief reason for the price spike, along with the typical consumer demand for eggs during the winter holiday season.",
      "In the past year, the average price for a dozen eggs in the U.S. has jumped 50%, and the cost increase appears to have accelerated since November, the month Donald Trump was elected president, according to data from\u00a0the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "\"Consumers and restaurants are being forced to make difficult decisions,\" Waffle House Inc. said in the statement.",
      "The franchise said the $0.50 increase \"is a temporary targeted surcharge\" tied to the rise in egg prices, and that it \"will adjust or remove the surcharge as market conditions allow.\"",
      "\"While we hope these price fluctuations will be short-lived, we cannot predict how long this shortage will last,\" the franchise said.",
      "Pertinent to the food industry's recovery and mitigating the spread of the virus is identifying cases of bird flu.",
      "To assist with bird flu investigations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged labs to determine whether people hospitalized with the flu have the virus or just seasonal influenza within 24 hours of admission.",
      "This guidance has been in place since last fall, but many hospitals have been sending flu samples out for testing in bulk every few days. According to the CDC's Dr. Nirav Shah, who is a senior advisor, acting principal deputy director at the agency, patients have often already been sent home by the time test results have come back.",
      "\"The more time that goes by, the more memories fade and the harder it is to identify a potential source,\u201d Shah said during a news briefing last month. This can also mean that \u201ctheir close contacts may be beyond the window for preventative medications like Tamiflu.\u201d",
      "The seasonal flu is raging in the United States right now, especially in the West, across the Midwest and deep into the Southeast, the CDC said last month."

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 23:39:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump's order revoking TPS status for almost 350,000 Venezuelans in 60 days would be 'suicidal' for some if they're sent back; others would be jailed, an activist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u2019s latest immigration shakeup has sent tremors through the Venezuelan community, as some face a possible return to a country whose regime has been dubbed illegal by the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration revoked Temporary Protected Status for almost 350,000 Venezuelans who are in the U.S. Also, the protection will end in 60 days instead of October. Those affected will no longer have temporary protection from deportation or work permits that TPS allows.",
      "Venezuelan activist Beatriz Olavarria said that, for some, \u201creturning would be almost suicidal.\u201d Many Venezuelans have fled amid brutal crackdowns on protests against the government and struggles for basic goods such as food and medicine.",
      "\u201cSome of those people that are here, that have spoken about the situation in Venezuela on cameras and everywhere, they set foot in Venezuela and they will be jailed,\u201d Olavarria told NBC6 South Florida.",
      "The latest TPS revocation is part of President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing effort to conduct mass deportations in the country, purging it of immigrants without permanent legal status. Trump pledged to target violent criminals in his campaign, but people with TPS have permission to be here and must pass criminal background checks to be eligible.",
      "TPS is granted to immigrants in the U.S. who can't return to their countries because of natural disasters or political upheaval. TPS does not provide a path to citizenship and administrations can issue or end a country's TPS designation.",
      "'Betrayed'",
      "\u201cBetrayed. We feel betrayed. More than betrayed. Beyond\u00a0betrayed,\u201d said Adeyls Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus in Doral, Florida, a south Florida suburb dubbed \u201cDoralzuela\u201d for its large Venezuelan population.",
      "TPS holders are \u201cliving a legal life in the United States,\u201d she said in a news conference on Monday. \u201cWe are not here because we came as tourists. We are here because we got kicked out from\u00a0our country because ... there is a cruel dictatorship in Venezuela.\u201d",
      "In November, the U.S. joined other countries in recognizing Edmundo Gonzalez as president-elect of Venezuela, based on election results showing he won a majority of votes. Incumbent President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, however, claimed victory.",
      "The U.S. State Department reissued a \"do not travel\" advisory last September warning U.S. citizens not to travel to Venezuela \"due to\u00a0the high risk of\u00a0wrongful detentions,\u00a0terrorism, kidnapping, the\u00a0arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime,\u00a0civil unrest,\u00a0poor health infrastructure.\" Among other things, the warning said shortages of gasoline, electricity, water, medicine and medical supplies continue.",
      "The TPS termination follows a meeting between Trump's envoy to Venezuela, Richard Grenell, and Maduro last week. Grenell returned with six Americans detained in Venezuela. The two also discussed migration and sanctions. A Venezuelan official said it was willing to restart legal cooperation to extradite Tren de Aragua gang members back to Venezuela.",
      "While President Trump said on TruthSocial on Friday that Venezuela had agreed to take back people who are deported, the Venezuelan government has not confirmed this.",
      "Legally ending, but facing challenges",
      "The Homeland Security secretary has the authority to end TPS, said Elizabeth Taufa, senior policy attorney and strategist for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. But she said there is need for continuity between administrations because people rely on the decisions to plan their lives. Many of these Venezuelans were told in January they had 18 more months and now find they only have about two months before they lose TPS status, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of whiplash for the same government to say in January things haven\u2019t improved in Venezuela, we have to extend TPS and then two weeks later, to say, actually things are absolutely fine in Venezuela,\u201d Taufa said.",
      "Ferro, from South Florida, said her group is planning litigation. Trump targeted TPS in his first term and court battles ensued, with an appeals court ruling in 2020 that he could end TPS. Many TPS holders have been living in fear since Trump\u2019s re-election.",
      "Rafael Struve, communications director for Bienvenido, a conservative Latino group that helped elect Republicans, said the TPS curtailment \u201chas me at a crossroads, trying to understand the concerns of both sides.\u201d",
      "Struve, who was born in the U.S. to Venezuelan parents, said he still has family in the country and his family has been affected by the country\u2019s political and economic crises.",
      "\u201cI, like many Venezuelans, was very supportive of President Trump. I very much believed he would take a firmer stance on the Maduro regime,\u201d he said.",
      "But he said he was confused by a DHS statement in a memo that the agency, along with the State Department, had concluded that \u201cthere are notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s very, very debatable. Based on what I am hearing from folks who live there right now, the situation has not improved economically. If that were true, many people would go back and would not be leaving. Venezuela continues to have the largest exodus of any other country on planet Earth.\u201d",
      "Trump has had heavy support in the Venezuelan community, in part because of his tough stand against Maduro in his previous term. But the increased post-pandemic arrivals of Venezuelans seeking asylum have caused a split in the community, with some moving, along with other Americans, to a more hawkish view on immigration.",
      "Hours before leaving office at the end of his first term, Trump granted a different form of protection to Venezuelans, Deferred Enforced Departure, for 18 months. That expired in July 2022, and those eligible were able to apply for TPS.",
      "The presence of members of Tren de Aragua in the U.S. has also helped instill some wariness toward newer arrivals.",
      "In 2023, as shelters in major cities overfilled and strained resources in places like New York City, President Biden responded by granting Temporary Protected Status to all Venezuelans who had lived in the U.S. since July 2023. That allowed them to be able to work sooner than they would if they followed the asylum process.",
      "The Venezuelans affected by the latest curtailment of TPS by the Department of Homeland Security affects those who became eligible for it in 2023. Their protection was due to end this April, but Biden extended it through fall 2026. Trump's DHS published a notice in the Federal Register on Monday that said the TPS would end in April, as originally scheduled.",
      "Last week, the administration also cut short the TPS of Venezuelans who had received it in 2021 and had gotten an extension until fall 2026. Trump is ending their TPS in September.",
      "A limited number of people with TPS can pursue separate immigration paths to obtaining a green card, such as by applying for asylum, marrying a U.S. citizen or being sponsored by an employer or family member.",
      "Struve said that while he understands that Trump has a mandate on immigration, he\u2019s hoping that more consideration is given to perspectives from Latin America policy experts.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing this bifurcation of perspective on what to do with the Venezuela situation, with folks in the wing of Kristi Noem and Homeland Security wanting to attack it from immigration standpoint, but the fact of the matter is the best policy to turn off the spigot is making sure that Maduro is gone.\u201d",

      "\u201cLuka Don\u010di\u0107 joining forces with the Los Angeles Lakers is a seismic event in NBA history,\u201d Los Angeles general manager Rob Pelinka said. \u201cWhen those two powerful forces come together it brings basketball joy to the world.\u201d",

      "When asked if he relayed to the team he wasn\u2019t willing to sign the extension, Don\u010di\u0107 shook his head and said \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 10:01:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Shrewd decisions by Eagles GM Howie Roseman has Philadelphia in its second Super Bowl in three years.",
    "story": [
      "Sometimes a promotion isn\u2019t really a promotion. At least not in the case of Howie Roseman, who oversaw the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 free agency and draft strategy from 2010 to 2014, only to have those duties stripped and given to then-head coach Chip Kelly.",
      "Kelly proceeded to run the team while Roseman managed salary and off-the-field staff. But when Kelly was fired five days before the final game of the 2015 regular season, the franchise gave Roseman another crack at being general manager.",
      "He hasn\u2019t looked back.",
      "\u201cAs it turned out, it was probably the best thing that ever happened to me,\u201d Roseman said on NBC\u2019s \u201cProFootballTalk\u201d in 2018. \u201cDid I ever think I would be back in a significant position in Philadelphia? No. I don\u2019t think that I did. But I was just determined that I was going to try to do the right thing every day and get better and learn more.\u201d",
      "Since having been reinstated in that role, Roseman has led the Eagles to three Super Bowl appearances\u00a0\u2014 a win in 2017, the first in franchise history \u2014 and four NFC East titles. Philadelphia faces the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday for another league championship.",
      "\u201cHis career is at an absolute apex right now,\u201d Michael Barkann said on NBC Sports Philadelphia\u2019s postgame show after the Eagles defeated the Washington Commanders in the NFC championship game. \u201cHe\u2019s won general manager of the year, he might win it again, and he might win it many, many, more times the way he\u2019s constructed this Eagles team.\u201d",
      "NBC Sports\u2019 Reuben Frank said,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s one win away from the Hall of Fame, most likely.\u201d",
      "The Eagles got here largely thanks to smart offseason moves by Roseman. Here were the decisions that led to arguably the most talented roster in the NFL today.",
      "April 2020: Drafts quarterback Jalen Hurts 53rd overall out of Oklahoma",
      "Philadelphia selected Hurts in the second round after his stellar play at both Oklahoma and Alabama, where he started his college career before a transfer. Hurts began as a backup behind Carson Wentz, but poor play by Wentz led Hurts to get playing time late in his rookie season. He never gave the job back.",
      "Though he is only 6-foot-1, his physique and speed make him a perfect dual-threat quarterback. And while he has the ability to take off and run (and execute the \u201ctush push\u201d play better than anyone else in the NFL), his passing ability is also strong. This season he completed a career-high 68.7% of his attempts.",
      "At 46-20 as a starter, Hurts again has Philadelphia on the verge of winning the Lombardi Trophy.",
      "March 2020: Trades with Lions for cornerback Darius Slay",
      "Roseman traded a third-round pick (No. 85 overall) and a fifth-round pick (No. 166) in 2020 to get the star defensive back. Slay immediately signed a three-year, $50 million extension to remain in Philadelphia.",
      "Slay, a six-time Pro Bowler, was a key contributor to both the NFC champion team in 2022 and this year\u2019s title contender. He had 13 passes deflected during the regular season, 13th most in the league. In three postseason games this year, he has 10 solo tackles and an interception.",
      "April 2021: Trades up to take wide receiver DeVonta Smith 10th overall out of Alabama",
      "Philadelphia traded the No. 12 pick and the No. 84 pick in the 2021 draft for the 10th selection and took Smith, the Heisman Trophy winner, to bolster its pass-catcher corps. He has been that and more. Over four seasons, Smith has 308 receptions for 4,011 yards and 27 touchdowns.",
      "Smith has become the perfect complement to star wideout A.J. Brown (more on that in a second) because of his elite speed, shiftiness and strong hands. His route running and separation against defensive backs are also among the NFL\u2019s best.",
      "Smith, 26, could be a difference maker Sunday against a Kansas City secondary that ranks in the middle of the league in most categories.",
      "September 2021: Tackle Jordan Mailata signs three-year, $64 million extension",
      "Mailata, a former Australian rugby player, was drafted as a flier in the seventh round of the 2018 draft. Flash forward to 2024 and he anchors one of the best offensive lines in football.",
      "Pro Football Focus ranks Mailata as the best offensive tackle in the NFL. According to ESPN Analytics, he \u201cwins\u201d 92% of his matchups on passing plays. Oh, and he\u2019s instrumental on the tush push.",
      "Mailata has signed three different contracts (this extension and then a new three-year deal last offseason) to tie him to the Eagles through the 2028 season.",
      "April 2022: Trades with Saints in a deal that eventually nets receiver A.J. Brown and DT Jalen Carter",
      "Philadelphia sent New Orleans the 16th overall pick, the 19th overall pick and a sixth-rounder in exchange for No. 18 overall, a third-rounder, a seventh-rounder, a 2023 first-round pick and a 2024 second-round pick.",
      "The move proved to be a long-term gold mine. Roseman took the first- and third-round selections from that deal and flipped them in a trade with the Tennessee Titans for Brown.",
      "The 2023 first-round pick they got from the Saints? The Eagles used it to trade up with the Chicago Bears for the ninth overall pick and took defensive tackle Jalen Carter out of Georgia.",

      "April 2024: Drafts defensive backs Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean",
      "Philadelphia took Mitchell 22nd overall out of Toledo. It then traded both of its second-round picks (No. 50 and No. 53) and a fifth-rounder to Washington for No. 40 and No. 78. The former ended up being DeJean of Iowa, the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year in 2023.",

The following offseason they opted to let their star running back hit the free agent market rather than pay him what he felt he was valued at.",
      "The Eagles did \u2014 with a three-year, $37.75 million contract \u2014 and it has been worth that and then some. Barkley led the league with 2,005 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. He has 442 yards on 66 carries (a 6.7-yard average) and five rushing scores this postseason alone.",
      "Barkley, 27, is a finalist for NFL MVP and a main reason Philadelphia could win a Super Bowl.",
      "The Giants, meanwhile, cut Jones midseason. He was seen in Barkley\u2019s suite earlier in the playoffs cheering on his friend and former teammate. For New York fans, it doesn\u2019t get much worse than that."

      "Rubiales is accused of sexual assault for kissing Hermoso, the Spain forward, at the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup final presentation ceremony in Sydney, as well as of coercion for allegedly trying to convince the player to support his version of the kiss. Hermoso says she did not consent to the kiss while Rubiales says it was consensual.",
      "De la Fuente said during his brief appearance in court that he spoke with Hermoso only about two months ago at a gala. He was at the Women\u2019s World Cup final in Australia but said he did not have any discussions with Spanish federation officials about the kiss and alleged attempts to support Rubiales.",
      "The 47-year-old Rubiales and three other former federation officials \u2014 former Spain women\u2019s coach Jorge Vilda, former sports director of the Spain men\u2019s team Albert Luque, and former head of marketing Rub\u00e9n Rivera \u2014 are accused of pressuring Hermoso to defend Rubiales publicly in a statement after the incident, which she refused to do.",
      "\u201cNobody talked to me or asked me about\u201d a possible statement, De la Fuente said.",
      "The coach said that when he visited the federation in the days following the scandal, he only \u201ctalked about football\u201d and business related to his position as the men\u2019s national coach.",
      "De La Fuente last week had his contract with the men\u2019s national team\u00a0extended\u00a0to 2028.",

      "Cuervo said he wrote up some of Hermoso\u2019s comments to a local radio station to release them to the media. He said Hermoso asked if they wanted her to do a video with the comments, and he said that it was not necessary.",
      "Hermoso\u00a0testified\u00a0on the first day of the trial on Monday and said she \u201cfelt disrespected\u201d by Rubiales after winning the Women\u2019s World Cup final and the kiss \u201cstained one of the happiest days of my life.\u201d",
      "The kiss sparked outrage in Spain about the prevalence of sexism in sports and beyond.",
      "Rubiales has yet to testify and denied the charges.\u00a0He resigned\u00a0under pressure three weeks later and was banned by FIFA for three years. Rubiales had\u00a0said he was the victim\u00a0of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by \u201cfalse feminists.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors, Hermoso and the Spain players\u2019 association want Rubiales jailed for two and a half years, fined 50,000 euros ($51,800) for damages, and banned from working as a sports official. They want the other three defendants sentenced to one and a half years in prison.",
      "The trial will continue on Wednesday. It is expected to last at least 10 days. Rubiales attended the first day on Monday."

      "It\u2019s a suitable concept \u2014 meant to be liberally interpreted, of course \u2014 for the first Met Gala exhibit in more than 20 years to focus exclusively on menswear, specifically Black style in menswear over the centuries.",
      "The Met\u2019s Costume Institute also announced on Tuesday that it will be reviving what it called a longstanding tradition of a \u201chost committee\u201d \u2014 basically a new slate of high-profile celebrities on top of the previously announced gala hosts: Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky and LeBron James. (Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who oversees the gala each year, rounds out the list.)",

      "\u201cHistorical definitions of dandyism range from absolute precision in dress and tailoring to flamboyance and fabulousness,\u201d Miller said. The show will focus specifically on Black dandyism; more broadly, it will chronicle the ways in which Black people have used dress and fashion over the centuries to transform their identities, the museum said.",
      "Among the artists contributing to the exhibit design is Torkwase Dyson, who will use her signature \u201chypershapes\u201d to create standalone monumental sculptures, or \u201carchitectural zones.\u201d Artist Ik\u00e9 Ud\u00e9, a consultant for the show, will curate a section that highlights Julius Soubise, one of the first Black dandies who challenged societal norms in 18th-century London.",
      "The show will be divided into 12 sections, each representing a characteristic that defines \u201cdandy\u201d style: ownership, presence, distinction, disguise, freedom, champion, respectability, jook, heritage, beauty, cool, and cosmopolitanism.",

    "story": [
      "After the biggest year of his professional career \u2014 which resulted in five Grammy Awards for his iconic Drake diss \u201cNot Like Us\u201d \u2014 rapper Kendrick Lamar will take the biggest stage in America when he performs at the Super Bowl on Sunday.",
      "Lamar\u2019s performance, which will also include singer SZA, is highly anticipated after he dominated both culture and music charts for much of 2024. And the people who helped put him onstage aren\u2019t shying away from the hype.",
      "\u201cEveryone will agree this is a halftime show like none other in Super Bowl halftime history,\u201d Jesse Collins, the executive producer of the show, told NBC News. \u201cThe creative concept is really something brilliant, spectacular and special. In all of our years of doing this \u2014 and I think every show that we\u2019ve done has been amazing \u2014 but I have never seen an artist take this creative approach to it.\u201d",
      "Roc Nation, the entertainment company and NFL partner that produces the halftime show, first tabbed Lamar to headline the Super Bowl last summer. He was already a critically acclaimed rapper, and his stardom reached another level after the May 4 release of \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d the knockout blow in his feud with Drake, the Canadian rapper.",
      "The song broke multiple streaming records and earned Lamar five Grammy awards, making it the most decorated rap song in the award show's history.",
      "Not long after the song was released, Lamar got a phone call from Roc Nation founder Jay-Z asking him whether he would perform at the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the stars aligning,\u201d Roc Nation CEO Desiree Perez told NBC News. \u201cWe would hope that every single year someone accomplishes what Kendrick has accomplished this particular year. You can\u2019t even really plan for something to align so perfectly.\u201d",
      "Lamar\u2019s halftime performance will also be the first since the NFL and Roc Nation extended their partnership \u2014 which encompasses both live music and social justice efforts \u2014 in October. Roc Nation\u2019s halftime shows have been well-received, with the 2022 show featuring Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Mary J. Blige becoming the first Super Bowl halftime to win an Emmy.",
      "Perez said the NFL has been very trusting as a partner, never once questioning a decision about the artist selection.",
      "\u201cWhat we bring to the table is not just booking the show; it\u2019s also understanding the environment that we\u2019re going into and understanding what\u2019s going on now,\u201d Perez says. \u201cUnderstanding the pulse of culture at the moment when the show is going to happen and doing that with precision is what I think we\u2019ve been able to master.\u201d",
      "Planning for a Super Bowl halftime typically begins immediately after the previous one, which means Roc Nation has been in meetings for Sunday\u2019s show since last February. During the week of the game, preparation will reach a fever pitch.",
      "Lamar will have at least three days on the field to rehearse before Sunday, and on those days the performers will run through the entire set multiple times. The halftime show is unique in terms of timing and staging \u2014 Lamar has exactly eight minutes to get on the field and six minutes to get off, without damaging the surface where the game is supposed to take place. (Simply getting the stage on and off the field takes more than 100 people, Collins said.)",
      "As for what to expect during the show itself, everyone is predictably tight-lipped. Perez said that whether or not other artists will be involved is entirely up to Lamar, though she said there will be \u201ca few surprises that we haven\u2019t seen in the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cKendrick is one of the most creative, incredible artists of our lifetime, and ... he is not going to disappoint,\u201d she said when she was asked directly what fans should be excited for.",
      "Collins said: \u201cRoc Nation, Jay, Kendrick and his whole team, we\u2019ve all really busted our ass to figure out something different. And I think people are going to be blown away.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A good humidifier provides a range of health benefits, such as more moisturized skin, help fighting off allergens and even defense against dry lips and mouth, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). If you use the appliance often, then knowing how to clean your humidifier and making sure it stays in good shape is especially important for your health. Cleaning the humidifier regularly will ensure that it doesn\u2019t grow mold and present health risks in the future.",

      "SKIP AHEAD Why do humidifiers need to be cleaned? | How to clean a humidifier | Tips for cleaning different types of humidifiers | Why trust NBC Select?",
      "Why do humidifiers need to be cleaned?",
      "Since the inside of a humidifier contains stagnant water of varying temperatures and little ventilation, it\u2019s susceptible to growing residue. \u201cThe biggest issues with humidifiers are the build-up of a slimy film in the reservoir, potential bacteria and mold growth, and mineral build-up,\u201d says Melissa Maker, author and founder of cleaning site Clean My Space. \u201cAll of which can be pumped into the air you breathe.\u201d Additionally, how you clean your humidifier may depend on the type, such as ultrasonic, steam, evaporative or impeller, which we explain more in our roundup of the best humidifiers.",
      "Plus, it\u2019s important to clean your humidifier so that you can actually benefit from using it, says Delah Gomasi, founder of Maid For You. \u201cOne of the things that hinders its performance is scale (mineral deposit) buildup which clogs pretty much everything from the misting plate and water reservoir to the filter and crevices within the machine,\u201d he says. \u201cSimply put, when scale buildup prevents misting, there is no humidification taking place.\u201d",
      "How to clean a humidifier",
      "Unplug the humidifier and let it sit for a few minutes if it\u2019s warm to the touch.",
      "Pour out any water sitting in the tank and use a paper towel to wipe away any visible \u201cslime\u201d or residue.",
      "Remove all detachable parts, such as the water tank. If you\u2019re cleaning an evaporative humidifier, this includes the filter inside.",
      "Soak a paper towel in warm soapy water and wring out the excess water. Wipe the inside of the water tank clean. Alternatively, use a sprayable dish soap, such as Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray, to lightly coat the inside of the tank. Use a moist paper towel to wipe it clean.",
      "Add equal parts white vinegar and water to the tank and let it sit for 30 minutes. This will help get rid of any odors or remaining residue. Pour out the mixture.",
      "Rinse the tank, let it dry completely and then add clean water when you\u2019re ready to use it again.",
      "Tips for cleaning different types of humidifiers",
      "Since there are humidifiers that create mists in different ways (such as cool-mist and warm mists) some of them have parts that need to be cleaned that others don\u2019t. Plus, some humidifiers require replacement filters.",
      "Evaporative humidifiers: These types of humidifiers have an internal filter, such as a wick filter (mesh-like filter that resembles a sponge). If your humidifier\u2019s filter is reusable and relatively new, you can clean it by soaking it in vinegar and water for 30 minutes. Then, use a nylon bristle brush to scrub off any residue. Let dry before replacing. If your humidifier has a wick filter, it\u2019s best to replace it with a new one, such as the Durabasics Premium Humidifier Filter, and buy multi-packs of them.Ultrasonic/impeller humidifiers: An ultrasonic humidifier, which doesn\u2019t have a filter, uses ultrasonic vibrations to release water into the air. Maker recommends focusing on descaling the inside, especially if you use hard unfiltered water with a lot of mineral deposits for your humidifier. The Durgol Universal Multipurpose Descaler can help remove any scaling in your humidifier.   Steam vaporizers: This is a type of warm-mist humidifier that uses heat to create steam. Remove the water tank and use warm soapy water and/or a vinegar soak to clean it.",

      "\u201cA humidifier should be cleaned at least once a week if it\u2019s used regularly,\u201d says Robin Murphy, president of cleaning company Maid Brigade. This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria, mold and minerals that can affect both the performance of the humidifier and the air quality in your home.\u201d If you only use a humidifier every once in a while, such as when you\u2019re sick, then it\u2019s fine to clean it once a month, says Murphy. It\u2019s important, however, to empty out the tank after each use and allow the parts to dry before using it again.",
      "As Murphy mentioned earlier, not cleaning a humidifier can lead to mold and bacteria growth. This is a byproduct of stagnant water and moisture inside of a container with little to no ventilation. You should really only have water in the humidifier if you\u2019re actively using it, otherwise keep it empty when it isn\u2019t on.",
      "While bleach does a good job of getting rid of bacteria and mold, Murphy doesn\u2019t recommend using bleach or bleach-based cleaning products to clean a humidifier, unless it\u2019s done with caution. This is because the residual smell can irritate the eyes and respiratory system, especially since the machine is releasing moisture into the air. If you do use bleach, use a small splash of it diluted with water and use the same method with white vinegar, rinsing thoroughly after.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 19:52:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Two transgender young adults and five families of trans minors filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday challenging two executive orders President Donald Trump issued over the last two weeks that aim to prohibit federal funding of transition-related health care for anyone under 19, and define sex as biological, only male and female and unchangeable.",
    "story": [
      "Two transgender young adults and five families of trans minors filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday challenging two executive orders President Donald Trump issued over the last two weeks that aim to prohibit federal funding of transition-related health care for anyone under 19, and define sex as biological, only male and female and unchangeable.",
      "\u201cThe Executive Orders were issued for the openly discriminatory purpose of preventing transgender people from expressing a gender identity different from their sex designated at birth\u2014and expressing governmental disapproval of transgender people who, by definition, have a gender identity that does not align with their sex designated at birth,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cThese Orders are part of a government-wide effort by the Trump Administration to restrict legal protections and essential services for the transgender community.\u201d",
      "One of the plaintiffs, Kristen Chapman, said she and her family moved to Virginia in the summer of 2023 after their home state of Tennessee passed a law banning gender-affirming medical care for trans minors like her 17-year-old daughter, Willow. The family struggled to find a provider in Virginia who would accept Medicaid, which is a government health care program for people with limited income. Chapman said the family paid for Willow\u2019s care out of pocket, but it became \u201cprohibitively expensive.\u201d After trying for a few months, she said they were finally able to schedule an appointment for Jan. 29 at VCU Medical Center in Richmond, which would take Medicaid.",
      "\u201cThe day before our appointment, President Trump signed the executive order at issue in this case. The next day, just a few hours before our appointment, VCU told us they would not be able to provide Willow with care,\u201d Chapman said in a statement shared by the ACLU. \u201cI thought Virginia would be a safe place for me and my daughter. Instead, I am heartbroken, tired, and scared.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the District Court of the District of Maryland, requests that a judge immediately block the executive orders, which it argues are illegal and unconstitutional because the president does not have the authority to withhold federal funds that have been previously approved by Congress. The suit also argues that the order restricting transition care violates parents\u2019 fundamental rights and the rights of trans people under 19 by discriminating against them based on sex, as the order allows people under 19 who are not trans to continue receiving the same treatments for other medical conditions.",
      "The White House and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal, ACLU of Maryland and private law firms Hogan Lovells and Jenner & Block filed the suit on behalf of the families and young adults who are all members of PFLAG National, a nonprofit that supports the friends and families of LGBTQ people. PFLAG and GLMA, the largest national association of LGBTQ and allied health professionals, some of whom have had federal funds withheld under the orders, are also named as plaintiffs.",
      "Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior counsel and health care strategist for Lambda Legal, called the orders \u201cmorally reprehensible and patently unlawful.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe federal government \u2014 particularly, this administration \u2014 has no right to insert itself into conversations and decision-making that rightly belongs only to patients, their families, and their medical providers,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis broadside condemns transgender young people to extreme and unnecessary pain and suffering, and for minors, it subjects their parents to agonized futility in caring for their child \u2014 all while denying them access to the same medically recommended health care that is readily available to their non-transgender peers.\u201d",
      "One of the orders, \u201cDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\u201d declared that the U.S. government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, and that \u201cthese sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.\u201d It prohibits agencies from promoting gender ideology and argues that it will \u201cdefend women\u2019s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.\u201d",
      "The other order at issue in the lawsuit, titled \u201cProtecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\u201d prohibits federal funding from covering transition-related medical care \u2014 including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery \u2014 for children, which it defines as those younger than 19. Medical schools and hospitals receiving federal research or education grants also have to \u201cend the chemical and surgical mutilation of children,\u201d the order states.",
      "The sweeping order could affect more than just programs receiving federal funds. For example, it also directs the secretary of health and human services to change section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits health care discrimination and, as a result, has required health insurance plans under the act to cover transition-related care. It also instructs the director of the Office of Personnel Management to bar trans care for minors in the Federal Employee Health Benefits and Postal Service Health Benefits programs for 2026.",
      "The order argues that the country has an obligation to protect children from \u201cirreversible medical interventions.\u201d",
      "\u201cCountless children soon regret that they have been mutilated and begin to grasp the horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding,\u201d the order states, using inflammatory language to describe transition-related care. It goes on to allege without citing evidence that these youths\u2019 \u201cmedical bills may rise throughout their lifetimes, as they are often trapped with lifelong medical complications, a losing war with their own bodies, and, tragically, sterilization.\u201d",
      "More than half of states across the U.S. have already enacted measures to restrict transition-related care for minors, but since Trump\u2019s order last week, a number of hospitals in states without these restrictions have stopped such care for patients under 19 or announced that they are reviewing it. The White House announced in a news release Monday that hospitals in New York City, Colorado, Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., have either suspended or announced that they are reviewing their transition care programs for minors.",
      "Though Trump\u2019s order seeking to restrict such transition care implies that it is a widespread threat to children, recent research has shown that a small number of minors actually access this type of care. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics in January found that less than 0.1% of adolescents with private insurance in the U.S. are transgender or gender-diverse and are prescribed puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones.",
      "Most major medical associations, such as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, support access to transition care for minors and oppose restrictions on it.",
      "Trump issued multiple executive orders during his first two weeks in office that seek to restrict trans rights. In addition to the two mentioned in the lawsuit, he also signed\u00a0 an order prohibiting trans people from enlisting and serving in the military. At least three other lawsuits have been filed against these orders \u2014\u00a0two from transgender women serving time in federal prison who would be denied transition care under the order and transferred to men\u2019s prisons, and one from transgender service members and those seeking to enlist. A judge blocked prison officials from transferring one of the trans inmates on Sunday."

      "\u201cI woke up and I felt a lot more settled. I wasn\u2019t fully healed or anything like that, but I felt settled that he was watching over us and looking out for us,\u201d Holker said.",

With the sun and Mercury close to their North Node, an ability to think ahead will make it easier to anticipate the moves of their opponents. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the Chiefs won\u2019t put up a fight!\u201d",

    "summary": "Trisha Paytas made her Broadway debut in \"Trisha Paytas' Big Broadway Dream.\" Here's what happened, and how the internet star pulled it off.",
    "story": [
      "In \"Trisha Paytas' Big Broadway Dream,\" anything was possible.",
      "Through her 90-minute Broadway debut, the internet icon not only invented Broadway and Diet Coke, she also traveled back in time to the 1860s and finally understood gravity.",
      "If you're like, \"Huh? What? Oh, haha, OK,\" so was the audience in the St. James Theatre on Feb. 3, where Paytas leaned into her niche for some 1,700 of her fans, plus thousands tuning in on a worldwide livestream to watch her achieve her lifelong dream of starring on Broadway.",
      "\"It's the perfect blend of everything \u2014 it's a little bit Trish, and it's a lot of bit Broadway,\" Paytas told TODAY.com an interview ahead of her performance. \"So I've been just taking it all in because it's even more than I imagined. I saw the finale, and I was just like crying because I didn't think this was, like, possible.\"",
      "Paytas pulled out references to her now viral YouTube videos, while also bringing out Broadway legends like Sutton Foster, Ben Platt and Rachel Zegler as guests in exaggerated, onstage interviews for a makeshift version of her podcast (while also singing some duets, of course.)",
      "The 36-year-old internet personality has been filming her life for the better part of two decades, amassing more than 5.1 million subscribers on YouTube, where she's known for her vlogs, mukbangs and of course, music covers (which have spanned Broadway hits like \"Beetlejuice,\" \"Wicked\" and many others).",
      "The absurd, one-night-only special gave fans around the world a glimpse into the mind of Paytas \u2014 complete with throwbacks to her meme-worthy moments (like crying on her kitchen floor), while also incorporating nods to her podcast with Broadway stars.",
      "In the sold-out special, Paytas proved she's made a name for herself beyond the internet, starring on Broadway just months after she made a cameo on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Paytas gave TODAY.com a behind-the-scenes look as she was rehearsing for the show to make her Broadway dreams come true.",
      "\"That's why I'm losing my voice today,\" Paytas said after her second day of rehearsals. \"Because I was just like, going crazy.\"",
      "It all started as a joke. Seriously.",
      "The idea of Paytas starring on Broadway started less than a year ago \u2014 as an April Fools' Day joke.",
      "Kobi Kassal, producer of \"Trisha Paytas' Big Broadway Dream\" and editor-in-chief at Theatrely.com, told TODAY.com ahead of the premiere he always runs a couple of silly articles on his website for April Fools' Day. So in 2024, he published an article that said Paytas would be making her Broadway debut as Roxie in \"Chicago\" over the summer.",
      "\"It was just believable enough where I thought people would get a kick out of it, but we made it very, very clear that it was not true,\" Kassal said. \"It was all in fun, because we love her so much.\"",
      "Kassal posted the article and sent it out on social media before heading to a preview performance of \"Cabaret\" on Broadway. During intermission, Kassal said he turned on his phone and began receiving hundreds of notifications.",
      "\"Trisha had posted that article to every social media platform, like Instagram stories, on the actual grid, on her Twitter, it was everywhere,\" Kassal recalled. \"She had posted it and she was kind of playing along with it and egging it on. She was like, 'Can't wait.'\"",
      "After reading comments that people had bought tickets for dates they thought Paytas would be in \"Chicago,\" Kassal said he worried he had taken it too far.",
      "\"But why can't Trisha be on Broadway? Why can't this be a thing?\" he remembered asking along with another Broadway producer, George Strus.",
      "The pair put their heads together and approached Paytas' team. \"Since April, we've been slowly working with her and her team, and now today, we're at our first rehearsal of her own Broadway musical,\" Kassal said.",
      "Paytas said the article, though it was originally a joke, is \"the ultimate power of manifestation.\"",
      "\"I Google myself from time to time, and I saw the article, and for a minute, I thought it was real. I was like, 'Wow, maybe I missed an email, maybe it's real,'\" she said. \"So I posted it because, you know, I always think \u2014 well, maybe the people on 'Chicago' will see the hype.\"",
      "\"I think the majority were like, 'Oh my God, this is amazing,' not realizing it was an April Fools' article, but it did manifest this show, which is kind of even better to have your own,\" she said.",
      "Rehearsals, celeb guests, a livestream \u2014 oh my!",
      "Paytas flew in on a red eye a week before the show. She arrived in New York City on Tuesday morning and immediately headed to rehearsals for the next six days.",
      "Why can't Trisha be on Broadway? Why can't this be a thing?\u201d",
      "kobi kassal\u00a0producer of 'Trisha Paytas' Big broadway dream'",
      "The show, which proclaims it's completely original and never-been-done-before, borrowed elements from \"A Christmas Carol\" and followed Paytas as she has a nightmare about never performing on Broadway.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re really diving into the mind of Trisha Paytas and discovering her love of Broadway and figuring out what it means to create a Broadway show and be a Broadway star,\u201d Kassal said of the show.",
      "The \"ghosts\" of Broadway past, present and future (Foster, Platt and Zegler, respectively) arrived to help Paytas on her journey to find herself by starring on a makeshift podcast set (a reference to Paytas' \"Just Trish\" podcast) and sitting for an interview before singing Broadway hits.",
      "Joy Woods played the role of \"Broadway\" in the show, serving as the show's narrator and appearing in person toward the end of the special.",
      "Paytas said she didn't think having names like Woods, Foster, Platt or Zegler would be possible for her show.",
      "\"It's very surreal,\" she said. \"I think I was psyching myself out as a little intimidated \u2014 but after going through the vocal practices, everyone's so nice. Sutton Foster's the nicest person. All that stuff makes me feel so much better, because it's intimidating, you know? I'm excited, and I'm honored to have them be a part of it.\""

      "Quan\u2019s story has been well documented. A child star who appeared in 1985's \u201cThe Goonies\u201d and \u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d before that, he faded from the limelight and went roughly two decades without starring in a movie before he burst back onto the scene in \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d a role that earned him a best supporting actor Academy Award in 2023 and raves for his moving acceptance speech at the Oscars.",

      "Astin did not appear to be at the ceremony, but he would make his presence felt at the theater the very same day. He later posed with the cast on the red carpet for the premiere of the upcoming movie \u201cLove Hurts,\u201d which just so happens to star Quan and Astin.",
      "The \u201cGoonies\u201d cast has reunited before, with several members getting together virtually in the early days of the pandemic in 2020. That event featured Quan, Astin, Brolin, Feldman, Green, Plimpton, Cohen, Columbus, Spielberg and director Richard Donner, along with fellow stars Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano.",
      "There has also been chatter for years that a \u201cGoonies\u201d reboot or sequel was in the works, with a report coming out last month that a new project is in development at Warner Bros."

We continue to share a belief in that mission and will continue our work together at the foundation, but we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives. We ask for space and privacy for our family as we begin to navigate this new life.\u201d",

While I\u2019d always assumed I\u2019d be a working mom, Bill\u2019s schedule as CEO was all-consuming, and I knew I wanted my kids to have the kind of family life I\u2019d had growing up \u2014 full of books and science experiments and after-school glasses of iced tea with my mom. Not every woman has the option to say home with her kids, and I felt very lucky that I did. At the time, and under the circumstances, it seemed like a no-brainer.\u201d",
      "Over time, she changed her mind.",

That decision is personal for each woman, but for me, it came down to this: If I wanted my daughters and son to truly believe that women can do anything, I needed to model that for them.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 17:02:18 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump says he wants access to Ukraine's supply of rare earth minerals in exchange for American military aid for the country's war against Russia.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he wants access to Ukraine\u2019s bonanza of rare earth and critical minerals in exchange for the billions of dollars in military aid Washington has been supplying to Kyiv.",
      "It\u2019s an idea previously suggested by Republican senators and Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelenskyy, who sought to appeal to Trump\u2019s dealmaker persona as a way of keeping alive Washington\u2019s support of Kyiv.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they\u2019re going to secure what we\u2019re giving them with their rare earth and other things,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. \u201cI want security of the rare earth, and they\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d",
      "As well as being a global breadbasket \u2014 Ukraine is a huge supplier of wheat and other agricultural commodities \u2014 the country also has a rich seam of rare earth and critical minerals.",
      "Elements such as lithium, gallium and neodymium are crucial in producing a vast range of technologies that include electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and cutting-edge military hardware. As such, the U.S. and China among others have increasingly coveted them.",
      "Trump\u2019s comments Monday came as Ukraine and its European neighbors anxiously awaited details of his plan to end the war in Ukraine that Russia launched with its full-scale invasion three years ago.",
      "Though the president has offered few details of how peace might be achieved, his overriding complaint has been that European nations have not contributed as much as the $175 billion in assistance that makes America Ukraine\u2019s biggest donor.",
      "He also reiterated his long-held desire Monday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to stop that ridiculous war.\u201d",
      "That impulse has prompted nervousness among Kyiv\u2019s supporters that Trump may try to force a ceasefire favorable to Russian President Vladimir Putin. With Russia making steady battlefield gains, Putin has shown no appetite for a truce without significant territorial gains and a promise Ukraine will never join NATO.",
      "Zelenskyy has said in the past that he sees the war as one between Russia and the West, not just Ukraine, and as such has implored Western countries to provide more weaponry.",
      "The Ukrainian president has also made positive comments about working with Trump \u2014 some analysts say that he has little choice \u2014 and now there appears to be some agreement on the subject of rare earth minerals.",
      "China dominates the global market for rare earth metals, securing rights to mine some 60% and produce up to 90% of the world's supply, according to the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies.",
      "That's partly due its vast \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure project through which it has developed ties to resource-rich countries. But also its willingness to process these environmentally damaging materials on behalf of Western countries, which until recently have been happy to offload this burden.",
      "Ukraine is a key player, too, with upward of 5% of the world\u2019s mineral supply, according to its national Geological Association. Many of those crucial minerals are under the frigid trenches and minefields in eastern Ukraine, however, and at risk of falling into the hands of Putin.",
      "Commenting on Trump\u2019s interest in rare earth minerals, Zelenskyy on Tuesday told reporters in Kyiv that his country was open to investment by American companies, Reuters reported.",
      "On Monday his office welcomed Trump\u2019s comments as \u201cpart of the Victory Plan that President Zelensky presented to President Trump in the fall,\u201d but warned that \u201cwe must ensure the security of Ukraine and these resources so that Russia does not simply seize them physically.\u201d",
      "That so-called \u201cvictory plan,\u201d proposed by Zelenskyy in October, offered \u201cstrategic partners\u201d such as the U.S. \u201ca special agreement\u201d to access deposits of uranium, titanium, lithium, graphite that Ukraine says are worth trillions of dollars.",
      "Trump appearing to adopt this plan shows Zelenskyy\u2019s success in appealing to the president\u2019s dealmaker instinct, according to Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy knows how Trump likes to make deals, and this plan was to make Ukraine an asset, not a liability,\u201d Lutsevych said. \u201cBut we still do not know Trump\u2019s strategy. We know bits of it but he says very little, and we only know what he says.\u201d",
      "When asked about Trump's comments, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday that it was merely \"an offer to buy aid\" rather than \"provide it on a free of charge basis.\"",
      "\"It is better, of course, not to provide it at all and thereby contribute to the end of the conflict,\u201d Peskov added.",
      "Though many in Europe still fear that Trump may hand Putin a win, Ukrainians themselves appear to trust the American president more than their E.U. counterparts. A December poll by the New Europe Center, a Ukrainian nongovernmental organization, found more than 44% of respondents said they trusted Trump \u2014 higher than most other European countries.",
      "One of those maintaining a positive outlook is Taras Byk, 41, a consultant and civil activist in Kyiv. He told NBC News that the rare-earth proposal would be a \u201cwin-win scenario for both Ukraine and the USA.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe would like to cooperate as equal partners,\u201d he said, \u201cif this exchange will lead to the retreat of Russia, such an option is much better than war.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London and Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv."

      "A small girl in a pink sweater waved goodbye through the smudged window of a bus as it prepared to depart Gaza on Saturday, packed with 37 ill and injured patients, most of them children with cancer, in need of medical treatment that Gaza's war-ravaged hospitals cannot provide.",
      "It was the first time in nine months that medical evacuees have been able to leave Gaza by the Rafah border crossing, and outside Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, weary mothers held their sick and listless children wrapped up in coats, anxiously waving their documents at officials to confirm their place.",
      "But their departure was bittersweet \u2014 only a few patients made the list that day, and each could bring only one companion.",
      "A small boy who tried to squeeze his way onto the bus with his sick brother and mother was escorted off.",
      "\u201cThey did not allow me to pass,\u201d Khalil, 8, still sobbing from being separated from his family, told NBC News' crew. \u201cMy brother went with my mom; he is sick.\u201d",

      "\u201cTrauma injuries, think about amputees, many of them children. Spinal cord injuries, burns, which need multiple different specialized operations and rehabilitation, which they currently cannot get in Gaza. The other is patients for oncology, cancer patients, chronic diseases and cardiovascular diseases, which need to be medevaced out of Gaza.\u201d",
      "The conflict has destroyed much of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, causing its health system to collapse. Beyond the enormous needs of the skyrocketing number of war wounded, hundreds of thousands of people with acute and chronic illnesses were left with limited or no access to medicine and treatment.",
      "According to the WHO, from the start of the war on Oct. 7, 2023, to when the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, Gaza's health care system sustained more than 1,200 direct attacks, including at least 660 on health facilities, and over 1,000 attacks that affected health care workers.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces says Hamas operates command centers at hospitals, uses ambulances to transport fighters and diverts fuel aid intended for hospital use to military purposes, charges that Hamas and hospital staff members deny.",
      "The scale of the crisis for patients remains overwhelming, and for some children, it is too late.",
      "Dr. Muhammed Abu Salmiya, the director general of Al-Shifa Medical Complex, once Gaza's top hospital, said two of the children scheduled for evacuation Saturday died before they could make the journey.",
      "Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called for 2,500 children to be \u201cimmediately evacuated with the guarantee that they will be able to return to their families and communities.\u201d",
      "Medical evacuations were rare even before the Rafah crossing closed. From October 2023 to May, the United States, hospitals, various nongovernmental organizations and local officials in Gaza were able to quietly move just 150 patients, most of them children, out of Gaza for lifesaving care.",
      "After the Rafah crossing shut down when Israeli forces captured it in May, the improbable became nearly impossible.",
      "The last significant evacuation appeared to have been in June, when 21 critically ill children were evacuated from the Gaza Strip."

      "Four years after a military coup that has morphed into a grinding civil war, experts say there is a growing mental health crisis in the Southeast Asian nation, made worse by the junta\u2019s atrocities against civilians and a humanitarian disaster that has left more than 3 million people displaced.",
      "They find some relief at the Mae Tao Clinic on the outskirts of Mae Sot, a border town in neighboring Thailand.",
      "Each morning, hundreds of Burmese arrive at the clinic, waiting to see a doctor, receive vaccinations or get a prenatal checkup. Some are living in refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, while others have jobs as migrant workers or have crossed into Thailand illegally.",
      "The donor-funded clinic, which opened in the 1980s with only four beds, has since evolved into a full-fledged primary health facility that offers a range of free services, including psychiatric care. It says its 700 doctors, nurses, medics and volunteers treat 120,000 people a year, a number that may increase after a freeze on foreign aid by the Trump administration that threatens to close U.S.-supported health care facilities treating Myanmar refugees in Thai border camps.",
      "Those who have fled Myanmar \u201chave so many traumas,\u201d said Thein, a Myanmar refugee who is one of the psychiatric care unit\u2019s two Burmese-speaking psychiatrists.",
      "On Tuesdays and Fridays, the two days the unit is open, Thein walks past the bustling outpatient wards and crosses a tranquil bamboo garden to his office. It is a single-story cement building painted light blue, with the windows and doors covered in translucent black film to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Thein, 36, sees about 10 patients a day in one-on-one sessions. They include rebel soldiers injured on the front lines as well as political refugees and migrant workers.",
      "\u201cThey have flashbacks and nightmares at night and they cannot sleep,\u201d said Thein, who has been in Mae Sot for a year and asked not to be identified by his full name to protect his safety and that of his family.",
      "While the clinic has social workers and counselors for patients with milder mental health issues, Thein works with the most serious cases.",
      "\u201cI can give counseling to them, like mindfulness or meditation or breathing,\u201d he said. But often his patients also require medication, which the clinic provides for free.",
      "Thein said he sometimes struggles with anxiety himself stemming from the abuse he received from the junta.",
      "Like most of his patients, Thein\u2019s life took a turn on Feb. 1, 2021, when the Myanmar military \u2014 which has ruled the former British colony for much of its history since it gained independence in 1948 \u2014 overthrew democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Peaceful protests broke out immediately, to which the new military government responded with deadly violence.",
      "According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit group that has documented killings and arrests since the coup, the junta has killed at least 6,000 people and arrested more than 28,000. On Friday, Myanmar state media reported that the state of emergency that has been in place since the coup had been extended for another six months, further delaying promised elections.",
      "Though the junta remains in charge, its hold on power has slipped in the face of a coordinated offensive by ethnic rebel groups that have fought the Myanmar military for decades. In the past year the government has lost control of vast swaths of territory around the country, creating instability along Myanmar\u2019s borders with Thailand, India, China and others.",
      "\u201cI want to help my friends, but I don\u2019t want to kill people,\u201d Thein said. \u201cSo I treated the wounded people or wounded soldiers.\u201d",
      "Thein was arrested in 2022 on suspicion of helping the resistance and sent to Myanmar\u2019s notorious Insein Prison.",
      "\u201cThey tortured me with a whip. I think six people beat me during the interrogation. It was really scary,\u201d Thein recalled, as he raised his hands around his head to demonstrate how he tried to protect himself.",
      "Thein was released after a year of detention. Fearing another arrest, he left his life in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city, and fled to Thailand.",
      "Mae Sot has long been a place for Burmese to seek sanctuary, but it is an uneasy refuge. It is filled with people waiting for resettlement, living with constant anguish while facing the risk of arrest and deportation.",
      "Every month, Burmese who lack the documents needed to stay in Thailand legally have to pay local police 300 baht ($9) to obtain a card that prevents them from being detained or deported, but many find this fee unaffordable.",
      "\u201cSome patients were arrested on the way to the clinic by the Thai police because they have no documents,\u201d Thein said.",
      "The clinic\u2019s founder, Cynthia Maung, was also a doctor in Myanmar before she fled in 1988 amid a crackdown by the military government on a pro-democracy uprising.",
      "\u201cI think the struggles now and back then are very similar,\u201d she said.",
      "Mental health is often neglected in Myanmar, where Thein was trained. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2019 there were only 117 psychiatrists and two mental health hospitals in the country of 54 million people.",
      "Shwe Zin Aung is one of Thein\u2019s patients and has been struggling with bipolar disorder for a decade.",
      "The 35-year-old teacher arrived in Mae Sot from Myanmar\u2019s capital city, Naypyidaw, in early December, following in her brother\u2019s footsteps. She said that in addition to free medication, the clinic provided her with a safe place to talk about her feelings.",
      "Though she said she had not personally faced any abuse from the junta, \u201cit is so frustrating to see them brutally shoot the protesters,\u201d she said.",

Israel retaliated with an air and land assault on Gaza,\u00a0killing more than 47,000 people, most of them civilians, according to local officials. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been displaced.",
      "The scale of Israeli counteroffensive has led to international condemnation, but Netanyahu has defended his actions, most recently en route to Washington.",

      "Just days after the Oct. 7 attack, Trump told a crowd at a campaign rally that Netanyahu had \u201clet us down\u201d during his first administration, arguing that he had been unhelpful before\u00a0the United States killed a top Iranian general. That led to criticism from his Republican rivals, and Trump later posted on social media, \u201c#IStandWithIsrael\u201d and \u201c#IStandWithBibi,\u201d using Netanyahu's nickname.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u2019s moves to dismantle the U.S. agency that helps to fight starvation and poverty overseas has stoked fears that America will lose its standing on the world stage as rival powers rush to fill the void.",
      "Concerns are growing in Washington that temporarily halting assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development \u201copens up a window for China and Russia,\u201d George Ingram, a former senior USAID official, told NBC News in a telephone interview Thursday.",
      "He was one of several experts to caution that the decision would lead to American influence waning in Africa, South America and Asia where it addresses a range of needs from health care to clean water, distributing aid to nongovernmental organizations, aid agencies and nonprofits.\u00a0USAID\u00a0has also provided millions of dollars in military aid to Israel and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cNobody anticipated\u201d that Trump would suspend most foreign aid \u201cand then decapitate USAID of its personnel,\u201d said Ingram, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order halting foreign aid funding for at least 90 days so his administration could review the program\u2019s compatibility with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy.",
      "Since then, hundreds of USAID employees and contractors have been fired or furloughed and most foreign assistance has come to a  standstill; as of Monday, USAID\u2019s website no longer loads on the web, resulting in a message that its server IP address cannot be found.",
      "Earlier Monday, the world's richest person, Elon Musk, dubbed a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d by the White House, said that the plan was to shut USAID down.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It\u2019s beyond repair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re shutting it down.\u201d",
      "The billionaire appointed by Trump to run the Department of Government Efficiency, said that he had spoken in detail about USAID with the president, who \u201cagreed we should shut it down.\u201d",
      "\u201cI actually checked with him a few times [and] said, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019\u201d Trump responded, \u201cYes,\u201d Musk added.",
      "Asked Monday about whether it would take an act of Congress to abolish USAID, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think so \u2026 we just want to do the right thing.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said Monday that he was now the acting director of USAID and that he had tapped Pete Marocco, director of foreign assistance at the State Department, to begin reviewing all the work done by USAID. He also warned that certain projects or programs might be suspended or eliminated.",
      "The Trump administration plan was not \u201cabout ending the programs that USAID does, per se,\u201d he said. But Marocco\u2019s review could lead to the \u201csuspension or elimination of programs, projects or activities; closing or suspending missions or post; closing, reorganizing, downsizing, or renaming establishments, organizations, bureaus, centers, or offices; reducing the size of the workforce at such entities and contracting out or privatizing functions or activities performed by federal employees,\u201d Rubio added.",
      "Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Rubio said: \u201cThis is not about getting rid of foreign aid.\u00a0 There are things that we do through USAID that we should continue to do, that makes sense.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll have to decide is that better through the State Department, or is that better through something, a reformed USAID?\u201d",
      "But the freeze on funding was already \u201chaving a direct effect on people whose lives are already vulnerable,\u201d Peter Taylor, director of the Institute of Development Studies, said in a telephone interview Thursday. In one case a workshop on sanitation programming was immediately halted, he added.",
      "A review by the Congressional Research Service last month found that USAID provided assistance to around 130 countries with Jordan, Syria, Ethiopia and South Sudan among the top 10 recipients. But top of the list was Ukraine which has been at war with Russia for almost three years, since President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of the country.",
      "It has also provided millions of dollars in military aid to Israel, while providing humanitarian help to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip during Israel\u2019s military offensive in the enclave.",
      "Despite the freeze on funding, NBC News reported last month that Rubio issued a waiver for foreign military financing for both Israel and Egypt. A waiver was also approved for \u201cemergency food assistance and administrative expenses, including salaries, necessary to administer such assistance.\u201d",
      "In Fiscal Year 2023, the U.S. dedicated more than $44.6 billion on international development worldwide, according to USAID. But that represents less than 1% of its budget for foreign assistance, a smaller overall share than some other countries.",
      "\u2018America\u2019s enemies will rejoice\u2019",
      "Founded as an independent agency in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, USAID was designed to counter the influence of the then-Soviet Union during the Cold War and to run various foreign assistance programs, based on the idea that American security was tied to stability and economic advancements in other nations.",
      "Since then, foreign aid has been widely viewed as a cornerstone of soft power, a term popularized in the 1980s by U.S. political scientist Joseph Nye to describe the ability to influence others to deliver desired outcomes.",
      "The decision to suspend assistance without any warning will already \u201chave a significant impact,\u201d Ingram said, adding it would \u201cdo serious damage to the trust that the U.S. has built up over the years in many countries carrying out a foreign aid program that is dependable and is seen as working in the interests of those countries.\u201d",
      "Michael Schiffer, who served as the assistant administrator of the USAID Bureau for Asia from 2022 until January, was more blunt in his assessment in an opinion piece published on the online forum Just Security.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration has just put America last, while handing a gift to our biggest adversaries, notably China,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAmerica\u2019s alliances will suffer. U.S. partners will be at risk. And America\u2019s enemies will rejoice,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. national security could \u201cerode,\u201d with abrupt changes to development programs risking instability in countries around the world, potentially influencing extremism and deepening migration crises, he added.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s allies have offered similar warnings.",
      "During the Senate Budget Committee confirmation hearing for\u00a0 Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s pick for budget chief, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. warned last month of the importance of soft power as a \u201ccritical component of defending America and our values.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get involved in the world and you don\u2019t have programs in Africa where China\u2019s trying to buy the whole continent, we\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concept of soft power means a lot to me \u2014 and that\u2019s coming from a pretty hawkish guy.\u201d"

      "The Rwanda-backed rebels\u00a0who seized the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s key city of Goma announced a unilateral ceasefire in the region Monday for humanitarian reasons, following calls for a safe corridor for aid and hundreds of thousands of displaced people.",
      "The M23 rebels said the ceasefire would start Tuesday. The announcement came shortly after the U.N. health agency said at least 900 people were killed in last week\u2019s fighting in Goma between the rebels and Congolese forces.",
      "The city of 2 million people is at the heart of a region home to trillions of dollars in mineral wealth and remains in rebel control. The M23 were reported to be\u00a0gaining ground in other areas of eastern Congo\u00a0and advancing on another provincial capital, Bukavu.",
      "But the rebels said Monday they did not intend to seize Bukavu, though they earlier expressed ambition to\u00a0march on Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, a thousand miles away.",
      "\u201cIt must be made clear that we have no intention of capturing Bukavu or other areas. However, we reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions,\u201d M23 rebel spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said in a statement.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Congo\u2019s government.",
      "The rebels\u2019 announcement came ahead of a joint summit this week by the regional blocs for southern and eastern Africa, which have called for a ceasefire. Kenya\u2019s President William Ruto said the presidents of Congo and Rwanda would attend.",
      "Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies, or G7, urged parties in the conflict to return to negotiations. In a statement on Monday, they called for a \u201crapid, safe and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians.\u201d",
      "Congolese authorities have said they are open to talks to resolve the conflict, but that such a dialogue must be done within the context of previous peace agreements. Rwanda and the rebels have accused the Congo government of defaulting on previous agreements.",
      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012 when they first briefly captured Goma then withdrew after international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "The latest fighting forced hundreds of thousands of people who had been displaced by years of conflict to carry what remained of their belongings and flee again. Thousands poured into nearby Rwanda.",
      "The fighting in Congo\u00a0has connections with a\u00a0decades-long\u00a0ethnic conflict.",
      "M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsi in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsi are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsi and others in Rwanda.",
      "Many Hutu fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda said the group is \u201cfully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges.",
      "On Monday, families desperate to identify their loved ones besieged morgues as body bags were loaded onto trucks for burials in Goma.",
      "A weeping Chiza Nyenyezi recalled how her son died from a gunshot injury after a bullet went through his chest. \u201cHis entire chest was open,\u201d Nyenyezi said.",
      "Louise Shalukoma said her son\u2019s body could not be immediately recovered from the streets because a bomb detonated as people tried to retrieve it.",
      "\u201cMy God, my fourth child, when I saw that he was dead I said, \u2018Lord, what am I going to do?\u2019\u201d she lamented. \u201cThis M23 war came for me in Goma.\u201d"

      "Starting Feb. 10, China will impose an additional tariff of 15% on coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement automobiles and pickup trucks, the government said.",
      "The Chinese announcement came minutes after the U.S. tariff took effect at 12:01 a.m. ET, the only one to go ahead after President Donald Trump paused 25% tariffs he had announced on goods from Canada and Mexico.",

      "In addition, Beijing announced an investigation into Google for alleged anti-trust violations, and export controls on items related to tungsten and other rare earth elements that are critical components of high-tech products.It also said U.S. gene sequencing company Illumina and PVH Corp., the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, would be added to the \u201cunreliable entity list,\u201d restricting their ability to operate in China.",

      "The additional U.S. tariff \u201cseriously violates WTO rules and is an egregious act, representing typical unilateralism and trade protectionism,\u201d a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said.",
      "The U.S. has blocked the appointments of appellate judges to the World Trade Organization since Trump\u2019s first term, leaving it largely unable to mediate international trade disputes. But China could still use a lawsuit to gather international support against the U.S. tariffs.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. approach severely undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system, damages the foundation of Sino-U.S. economic and trade cooperation, and disrupts the stability of global industrial and supply chains,\u201d the Chinese Commerce Ministry said.",

      "The impacts of Donald Trump\u2019s long-promised pledge to use tariffs as a political cudgel started to come into focus Monday, even as the president cut last-minute deals with some of the country\u2019s closest allies allowing him to back down from his initial threats.",
      "On Saturday, Trump announced that he would slap broad 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, both U.S. allies, and 10% tariffs on China, a political foe. The move was expected, but it still sparked fears about the rising costs of goods across the U.S. economy.",
      "That concern is particularly potent because Trump campaigned heavily on lowering costs and easing inflation. If they are fully implemented, Trump's tariff proposals would affect American households' purchasing power by $1,000 to $1,200 annually, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.",
      "The first domino to fall came early Monday, when Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced a deal had been reached to delay tariffs on her country by one month, in return for Mexico\u2019s agreeing to beef up its presence at the border with the United States with 10,000 members of its national guard.",
      "It was an effort to placate the Trump administration, which at times has been inconsistent with its messaging about the rationale for tariffs but has consistently said curbing the flow of drug trafficking into the United States is a main focus.",
      "Trump officials quickly took a victory lap after the announcement, even as several steps to avoid a potential heated trade war remain.",
      "\u201cSo for literally three days, I heard the far left in this country say that these tariffs would make Americans' life worse,\u201d Vice President JD Vance said at an event in Ohio in response to a question from NBC News. \u201cAnd what actually happened is the Mexican government was so afraid of the tariffs that they actually are taking their border enforcement and their anti-cartel activity more seriously.",
      "\u201cThat is not a pathway to making Americans worse off,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a pathway to making Americans better off.\u201d",
      "Trump posted on Truth Social that he had a \u201cvery friendly conversation\u201d with Sheinbaum, a quick shift in tone. Over the weekend, she rejected what she called \u201cslander\u201d from Trump for suggesting her government had an alliance with drug traffickers.",
      "The past few days have shown one thing: Trump's tariff threats were not necessarily hollow campaign rhetoric.",
      "\u201cOne thing that is different is that leaders need to realize that Trump is serious,\u201d Heritage Foundation research fellow EJ Antoni said. \u201cIf they just think it\u2019s all bluster or campaign promises, nothing will really change, right? They have to know he is serious.\u201d",
      "Antoni predicted continued \u201cde-escalation\u201d as Trump\u2019s threats start to be interpreted as real, because of the size of the U.S. economy and the disproportionate trade relationships with Canada and Mexico. The two allies are America's largest trading partners, but international trade accounts for a much larger percentage of their overall economies.",
      "\u201cHe economically holds all the cards\u201d he said. \u201cHe has now made clear this is serious and happening. You can either get on the train, get off the tracks or get run over.\u201d",
      "At times, inconsistent rhetoric has come from the Trump administration about the motivation for tariffs. Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro told reporters in Washington on Monday that the fight is not a trade war but \"a drug war,\" echoing comments of other advisers.",
      "Trump himself, though, has repeatedly said he is concerned that the targets of the tariffs bully the United States and that the tariffs can be a weapon to end that perceived mistreatment.",
      "For example, hours after the Mexico deal was announced, Trump continued to antagonize Canada, claiming the only thing it could do to avoid tariffs is become the 51st state \u2014 which Canada has repeatedly said it would not do.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see ... Canada become our 51st state,\u201d Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with reporters when he was asked what Canada could do to end the pending trade war. \u201cWe give them protection, military protection. We don\u2019t need them to build our cars \u2014 I\u2019d rather see Detroit or South Carolina ... or any one of our states build the cars.\u201d",
      "Trump spoke shortly before he was scheduled to have his second call of the day with outgoing Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. Unlike from Mexico, little fentanyl comes across the U.S.-Canadian border. Trudeau told reporters Saturday night that it is less than 1% of all the supply in the United States.",
      "A 30-day delay on tariffs on Canada was announced Monday afternoon after that second call. Trudeau said he had a \u201cgood call with President Trump,\" who has used him as a political bogeyman for months. As part of the deal, Trudeau said the country would spend $1.3 billion on a border security plan and appoint a \u201cfentanyl czar.\u201d",
      "The Canadian government first proposed the border security funding part of the plan last year.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Canadian government did not reply to a request seeking comment about whether the already proposed plan was used as part of the deal with Trump.",
      "The White House did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "Most congressional Republicans have not commented publicly on whether they support Trump\u2019s push for tariffs on historic political and economic allies, with a few exceptions. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, was the first to chime in Monday morning when he took to X to \u201cplead\u201d with Trump to consider tariffs\u2019 impacts on his agriculture-heavy state.",
      "\u201cBiden inflation increase the input cost to farming by 20% incl particularly high prices on fertilizer,\u201d Grassley wrote. \u201cSo I plead w President Trump to exempt potash from the tariff because family farmers get most of our potash from Canada.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told Newsmax that he shares \u201cthe market\u2019s concern\u201d about long-term tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt Americans, American companies, American exporters. It will hurt American consumers long term,\u201d he said.",
      "While Trump brokered 30-day reprieves with Canada and Mexico, it is unclear how the tariff fight will end with them, and the threats against China \u2014 by far the largest economy of the three \u2014 were not resolved Monday.",
      "China has said\u00a0it will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and pursue \u201ccountermeasures\u201d in response.",
      "There is little indication that Republican senators will start to speak out in large numbers against Trump\u2019s threats of trade wars, even if there is a prolonged fight on the issue.",
      "\u201cThere might be a few,\u201d said a political adviser to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. \u201cBut generally, I think there is a sense that Trump holds all the cards here. To the extent there is concern about home state constituencies, I think a lot of that will be expressed quietly and behind the scenes.\u201d",
      "Another veteran Republican familiar with Thune\u2019s thinking said he is unlikely to react in any overtly public or rash way.",
      "\u201cThese are U.S. senators. They have egos like everyone else,\u201d the person said. \u201cSen. Thune approaches things differently. He is more of a read-the-room guy. I\u2019d not expect him to act impulsively on anything, including this.\u201d",
      "The impacts of potential tariffs, for now, have been averted, but the future remains unclear, which leaves uncertainty both in the United States and around the globe. U.S. markets fell early Monday, but they quickly rebounded after the one-month Mexico pause was announced.",
      "Though Trump ran on the promise that tariffs would be good for the nation, in recent days, he has begun to acknowledge that if they are fully implemented there would be some short-term pain. But he now argues that those bumps and bruises would be beneficial to the nation in the long run.",
      "\u201cWill there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!),\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cBut we will make America great again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid. We are a country that is now being run with common sense \u2014 and the results will be spectacular!!!\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio has empowered a top official at the State Department to run the U.S. Agency for International Development and begin reviewing all of the work done by the government agency targeted for dismantling by President Donald Trump and tech billionaire adviser Elon Musk.",
      "Rubio tapped Pete Marocco, the director of foreign assistance at the State Department, to begin reviewing all of the work done by USAID. He also warned that certain projects or programs might be suspended or eliminated.",
      "Marocco held several national security positions during the first Trump administration, including at USAID, where his attempts to consolidate power and slash funding drove officials to write a dissent memo that ultimately pushed him out of office, according to multiple sources who spoke with NBC News.",
      "Marocco has worked closely with the administration\u2019s other political appointees at USAID during the first weeks of Trump's second term, two current USAID officials with knowledge of the agency\u2019s new leadership structure and a source familiar with USAID\u2019s day-to-day operations said.",
      "Other people familiar with the agency\u2019s operations say Marocco has largely directed the downsizing of the agency from afar.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing now is frighteningly similar to everything he was trying to do at USAID before, but this time he\u2019s destroying it,\u201d said a USAID official familiar with Marocco's past actions.",
      "\u201cIf someone in the private sector did this with no mitigation plan, their stakeholders would go ape s---,\u201d a USAID staffer said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been responsible for building anything ever. He\u2019s very good at turning things off and questioning things and making people feel uncomfortable. He\u2019s taken apart a lot of things.\u201d",
      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those characterizations of Marocco, who has also been tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "In early 2023, online sleuths who aided the FBI in cases against hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters identified Marocco and his now-wife as being among the rioters who stormed the Capitol in 2021, pointing to multiple images of them on the Capitol grounds that day and CCTV video that shows the man they identified as Marocco entering the Capitol through a broken window.",
      "Photos of the person who entered the building were a strong facial recognition match for publicly available images of Marocco, online sleuths said. Marocco, like hundreds of others whom sleuths identified as people who entered the Capitol, was not charged before Trump pardoned all Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "Marocco did not respond to a request for comment. Reached by D Magazine last year, he did not deny that he entered the Capitol, but he referred to \u201csmear tactics and desperate personal attacks.\u201d",
      "USAID has already largely been run out of the State Department since Inauguration Day, multiple sources said.",
      "Rubio had sent a letter informing the relevant congressional committee chairs and ranking members of the Trump administration\u2019s plans to reorganize USAID, four sources familiar with the letter\u2019s delivery said.",
      "In the letter, Rubio told the lawmakers that he is initiating \u201cconsultations\u201d with them about how foreign aid is distributed around the world through the program.",
      "\u201cUSAID has numerous conflicting, overlapping, and duplicative functions that is shares with the Department of State. Additionally, USAID\u2019s systems and processes are not well synthesized, integrated, or coordinated and often result in discord in the foreign policy and foreign relations of the United States,\u201d Rubio wrote. \u201cThis undermines the President\u2019s abilities to carry out foreign relations.\u201d",
      "Marocco\u2019s review could lead to the \u201csuspension or elimination of programs, projects or activities; closing or suspending missions or post; closing, reorganizing, downsizing, or renaming establishments, organizations, bureaus, centers, or offices; reducing the size of the workforce at such entities and contracting out or privatizing functions or activities performed by Federal employees,\u201d Rubio added.",
      "Trump administration officials are actively considering placing USAID under the State Department\u2019s authority, more than a dozen current and former officials and sources familiar with the discussions have said. As of Monday, USAID\u2019s website no longer loads on the web, resulting in a message that its server IP address cannot be found.",
      "USAID employees based out of the nation's capital were ordered overnight not to come into the office Monday and to work from home.",
      "\"At the direction of Agency leadership, the USAID headquarters at the Ronald Reagan building in Washington, D.C. will be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, February 3, 2025,\" said an email sent to staff members overnight, according to a copy obtained by NBC News.",
      "The message said agency personnel who normally work at USAID's headquarters \"will work remotely tomorrow\" except for people who perform essential on-site and building maintenance duties. \"Further guidance will be forthcoming,\" it said.",
      "The email gave no reason for the work-from-home directive. Musk, who has been closely advising Trump after he was tapped to lead his Department of Government Efficiency, said in the early hours Monday that he and Trump were in the process of shutting down USAID.",
      "USAID, which President John F. Kennedy established in 1961, and has been the U.S. government's main international humanitarian and development arm.",
      "According to a recent Congressional Research Service report, more than 10,000 people work at the agency, about two-thirds of them overseas. In recent years, USAID has \"provided significant humanitarian, development, and economic support to Ukraine and countries affected by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, as well as humanitarian assistance in Gaza and elsewhere,\" the report says.",

      "Trump signed an executive order Saturday to place 25% tariffs on nearly all goods coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday. The move risked triggering a trade war with two of American\u2019s closest trading partners that could have driven prices higher for American consumers on a variety of goods, including cars, fresh produce, homebuilding materials and gasoline.",
      "Trump also placed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports and took steps to close a loophole that allows Chinese e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein to avoid tariffs by shipping packages worth less than $800 into the United States duty free. Those tariffs went into effect on Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. ET, shortly after which China announced its own tariffs on some U.S. products.",

      "Stocks fell Monday morning in response to the tariff announcement over the weekend but recovered some of the losses after the agreement with Mexico was announced. The United States imports more goods from Mexico than any other country, and economists and business groups had warned the tariffs could raise prices in the United States and trigger an economic slowdown.",
      "During his first term, Trump also threatened to place tariffs on Mexico, before he backed away less than two weeks later when Mexico responded with plans to deploy its national guard throughout the country to crack down on immigration and expand a program in which some migrants seeking asylum in the United States would wait for their immigration court hearings in Mexico.",
      "Trudeau had announced Saturday night that Canada would respond to Trump's tariffs by issuing its own 25% tariff on $155 billion Canadian worth of U.S. goods. That was set to include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, the day the United States said it would begin collecting tariffs on Canadian goods.",

      "Tariffs on Canada would have driven prices higher for a wide variety range of goods, including lumber, cars and heating fuel, industry analysts said.",
      "The White House said in the executive order issuing the tariffs that the move was in response to the flow of fentanyl and immigrants coming into the country from Canada and Mexico, which Trump was declaring a national emergency.
