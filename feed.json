      "Weinstein, 72, was sent to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan for an \u201cemergent treatment due to an alarming blood test result that requires immediate medical attention,\u201d his attorney, Imran Ansari, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIt is expected that he will remain there until his condition stabilizes,\u201d the statement continues. \"His deprivation of care is not only medical malpractice, but a violation of his constitutional rights.\u201d",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Rocky Balboa fans are ready to go the distance \u2014 by bus, by ice skates, by 72 steps \u2014 to honor Philly\u2019s favorite fictional fighter almost 50 years after the first movie launched the enduring series of an underdog boxer persevering despite the odds.",
      "Yo, Adrian, Philly finally did it!",
      "The city Rocky called home at last has a week dedicated to the box office heavyweight champion of the world a year after the inaugural Rocky Day was held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art steps.",
      "It\u2019s Rocky, so of course there\u2019s a sequel.",
      "This year, it\u2019s RockyFest.",
      "The Rocky Bus Tour served as Round 1 over the weekend before the festival truly laced up its gloves for Tuesday\u2019s kickoff event \u2014 on Dec. 3, the 1976 release date of \u201cRocky\u201d \u2014 with area elementary school students running the Rocky steps.",
      "From there, Rocky is feted with a mural unveiling, movie marathons, RockyU discussions on the enduring appeal of Sylvester Stallone\u2019s most famous character, look-alike contests and even a bus tour. The tour weaves Rocky fanatics through the city and includes stops at Adrian and Paulie\u2019s fictional graves (not far from the real one for former Phillies announcer Harry Kalas), the Italian Market where Rocky trained, and the exterior site of Mighty Mick\u2019s Gym.",
      "\u201cIf no one has seen the movie,\u201d tour guide Adam Clements said before a recent trip, \u201cthere will be spoilers.\u201d",
      "Rocky fans can even recreate Rocky and Adrian\u2019s first date at a local ice rink.",
      "It seems almost as improbable as Rocky Balboa lasting 15 rounds with champion Apollo Creed that it took so long for Philadelphia to properly honor \u201cRocky\u201d and the other eight movies in the series (including three \u201cCreed\u201d films).",
      "Whether natives like it or not, Rocky is as much a part of the fabric of the city as the Founding Fathers and the Liberty Bell.",
      "Before most fans chug their first raw eggs of the day, the Rocky statue at the base of the museum steps already boasts a line that often snakes around the corner for most of the day. Movie clips are played ad nauseam \u2014 usually Adrian imploring Rocky to win \u2014 on the big screen at sporting events. The strains of \u201cGonna Fly Now\u201d stir ahead of kickoff for all Eagles games. Rocky\u2019s faithful followers run a 50-kilometer race each year that follows his trumped-up training route in a grueling tribute to their mythical champ.",
      "There\u2019s even a merchandise stand at the steps that sells \u201cItalian Stallion\u201d robes and plush Clubber Lang dolls a short run from where Paul C\u00e9zanne and Claude Monet\u2019s works hang in the museum.",
      "Choose your favorite canvas, there\u2019s a little something for everyone.",
      "While Stallone and \u201cCreed\u201d star Michael B. Jordan have made previous promotional stops at the Rocky steps, no actors were expected to attend this year's events.",
      "The 78-year-old Stallone did appear last year at a rain-soaked Rocky Day and credited the city for the character's success as much as anything the weathered fighter achieved on the big screen.",
      "\u201cI've been around the world,\u201d Stallone said. \u201cBut for some reason, these 72 steps inspire me, excite me. It's like you get to the top, you feel inspired, you feel special, hopeful, happy. Most of all, proud of yourself. To all of you, who, believe it or not are real-life Rockys, because you live your life on your own terms, you try and do the best you can and you just keep punching.\u201d",
      "The 1976 film won a best picture Oscar and in 2020 finished tied for No. 2 in The AP Top 25 favorite sports movies poll.",
      "The Philadelphia Visitors Center hatched RockyFest \u2014 which runs through Dec. 8 \u2014 in part for an overdue appreciation of the series as well as connecting locals and tourists to movie sites beyond the bronze statue.",
      "\u201cFor years, there were tourists coming every single day to get their photo at the Rocky statue and there was nothing here officially to greet them,\" said Maita Soukup, of the Philadelphia Visitor's Center. \u201dThere were no maps, no signage, no sort of visitor services infrastructure here at the Rocky statue and steps, even though it was such a big tourist attraction. That's why we wanted to open a visitor's center here. In the process of the city pursing that, Sly Stallone reached out to us and was like, let's do this in partnership.\u201d",
      "Just like Rocky, if the first festival is successful, expect II and III and IV and more.",

      "Bobby Flay\u2019s latest cookbook is really a sort of recipe for how Bobby Flay was made",
      "NEW YORK -- Bobby Flay's latest cookbook is really a sort of recipe for how Bobby Flay was made.",
      "The chef, restaurateur and TV personality has compiled 100 of his most important dishes into a lush, beautifully photographed coffee table book he hopes will inspire home cooks.",
      "\u201cThis is certainly my most important book to me and I think is going to be my most important book to people who consider themselves my readers,\u201d Flay says.",
      "\u201cBobby Flay: Chapter One: Iconic Recipes and Inspirations from a Groundbreaking American Chef,\u201d has dishes from his restaurants like Mesa Grill, Bolo, Bar Americain and Gato, and his epic runs on \u201cIron Chef.\u201d",
      "\u201cInterestingly enough, when I was going through the database of all these thousands of recipes, they popped out at me immediately,\u201d he says.",
      "Three dishes from Mesa Grill that stayed on its menu from the time the restaurant opened in 1991 to when it closed 26 years later \u2014 including Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Tamale \u2014 made the book. As did Steamed Baby Clams with Saffron-Tomato Broth and Scallion Croutons from Bolo and an \u201cIron Chef\u201d stunner \u2014 Curried Fried Chicken with Charred Lime.",
      "The book is broken up into just three sections \u2014 seafood, meat and vegetables \u2014 with Flay avoiding making a chronology of dishes for fear of confusing readers. All have been updated to reflect today's ingredients and techniques.",
      "\u201cWhat I want people to do is, even though it\u2019s this beautiful sort of coffee table book, I do want them to use it either by cooking from it directly or being inspired by it,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cSo when somebody says, \u2018I want to cook fish tonight, I got that Bobby Flay cookbook, let me open to the fish section\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to inspire them.\u201d",
      "Most illuminating are the eight essays Flay wrote that describe a career that has won four Daytime Emmys, multiple James Beard Awards and the honor of cooking a state dinner for President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "Readers will learn that Flay struggled at school \u2014 although smart, he had a learning disability \u2014 and a turning point came when he was a temporary busboy leaving his last shift at the restaurant Joe Allen and the chef asked if he wanted a job in the kitchen.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t know that I wanted to cook for a living. I was 17 years old or something. I was just like, 'Well, I don\u2019t have anything to do today. I don\u2019t know where my friends are, so fine. Like, where do I find an apron?\u2019\u201d",
      "Flay, soon turning 60, learned he had to work with his hands to be inspired and food unlocked something in him. It is, he says, how he shares his love.",
      "\u201cI remember waking up one morning a handful of months after I started working, laying in bed, staring at the ceiling. And I\u2019m like, \u2018I can\u2019t wait to go to work today,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cI never felt that feeling before.\u201d",
      "Flay hit the ground running, soon working for Jonathan Waxman at Bud's, reborn as a red-headed Irish-American New Yorker loving the food of Southwest and Mexico. As he traveled his repertoire grew \u2014 Spanish, Italian and French.",
      "\u201cI am always thrilled to see somebody cooking something interesting. I get inspired by it,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s face it: We\u2019re watching what everybody else is doing. I mean, you can\u2019t just sit in a room and just come up with a brand new cuisine.\u201d",
      "Flay also became a Food Network star, hosting such shows as \u201cGrillin\u2019 & Chillin\u2019\u201d and \u201cBoy Meets Grill\u201d and competition shows like \u201cBobby\u2019s Triple Threat\u201d and \u201cBeat Bobby Flay,\u201d which has a new holiday-themed series this year featuring Marcus Samuelsson, Eric Adjepong and Brooke Williamson.",
      "Not all his food became iconic, like his liberal use of Calabrian chilies. When he opened Bolo, he created what he believed would be its signature dish \u2014 a paella with duck and lobster. His staff weren't so sure, but he insisted. The New York Times critic would later rave about Bolo but said of the paella that the lobster \"looks as if it fell into the dish and wonders how it is ever going to get out.\u201d",
      "Flay credits many people for his success, saying food is a collaborative field. Take his Lamb Shank with Toasted Orzo, Roasted Garlic and Oven-Dried Tomato. He says chef Tom Valenti was one of the first to serve lamb shanks in the city and Flay's twist was to add orzo, making a comforting winter dish. A food writer later offered a tip: toast the orzo in a dry pan to give it a nutty flavor.",
      "\u201cI did it and it worked and it was amazing and people loved it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe food world is a wonderful place because it\u2019s helmed by people who are generous with their thoughts and their experience.\u201d",
      "He loves the camaraderie of the kitchen and the challenge and is tired of hearing negativity about the restaurant business. \u201cListen, it gave somebody like me a life, forget about a career,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll see on shows like \u2018The Bear\u2019 and stuff like that that it\u2019s not so much about how much gratification the customer gets. It\u2019s more about the battle and the challenge to get through the evening and work alongside people and get something good on the plate.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- Mat\u00edas Tarnopolsky will become president and CEO of the New York Philharmonic on Jan. 1 after six years heading the Philadelphia Orchestra, a hiring boosted by his long friendship with incoming music director Gustavo Dudamel.",
      "Tarnopolsky's appointment was announced Monday. The 54-year-old, who has American, British and Argentine citizenship, fills a void created when Gary Ginstling quit in July just one season into the job.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done a really wonderful job with Philadelphia, and one of the most important issues was that he has a very close relationship with Gustavo Dudamel,\u201d philharmonic co-chairman Peter W. May said. \u201cThat was really the most important factor for us.\u201d",
      "Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Tarnopolsky played clarinet and received bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in music and musicology from King's College, London. A performance of Mahler\u2019s Fifth Symphony by Leonard Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic at the 1987 BBC Proms had an especially memorable impact.",
      "He was the New York Philharmonic's vice president of artistic planning from December 2005 until August 2009, then spent nine years as executive director of Cal Performances at Berkeley until moving to Philadelphia in 2018. Cal hosted Dudamel and the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Symphony Orchestra in several residencies.",
      "He called his return to the New York Philharmonic along with Dudamel a \u201cfull circle moment,\u201d recalling hitting it off with the conductor during a work visit to Caracas. \u201cI watched him work with the kids of the Sim\u00f3n Bolivar and was just blown away, and so we invited him to conduct the New York Philharmonic. So this is a story almost two decades in the making,\u201d Tarnopolsky said in an interview.",
      "Ginstling joined the New York Philharmonic as executive director from Washington's National Symphony Orchestra.",
      "\u201cFrankly, it just wasn\u2019t a good fit from both Gary's perspective and our perspective,\" May told The Associated Press. \"Mat\u00edas clearly had significantly more experience than Gary has had in terms of leading one of the top orchestras in the country and we're quite confident that this is the right guy for the job.\u201d",
      "Philharmonic co-chairman Oscar L. Tang said Tarnopolsky is aligned with the vision held by Dudamel and the board.",
      "\u201cGustavo says that he feels classical music is a human right and he wants to view classical music as a force for social development, social good,\u201d Tang said. \u201cThese are some of the aspirations that Peter and I have for the New York Phil in terms of extending its role in the cultural and civic life of New York City and really the country and the world.\u201d",
      "The New York Philharmonic returned to a renovated Geffen Hall in October 2022, announced Dudamel\u2019s hiring four months later.",
      "Borda said guest conductors have been engaged and a tour has been arranged for Dudamel's first season, with his approval, but much of the 2026-27 programming remains open.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s a chance that comes along maybe once in a lifetime to author a completely new chapter for a great musical institution,\u201d Tarnopolsky said. \u201cThe commitment here is to rededicate ourselves to ensuring the philharmonic\u2019s place in the civic, cultural, musical, educational life of contemporary New York.\u201d",
      "Ryan Fleur, the Philadelphia Orchestra's executive director, will become its interim president on Jan. 1, a role he held for eight months in 2018 between Allison Vulgamore's departure and Tarnopolsky's arrival.",
      "___",
      "This story corrects that Mat\u00edas Tarnopolsky headed Philadelphia Orchestra six years."

      "It reported that Wallace was warned by his employers after a complaint in 2018, and an internal investigation at the time found his behavior was \u201cunacceptable and unprofessional.\"",

      "In a surprise that stunned the audience of Hollywood\u2019s first big awards-season bash, \u201cA Different Man,\u201d a dark comedy about doppelg\u00e4ngers, deformity and authenticity in acting, won best feature film at the 34th Gotham Awards on Monday night",
      "NEW YORK -- In a surprise that stunned the audience of Hollywood\u2019s first big awards-season bash, \u201cA Different Man,\u201d a dark comedy about doppelg\u00e4ngers, deformity and authenticity in acting, won best feature film at the 34th Gotham Awards on Monday night.",
      "Much can be unpredictable at the Gotham Awards, which uses small juries of insiders and film industry veterans to pick nominees and winners. But as the \u201cA Different Man\u201d ensemble, including Sebastian Stan and Adam Pearson, took the stage, writer-director Aaron Schimberg was in obvious disbelief.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I'm the only person in this room who\u2019s totally stunned,\" said Schimberg. \u201cConsidering the other nominees, I thought it would be hubris to prepare a speech.\"",
      "At a starry Gothams that drew Zendaya, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Angelina Jolie, most were expecting triumph for Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora,\u201d a comedy about a sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch. It came in the lead nominee, the Cannes Palme d\u2019Or winner, and maybe a top best-picture contender at the Oscars, but went home empty-handed.",
      "Instead, the night belonged to the A24 release \u201cA Different Man,\u201d which stars Stan as a man with facial deformities who's healed of them. He's then upstaged by the character played by Pearson, who genuinely has neurofibromatosis, a condition that covers much of his face with benign skin tumors.",
      "The Gothams aren\u2019t an Oscar bellwether, though several of its recent top winners \u2013 including last year's winner \u201cPast Lives,\u201d as well as \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d and \u201cNomadland\u201d \u2013 have gone on to be nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, with \u201cEverything Everywhere\u201d and \u201cNomadland\u201d winning.",
      "Whether any of the winners Monday night \u2014 \u201cSing Sing\u201d and \u201cNickel Boys\u201d were also victorious \u2014 will use the early wins as a springboard for more trophies remains to be seen. But the Gothams, a black-tie affair held at Cipriani Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, tend give some sense of the flavor of the upcoming gauntlet of award-season ceremonies.",
      "How prominent politics, and the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, might be in this year\u2019s Oscar race is one of the biggest questions as the season ramps up. On Monday, Trump's name was never uttered on stage (though Stan is in the awards mix for playing him in \u201cThe Apprentice\" ), nor were there any overtly political statements. But several winner seemed to allude to the shifting political climate.",
      "\u201cLet's keep doing the work that really matters and makes a difference,\u201d said Colman Domingo, who won best lead performance. \u201cThat's what we can do right now. That can be the light in the darkness.\u201d",
      "Domingo won for his starring role in \u201cSing Sing,\u201d the indie drama about a real prison program called Rehabilitation Through the Arts, which helps incarcerated people heal through theater productions. Clarence Maclin, one of the formerly incarcerated men who co-star in the film, won best supporting performance. (The Gothams give gender-neutral acting awards that number 10 nominees instead of the typical five.)",
      "\u201cIf someone was going to tell me ten years ago, I was going to be here, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it,\u201d said Maclin.",
      "\u201cSing Sing,\u201d also from A24, was arguably the emotional winner of the night. The film's ensembled also accepted a tribute award. In one of the evening's most powerful speeches Sean Dino Johnson, a founding member of RTA, spoke passionately about the redemptive qualities of the arts.",
      "\u201cStanding here tonight we are proof that movies like \u2018Sing Sing\u2019 don\u2019t just entertain,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThey change lives.\u201d",
      "RaMell Ross' \u201cNickel Boys,\" his arrestingly photographed Colson Whitehead adaptation, also won two major awards: best diretor for Ross and breakthrough performer for Brandon Wilson. Ross\u2019 film, about two Black teenagers at an abusive juvenile reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida, is filmed largely from the first-person perspective of its two main characters.",
      "For many, the Gothams are a chance to make an impression with a speech that helps solidify their awards chances. To that cause, the Gothams gave out an array of tribute awards. This year\u2019s crop was particularly starry, including Zendaya (for \u201cChallengers\u201d ), Jolie (for \u201cMaria\u201d), Chalamet and James Mangold (for \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d), Denis Villeneuve (for \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d ), the cast of \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d and Franklin Leonard, founder of the fabled unproduced screenplay platform The Black List.",
      "Jolie, who plays the opera singer Maria Callas in \u201cMaria,\u201d also spoke about the importance of the arts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so important that art be taught in our schools, and so concerning that is being reduced,\u201d Jolie said.",
      "Zendaya, honored for her performance in Luca Guadagnino's \u201cChallengers,\u201d took a moment to thank her date. \u201cMy mom's here tonight,\" she said. \u201cShout out mom.\u201d",
      "Chalamet read a short speech about his transformation into Bob Dylan for the upcoming \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "\u201cGetting to study and immerse myself in the world of Bob Dylan has been the greatest education a young artist can receive,\" Chalamet said. \"If you're already a fan of Bob Dylan, this will make perfect sense to you. If you're not familiar with his work, perhaps our film can serve as a humble gateway to one of the great poets and chroniclers of our times.\u201d",
      "Best documentary went to \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a film made by a Palestinian and Israeli filmmaker collective that documents Israeli occupation of a Palestinian village in West Bank over the course of years. Despite being one of the year\u2019s most acclaimed documentaries, \u201cNo Other Land\u201d remains without an American distributor.",
      "Payal Kapadia\u2019s \u201cAll We Imagine as Light,\u201d a poetic drama about three women in modern Mumbai, took the award for best international film. Though the film was the first Indian movie in competition in more than 30 years at the Cannes Film Festival, India opted not to select it for its Oscar submission.",
      "The award for breakthrough director went to Vera Drew for \u201cThe People's Joker,\u201d a superhero parody about gender identity. Drew thanked Warner Bros. \u201cfor not suing me\u201d and Nicole Kidman, an attendee, because, Drew said, \u201c'Batman Forever' is when I realized I was trans.\u201d"

      "There's lots to leave behind as the new year rolls around. Here's a tiny tip of the iceberg of what we're over as we move on to 2025.",
      "TikToker Jools Lebron's 38-second video describing her workday makeup routine as \u201cVery demure. Very mindful\u201d lit up the summer with memes. The video has been viewed more than 50 million times.",
      "With her newfound fame, Lebron, a transgender woman, was able to earn toward her transition, help her family, rack up some brand deals and make a big statement about staying positive. In another video, she got the world going on \u201cvery cutesy.\u201d",
      "Love you, Jools! But here's the thing all you meme-makers: Summer's over. We're also looking at you, \u201cbrat\u201d enthusiasts. The summer slime greenness of it all and the Charli XCX-Kamala Harris moment were great! We know you'll keep it demure as you move on to the next big thing.",
      "As for all those dogs and cats eeeking out in videos over President Donald Trump's Haitian immigrant remark? Here's to a calmer 2025 for you, Springfield, Ohio.",
      "Speaking of demure but no longer cutesy, in the name of all things Holy Feminism, passenger princesses must abdicate.",
      "A passenger princess, according to Urban Dictionary, is \u201ca pretty girl that has no other job but to look pretty in the passenger seat while her sneaky link/boyfriend/significant other drives.\u201d What's a sneaky link, you might ask? It's a secret hookup. For sex.",
      "Passenger princesses decorate their sides of front seats with little baubles in the air vent. They pack in snacks on little trays that fit on their Stanley cups. They bring cozy blankies, replace visor mirrors with fancy lit ones and generally reign while demanding their men place one hand on their nearest leg.",
      "The term has been around since at least 2020, when a Twitter (now X) user called his dog a passenger princess on a photo of said dog in the front seat of his car. That, eventually, morphed into human princesses storming TikTok.",
      "Take the wheel, dear princesses. We know you know how to drive. And congrats, TikToker @masonshea. Your passenger prince video has amassed more than 60 million views since you posted an equal treatment grab in early 2023.",

Instead, they\u2019re something either you get or you don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Bubble dresses, in various iterations, are hardly fresh fashion. Pierre Cardin, Christian Dior, Hubert de Givenchy and Yves Saint Laurent got there first in the 1950s. They, yes, bubbled back up in the 1980s, and again in the 2000s.",
      "Dare to be different!",

      "Sourdough videos? No need. Thank you for your service.",
      "Depending on who you are, rawdogging has different meanings. There's having sex without a condom. And there's the male-driven travel trend of eschewing all distractions and movement and sustenance while long-haul flying. The latter raw dogging spiked in 2024.",
      "You've got your hyper-male enthusiasts looking to, well, be hyper-male. And you've got your travelers seeking to lock in some sort of mindfulness or uber-focus or, what? Who knows.",

      "Finding your center by simply staring at the in-flight map seems, simply, pointless. Here's to a rawdog-free new year. The same goes for that plane seat belt thing where people find it somehow useful (not) to buckle up at the ankles, their knees hiked to their chins. C'mon. That can't be all that comfortable, let alone safe. Happy turbulence to you all.",

      "As of September 2022, Gillette estimated that 12.5 million men in the U.S. had mustaches. That's a 1.5% increase from March 2020. The shaving company launched a facial hair-grooming brand, King C. Gillette, to ride the wave.",
      "Mustaches, with beards. Fine. Freestanding mustaches. Polarizing. Do we thank a contingent of ironical millennials looking to revisit the past for this, uh, trend? What about the unironical? Do we point to Miles Teller's character in the 2022 film, \u201cTop Gun: Maverick?\u201d",
      "Teller's 'stache was a nod to Anthony Edwards\u2019 similar one in the original 1986 \u201cTop Gun.\u201d This is not 1986.",

      "LONDON -- One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character.",
      "In Miami, observers say the Dwyane Wade sculpture looks more like actor Laurence Fishburne than the former basketball star. Of course, the infamous Cristiano Ronaldo bust in 2017 gave the chiseled soccer star a chubby face and goofy smile.",
      "A statue of Mohamed Salah in 2018 depicted the Liverpool star with a disproportionately large head. In 2011, a terracotta warrior statue of Andy Murray at a Shanghai tennis tournament drew chuckles, including from the star himself: \u201cI thought I was better looking than that.\"",
      "It wasn't always this way. In classical times, sculptors \u201chad absolutely no interest in depicting people accurately,\u201d explained Lucy Branch, a London-based sculptural conservator.",
      "\u201cWhat they ended up doing quite often, they recycled sculptures so when another athlete became more prominent, they just changed the name on the plaque,\u201d said Branch, host of the \u201cSculpture Vulture\u201d podcast.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this idea now, in this era, that commemorative sculpture should be like portraiture \u2014 it should look exactly like the person they are commemorating. But actually that's a really new idea in sculpture.\"",
      "To avoid pitfalls, here are some tips from sculptors:",
      "London-based sculptor Hywel Pratley studied countless images of Queen Elizabeth II to create a memorial statue in the East Midlands town of Oakham.",
      "\u201cA good portrait sculpture is evidence of 1,000 decisions after 10,000 observations,\u201d Pratley said.",
      "In addition, Yorkshire county sculptor Steve Winterburn recommends getting close with a subject's family and friends to help find characteristics.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want it looking like a Madame Tussauds,\u201d said Winterburn, who created a statue of five Rugby League greats at Wembley Stadium. \u201cIt still needs a bit of art in it, a bit of soul. That\u2019s what makes art really sing.\u201d",
      "The Ronaldo bust depicted the Portugal star smiling crookedly. Likewise, the Salah sculpture features the Egyptian smiling while celebrating a goal. In Miami, Wade's mouth is open in the statue representing the moment the player famously jumped onto a courtside table and yelled \u201cThis is my house.\u201d",
      "It's probably best avoided.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to do teeth looking good in sculpture,\u201d Pratley said.",
      "Start \"by understanding the profile\" before moving on to determine widths from the front view, Pratley said.",
      "\u201cGet the profile right and you will have won half the battle, because then you can have something at least that you can trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re lost, you can say, \u2018well I knew where I was then,\u2019 \u2014 and you will get lost as a sculptor in the forms.",

      "For Pratley, especially when he is working with a live model, \u201cI\u2019m often struck by how the absolute essence of somebody is somewhere between the nostrils and the mouth.

      "Commemorative sculpture historically has been on plinths, Branch notes.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason for that is because we put our heroes on a pedestal,\" she said. \"The problem is, the lower to the ground the sculpture is, the more scrutiny it\u2019s going to get and the less it can get away with not looking quite right.\u201d",
      "The Kane sculpture features the England captain seated.",
      "\u201cBeing so low, people get to look at it incredibly closely,\u201d Branch said. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to get sculpture to be more with the people, but then that comes with its own problems.\u201d",
      "In the UK, local councils \u2014 like a city council in the US \u2014 might propose a project, fund it and select the sculptor, sometimes with little input from the public and limited vetting of artists.",
      "Branch says there's a better way: Vote on it.",
      "That's what happened for the Emmeline Pankhurst statue in Manchester. A selection committee used an online platform to get public input and Hazel Reeves' proposal to honor the suffragette won.",
      "\u201cIt is a really good balance and check for whether people on the committees have chosen the right sculptor or the right composition for that person who is being commemorated,\u201d Branch said. \u201c(The public) may not necessarily be highly educated about sculpture, but they always tend to know whether the artist has hit the nail on the head.\u201d",

      "\"Moana 2\" brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over Thanksgiving Day weekend.",
      "NEW YORK -- Christmas came early at the box office this year.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day weekend, setting records with $221 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. That, combined with \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II,\u201d made for an unprecedented weekend in cinemas and a confluence of blockbusters more like what\u2019s often found in late December.",
      "Expectations were high for Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cMoana 2,\u201d but the film \u2014 originally planned as a series for Disney+ before it was redirected to the big screen \u2014 blew predictions out of the water. Its five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing. (The previous best was $125 million for \u201cFrozen 2\u201d in its second week of release in 2019.) \u201cMoana 2\u201d added $165.3 million internationally; with $386 million worldwide, it's the second-best global launch of the year.",
      "At the same time, the sensation of \u201cWicked\u201d showed no signs of slowing down. The Universal Pictures musical brought in $117.5 million over the five-day weekend, pushing its two-week global total to $359.2 million. Not accounting for inflation, \u201cWicked\u201d is now the highest grossing Broadway adaptation over \u201cGrease.\u201d (That 1978 film grossed $190 million, but factoring in inflation would put it past $900 million.)",
      "\u201cGladiator II,\u201d meanwhile, also held well, dipping 44% from its opening weekend. Ridley Scott\u2019s sequel to his Oscar-winning best picture original collected $44 million in its second weekend. While its steep price tag of $250 million will make profitability challenging, \u201cGladiator II\u201d has swiftly gathered $320 million worldwide.",
      "Those three films drove the overall box office to a record $420 million in overall Thanksgiving weekend ticket sales, according to Comscore \u2014 more than $100 million more than ever before. For an industry that has been battered in recent years by the pandemic, work stoppages and the upheaval caused by streaming, it was a triumphant weekend that showed the still-potent power of Hollywood\u2019s blockbuster machine. Before \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d arrived in theaters, ticket sales were running about 25% behind pre-pandemic levels.",
      "Michael O\u2019Leary, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theatre Owners, said the weekend showed what\u2019s possible when \u201call the pieces of the puzzle come together\u201d in compelling big-budget movies with marketing muscle.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic that this weekend is the start of what we believe is a full-on charge into the future,\u201d he said. \"The remaining quarter of this year looks very promising and then on into 2025 and 2026. We\u2019re hoping next year is the first kind of normal year this industry has had in a long time.\u201d",
      "Like the last time such anticipated movies collided on the release calendar \u2014 2023's much-ballyhooed \u201cBarbenheimer\" \u2014 the movie industry again could see evidence of a rising moviegoing tide lifting all blockbusters. In recent years, studios have typically tried to space out most of their biggest releases. Earlier this fall, \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\" for example, was the No. 1 film for three straight weeks, despite not being particularly successful.",
      "\u201cFor a long, long time in Hollywood, there\u2019s been a belief that you don\u2019t put big blockbuster movies up against each other,\u201d said O'Leary. \u201cBut the truth of the matter is that competition is good. It\u2019s good for the movies. It\u2019s good for the studios. It\u2019s good for the theater owners. But it\u2019s particularly good for the moviegoing public.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d was the nexus of a strategy shift for Disney. When it first began development, it was fashioned as a series for streaming. But when Bob Iger returned as chief executive, he reconsidered the balance between theatrical and streaming. The original \u201cMoana,\" after all, was the most streamed movie on Disney+ in 2023, with the added benefit of $680 million in box office in 2016. Only in February this year did Iger announce the release of \u201cMoana 2,\" with Auli\u2019i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson returning as the voices of Moana and Maui.",
      "\u201cIt just shows you that the big screen and small screen are not adversarial. They can be complementary and additive,\u201d says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cWhoever made that decision to go big screen globally with \u2018Moana 2,' that was one of the greatest decisions ever.\u201d",
      "And it helped lead a resurgence for Walt Disney Co., whose last two animated November releases \u2014 \u201cStrange World\u201d and \u201cWish\u201d \u2014 fizzled in theaters. \u201cMoana 2\u201d may become the third $1 billion-grossing movie for the studio in 2024, along with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine.\u201d Though reviews for \u201cMoana 2\" have only been 65% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes, audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d is also part of a major rebound for family moviegoing. According to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment, family moviegoing in 2024 is going to account for approximately $6.8 billion in ticket sales, roughly the sums of 2022 and 2023, combined.",
      "After such large debuts, \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d are likely to continue to drive moviegoing through December. The only question will be if this year's Christmas movies \u2014 historically a much bigger holiday period for theaters \u2014 can come anywhere near the Thanksgiving lineup. Among the movies aiming for that holiday corridor are Disney's \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d Paramount's \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\" and Searchlight's \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as a young Bob Dylan.",

      "His wide-ranging career spanned some of Woody Allen\u2019s best films.",
      "NEW YORK -- The Oscar-winning screenwriter Marshall Brickman, whose wide-ranging career spanned some of Woody Allen 's best films, the Broadway musical \u201cJersey Boys\u201d and a number of Johnny Carson's most beloved sketches, has died. He was 85.",
      "Brickman died Friday in Manhattan, his daughter Sophie Brickman told The New York Times. No cause of death was cited.",
      "Brickman was best known for his extensive collaboration with Allen, beginning with the 1973 film \u201cSleeper.\u201d Together, they co-wrote \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d (1977), \u201cManhattan\" (1979) and \u201cManhattan Murder Mystery\" (1993). The loosely structured script for \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d in particular, has been hailed as one of the wittiest comedies. It won Brickman and Allen an Oscar for best original screenplay.",
      "In his acceptance speech (Allen skipped the ceremony), Brickman referenced one of the film's many oft-quoted lines, saying: \"I've been out here a week, and I still have guilt when I make a right turn on a red light.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the film is worth anything,\u201d Brickman told Vanity Fair in 2017, \u201cit gives a very particular specific image of what it was like to be alive in New York at that time in that particular social-economic stratum.\u201d",
      "Brickman and Allen had met in the early 1960s, when Allen was breaking through as a stand-up comedian. Brickman was brought on to write jokes for him. At the time, he had been playing banjo for the folk group the Tarriers. In one of the many twists of Brickman's career, it was an album he and his college roommate Eric Weissberg recorded that later made the soundtrack to 1972's \u201cDeliverance,\u201d including \u201cDueling Banjos.\u201d",
      "Brickman, born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was the son of Jewish socialists Abram (who fled Poland during WWII) and Pauline (Wolin) Brickman, who was from New York. They later moved to the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, where Brickman grew up. His start in show business, after graduating from the University of Wisconsin with degrees in science and music, came with the Tarriers. He replaced Alan Arkin in the group.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I was asked to join was because they needed somebody to front the group and talk while everybody was tuning up,\u201d Brickman told the Writers Guild in 2011. \u201cAnd so I started to develop little jokes and routines and stuff like that.\u201d",
      "By the late \u201860s, Brickman was head writer for Carson\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show.\" There, one of his most enduring contributions were the Carnac the Magnificent sketches, during which Carson played a \u201cmystic from the East\u201d who could divine answers to unseen questions. Brickman\u2019s other TV stints included \u201cCandid Camera,\u201d \u201cThe Dick Cavett Show\u201d and \u201cThe Muppet Show.\u201d",
      "When Brickman and Allen began writing together, they found a natural chemistry, with Brickman playing a supporting role to Allen's semi-autobiographical material.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t write scenes together. I think that\u2019s the death for any collaboration,\u201d Brickman told the Writers Guild. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any such thing really as an equal collaboration. I think that in any collaboration, one person, one personality, one point of view has to dominate.\"",
      "Brickman wrote and directed the 1980 film \u201cSimon,\u201d starring Arkin as a psychology professor brainwashed into believing he's from outer space. He also directed 1983's \u201cLovesick,\" with Alec Guinness as the ghost of Sigmund Freud, and 1986's \u201cThe Manhattan Project,\u201d about a high schooler who builds a nuclear weapon for a school project.",
      "With Rick Elice penning the music, Brickman wrote the Broadway musical \u201cJersey Boys,\u201d about the 1960s rock group The Four Seasons. It ran on Broadway for 12 years beginning in 2005. He and Elice also wrote the 2010 musical \u201cThe Addams Family.\u201d",
      "Brickman is survived by his wife, Nina, daughters Sophie and Jessica, and five grandchildren.",

      "An official of a union involved in the anti-smoking push on Monday called for the head of the Atlantic City casino workers' union, Donna DeCaprio, to resign for failing to protect her members from the dangers of secondhand smoke.",
      "DeCaprio is president of Local 54 of the Unite Here union, which opposes a smoking ban on the grounds that so much business would be lost by smokers taking their money elsewhere that it could cause one or more casinos to shut down, costing thousands of workers their jobs.",
      "\u201cShe should be ashamed of herself,\u201d said Ray Jensen, assistant director of United Auto Workers Region 9, which represents dealers at three Atlantic City casinos and is part of a lawsuit seeking to have the courts force an end to smoking in the gambling halls. \u201cShe should hand in her union card.\u201d",

      "Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has said he will sign a bill to end casino smoking if it reaches his desk.",
      "The casinos, joined by Local 54, oppose that effort, saying it will cost Atlantic City thousands of jobs and lead to decreased tax revenue for state programs for senior citizens and the disabled.",
      "On Monday, the workers group that calls itself CEASE (Casino Employees Against Smoking\u2019s Effects) filed an appeal of a court ruling in August that allowed smoking to continue in the nine casinos.",
      "The Casino Association of New Jersey declined to comment Monday.",
      "Attorney Nancy Erika Smith said as far back as 1993, tobacco companies targeted labor unions in the hospitality industry as potential allies to work against smoking bans in the restaurant and hospitality industries. That effort included the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, a precursor of the Unite Here union.",
      "\u201cHERE and the related AFL-CIO affiliates are critical allies which should be cultivated as supporters of the effort to prevent smoking bans,\u201d a public relations firm wrote in a memo to Philip Morris Companies that was made public during several states' litigation against tobacco companies.

      "As far back as 2001, HERE was part of a 12-member coalition including labor unions advocating for improved indoor ventilation instead of government-imposed smoking bans, according to another document cited in Monday's appeal.",

      "A majority of Supreme Court justices didn\u2019t seem convinced Monday that federal regulators misled companies before refusing to allow them to sell sweet flavored vaping products following a surge in teen e-cigarette use",
      "WASHINGTON -- A majority of Supreme Court justices didn't seem convinced Monday that federal regulators misled companies before refusing to allow them to sell sweet-flavored vaping products following a surge in teen e-cigarette use.",
      "The conservative-majority court did raise questions about the Food and Drug Administration crackdown that included denials of more than a million nicotine products formulated to taste like fruit, dessert or candy. Teen vaping use has since dropped to its lowest level in a decade, but the agency could change its approach after the inauguration next month of President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to \u201csave\u201d vaping.",
      "Vaping companies have long marketed their products as a way to help adults quit traditional cigarettes, and say the FDA changed its standards with little warning as it blocked the sale of over a million new flavored products.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan, though, was skeptical.",
      "\u201cI guess I\u2019m not really seeing what the surprise is here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew what the FDA\u2019s point of view was ... that blueberry vapes are really problematic in terms of youth smoking.\"",
      "The FDA was slow to regulate the now multibillion-dollar vaping market, and even years into the crackdown flavored vapes that are technically illegal nevertheless remain widely available.",
      "The agency says the companies were denied because they couldn't show flavored vapes had a net public benefit, as laid out in the law. It has approved some tobacco-flavored vapes, and recently allowed its first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers after the company provided data showing the product was more helpful in quitting, Deputy Solicitor General Curtis Gannon said.",
      "The issue came before the high court when the agency appealed a decision from the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals tossing out one of its denials.",
      "While other lower courts rebuffed vaping company lawsuits, the 5th Circuit sided with Dallas-based company Triton Distribution. The decision allowed the sale of e-juices like \u201cJimmy The Juice Man in Peachy Strawberry\" and \u201cSuicide Bunny Mother's Milk and Cookies\u201d which are heated by an e-cigarette to create an inhalable aerosol.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether the FDA process had given the companies a fair chance to make their claims, given that their businesses were at stake.",
      "Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed concern about what recourse companies have if agencies issue misleading guidance, though he also elicited that the FDA wasn't required to issue the guidance it gave in the vaping case. \u201cI'm trying to figure out what the legal error is here,\u201d he said.",
      "The vaping companies, he said, can reapply for sales authorization even if they don't win in court. Triton attorney Eric Heyer said that process would take so long that the company could be forced to close.",
      "The court has overall been skeptical of the power of federal regulators, including by striking down the so-called Chevron doctrine that had judges deferring to agencies' interpretation of the law.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned whether the vaping companies wanted the court to take that concept a step further. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a reverse Chevron deference, except we're deferring to the applicant,\" she said.",
      "The court is expected to decide the case in the coming months.",

      "BOISE, Idaho -- A federal appeals court on Monday ruled that most of Idaho's first-in-the-nation law that makes it illegal to help minors get an abortion without the consent of their parents can take effect while a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality continues.",
      "The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the statute\u2019s prohibition on helping a minor get an abortion by harboring and transporting them with the intent to conceal the procedure from the minor\u2019s parents is likely to be found constitutional and can be enforced.",
      "Part of the law remains blocked, however. The court found that the law\u2019s prohibition on \u201crecruiting\u201d pregnant youth violates the First Amendment. That means prosecutors, for now, will not be able to charge a person with \u201crecruiting\u201d or influencing a minor to have an abortion.",
      "\"Encouragement, counseling, and emotional support are plainly protected speech,\u201d the court wrote, even when that speech happens in the \u201ccontext of deciding whether to have an abortion.\u201d",
      "The ruling largely reverses U.S. Magistrate Judge Debora K. Grasham's decision, which prevented the law from being enforced after opponents sued the state in the summer of 2023.",
      "Abortion is banned in Idaho at all stages of pregnancy, and the law enacted in 2023 was designed to prevent minors from getting abortions in states where the procedure is legal if they don\u2019t have their parents\u2019 permission.",
      "Supporters of the law call it an \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d ban. Opponents say it is an unconstitutional prohibition on interstate travel and free speech rights. Both sides framed Monday's ruling as a victory.",
      "\u201cThis decision is a significant victory for the plaintiffs, as it frees Idahoans to talk with pregnant minors about abortion health care,\u201d Wendy Heipt, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an emailed statement Monday.",
      "She said the plaintiffs, which include multiple advocacy groups, are also considering their appeal options.",
      "Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador in an emailed statement called the ruling a victory for the state.",
      "\u201cIdaho\u2019s laws were passed specifically to protect the life of the unborn and the life of the mother, Labrador said. \"Trafficking a minor child for an abortion without parental consent puts both in grave danger, and we will not stop protecting life in Idaho.\u201d",
      "The law makes it illegal to either obtain abortion pills for a minor or to help them leave the state for an abortion without their parents\u2019 knowledge and consent. Anyone convicted will face two to five years in prison and could also be sued by the minor\u2019s parent or guardian. A parent who raped their child will not be able to sue, though the criminal penalties for anyone who helped the minor obtain an abortion will remain in effect."

      "A Zimbabwean High Court judge has ruled that provisions of a law that deny abortion services to women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 are unconstitutional",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- A law prohibiting abortion services for women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 is unconstitutional, Zimbabwe\u2019s High Court has ruled.",
      "In his ruling handed down on Nov. 22 and made public this week, Judge Maxwell Takuva said since Zimbabwe\u2019s laws already criminalize marital rape and sex with a minor, victims should be allowed to abort if they become pregnant.",
      "The ruling is significant, given Zimbabwe\u2019s restrictive abortion laws that often lead women and girls into illegal and unsafe backstreet abortions that in many cases turn fatal.",
      "Abortion is allowed in very few circumstances in Zimbabwe, including such as if the pregnancy endangers the life of a woman, or if there is a risk of a physical or mental defect \u201cof such a nature that (the child) will permanently be seriously handicapped.\u201d Women can also access legal abortion services in cases of unlawful sex such as incest.",
      "Zimbabwe criminalized sex with any person below 18 in September following an earlier constitutional court ruling ordering parliament to raise the legal age of consent for sex to 18 from 16. But the highly restrictive Termination of Pregnancy Act still denied abortion services for girls under 18.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that it is torture, cruel and degrading treatment for a child to carry another child, for a child to give birth to another child or for a child to be forced to illegally abort because of cruel circumstances,\u201d said the judge.",
      "The government did not mount any opposition to the case, which was brought by a women\u2019s rights group, although the ruling must still be approved by the Constitutional Court to become effective.",

      "The country of 15 million people records about 77,000 unsafe abortions annually, but many others go unreported. Many girls and women die from abortion complications each year, according to the United Nations children\u2019s agency, UNICEF.",
      "Teen pregnancies are rife in the southern African country because of lax enforcement of laws, cultural and religious practices and widespread poverty that also make it difficult for girls and women to access contraceptives and clinics.",
      "Almost one of every four girls falls pregnant between the ages of 10 and 19, according to figures by the government and UNICEF. One of every three girls is wed before age 18 in the deeply conservative southern African country where girls are usually culturally forced to marry men responsible for their unplanned pregnancies."

      "Artificial intelligence is changing the way industries do business",
      "WASHINGTON -- Artificial intelligence is changing the way companies do business \u2014 helping programmers write code and fielding customer service calls with chatbots.",
      "But the pharmaceutical industry is still waiting to see whether AI can tackle its biggest challenge: finding faster, cheaper ways to develop new drugs.",
      "Despite billions poured into research, new medicines still typically take a decade or more to develop.",
      "Founded in 2018, Insitro is part of a growing field of AI companies promising to accelerate drug discovery by using machine learning to analyze huge datasets of chemical and biological markers. The South San Francisco-based company has signed deals with drugmakers like Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb to help develop medicines for metabolic diseases, neurological conditions and degenerative disorders.",
      "CEO and founder Daphne Koller spoke with the AP about what AI brings to the challenges of drug discovery. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: I think the problem with drug discovery is that we are trying to intervene in a system that we only slightly understand. Many of the successes that we\u2019ve seen in the last 15 to 20 years have been when we arrive at a sufficient understanding of the system so we can really design interventions to align with it.",
      "So one of the things that we try to do at Insitro is unravel the underlying complexity of heterogeneous diseases and identify new intervention modes that could help, maybe not the entire population, but perhaps just a subset of it. That way we can really identify the right therapeutic hypothesis to intervene in a particular patient population. And that, I think, is the real crux of the industry\u2019s lack of success.",
      "A: One of the things that has been happening in parallel to the AI revolution is a much quieter revolution in what I call quantitative biology, which is the ability to measure biological systems with unprecedented fidelity. You can measure systems like proteins and cells with increasingly better measurements and technology.",
      "But if you give that data to a person, their eyes will just glaze over because there\u2019s only so many cells someone can look at and only so many subtleties they can see in these images. People are just limited in their ability to perceive subtle differences.",
      "So you end up with a very reductionist view of a very complex, multifaceted system which is really important to unraveling the distinctions between patients and uncovering where an intervention really can make a difference.",
      "A: My PhD was in computer science. But I started to get into the field of machine learning in the service of biomedical problems back in 1998 or 1999.",
      "At that time, the problems that machine learning was able to tackle were, frankly, uninspiring. How inspired can you get about classifying spam versus non-spam in a dataset of email messages?",
      "I was looking for something that had more richness to it. And my first foray into this field was not because I was particularly interested in becoming a biologist, but because I was looking for more technically challenging questions. And then, as I started looking into it, I became interested in biology in its own right.",
      "A: This is probably one of the most important things we\u2019ve achieved as an organization.",
      "You can take the most sophisticated, best meaning scientists from either side and put them in the same room together and they might as well be speaking Thai and Swahili to each other.",
      "When you\u2019re an engineer, you\u2019re looking for the strongest, most consistent patterns that are going to allow you to make predictions about a majority of cells or individuals. When you\u2019re a life scientist, oftentimes you\u2019re actually looking for the exceptions because those are the threads that can lead to new discoveries.",
      "So we\u2019ve put in place a number of cultural elements and organizational elements to help people engage with each other openly, constructively and with respect."

      "Gender-affirming care is supported by the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical groups. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s typically involved:",
      "Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are often referred to clinics where teams from various medical specialties provide gender-affirming care.",
      "Such care begins with an evaluation, which can include a pediatrician and a mental health specialist who assess the degree of distress, if any, the young person is experiencing.",
      "Those who meet defined criteria may be diagnosed with what\u2019s called gender dysphoria if their distress is continuous and significant.",

But the truth is that it\u2019s more than just medical. It\u2019s love and acceptance.\u201d",
      "A subset of young people may be offered additional interventions such as puberty blockers to ease distress and give them time to explore their gender identity.",
      "The drugs, known as GnRH agonists, block the release of key hormones involved in sexual maturation. They\u2019ve been used for decades to treat precocious puberty, an uncommon medical condition that causes puberty to begin abnormally early.",
      "The medication starts after a young person show early signs of puberty \u2014 enlargement of breasts or testicles. This typically occurs around age 8 to 13 for those assigned female at birth and a year or two later for those assigned male at birth.",
      "The drugs can be given as injections every few months or as arm implants lasting up to a year or two. Many of the effects are reversible \u2014 puberty and sexual development resume as soon as the drugs are stopped. Researchers are exploring the effects of puberty blockers on bone development, but no research has shown an increased risk for bone fractures.",
      "Young people can stay on puberty blockers for several years.",
      "After puberty blockers, trans adolescents go through puberty either with or without hormone treatment.",
      "Some may choose to take hormones to make their bodies more closely match their gender identity. They take manufactured versions of either estrogen or testosterone \u2014 hormones that prompt sexual development in puberty. Estrogen comes in skin patches and pills. Testosterone is available in injections, implants or gels.",
      "Guidelines recommend starting these when teens are mature enough to make informed medical decisions. Many transgender people take the hormones for life.",
      "If the medication is stopped, some physical changes remain. Testosterone generally leads to permanent voice-lowering, facial hair and development of the Adam\u2019s apple. Estrogen can lead to permanent breast development.",
      "Research on long-term hormone use in transgender adults has found potential health risks including a modest risk for blood clots with estrogen and negative cholesterol changes with testosterone.",
      "Gender-affirming surgery in transgender teens is far less common than hormone treatment. When it is done among transgender youth, it\u2019s almost always breast reduction surgery in older transgender males.",
      "Even so, that type of surgery is extremely rare. Perhaps surprisingly, breast reduction among minors is most frequently performed in males who are not transgender. This is for a condition called gynecomastia, which means having more breast tissue than usual.",
      "A study looking at millions of 2019 insurance claims found 151 breast reductions performed for U.S. minors. Nearly all \u2014 97% \u2014 were not transgender.",

      "WASHINGTON -- When the Supreme Court this week wades into the contentious issue of transgender rights, the justices will hear from an attorney with knowledge that runs deep.",
      "Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the nation's highest court, representing families who say Tennessee\u2019s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their children terrified about the future.",
      "Arguments in the case come amid heightened pushback to transgender rights, including a presidential campaign where Republican Donald Trump put his fierce opposition front and center.",
      "Strangio will bring months of intense legal preparation to the case as well as hard-won lessons from his own experience.",
      "\u201cI am able to do my job because I have had this health care that transformed and, frankly, saved my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a testament to the fact that we live among everyone.\u201d",
      "Strangio grew up outside of Boston and came out as trans when he was in law school. Now 42, he's an American Civil Liberties Union attorney whose legal career has included representing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, challenging a ban on transgender people serving in the military and helping win an LGBTQ+ worker-discrimination case at the Supreme Court. He's also the father of a 12-year-old, the son of a father who supports Trump, and has a close relationship with his Army-veteran brother.",
      "He's also an advocate, speaking out as a series of U.S. states banned gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. The laws are part of a wave of restrictions on school sports participation and bathroom usage around the country. After the first openly transgender person was elected to Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declared support for restricting bathroom use to sex assigned at birth.",
      "Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young people and its law protects them from making treatment decisions prematurely.",
      "\u201cTennessee, like many other states, acted to ensure that minors do not receive these treatments until they can fully understand the lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to the point that Tennessee might take a different view of their efficacy,\u201d state attorneys wrote in court filings.",
      "Arguing for Tennessee is state Solicitor General Matt Rice. He served in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the transgender worker-discrimination case Strangio worked on that term. The state attorney general's office did not make Rice available for an interview ahead of arguments, but his background also includes a couple of years as a minor league baseball player for the Tampa Bay Rays before he earned his law degree from the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The Biden administration is supporting the challenge to Tennessee's law, but the federal government\u2019s position is expected to change after Trump takes office in January. Strangio said he'll nevertheless keep advocating for transgender youth to access health care that wasn't available when he was young.",
      "\u201cMany of us think about our childhood and young adulthood as lost years, when we were just simply disembodied from our core,\u201d he said. Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose the bans and have endorsed such care, saying it\u2019s safe when administered properly. Strangio also pointed out that many medical interventions for young people, like gastric bypass surgeries for weight loss, carry some risk and it makes sense to inform families and let them decide.",
      "\u201cThere is harm that is compounded when we are forcing young people to be denied care that their doctors and their parents and they themselves all agree they need,\u201d he said.",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to decide the case by the summer.",

      "As temperatures drop into the teens, Minnesotans have embraced sauna culture for warmth and community",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- As another frigid winter settles over Minnesota with temperatures dipping into the teens, people like Ed Kranz are embracing the cold \u2014 and working up quite a sweat.",
      "Kranz and his wife, Colleen, are among Minnesotans who believe the best way to endure winter is to heat up in saunas and then cool off in their state's icy weather.",
      "On a bone-chilling Sunday morning, they set up a mobile wood-fired sauna from their business, Saunable, near a frozen lake in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan. After about 10 minutes of sweating in the 185 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius) sauna they moseyed outside into the 15-degree temperatures, lingering around a fire in bathing suits before repeating the process three or four more times. One brave soul dipped into a hole in the frozen lake for a post-sauna cold plunge.",
      "Their hot-and-cold venture is common in Minnesota, where plenty of residents embrace sauna culture for warmth and community. Devotees say they are mingling Old World traditions with newfangled internet-based communities, and making social connections in a society that can feel isolating.",
      "Sauna and cold plunges go together like peanut butter and jelly, said Glenn Auerbach, a self-described sauna evangelist and the founder and editor of SaunaTimes. Auerbach started the website in 2008 to share his thoughts, research and conversations with movers and shakers in the sauna world. He and his interlocutors mull over the nitty-gritty of sauna construction, how to cultivate \u201cgood sauna vibes\u201d and the potential health benefits of the sauna lifestyle.",
      "A typical temperature to achieve the holy trinity of the sauna experience \u2014 heat, steam and ventilation \u2014 is about 180 to 200 degrees F (82-93 degrees C), a temperature that starkly contrasts Minnesota's frigid winter weather.",
      "The craftiest in the sauna community can build a facility for about $10,000, according to Auerbach. Those looking to skip the physical labor can outsource the construction. Sauna's popularity, which enthusiasts say spiked following the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought with it a rise in manufacturers selling saunas for about $30,000 to $40,000.",
      "While sauna's cultural cache may have increased in recent years, the practice long predates the Instagrammable spaces now popping up, Auerbach said.",
      "The smell of cedar wood has been lodged in Justin Juntunen's memory ever since he first stepped into his family's sauna as a child. Juntunen, the founder of Cedar and Stone Nordic Sauna, is a descendant of Finnish immigrants who came to America in the 1880s. They brought with them an appreciation for saunas and the communal values the steam-filled rooms impart to local life.",
      "People in Finland say there are more saunas than cars, Juntunen said. When immigrants like his grandfather came to Minnesota to work in the mines, mills or docks, they would often save up to build a farmhouse. But they would build a sauna first, living in the space while the house was constructed. Later, saunas would serve as informal town centers.",
      "People gossiped in saunas, they gave birth in saunas and they died in saunas, Juntunen said. The public nature of the facilities reflects the egalitarian ethos that infuses Nordic culture, and sauna culture by extension, he added.",
      "\u201cThis is a tradition that\u2019s actually for everyone,\u201d Juntunen said. \u201cMy favorite Nordic proverb is all people are created equal, but nowhere more so than in the sauna.\"",
      "In addition to a desire for in-person experiences following the COVID-19 pandemic, sauna enthusiasts say interest rose after some of the internet\u2019s most famous figures, such as podcasters Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman, touted it.",
      "\u201cEvery big podcaster in the world discovered that you could jump in cold water and it feels kind of good. And then people click on it online,\u201d Juntunen said.",
      "In this way, technology has been a paradox for sauna culture, he added. Digital media helped sauna culture grow at the same time as saunas were billed as reprieves from the pervasive reach of technology over every facet of daily life.",
      "Either way, almost all of sauna culture's adherents say its rise is inextricably linked to a desire for community.",
      "Those who committed to building their own saunas have hosted friends, neighbors, and former high school hockey teammates over. This has created a new form of post-COVID-19 contagiousness: \u201cGood heat is contagious,\u201d Auerbach said.",
      "This core function of sauna culture spans generations. Juntunen's grandfather would rush to the sauna after work because it was the space where stories were told.",
      "\"It\u2019s a space where storytelling happens, where connection happens or silence happens,\" Juntunen said. \u201cI think that is a really beautiful example of what a sauna truly is.\u201d"

      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
      "HONG KONG -- Every Wednesday, retiree Zhang Zhili travels an hour by bus to an education center, drawn by the pulsing rhythms of the African drum she plays there in a classroom filled with fellow retirees whose hands move in unison, every beat lifting her spirits.",
      "Zhang, 71, has found joy and new friends at the \u201celderly university\u201d in Beijing. Besides African drums, the former primary school teacher joins social dance classes, paying about 2,000 yuan ($280) for two courses this semester. Seeing herself standing tall in dance class boosts her confidence. After class, she hangs out with her friends.",
      "\u201cWhen we get old, what do we need?\" she said. \u201cTo love ourselves.\u201d",
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional nursing homes, afraid of abandonment by their families and quality issues. That's driving a boom in universities, home care services, and communities catering to older adults. Though some providers struggle to turn a profit, they persist because they see promise in the growing market.",
      "China has a rapidly aging population. Last year, about 297 million people were aged 60 or above, over one-fifth of the population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 400 million, or over 30% of all Chinese.",
      "That's fueling growth in services and products aimed at older adults in what Beijing calls the silver economy, which is projected to balloon from about 7 trillion yuan (about $982 billion) currently to approximately 30 trillion yuan (about $4.2 trillion) in 2035, raising its share in the economy from about 6% to roughly 10%, Hu Zuquan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a public institution affiliated with China's main planning agency, told state media.",
      "Du Peng, dean of the school of population and health at Beijing's Renmin University, said the government is expanding basic care services to all older people who need them, moving beyond its traditional focus on those without family support. Last year, officials compiled a list of basic care services they aim to make available nationwide, including providing ability assessments for those over 65 and care training subsidies for family members of those who are disabled.",
      "Filial piety runs deep in China and most older people prefer aging at home with family after they retire, typically when they're 50 to 60 years old, one of the youngest retirement ages among the world\u2019s major economies. Many help care for their grandchildren, and for some, nursing homes are seen as a kind of abandonment, except in cases of serious disability.",
      "In January, Beijing issued new guidelines calling for expanding home care services and meal deliveries and more clothing, food and tech products tailored for older adults. They include enriching their lives through education.",
      "Home-based services offer a more affordable alternative to nursing homes, alleviating accommodation costs, Du said. Most older Chinese are relatively healthy, and these able people perhaps need richer cultural lives rather than disability care, he said.",
      "Cai Guixia, 60, said she has found fulfillment in African drumming and modeling classes. She thinks she would feel \u201cforsaken\u201d in a conventional nursing home, preferring to hire a domestic helper.",
      "Liu Xiuqin, an owner of two care homes, saw business opportunities in meeting those needs.",
      "She invested more than 800,000 yuan (about $112,000) to open a school in Beijing. Cai and Zhang are among its 150 students attending classes in dance, singing, yoga and modeling training for about 1,000 yuan ($140) per course each semester. Outside the classroom, her team organizes gatherings where students can socialize.",
      "Liu expects to break even in another year and is prepared for the wait. She believes in the market's future, given that the generation born in the 1960s and later values quality of life and health more than their parents did.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about making quick money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires persistence.\u201d",
      "Turning a profit is proving challenging for some silver economy businesses.",
      "In the southern city of Guangzhou, Wu Tang co-founded a school last year after his geotechnical investigation and surveying business was hit by the downturn in China\u2019s property market. His school offers courses to help people achieve some of their childhood dreams, but he has yet to cover his costs. He also faces competition from cheaper government-run courses.",
      "And there's Cui Yang, who runs a care station in Beijing, sending helpers zigzagging across the district to provide 30 yuan ($4.20) haircuts at home; accompanying people on hospital visits for 50 yuan ($7) per hour and other services. Even with government subsidies including free rent, Cui is losing money. Without the subsidies, the business would fail, she said.",
      "The struggles aren\u2019t limited to small operators.",
      "Wu Wenjing heads the home care department of a healthcare subsidiary of state-owned financial conglomerate China Everbright Group in southwest China's Chongqing. It has been in the red for 13 straight years, spending 5 million yuan (about $702,000) annually and still losing 1 million (about $140,000) a year, she said.",
      "Wu's business employs 70 workers who visit homes as caregivers, rehabilitation therapists and psychotherapists. The industry is competitive and it has a high turnover rate given the difficulties of working alone in clients\u2019 homes. Wu hopes to break even in five years, and is delighted about the government's efforts to grow the silver economy.",
      "\"The spring of China\u2019s elderly care business has finally come,\u201d she said.",
      "Various companies are looking to grab a slice of this government-backed market. Property developers like Vanke Co. and Sino-Ocean Group and insurance companies such as Taikang Insurance Group have built high-end communities for older adults with amenities such as movie-screening and mahjong rooms and dining services.",
      "China's also working to tackle the problem of dementia, providing cognitive screening tests and training staff who work in memory clinics or as social workers. Several Chinese pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working on drugs targeting Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia.",
      "Some vacant schools and kindergartens -- casualties of the country\u2019s declining birthrate -- are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Government efforts to back the silver economy are paying off: official data showed the country had 410,000 care facilities by June, double the number in 2019.",
      "Still, questions remain about the spending power of many older Chinese.",
      "A 2021 national survey co-conducted by China's Civil Affairs Ministry found older adults had a median annual income of 11,400 yuan ($1,574). In rural areas it was less than half of that. More than one in 10 older Chinese are living in poverty, with living standards much lower in rural areas and western China, according to data from surveys conducted by Peking University.",
      "China's silver economy is still in its infancy, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking.",
      "If they lack enough insurance to cover medical and other expenses, many older Chinese must set aside funds for such costs, limiting their spending capacity, he said, and it takes time to build industries producing senior-focused products and people trained to provide such services. Tax incentives and investments in training a skilled workforce would help, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are prospects here, but it seems there's still much that needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

      "British lawmakers are expected to vote on a law proposed to help terminally ill adults end their lives",
      "LONDON -- British lawmakers are expected to vote Friday on a law proposed to help terminally ill adults end their lives.",
      "The contentious bill would allow adults expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided with help to end their life, subject to safeguards and protections.",
      "Members of Parliament (MPs), who have been holding emotional meetings with constituents and searching their souls, are due to debate the issue that crosses political lines.",
      "Supporters say the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent unnecessary suffering. Opponents say it would put vulnerable people at risk, fearing that some would be coerced to end their lives and that some elderly or disabled people may opt for death so they don't become a burden.",
      "A vote in favor of the bill would send it to another round of hearings. A vote against it would kill it.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "The House of Commons hasn't debated an assisted dying bill since 2015 when a similar measure failed.",
      "Debate is scheduled for five hours and more than 150 members have reportedly signed up to speak. It is expected to be followed by a close vote.",
      "Although the current bill was proposed by a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it is an open vote with no pressure from the government on supporting it.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has previously supported assisted dying, said the government will remain neutral and he wouldn't reveal how he would vote. Some members of his cabinet have said they will support the bill, while others are against it.",
      "Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, along with three former Conservative prime ministers \u2014 Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Theresa May \u2014 have publicly opposed the bill, though they are no longer in the House of Commons and can't vote. Former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron supports it.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament.",
      "If ultimately approved, any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years, supporters say.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, only those over 18 years old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying. They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die.",
      "Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built in and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\u201d \u2014 two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Someone who helps a person end their life can be prosecuted and face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has done so voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Esther Rantzen, 84, a broadcaster dying of lung cancer, has urged passage of the bill so others don\u2019t have to do what she plans to do by traveling to Switzerland to legally end her life. She urged all 650 MPs to attend the hearing.",
      "\u201cThis is such a vital life and death issue, one that we the public care desperately about,\u201d Rantzen said in a public letter. \u201cIt is only right that as many MPs as possible listen to the arguments for and against, and make up your own minds, according to your own conscience, your personal thoughts and feelings.\u201d",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances."

      "Trump, in a statement Tuesday evening, said Bhattacharya, a 56-year-old physician and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, will work in cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, \"to direct the Nation\u2019s Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives.\u201d",

      "The decision to choose Bhattacharya for the post is yet another reminder of the ongoing impact of the COVID pandemic on the politics on public health.",
      "Bhattacharya was one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that lockdowns were causing irreparable harm.",

Protection should focus instead on people at higher risk, the document said.",

      "He served on the board of a Thiel-funded nonprofit that aimed to develop man-made islands that would float outside U.S. territory, allowing them to experiment with new forms of government. He also helped form and run the Thiel Fellowship, which awards $100,000 to young entrepreneurs who want to leave school to pursue a business or scientific venture.",
      "O\u2019Neill is the only one of Trump\u2019s health picks so far who brings previous experience working inside the HHS bureaucracy. Trump\u2019s previous choices to lead public health agencies \u2014 including Kennedy, Dr. Mehmet Oz for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator and Dr. Marty Makary for FDA commissioner \u2014 have all been Washington outsiders who are vowing to shake up the agencies.",

Missouri, a Supreme Court case contending that federal officials improperly suppressed conservative views on social media as part of their efforts to combat misinformation.

      "MILWAUKEE -- The Aurora Health Care Mobile Medical Clinic team waited patiently at a table in the main hallway of the Milwaukee Public Library\u2019s sprawling downtown branch, a blood pressure cuff and mental health questionnaire at the ready as they called out to patrons who paused: \u201cDo you have any questions about your health?\u201d",
      "On this Tuesday afternoon, one man did. His joints were bothering him, he told Carolyn McCarthy, the team\u2019s nurse practitioner. And he knew his bones need calcium to stay strong, so he stopped taking his blood pressure medication, a calcium channel blocker.",
      "McCarthy talked with him at length in simple and specific terms about how the medication worked on his cells, why it was important to take and how it doesn\u2019t affect calcium storage in his bones.",
      "\u201cHopefully, he walked away a little bit more informed,\u201d McCarthy said.",
      "The mobile clinic is one of several health programs offered by libraries around across the U.S. \u2014 from tiny rural town libraries to large urban systems. They offer fitness classes, food pantries, cooking classes, conversations about loneliness and mental health, and even blood pressure monitors that can be checked out just like books.",
      "The public health programs leverage libraries' reputation as sources of reliable information and their ability to reach people beyond formal health care settings. No money, insurance, language skills or ID required, no limits on age. All are welcome.",
      "Libraries are \u201cthe last true public institution,\u201d said Jaime Placht, a health and well-being specialist at the Kansas City Public Library system in Kansas City, Missouri. The system has a full-time social work team. \u201cThe library is a public health space.\u201d",
      "The Kansas City Public Library, along with Milwaukee and several others, is part of the American Heart Association's Libraries with Heart program. Several Kansas City branches have blood pressure stations \u2014 which Placht said have been used 13,000 times \u2014 as well as a take-home blood pressure kits that have been checked out nearly 100 times. The program started there about a year ago.",
      "\u201cWe have patrons that say, \u2018Because I used the blood pressure monitor at the library, I went and saw my physician for the first time in a long time,\u2019\u201d Placht said.",
      "There is no local public health office in Jarrell, Texas, a small town between Austin and Waco. But there is a nonprofit library that can connect patrons to mental health help. It's one of nine rural libraries in central Texas that receives funding from the St. David\u2019s Foundation, the philanthropic arm of one of the state\u2019s largest health systems.",
      "Jarrell Community Library and Resource Center is a place for brave conversations. When a senior card game group turned to a discussion of the best crematorium in town, the library brought in local experts to teach about end-of-life planning, library director Susan Gregurek said. Last year, seven women came to the library for information on how to file restraining orders against their husbands.",
      "\u201cThis is mental health, but it\u2019s obviously larger than mental health,\" Gregurek said.",
      "The public library in Smithville, Texas, which also gets money from the Libraries for Health program, stocks boxes of surplus food from area farmers and built out programs that help teens, older adults and parents address isolation. The library\u2019s peer support specialist has gone from working with four to five people a month to nearly 60 in the community southeast of Austin.",
      "St. David's Foundation has invested more than $3 million in the program over three years, which Smithville library director Judy Bergeron said is key when she hears comments like, \u201cWhy are we funding the library so much? Nobody reads anymore.\u201d",
      "A year and a half into being in Milwaukee's libraries, mobile health clinic reaches eight patrons on average per visit. They've had some people come back to say they went to the hospital and got a life-saving treatment, McCarthy said. They\u2019ve also had patients who did not seek help and later died.",
      "\u201cWhat we do is a Band-Aid on a broken (health care) system,\u201d McCarthy said of the clinic.",
      "Another library effort in Milwaukee teaches kids about healthy nutrition habits at the Mitchell Street branch \u2014 a weekly after-school program run by chef Sharrie Agee since 2022.",
      "\u201cCertain areas of Milwaukee don\u2019t have the same opportunities to (access) healthy ingredients, healthy sources of food, the knowledge behind how to use those ingredients,\u201d said Agee, whose class learns how to make snacks from different continents.",

      "A handful of Massachusetts lawmakers are hoping to persuade their colleagues to support a proposal that would make the state the first to adopt a ban meant to eliminate the use of tobacco products over time",
      "BOSTON -- A handful of Massachusetts lawmakers are hoping to persuade their colleagues to support a proposal that would make the state the first to adopt a ban meant to eliminate the use of tobacco products over time.",
      "Other locations have weighed similar \u201cgenerational tobacco bans,\u201d which phase out the use of tobacco products based not just on a person's age but on birth year.",
      "Under a Massachusetts law signed in 2018, the age to buy any tobacco product \u2014 including cigarettes, cigars and e-cigarettes \u2014 was raised to 21. Massachusetts also has banned the sale of all flavored tobacco products in an effort to reduce youth interest in nicotine.",
      "The new proposal, which lawmakers plan to file next year, would expand the effort to curb smoking by gradually ending all sales of nicotine and tobacco products. If the bill is approved, young people not old enough to legally purchase nicotine and tobacco would never be lawfully able to purchase them in Massachusetts, thereby creating no more new users.",
      "It would not apply to marijuana, and the cutoff date would be adjusted when passed to ensure everyone age 21 and above at that time would not be affected.",
      "Brookline, a town of about 63,000 neighboring Boston, was the first municipality in the country to adopt such a ban in 2020. Instead of raising the age for purchasing cigarettes, the bylaw blocks the sale of tobacco to anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 2000. The rule went into effect in 2021.",
      "That would mean at some point in the future no one would be allowed to buy any tobacco products in the town. The measure was challenged, but the state's highest court weighed in earlier this year, upholding the ban.",
      "Other Massachusetts cities and towns already have approved similar tobacco bans, including Malden, Melrose, Reading, Stoneham, Wakefield, and Winchester.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Jason Lewis, one of the backers of the statewide proposal, said the bill would \"save countless lives and create a healthier world for the next generation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all know the devastating health effects of nicotine and tobacco products, especially on our youth,\" he said.",
      "Nicotine and tobacco products are addictive and can increase the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and other illnesses.",
      "Nearly 9 out of 10 adults who smoke cigarettes daily first tried smoking by age 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also found that in 2024 about 2 in 5 students who had ever used a tobacco product currently used them.",
      "Peter Brennan, executive director of the New England Convenience Store and Energy Marketers Association, said the proposal would undercut small mom and pop shops that rely on cigarettes for a significant portion of their sales.",
      "It also would put stores located near neighboring states that allow the sale of cigarettes to all adults at a competitive disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really just taking away adults\u2019 right to purchase a legal, age-restricted product.\u201d",
      "Taking certain rights away from some adults and not others is likely unconstitutional, he said, adding that other prohibition efforts haven\u2019t worked, like past bans on alcohol, marijuana and gambling.",
      "It's unclear how much support the proposal has in the Legislature.",
      "Massachusetts has taken other steps in recent decades to curb smoking, including raising taxes on cigarettes. Those taxes would presumably be reduced and ultimately eliminated by an incremental statewide smoking ban.",
      "Any reduction in cigarette tax revenue would be more than offset by reduced healthcare costs and other savings, Lewis said.",
      "In 2022, 10.4% of adults in Massachusetts reported smoking cigarettes, according to the state Department of Public Health.",
      "Some California lawmakers have pushed to ban all tobacco sales, filing legislation last year to make it illegal to sell cigarettes and other products to anyone born after Jan. 1, 2007.",
      "In 2022, New Zealand became the first nation to pass a law intended to impose a lifetime ban on young people buying cigarettes by mandating that tobacco can\u2019t ever be sold to anybody born on or after Jan. 1, 2009. The law was later axed.",
      "In the U.K., Prime Minister Rishi Sunak proposed raising the legal age that people in England can buy cigarettes by one year, every year until it is eventually illegal for the whole population. The proposal failed to win approval earlier this year."

      "Cucumbers shipped to the U.S. and Canada, and organic eggs sold in 25 Costco stores in five southern U.S. states, were recalled this week for potential salmonella contamination.",
      "The cucumber outbreak sickened 68 people, including 18 who were hospitalized, in 19 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. No one has died. Produce grown in Sonora, Mexico, by Agrotato S.A. may be the culprit, the agency said.",
      "A recall announced Thursday by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was tied to the outbreak. SunFed Produce, based in Arizona, recalled cucumbers sold between Oct. 12 and Nov. 26, the FDA said.",
      "The recall happened after SunFed was told by the FDA that there were associated illnesses reported between Oct. 12 and Nov. 15. People who bought cucumbers during the window should check with the store where they purchased them to see if the produce is part of the recall.",
      "The egg recall involved nearly 11,000 cartons of 24-count organic eggs sold under Costco's Kirkland Signature brand that landed on shelves in Alabama, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee starting Nov. 22, according to the company\u2019s announcement posted Wednesday on the FDA website.",
      "No illnesses were immediately reported. Handsome Brook Farms said the cartons included eggs that were \u201cnot intended for retail distribution.\" Shoppers should check to see whether their egg cartons have Julian code 327 printed on the side and have a use-by date of Jan. 5, 2025. If the eggs are included in the recall, throw them out or take them back to the store for a refund.",

      "NEW YORK -- There\u2019s no easy way to bridge the political divides that have created rifts in communities, families and friendships.",
      "But workplace morale and productivity can take a hit when ideological differences are left to fester, affecting teamwork and feelings of mutual respect. Finding a safe space to process emotions while remaining civil can be a delicate balancing act.",
      "While talking politics with colleagues can be fortifying, the opposite also can be true when we disagree. Being exposed to strongly held beliefs that run counter to one\u2019s own values can lead to people feeling mistreated or unsafe. This month's U.S. presidential election heightened those tensions.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of anxiety during this election, and in times of anxiety you need to create psychological safety in people,\u201d said Ron Gutman, an adjunct professor of leadership at Stanford University and the co-founder and co-CEO of health technology company Intrivo. \u201cYou need to create trust in people, to bring back the trust in each other.\u201d",
      "Here are some tips from business leaders, psychologists and communication experts on how to navigate political conflicts in the workplace.",
      "To cultivate a more peaceful working environment, executives, managers and employees can practice humility. That means seeing ourselves as equal and not superior to our colleagues and subordinates, and recognizing that no one has all the right answers.",
      "When we listen to others thoughtfully and relinquish a reflexive belief in our own infallibility, it allows us to remain open to new ideas and perspectives, said Inclusivv CEO Jenn Graham, whose organization creates structured dialogues around social and political issues for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWe can say something like, \u2018I haven\u2019t heard of that or thought of that before. Thank you for sharing,\u2019\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd that simple act of \u2018thank you for sharing,\u2019 with gratitude and humility combined, creates a reciprocity for that brave space, for that psychological safety. And that\u2019s what we need to foster more than ever.\u201d",
      "To cultivate a humble mindset, think about why you might be wrong, and consider that the opposite of what you believe might be true, said Jake Telkamp, an assistant professor at Augusta University in Georgia. \u201cWe are really good at seeking out information that supports our beliefs, and then we scrutinize evidence that challenges our beliefs,\u201d he said.",
      "In some situations, a more guarded approach is warranted. If political talk feels like a personal attack, you may need to find allies who can help you process what you\u2019re hearing and feeling.",
      "For example, when a comedian opened a campaign rally for President-elect Donald Trump last month by referring to Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage,\u201d many people were deeply upset, said psychologist Alfiee Breland-Noble, founder of The AAKOMA Project, a nonprofit organization focused on empowering youth and young adults of color and people who face sexism and homophobia.",
      "The same was true after Black teenagers and adults received text messages this month telling them they were \u201cselected to pick cotton,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of sadness around, why isn\u2019t anybody publicly telling these people, 'You can\u2019t say these things about people who come from my community?\u2019\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "People feel like their lives are on the line, and are asking, \u201cWhere do I go with this struggle that I\u2019m having? Because people who look like me nationally, we all feel like we\u2019re under attack,\u201d she said.",
      "Breland-Noble encourages employees who feel marginalized by political discourse to identify colleagues to confide in, to check workplace policies for any rules on unacceptable speech and behavior, and to consider speaking with a trusted supervisor about what they\u2019re experiencing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot that we can learn from how people have over time managed having a marginalized identity and being in the workplace because you have a plethora of people around you who are dealing with this stuff literally every day,\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "Also check your employer\u2019s social media policy. In many states, workers can be fired for posting political beliefs online, said Brad Kelley, a shareholder who represents employers at the law firm Littler.",
      "When attempting to resolve discord, one way to foster a peaceful resolution is to seek common ground.",
      "In the structured conversations she leads, Graham encourages participants to begin by listening to and acknowledging what the other person is saying. Repeat it back. Honor their emotions. Then you can share your perspective, and in the process you may find similarities, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking for common ground, you\u2019re ideally looking for a shared value,\" Graham said. It could be as simple as recognizing \u201cwe both have a need for and a desire for (fill in the) blank.\u201d",
      "Most people want a happier, healthier, more prosperous country, but the disagreement often lies in how to best get there, Telkamp said. Acknowledging shared goals can help de-escalate tension.",
      "\u201cPeople on the left and the right are disliking, distrusting, and generally they think people on the other side are unintelligent and immoral,\u201d Telkamp said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how we can kind of get off the ledge a little bit and come back to a better understanding of each other.\u201d",
      "One way managers can try to bridge divides is to create rituals for employees to share what\u2019s important to them, Gutman said. This can help build a baseline of trust within an organization.",
      "Every Friday at Intrivo, the staff gathers for an hour and one person presents on a topic they\u2019re passionate about. It could be a hobby, an idea, a family experience or a skill. Political topics are fine as long as no one is putting anyone down, he said.",
      "\u201cIt can be super technical or super silly,\u201d Gutman said. The conversations build trust, and a sense of safety and community, he said.",
      "In circumstances where a discussion is getting heated, sometimes the best way to handle it is to remove ourselves from the conflict or to keep our views to ourselves.",
      "Leaders may want to consider abstaining from sharing their political views, which may alienate some workers, Telkamp said. \u201cThat\u2019s not about silencing your beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about keeping the workplace focused on the work.\u201d",

      "Biden's three-day visit to Angola will focus largely on the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance the U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies.",
      "Biden's trip comes weeks before Republican Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20, finally delivering on Biden's pledge to visit sub-Saharan Africa. On his way to Angola, he stopped in the Atlantic Ocean island nation of Cape Verde for a brief, closed-door meeting with Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva.",
      "Biden plans to meet with Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o in the capital, Luanda, where crowds lined the streets for his arrival, and visit the National Slavery Museum. He also will travel to the Atlantic port city of Lobito for a look at the rail project. He will announce new developments on health, agribusiness and security, White House officials said.",
      "Biden had been expected to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit in December 2022. The trip was pushed back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among some Africans that their continent is still low priority for Washington.",
      "The last U.S. president to visit sub-Saharan Africa was Barack Obama in 2015. Biden did attend a United Nations climate summit in Egypt in North Africa in 2022.",
      "\u201cI just kind of push back on the premise that this is some Johnny-come-lately trip at the very end,\u201d national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on board Air Force One on the way to Angola, noting that top administration officials had visited Africa, including Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cThis is something he (Biden) has been focused on since he became president of the United States.\u201d",
      "Critical minerals are a key field for U.S.-China competition, and China has a stranglehold on Africa\u2019s critical minerals.",
      "The U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer) railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China\u2019s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy.",
      "The Biden administration has called the corridor one of the president\u2019s signature initiatives, yet Lobito\u2019s future and any change in U.S. engagement with the continent depends on the incoming administration of President-elect Trump.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden is no longer the story,\u201d said Mvemba Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEven African leaders are focused on Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has committed $3 billion to the Lobito Corridor and related projects, administration officials said, alongside financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks.",

      "Many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which won't be complete until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration. Blunting China has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump\u2019s to-do list.",
      "\u201cAs long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it\u2019s going to keep being funded,\u201d said Christian-G\u00e9raud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Kirby said the Biden administration hopes Trump and his team see the value in Lobito but \u201cwe are still in office. We still have 50 days. This is a key major development not just for the United States and our foreign policy goals in Africa, but for Africans.\u201d",
      "The Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola\u2019s port of Lobito, strengthening a route west for Africa\u2019s critical minerals. It also ultimately aims to extend from Zambia and Congo to Africa\u2019s east coast through Tanzania and be a coast-to-coast rail link.",
      "While Biden\u2019s administration called it a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for U.S. investment in Africa, it\u2019s little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, with China dominant in mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, with most heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe rely on.",
      "Michelle Gavin, a former adviser on Africa to Obama, said the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend.",
      "The Lobito Corridor was \u201cnot just about trying to blunt China, but trying to imagine, OK, what does it look like if we actually were to show up in a more serious way?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one project. It\u2019s one good idea. And I\u2019m very glad we\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s not enough.\u201d",
      "Lobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola\u2019s long and strong ties with Beijing.",
      "The Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola\u2019s civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year.",
      "The visit will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America\u2019s value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden\u2019s trip to criticize the Louren\u00e7o government\u2019s authoritarian shift.

      "A top Romanian court has validated the first round of a presidential race in which a far-right outsider emerged as the frontrunner, plunging the country into a week of turmoil amid allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- After a ballot recount, a top Romanian court on Monday validated the first round of a presidential race in which a far-right outsider emerged as the frontrunner, plunging the country into turmoil amid allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling.",
      "The Constitutional Court\u2019s unanimous decision came after it had asked the Central Election Bureau to recount and verify all 9.4 million ballots cast in the first round of the presidential election on Nov. 24. The election bureau approved the request and proceeded with the recount.",
      "Monday's decision is final.",
      "Calin Georgescu, a little-known far-right populist and independent candidate, narrowly won the first round, beating the incumbent prime minister Marcel Ciolacu. Georgescu will face reformist Elena Lasconi, the leader of the Save Romania Union party, in a runoff on Sunday.",
      "Lasconi beat Ciolacu by just 2,740 votes.",
      "The recount was prompted by a complaint lodged by Cristian Terhes, a presidential candidate who garnered 1% of the ballot. Terhes\u2019 media office said the court ordered the recount \u201cdue to indications of fraud,\u201d alleging that valid votes cast for Ludovic Orban \u2014 who had dropped out of the race but remained on the ballot \u2014 were reassigned to Lasconi.",
      "He also claimed that Lasconi\u2019s party had urged people to vote before some diaspora polls had closed, saying it violated electoral laws against campaign activities on polling day.",
      "On Monday, the election bureau submitted partial recount results to the court, which did not include hundreds of thousands of the votes from Romania\u2019s large diaspora.",
      "Dominic Fritz, the vice president of Save Romania Union party led by Lasconi, said in a statement before that court\u2019s decision that more than 8 million votes had been recounted, and that \u201cno one has found any reason to question the final results.\u201d",
      "Many observers had warned that invalidating the vote could further fuel the crisis that gripped Romania's political establishment in the wake of the first round.",
      "Georgescu\u2019s unexpected success prompted a series of protests by people who claim he is a threat to democracy and who are concerned with previous remarks he made in praising Romanian fascist and nationalist leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Many have attributed to his rapid rise in popularity on the social media platform TikTok.",
      "According to a report by Expert Forum, a Bucharest-based think tank, Georgescu\u2019s account had an explosion, which it said \u201cappears sudden and artificial, similar to his polling results.\u201d",
      "Without naming Georgescu, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis\u2019 office said after a Supreme Council of National Defense meeting last Thursday that an analysis of documents revealed that \u201ca presidential candidate benefited from massive exposure due to preferential treatment granted by the TikTok platform.\u201d",
      "Romania\u2019s National Audiovisual Council asked the European Commission to investigate TikTok\u2019s role in the Nov. 24 vote. Pavel Popescu, the vice president of Romania\u2019s media regulator Ancom, said he would request TikTok\u2019s suspension in Romania if investigations find evidence of \u201cmanipulation of the electoral process.\u201d",
      "In an emailed statement to The Associated Press on Monday, TikTok said it was \u201cinaccurate and misleading to ascribe his campaign activity solely to TikTok,\u201d and noted that Georgescu also used other social media platforms.",
      "\u201cWe are highly vigilant against actors who seek to use deceptive behaviors to try to affect civic processes and work diligently to identify and remove covert influence operations,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Separately, Romania held a parliamentary election on Sunday in which pro-Western parties won the most votes and will look to form a coalition government. The ballot also saw a surge of support for far-right nationalists who made huge gains in the country\u2019s legislature."

      "Thirteen women from the Philippines have been convicted on human trafficking-related charges for acting as surrogates in Cambodia for a ring selling babies to foreigners for cash",
      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Thirteen women from the Philippines have been convicted on human trafficking-related charges for acting as surrogates in Cambodia for a ring selling babies to foreigners for cash.",
      "The women were each sentenced to four years in prison after being found guilty of selling, buying or exchanging a person for cross-border transfer, the Kandal Provincial Court said late Monday.",
      "According to the verdict, two of the four years in prison were suspended, meaning they won't have to be served unless they're found guilty of another crime.",
      "The women are held at a police hospital outside Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, and authorities have previously said they would not have to serve prison time until after giving birth.",
      "The women can appeal the verdict, said court spokesperson So Sarin. He refused to comment on how many were still pregnant, or what would happen to the babies after they have given birth.",
      "Developing countries have been popular for surrogacy because costs are much lower compared to the United States and Australia, where surrogate services could cost around $150,000.",
      "The Cambodia case was unusual because surrogates normally are employed in their own countries, not transported elsewhere.",
      "Authorities have said the business that recruited the women was based in Thailand, and that their food and accommodation in Cambodia was organized there.",
      "The women were arrested in late September in a raid on a villa in Kandal province, where authorities found 20 Filipinos and four Vietnamese.",
      "At the time the women were charged in October, Cambodia\u2019s Interior Ministry said the ringleaders had not been identified. It said, however, that it considered the women offenders who conspired with the organizers to act as surrogates and then sell the babies for money, rather than victims.",
      "Eleven of the women who were not pregnant were deported, and the 13 Filipinos were charged under a provision on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation. The law was updated in 2016 to ban commercial surrogacy after Cambodia became a popular destination for foreigners seeking women to give birth to their children.",
      "Cambodia has a bad reputation for human trafficking, especially in connection with online scams in which foreigners recruited for work under false pretenses are kept in conditions of virtual slavery and help perpetrate criminal fraud online against targets in many countries.",
      "The surrogacy business boomed in Cambodia after it was put under tight restrictions in neighboring Thailand, as well as in India and Nepal.",
      "In July 2017, a Cambodian court sentenced an Australian woman and two Cambodian associates to 1 1/2 years in prison for providing commercial surrogacy services."

      "The capture of the towns is the latest in the push by insurgents led by the salafi jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, as well as Turkey-backed opposition fighters. Insurgents now are about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Hama, the country\u2019s fourth largest city.",
      "The latest push is part of a wide offensive by forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad that over the past days has captured large parts of the northern city of Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest, as well as towns and villages in southern parts of the northwestern Idlib province.",
      "The insurgents\u2019 military operations administration said gunmen killed 50 government forces as they captured the central towns of Halfaya, Taybat al-Imam, Maardis and Soran. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, confirmed that the towns were taken.",
      "The pro-government Dama Post media outlet reported intense clashes in an around the towns, adding that Syrian troops are firing artillery shells at insurgents in the area. State media reported intense airstrikes by Syrian and Russian air forces in the area.",
      "Both the Observatory and pro-government media outlets reported that Syrian government forces on Tuesday captured the village of Khanaser, days after losing it. Khanaser sits on one of the roads that lead to Aleppo.",
      "The long war between Assad and his foreign backers and the array of armed opposition forces seeking his overthrow has killed an estimated half-million people over the past 13 years.",
      "To the east, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement that they captured seven villages from pro-government fighters. Syrian state media, however, denied that the villages were captured by the U.S.-backed SDF saying that the attack was repelled.",
      "The villages are close to a base housing U.S. troops in the area that is close to Iraq.",
      "Also Tuesday, Hakan Fidan, the foreign minister of Turkey, which is a main backer of groups opposed to Assad, said the recent rapid advance by insurgents in Syria shows that the Syrian president must reconcile with his own people and hold talks with the opposition.",
      "Assad and officials in his government say all armed groups in opposition-held parts of Syria are terrorists and has rejected any political solution with them.",
      "Turkey has been seeking to normalize ties with Syria to address security threats from groups affiliated with Kurdish militants along its southern border and to help ensure the safe return of more than 3 million Syrian refugees. Assad has insisted that Turkey's withdrawal of its military forces from northern Syria be a condition for any normalization between the two countries."

      "A Zimbabwean High Court judge has ruled that provisions of a law that deny abortion services to women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 are unconstitutional",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- A law prohibiting abortion services for women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 is unconstitutional, Zimbabwe\u2019s High Court has ruled.",
      "In his ruling handed down on Nov. 22 and made public this week, Judge Maxwell Takuva said since Zimbabwe\u2019s laws already criminalize marital rape and sex with a minor, victims should be allowed to abort if they become pregnant.",
      "The ruling is significant, given Zimbabwe\u2019s restrictive abortion laws that often lead women and girls into illegal and unsafe backstreet abortions that in many cases turn fatal.",
      "Abortion is allowed in very few circumstances in Zimbabwe, including such as if the pregnancy endangers the life of a woman, or if there is a risk of a physical or mental defect \u201cof such a nature that (the child) will permanently be seriously handicapped.\u201d Women can also access legal abortion services in cases of unlawful sex such as incest.",
      "Zimbabwe criminalized sex with any person below 18 in September following an earlier constitutional court ruling ordering parliament to raise the legal age of consent for sex to 18 from 16. But the highly restrictive Termination of Pregnancy Act still denied abortion services for girls under 18.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that it is torture, cruel and degrading treatment for a child to carry another child, for a child to give birth to another child or for a child to be forced to illegally abort because of cruel circumstances,\u201d said the judge.",
      "The government did not mount any opposition to the case, which was brought by a women\u2019s rights group, although the ruling must still be approved by the Constitutional Court to become effective.",
      "The judge said providing access to safe and legal abortion services for underage girls \u201cis significant in light of the massive instances of teenage pregnancies in Zimbabwe, and consequently illegal teen abortions and teenage mortalities.\u201d",
      "The country of 15 million people records about 77,000 unsafe abortions annually, but many others go unreported. Many girls and women die from abortion complications each year, according to the United Nations children\u2019s agency, UNICEF.",
      "Teen pregnancies are rife in the southern African country because of lax enforcement of laws, cultural and religious practices and widespread poverty that also make it difficult for girls and women to access contraceptives and clinics.",
      "Almost one of every four girls falls pregnant between the ages of 10 and 19, according to figures by the government and UNICEF. One of every three girls is wed before age 18 in the deeply conservative southern African country where girls are usually culturally forced to marry men responsible for their unplanned pregnancies."

They demand that major polluting nations be held to account.",

      "\u201cThe stakes could not be higher. The survival of my people and so many others is on the line,\u201d said Arnold Kiel Loughman, attorney-general of the Vanuatu archipelago nation.",

He added that \u201ca handful of readily identifiable states have produced the vast majority of historic and current greenhouse gas emissions. Yet other countries, including my own, are suffering the brunt of the consequences.\u201d",
      "The Hague-based court will hear from 99 countries and more than a dozen intergovernmental organizations over two weeks. It\u2019s the largest lineup in the institution\u2019s nearly 80-year history.",
      "Last month at the United Nations\u2019 annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the $1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed.",
      "\u201cFor our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the world\u2019s biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines,\u201d said Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change.",

And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment?",

      "Israel has unleashed its largest wave of airstrikes across Lebanon since agreeing to a ceasefire with Hezbollah last week, killing at least 11 people",
      "JERUSALEM -- Israel unleashed its largest wave of airstrikes across Lebanon since agreeing to a ceasefire with Hezbollah last week, killing at least 11 people on Monday after the Lebanese militant group fired a volley of projectiles as a warning over what it said were Israeli truce violations.",
      "The projectiles were apparently the first time that Hezbollah took aim at Israeli forces after the 60-day ceasefire went into effect last Wednesday. The increasingly fragile truce aimed to end more than a year of war between Hezbollah and Israel \u2014 part of a wider regional conflict sparked by the devastating Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "In the United States, President-elect Donald Trump demanded the immediate release of Israeli hostages held by the Palestinian militant Hamas group in Gaza, saying on social media that if they are not freed before he takes office in January there would be \u201cHELL TO PAY.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear whether Trump was threatening to directly involve the U.S. military in Israel\u2019s ongoing war in Gaza. The U.S. has given Israel crucial military and diplomatic support throughout the nearly 15-month conflict.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry said an Israeli airstrike on the southern village of Haris killed five people and wounded two while another airstrike on the village of Tallousa killed four and also wounded two.",
      "Israel's military carried out a string of airstrikes late Monday against what it said were Hezbollah fighters, infrastructure and rocket launchers across Lebanon, in response to Hezbollah firing two projectiles toward Mount Dov \u2014 a disputed Israeli-held territory known as Shebaa Farms in Lebanon where the borders of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel meet. Israel said the projectiles fell in open areas and no injuries were reported.",
      "Hezbollah said in a statement that it fired on an Israeli military position in the area as a \u201cdefensive and warning response\u201d after what it called \u201crepeated violations\u201d of the ceasefire deal by Israel. It said complaints to mediators tasked with monitoring the ceasefire \u201cwere futile in stopping these violations.\u201d",
      "Before the Hezbollah projectiles, Israeli carried out at least four airstrikes and an artillery barrage in southern Lebanon, including a drone strike that killed a person on a motorcycle, according to Lebanese state media. Another strike killed a corporal in the Lebanese security services.",
      "Israel has said its strikes are in response to unspecified Hezbollah violations, and that under the ceasefire deal it reserves the right to retaliate.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, accused Israel of violating the truce more than 50 times in recent days by launching airstrikes, demolishing homes near the border and violating Lebanon's airspace.",
      "Officials in the U.S. \u2014 which along with France helped broker the truce and heads a commission meant to monitor adherence to the deal \u2014 played down the significance of Israeli strikes. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said, \u201cLargely speaking, the ceasefire is holding.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from dozens of strikes down to one a day maybe two a day,\u201d Kirby told reporters, referring to Israeli strikes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep trying and see what we can do to get it down to zero.\u201d",
      "Under the deal, Iran-backed Hezbollah has 60 days to withdraw its fighters and infrastructure from southern Lebanon. During that time, Israeli troops are also to withdraw to their side of the border.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social site, Trump called for Palestinian militants to free all of the roughly 100 Israeli hostages still held inside Gaza, around two-thirds of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "If not, Trump said, \u201cThose responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!\u201d",
      "Hours earlier, the Israeli government confirmed the death of Omer Neutra, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, whose body is still believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza, according to the Israeli government. The Biden administration is mounting a last-ditch effort to try to restart talks between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office declined to comment on Trump's post though President Isaac Herzog welcomed it.",
      "In Gaza, meanwhile, alarm is mounting over increasing hunger. The amount of food allowed in by Israel has plunged over the past two months, compounded by a decision Sunday by the United Nations to halt aid deliveries from the main crossing into the territory because of the threat of armed gangs looting convoys.",
      "Experts have already warned of famine in the northernmost part of Gaza, which Israeli forces have almost completely isolated since early October, saying they're fighting regrouped Hamas militants there.",
      "Displaced families have set up tents surrounded by piles of garbage on the streets of Gaza City. Bilal Marouf, 55, said he and 11 family members fled the Israeli offensive \u201cbarefoot and naked.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had nothing. Hunger and thirst killed us, and we did not have a single shekel, nor clothes, nor a mattress, nor a blanket,\u201d he said, speaking near his tent.",
      "Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas\u2019 Oct 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, has driven almost the entire population of the territory from their homes. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians now live in squalid tent camps, relying on international aid.",
      "The Israeli military said it allowed 40 trucks carrying 600 tons of flour for the World Food Program to enter the southern Gaza Strip on Sunday night, as well as 16 other food trucks.",
      "Israel has said it is working to increase the flow of aid. November saw an increase in the average number of humanitarian trucks it let into Gaza, up to 77 daily from 57 the month before, according to official Israeli figures.",
      "But the levels are still nearly the lowest of the entire 15-month war. And the U.N. says less than half of that actually reaches Palestinians because Israeli military restrictions, fighting and robberies make it too dangerous to deliver the aid.",
      "The World Food Program was able to only deliver aid to some 300,000 Palestinians in November across the Gaza Strip due to ongoing Israeli military offensives and the looting of convoys, Carl Skau, WFP\u2019s deputy executive director, said Monday.",
      "In a tent camp in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, Palestinians lined up at makeshift mud ovens trying to buy a few loaves of flatbread for their families.",
      "With the price of flour mounting because of scarcity, the bakers \u2014 women displaced from further north \u2014 said they could bake less bread, and families could afford far less.",
      "\u201cThey divide them to their children, one loaf every day,\u201d said one woman baker, Wafaa al-Attar.",

      "Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral has some surprising stories to tell before it reopens this weekend after five years of restoration",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Notre Dame Cathedral, which is set to reopen to the public on Sunday after a five-year restoration following a devastating fire, stands as a jewel of Gothic architecture, a symbol of Paris and a tourist mecca.",
      "But behind the grandeur of the cathedral, which took 182 years to build between the 12th and 14th centuries, lie some surprising stories. From medieval myths to modern-day mysteries, here are five special things to know about this Paris landmark:",
      "Notre Dame\u2019s importance goes beyond its architecture and history \u2014 it\u2019s literally the point from which all roads in France begin.",
      "In front of the cathedral, embedded in the cobblestones, lies a modest bronze-and-stone slab with the inscription \u201cpoint z\u00e9ro des routes de France,\u201d meaning \u201cstarting point of the roads of France.'' This plaque marks the starting point for measuring distances between Paris and other cities across the country.",
      "While the plaque was installed in 1924, the idea of a national \u201cground zero\u201d dates to 1769. King Louis XV envisioned a central reference for France\u2019s growing network of roads, a concept that tied the nation\u2019s geography to its heart in Paris.",
      "Those scary stone creatures on Notre Dame might seem ancient, but not all of them are what they appear. The actual gargoyles, which are monster-shaped gutters used to drain rainwater, have been around since the time of the cathedral\u2019s construction. But the dramatic, monster-like figures often depicted on postcards and movies are chimera, and they\u2019re much newer.",
      "In the 19th century, the architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, who was in charge of renovating the then-decaying building, added these creatures to add to the mystique of the cathedral. Viollet-le-Duc drew inspiration from Victor Hugo\u2019s famous book \u2018\u2019The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' to create these demonic animal figures with personified expressions.",
      "How to tell them apart? Gargoyles resemble horizontal spikes coming out of the facade and have holes in their spouts to allow water to drain.",
      "During the French Revolution, which saw waves of protest against the Church, Notre Dame wasn\u2019t exactly treated like a revered cathedral. In 1793, revolutionaries stripped it of its religious symbols and renamed it \u201cNotre-Dame de la Raison\u201d (Our Lady of Reason).",
      "Instead, the cathedral hosted festivals celebrating science and Enlightenment ideas, and for a short time, it was even used as a wine warehouse.",
      "Religious services resumed in 1795, and Notre Dame regained its sacred status on the impulse of French emperor Napoleon I, who held his coronation there in 1804, immortalized in a famous painting by Jacques-Louis David.",
      "In 1792, revolutionaries also decapitated 28 statues from Notre Dame\u2019s facade, mistaking them for French monarchs. They were actually ancient kings of Judah, biblical ancestors of Jesus. The heads were thought lost forever, possibly destroyed or sold as building materials.",
      "But in 1977, workers renovating a courtyard in Paris\u2019 9th arrondissement uncovered hundreds of fragments of stone sculptures. Experts confirmed they were the missing heads of Notre Dame\u2019s kings. How they ended up buried there remains a mystery.",
      "Today, 22 of the heads have been restored and are displayed at the Cluny Museum in Paris. Their discovery is considered one of the most remarkable archaeological finds in the city\u2019s modern history.",
      "The 2019 fire that almost destroyed Notre Dame revealed a serious health risk. When the flames melted the roof, tons of toxic lead dust were released into the air and settled across Paris.",
      "The problem? Authorities discovered there were no rules to measure the danger of outdoor lead dust. This wasn\u2019t just a Paris issue \u2014 major cities like London and Rome, and even the World Health Organization, don\u2019t have guidelines for outdoor lead pollution.",
      "The Notre Dame fire highlighted a hidden problem, forcing officials to take a closer look at their safety standards. It took four months for the city to complete a deep-clean operation of the sidewalks even as tourists, residents and merchants walked streets around the cathedral daily.",

      "The drugs had a sale value of 760 million Australian dollars ($494 million) and equaled as many as 11.7 million street deals if they had reached the country of 28 million people, federal police said in a statement.",
      "Investigators told reporters in Brisbane that the drugs were transported from an unidentified South American country.",
      "The arrests on Saturday and Sunday followed a monthlong investigation after a tipoff that the Comancheros motorcycle gang was planning a multi-ton smuggling operation, Australian Federal Police Commander Stephen Jay said.",
      "The smugglers made two attempts to transport the drugs to Australia by sea from a mothership floating hundreds of kilometers (miles) offshore, Jay said. Their first boat broke down, and the second vessel foundered on Saturday, leaving the suspects stranded at sea for several hours until police raided the fishing boat and seized the drugs, he said.",
      "The mothership was in international waters and was not apprehended, Jay said.",
      "Authorities have seized more than one ton of cocaine before, Jay said, but the weekend's haul was the biggest ever recorded in Australia.",
      "Those charged are accused of conspiring to import the drug into Australia by sea and were due to appear in various courts on Monday. The maximum penalty under the charge is life in prison.",
      "Some were arrested on the boat while others were waiting on shore to collect the cocaine, police said. Two were under age 18 and all were Australian citizens, they said.",

      "BAMAKO, Mali -- Drone strikes by Mali's military regime killed eight Tuareg rebel leaders in the town of Tinzaouatine in the north of the country, a rebel spokesman said Sunday. It was the first time since the start of the rebellion in 2012 that so many Taureg leaders have been killed in a single attack.",
      "\u201cSeveral synchronized drone strikes martyred some Azawad leader on December 1, 2024 in Tinzaouatine, near the Algerian border,\u201d spokesman Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane said in a statement.",
      "Azawad is the term used by the separatists for northern Mali. The statement from the separatists lists the names of eight Tuareg chiefs, the best known of whom is Fahad Ag Al Mahmoud, Secretary General of the Gatia, a Tuareg armed group.",
      "Later Sunday evening, the General Staff of the Malian armed forces confirmed the deaths of the rebel leaders, whom it described as terrorists, \u201cin a special operation.\u201d The military statement was broadcast on Malian national television channel ORTM.",

      "French Prime Minister Michel Barnier is bracing for a no-confidence vote this week, a political reckoning poised to topple his fragile government and send shockwaves across the eurozone",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 French Prime Minister Michel Barnier is bracing for a no-confidence vote this week, a political reckoning almost certain to topple his fragile government and send shockwaves across the eurozone.",
      "Barnier on Monday invoked a rarely used constitutional mechanism to push through the contentious 2025 budget without parliamentary approval, arguing it was essential to maintain \u201cstability\u201d amid deep political divisions.",
      "The move immediately drew sharp backlash, with Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally and the leftist New Popular Front both filing no-confidence motions in response, setting the stage for a vote as early as Wednesday that could see Barnier\u2019s ouster.",
      "The looming showdown unfolds against the backdrop of a fractured National Assembly, left in disarray after June\u2019s snap elections delivered no clear majority.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron had turned to Barnier in September to navigate the impasse and address France\u2019s soaring deficit. Yet Barnier\u2019s proposed austerity budget \u2014 slashing 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raising taxes by 20 billion euros \u2014 has only deepened divisions, inflaming tensions in the lower house and triggering this dramatic political confrontation.",
      "The use of the constitutional tool, called Article 49.3, allows the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote but leaves it exposed to no-confidence motions. Opposition leaders argue that Barnier\u2019s concessions, including scrapping an electricity tax hike, do not go far enough to address their concerns. Le Pen accused Barnier of ignoring her party\u2019s demands.",
      "\u201cEveryone must shoulder their responsibilities,\u201d she said.",
      "The political standoff has unsettled financial markets, with borrowing costs rising sharply amid fears of prolonged instability. Barnier warned of \u201cserious turbulence\u201d if the budget isn\u2019t passed, but critics dismissed his remarks as fear-mongering.",
      "If the no-confidence motion succeeds, Macron will remain president but will need to appoint a new prime minister to steer legislation through the fractured assembly. The uncertainty threatens to deepen France\u2019s economic troubles and reverberate across the eurozone."

      "The Grammy winner was detained for the first time in 2022 following mass protests that swept the Islamic Republic after Amini was arrested for wearing her hijab, the Islamic head covering, too loosely, and later died in police custody.",

      "Artificial intelligence is changing the way industries do business",
      "WASHINGTON -- Artificial intelligence is changing the way companies do business \u2014 helping programmers write code and fielding customer service calls with chatbots.",
      "But the pharmaceutical industry is still waiting to see whether AI can tackle its biggest challenge: finding faster, cheaper ways to develop new drugs.",
      "Despite billions poured into research, new medicines still typically take a decade or more to develop.",
      "Founded in 2018, Insitro is part of a growing field of AI companies promising to accelerate drug discovery by using machine learning to analyze huge datasets of chemical and biological markers. The South San Francisco-based company has signed deals with drugmakers like Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb to help develop medicines for metabolic diseases, neurological conditions and degenerative disorders.",
      "CEO and founder Daphne Koller spoke with the AP about what AI brings to the challenges of drug discovery. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: I think the problem with drug discovery is that we are trying to intervene in a system that we only slightly understand. Many of the successes that we\u2019ve seen in the last 15 to 20 years have been when we arrive at a sufficient understanding of the system so we can really design interventions to align with it.",
      "So one of the things that we try to do at Insitro is unravel the underlying complexity of heterogeneous diseases and identify new intervention modes that could help, maybe not the entire population, but perhaps just a subset of it. That way we can really identify the right therapeutic hypothesis to intervene in a particular patient population. And that, I think, is the real crux of the industry\u2019s lack of success.",
      "A: One of the things that has been happening in parallel to the AI revolution is a much quieter revolution in what I call quantitative biology, which is the ability to measure biological systems with unprecedented fidelity. You can measure systems like proteins and cells with increasingly better measurements and technology.",
      "But if you give that data to a person, their eyes will just glaze over because there\u2019s only so many cells someone can look at and only so many subtleties they can see in these images. People are just limited in their ability to perceive subtle differences.",
      "So you end up with a very reductionist view of a very complex, multifaceted system which is really important to unraveling the distinctions between patients and uncovering where an intervention really can make a difference.",
      "A: My PhD was in computer science. But I started to get into the field of machine learning in the service of biomedical problems back in 1998 or 1999.",
      "At that time, the problems that machine learning was able to tackle were, frankly, uninspiring. How inspired can you get about classifying spam versus non-spam in a dataset of email messages?",
      "I was looking for something that had more richness to it. And my first foray into this field was not because I was particularly interested in becoming a biologist, but because I was looking for more technically challenging questions. And then, as I started looking into it, I became interested in biology in its own right.",

      "The S&P 500 rose 0.2% from its all-time high set on Friday to post a record for the 54th time this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 128 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1%.",
      "Super Micro Computer, a stock that\u2019s been on an AI-driven roller coaster, soared 28.7% to lead the market.",
      "Following allegations of misconduct and the resignation of its public auditor, the maker of servers used in artificial-intelligence technology said an investigation found no evidence of misconduct by its management or by the company\u2019s board. It also said that it doesn\u2019t expect to restate its past financials and that it will find a new chief financial officer, appoint a general counsel and make other moves to strengthen its governance.",
      "Big Tech stocks also helped prop up the market. Gains of 1.8% for Microsoft and 3.2% for Meta Platforms were the two strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500.",
      "Intel was another propellant during the morning, but it lost an early gain to fall 0.5% after the chip company said CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired  and stepped down from the board. Intel is looking for Gelsinger\u2019s replacement, and its chair said it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to restoring investor confidence.\u201d Intel recently lost its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  to Nvidia, which has skyrocketed in Wall Street\u2019s frenzy around AI.",

Carlos Tavares steps down after nearly four years in the top spot of the automaker, which owns car brands like Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, amid an ongoing struggle with slumping sales and an inventory backlog at dealerships. The world\u2019s fourth-largest automaker\u2019s stock fell 6.3% in Milan.",

The euro fell amid a political battle in Paris over the French government\u2019s budget. The euro sank 0.7% against the U.S. dollar and broke below $1.05.",
      "In the bond market, Treasury yields gave up early gains to hold relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed above 4.23% during the morning before falling back to 4.19%. That was just above its level of 4.18% late Friday.",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 French Prime Minister Michel Barnier is bracing for a no-confidence vote this week, a political reckoning almost certain to topple his fragile government and send shockwaves across the eurozone.",
      "Barnier on Monday invoked a rarely used constitutional mechanism to push through the contentious 2025 budget without parliamentary approval, arguing it was essential to maintain \u201cstability\u201d amid deep political divisions.",
      "The move immediately drew sharp backlash, with Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally and the leftist New Popular Front both filing no-confidence motions in response, setting the stage for a vote as early as Wednesday that could see Barnier\u2019s ouster.",
      "The looming showdown unfolds against the backdrop of a fractured National Assembly, left in disarray after June\u2019s snap elections delivered no clear majority.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron had turned to Barnier in September to navigate the impasse and address France\u2019s soaring deficit. Yet Barnier\u2019s proposed austerity budget \u2014 slashing 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raising taxes by 20 billion euros \u2014 has only deepened divisions, inflaming tensions in the lower house and triggering this dramatic political confrontation.",
      "The use of the constitutional tool, called Article 49.3, allows the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote but leaves it exposed to no-confidence motions. Opposition leaders argue that Barnier\u2019s concessions, including scrapping an electricity tax hike, do not go far enough to address their concerns. Le Pen accused Barnier of ignoring her party\u2019s demands.",
      "\u201cEveryone must shoulder their responsibilities,\u201d she said.",
      "The political standoff has unsettled financial markets, with borrowing costs rising sharply amid fears of prolonged instability. Barnier warned of \u201cserious turbulence\u201d if the budget isn\u2019t passed, but critics dismissed his remarks as fear-mongering.",
      "If the no-confidence motion succeeds, Macron will remain president but will need to appoint a new prime minister to steer legislation through the fractured assembly. The uncertainty threatens to deepen France\u2019s economic troubles and reverberate across the eurozone."

    "story": [
      "Positioned along the seismically active Ring of Fire, Indonesia and the Philippines have the second and third highest installed geothermal energy capacity in the world, after the United States",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Providing round-the-clock energy, using minimal space and considered a clean source of power \u2014 geothermal energy seems like an ideal option for countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, where the potential is high, and governments are seeking to transition away from highly polluting fossil fuels.",
      "Yet most of the potential of geothermal energy, created by harnessing heat produced by the earth from underground reservoirs of hot water to power turbines that generate electricity, remains untapped in these countries and across the world \u2014 as financial, regulatory and community roadblocks have stalled growth.",
      "More readily available financing and domestic regulatory changes are starting to address these barriers, but experts say more should be done to unlock the vast clean energy source trapped just beneath the Earth\u2019s surface.",
      "Countries with high geothermal potential \u2014 such as the United States, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 are usually located close to tectonically active regions where hot water or steam is naturally carried to the Earth\u2019s surface through volcanic activity, or can be accessed by shallow drilling.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re essentially standing on our own sun, which we can get clean, reliable energy from,\u201d said Marit Brommer, CEO of the International Geothermal Association based in Germany.",
      "Experts also laud geothermal plants for their ability to operate continuously to meet the minimum level of power demanded around-the-clock, unaffected by weather, with long lifespans and minimal maintenance.",
      "As countries shift towards renewable and cleaner energy, geothermal use is expected to grow: In Southeast Asia, geothermal power generation is expected to increase tenfold from 2020 to 2050, reaching 276 million megawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "With their steaming volcanoes and bubbling lakes, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 two archipelagic Southeast Asian countries located on the seismically active \u201cRing of Fire\u201d \u2014 are the second and third-largest users of geothermal energy in the world, with some of the highest geothermal energy potential. The U.S. is number one.",
      "Yet Indonesia uses less a tenth of its gargantuan reserves, making up 6% of its power supply. In the Philippines, about 8% of geothermal capacity has been developed, constituting 14.6% of the country's energy use, the country's largest source of renewable energy.",
      "Both countries plan to expand use of geothermal energy as they transition away from fossil fuels: Indonesia aims to increase the share of geothermal power generation by at least 8% by 2030, making it the second-largest renewable energy source after hydropower. The Philippine government is targeting several projects to boost geothermal capacity by adding nearly 1.5 gigawatts, nearly doubling its current use.",
      "But the exploratory stage of geothermal development \u2014 when companies do tests and drilling to confirm the size, temperature, pressure, and potential production rates of sites \u2014 is expensive and risky. That makes it hard to attract finance for development, said Shigeru Yamamura, an energy specialist at the Asia Development Bank.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most difficult part of developers, because (financially) they cannot take 100% of the exploration risk themselves,\u201d Yamamura told The Associated Press.",
      "Climate finance for geothermal development is limited for most Southeast Asian nations, accounting for only 9% of finance available for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \u2014 a political and economic bloc of ten states in the region, which includes Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "A 2024 ASEAN energy report said \u201cblended finance\u201d using both public and private sources, grants and green bonds could help bridge the gap.",
      "The Philippine government has announced green energy auction schemes for geothermal energy and is preparing a \u201csmart green grid plan\u201d that prioritizes renewable energy \u2014 vital to enable private developers to get financing from banks. This signals progress in policy support for investment, Yamamura said.",
      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has focused on geothermal as part of the country's energy transition. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources says it's working to shorten permitting times and considering ways to increase rates of return on investments in geothermal projects. The state electric utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, also said it's committed to ramping up geothermal energy development.",
      "The World Bank is providing a $150 million loan to scale up Indonesian investments in geothermal energy by reducing the risks of early-stage exploration. The Green Climate Fund and the Clean Technology Fund are providing a $127.5 million.",
      "Even when finance is secured, community pushback can slow development.",
      "In Indonesia, residents of villages have protested projects, citing safety and environmental concerns: Several geothermal sites in Indonesia have had deadly gas leaks in the past five years.",
      "Some Indonesian communities don't understand what geothermal energy is and how they could benefit from its development, said Timothy Ravis, a doctoral student in global development at Cornell University.",
      "Protests at geothermal sites in the Philippines have led at least one company to pay royalties to Indigenous groups worried about land degradation caused by geothermal development.",
      "Governments and businesses should work to gain the consent of communities near projects to help ensure they succeed, said Brommer.",
      "\u201cWe need to show that this development benefits all people, not just a company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's not about being a good neighbor, it's about being the best neighbor and really working with communities to respect their concerns.\"",

      "Wisconsin public worker and teachers unions have scored a major legal victory with a ruling that restores collective bargaining rights they lost under a 2011 state law",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin public worker and teachers unions scored a major legal victory Monday with a ruling that restores collective bargaining rights they lost under a 2011 state law that sparked weeks of protests and made the state the center of the national battle over union rights.",
      "That law, known as Act 10, effectively ended the ability of most public employees to bargain for wage increases and other issues, and forced them to pay more for health insurance and retirement benefits.",
      "Under the ruling by Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost, all public sector workers who lost their collective bargaining power would have it restored to what was in place prior to 2011. They would be treated the same as the police, firefighter and other public safety unions that were exempted under the law.",
      "Republicans vowed to immediately appeal the ruling, which ultimately is likely to go before the Wisconsin Supreme Court. That only amplifies the importance of the April election that will determine whether the court remains controlled 4-3 by liberal justices.",
      "Former Gov. Scott Walker, who proposed the law that catapulted him onto the national political stage, decried the ruling in a post on the social media platform X as \u201cbrazen political activism.\u201d He said it makes the state Supreme Court election \u201cthat much more important.\u201d",
      "Supporters of the law have said it provided local governments more control over workers and the powers they needed to cut costs. Repealing the law, which allowed schools and local governments to raise money through higher employee contributions for benefits, would bankrupt those entities, backers of Act 10 have argued.",
      "Democratic opponents argue that the law has hurt schools and other government agencies by taking away the ability of employees to collectively bargain for their pay and working conditions.",
      "Union leaders were overjoyed with the ruling, which affects tens of thousands of public employees.",
      "\u201cWe realize there may still be a fight ahead of us in the courts, but make no mistake, we\u2019re ready to keep fighting until we all have a seat at the table again,\u201d said Ben Gruber, a conservation warden and president of AFSCME Local 1215.",
      "The law was proposed by Walker and enacted by the Republican-controlled Legislature in spite of massive protests that went on for weeks and drew as many as 100,000 people to the Capitol. The law has withstood numerous legal challenges over the years, but this was the first brought since the Wisconsin Supreme Court flipped to liberal control in 2023.",
      "The seven unions and three union leaders that brought the lawsuit argued that the law should be struck down because it creates unconstitutional exemptions for firefighters and other public safety workers. Attorneys for the Legislature and state agencies countered that the exemptions are legal, have already been upheld by other courts, and that the case should be dismissed.",
      "But Frost sided with the unions in July, saying the law violates equal protection guarantees in the Wisconsin Constitution by dividing public employees into \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cpublic safety\u201d employees. He ruled that general employee unions, like those representing teachers, can not be treated differently from public safety unions that were exempt from the law.",
      "His ruling Monday delineated the dozens of specific provisions in the law that must be struck.",
      "Wisconsin Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said he looked forward to appealing the ruling.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit came more than a decade after Act 10 became law and after many courts rejected the same meritless legal challenges,\u201d Vos said in a statement.",
      "Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state's largest business lobbying organization, also decried the ruling. WMC President Kurt Bauer called Act 10 \u201ca critical tool for policymakers and elected officials to balance budgets and find taxpayer savings.\"",
      "The Legislature said in court filings that arguments made in the current case were rejected in 2014 by the state Supreme Court. The only change since that ruling is the makeup of Wisconsin Supreme Court, attorneys for the Legislature argued.",
      "The Act 10 law effectively ended collective bargaining for most public unions by allowing them to bargain solely over base wage increases no greater than inflation. It also disallowed the automatic withdrawal of union dues, required annual recertification votes for unions, and forced public workers to pay more for health insurance and retirement benefits.",
      "The law was the signature legislative achievement of Walker, who was targeted for a recall election he won. Walker used his fights with unions to mount an unsuccessful presidential run in 2016.",
      "Frost, the judge who issued Monday's ruling, appeared to have signed the petition to recall Walker from office. None of the attorneys sought his removal from the case and he did not step down. Frost was appointed to the bench by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who signed the Walker recall petition.",
      "The law has also led to a dramatic decrease in union membership across the state. The nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum said in a 2022 analysis that since 2000, Wisconsin had the largest decline in the proportion of its workforce that is unionized.",
      "In 2015, the GOP-controlled Wisconsin Legislature approved a right-to-work law that limited the power of private-sector unions.",
      "Public sector unions that brought the lawsuit are the Abbotsford Education Association; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Locals 47 and 1215; the Beaver Dam Education Association; SEIU Wisconsin; the Teaching Assistants\u2019 Association Local 3220 and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 695."

      "WASHINGTON -- A majority of Supreme Court justices didn't seem convinced Monday that federal regulators misled companies before refusing to allow them to sell sweet-flavored vaping products following a surge in teen e-cigarette use.",
      "The conservative-majority court did raise questions about the Food and Drug Administration crackdown that included denials of more than a million nicotine products formulated to taste like fruit, dessert or candy. Teen vaping use has since dropped to its lowest level in a decade, but the agency could change its approach after the inauguration next month of President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to \u201csave\u201d vaping.",
      "Vaping companies have long marketed their products as a way to help adults quit traditional cigarettes, and say the FDA changed its standards with little warning as it blocked the sale of over a million new flavored products.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan, though, was skeptical.",
      "\u201cI guess I\u2019m not really seeing what the surprise is here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew what the FDA\u2019s point of view was ... that blueberry vapes are really problematic in terms of youth smoking.\"",
      "The FDA was slow to regulate the now multibillion-dollar vaping market, and even years into the crackdown flavored vapes that are technically illegal nevertheless remain widely available.",
      "The agency says the companies were denied because they couldn't show flavored vapes had a net public benefit, as laid out in the law. It has approved some tobacco-flavored vapes, and recently allowed its first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers after the company provided data showing the product was more helpful in quitting, Deputy Solicitor General Curtis Gannon said.",
      "The issue came before the high court when the agency appealed a decision from the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals tossing out one of its denials.",
      "While other lower courts rebuffed vaping company lawsuits, the 5th Circuit sided with Dallas-based company Triton Distribution. The decision allowed the sale of e-juices like \u201cJimmy The Juice Man in Peachy Strawberry\" and \u201cSuicide Bunny Mother's Milk and Cookies\u201d which are heated by an e-cigarette to create an inhalable aerosol.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether the FDA process had given the companies a fair chance to make their claims, given that their businesses were at stake.",

      "The vaping companies, he said, can reapply for sales authorization even if they don't win in court. Triton attorney Eric Heyer said that process would take so long that the company could be forced to close.",
      "The court has overall been skeptical of the power of federal regulators, including by striking down the so-called Chevron doctrine that had judges deferring to agencies' interpretation of the law.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned whether the vaping companies wanted the court to take that concept a step further. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a reverse Chevron deference, except we're deferring to the applicant,\" she said.",

      "Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls, as the administration of President Joe Biden has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these Entity List actions is to stop PRC (Chinese) companies from leveraging U.S. technology to indigenously produce advanced semiconductors,\u201d Matthew S. Axelrod, the assistant secretary for export enforcement, said in a statement. \u201cBy adding key semiconductor fabrication facilities, equipment manufacturers, and investment companies to the Entity List, we are directly impeding the PRC\u2019s military modernization, WMD (weapons of mass destruction) programs, and ability to repress human rights.\u201d",
      "China has accused the U.S. of pursuing \u201ctechnology hegemony,\u201d as Washington steps up pressure on Chinese tech giant Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers of advanced technology by blocking access to American suppliers.",
      "It particularly objects to what it calls \u201clong-arm jurisdiction\u201d moves such as the U.S. decision to extend export controls to companies to apply to chip-making equipment makers in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore if they use any U.S. technology that might be sold to China.",
      "Pressure from Washington has spurred China to step up its efforts to develop its own advanced computer chips and other technologies, providing billions in subsidies and investments for the industry. Chinese manufacturers have made quick progress even though they remain years behind in some areas.",
      "Shares in Japanese computer chip makers and makers of related equipment surged Tuesday, with testing equipment maker Advantest surging 4.6%, Tokyo Electron gaining 4.6% and Applied Materials up 4.9%. Disco Corp., another chipmaker, jumped 6.9%, while the Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index gained 2.3%.",

      "A Stellantis joint venture with Samsung SDI has won a commitment from the U.S. Energy Department for up to a $7.54 billion loan to help build two electric vehicle battery plants in Kokomo, Indiana",
      "DETROIT -- A Stellantis joint venture with Samsung SDI has won a commitment from the U.S. government for up to a $7.54 billion loan to help build two electric vehicle battery plants in Kokomo, Indiana.",
      "The project being built by StarPlus Energy LLC is expected to create at least 2,800 jobs at the plants and hundreds more at a nearby park for parts supply companies, the Energy Department said Monday in a statement.",
      "The loan still must be finalized, but the government said the commitment shows its intent to finance the project. To get the loan, StarPlus must develop a plan to engage with community and labor leaders to create good paying jobs. It also has to meet technical, legal, environmental and financial conditions before the government will fund the loan.",
      "It's unclear whether the loan will be finalized before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to end funding for such projects, which he called the \u201cgreen new scam.\u201d A message was left Monday seeking comment from the Trump transition team.",
      "The Energy Department didn't directly answer a question about whether the loan would be funded before the inauguration, but said it would be irresponsible for \"any government to turn its back on private sector partners, states, and communities that are benefiting from lower energy costs and new economic opportunities\u201d from the loans.",
      "The plants would make battery cells and modules for electric vehicles to be sold in North America, the department said. At full capacity, the plants will produce enough batteries to supply about 670,000 vehicles per year.",
      "\u201cThis will greatly expand EV battery manufacturing capacity in North America and reduce America's reliance on adversarial foreign nations like China,\u201d the statement said.",
      "If finalized, Stellantis would get $6.85 billion in principle plus $688 million in interest for the project.",
      "Late last month electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive got a $6.6 billion loan to build a factory in Georgia that has stalled as the startup has struggled to make a profit.",
      "The loan announcement comes one day after Stellantis confirmed that CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker that owns brands such as Jeep, Ram and Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot. The world\u2019s fourth-largest automaker announced that its board accepted Tavares\u2019 resignation Sunday, effective immediately, amid a continued struggle with slumping sales.",

    "summary": "America&rsquo;s wealthiest have long urged each other to give away more money.",
    "story": [
      "America\u2019s wealthiest have long urged each other to give away more money.",
      "Marie Dageville and her husband Benoit Dageville became billionaires overnight when his data cloud company, Snowflake, went public in September 2020. After that life changing moment, Marie, a former hospice nurse, then set out to learn how to urgently give away that new fortune.",
      "\u201cWe need to redistribute what we have that is too much,\u201d she said in an interview with The Associated Press from her home in Silicon Valley.",
      "While many say giving away a lot of money is hard, that is not Dageville\u2019s perspective. Her advice is to just get started.",
      "America's wealthiest people have urged each other to give away more of their money since at least 1889, the year Andrew Carnegie published an essay entitled, \u201cThe Gospel of Wealth.\" He argued that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "A whole industry of advisers, courses and charitable giving vehicles has grown to help facilitate donations from the wealthy, to some extent prompted by the Giving Pledge, an initiative housed at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2010, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates invited other billionaires to promise to give away half of their fortunes in their lifetimes or in their wills. So far, 244 have signed on.",
      "So, what stands in the way of the wealthiest people giving more and giving faster?",
      "Philanthropy advisers say some answers are structural, like finding the right vehicles and advisers, and some have to do with emotional and psychological factors, like negotiating with family members or wanting to look good in the eyes of their peers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a massive, perfect storm of behavioral barriers,\u201d said Piyush Tantia, chief innovation officer at ideas42, who recently contributed to a report funded by the Gates Foundation looking at what holds the wealthiest donors back.",
      "He points out that unlike everyday donors, who may give in response to an ask from a friend or family member, the wealthiest donors end up deliberating much more about where to give.",
      "\u201cWe might think, \u2018It\u2019s a billionaire. Who cares about a hundred grand? They make that back in the next 15 minutes',\" he said. \"But it doesn\u2019t feel like that.\u201d",
      "His advice is to think about philanthropy as a portfolio, with different risk levels and strategies ideally working in concert. That way it's less about the outcome of any single grant and more about the cumulative impact.",
      "Marie Dageville said she benefited from speaking with other people who had signed the Giving Pledge, especially one person who urged her to make general operating grants, meaning the organization can choose how to spend the funds themselves. She trusts nonprofits close to the communities they serve to know best how to spend the money and said she is not held back by a worry that they will misuse it.",
      "\u201cIf you are in the position where you are at now \u2014 able to redistribute this fortune \u2014 either you took risks or someone took risks on you,\" she said, adding. \u201cSo why can\u2019t you take some risk (in your philanthropy)?\u201d",
      "Dageville also thinks there is too much focus on the wants of the donors, rather than the needs of the recipients.",
      "Private and open conversations between donors also help them move forward, advisers have found. The Center for High Impact Philanthropy at University of Pennsylvania runs an academy that convenes very wealthy donors, their advisers and the heads of foundations to learn together in cohorts.",
      "Kat Rosqueta, the center's executive director, said donors like MacKenzie Scott, the author and now billionaire ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, show it's possible to move quickly.",
      "\u201cDo all the ultra high net worth funders have to go slower than MacKenzie Scott? No,\u201d she said.",
      "But she said, sometimes donors struggle with seeing how to make a difference, given that philanthropic funding is tiny compared to government spending or the business sector.",
      "Cara Bradley, deputy director of philanthropic partnerships at the Gates Foundation, said the scrutiny of billionaire philanthropy also means they feel a huge responsibility to use their funds as best as possible.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve signed a pledge genuinely committed to trying to give away this tremendous amount of wealth. And then, people can get stuck because life gets busy. This is hard. Philanthropy is a real endeavor,\u201d she said.",
      "It is also not easy to conduct empirical research on billionaires, said Deborah Small, a marketing professor at Yale School of Management. But she said, in general, current social norms value anonymity in giving, which is seen as being more virtuous because the donor isn't recognized for their generosity.",
      "\u201cIt would be better for causes, and for philanthropy as a whole, if everybody was open about it because that would create the social norm that this is an expectation in society,\u201d she said.",
      "Jorge P\u00e9rez, founder and CEO of the real estate developer Related Group, along with his wife, Darlene, was early to join the Giving Pledge in 2012. In an interview with The Associated Press, P\u00e9rez said he frequently speaks with his peers about giving more and faster.",
      "\u201cI think people have stopped taking my calls,\u201d he joked.",
      "He also has engaged his adult children in their philanthropy, much of which they conduct through The Miami Foundation. He said they decided to draw on the expertise of the foundation, rather than starting their own organizations, to speed along the evaluation of potential grantees.",
      "Even before the P\u00e9rezes joined the Giving Pledge, they were major supporters of the arts and of scholarships in Miami, where they are based. In 2011, the couple donated their art collection along with cash, together worth $40 million, to the art museum, which was renamed the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami after the gift.",
      "P\u00e9rez said he gives because he thinks very unequal societies are not sustainable and because he wants to leave behind a legacy.",
      "\u201cI keep on selling the idea that you\u2019re giving because of very selfish reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is it makes you feel good. But two, particularly in the city or the state or the country that you\u2019re going to live in, in the long run, this is going to make a huge difference in making our society fairer, better and more progressive and probably lead to greater economic wealth.\u201d",

      "Two company executives, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, will act as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a replacement for Gelsinger, who also stepped down from the company's board.",
      "The departure of Gelsinger, whose career spanned more than 40 years, underscores the turmoil at Intel. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Gelsinger started at Intel in 1979 and was its first chief technology officer. He returned to the company as chief executive in 2021.",
      "Gelsinger said his exit was \u201cbittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.\u201d",
      "Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer at Intel. Holthaus was appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, which includes the client computing, data center and AI groups.",
      "Frank Yeary, independent chair of Intel's board, will become interim executive chair.",
      "\u201cPat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021,\u201d Yeary said in a statement. \"As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.\u201d",
      "Gelsinger's departure comes as Intel\u2019s financial woes have been piling up. The company posted a $16.6 billion loss and halted its dividend in the most recent quarter, and its shares have fallen by about 60% since he took over as CEO. Gelsinger announced plans in August to slash 15% of its huge workforce \u2014 or about 15,000 jobs \u2014 as part of cost-cutting efforts to to save $10 billion in 2025.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s ascendance, meanwhile, was cemented earlier this month when it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",

Under Gelsinger, the company has been working to build up its foundry business making semiconductors in the U.S. designed by other firms, in a bid to compete with rivals such as market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or TSMC.",
      "Intel has benefited from tens of billions of dollars that the administration has pledged to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness.",
      "After taking over as CEO, Gelsinger unveiled plans to build a $20 billion chipmaking facility in central Ohio, and poured billions more into expanding in Europe, where leaders were also worried about dependence on Asia.",

      "Consumers in the United States are scouring the internet for online deals as they look to take advantage of the post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon with Cyber Monday.",
      "Even though e-commerce is now part and parcel of many people's regular routines and the holiday shopping season, Cyber Monday \u2014 a term coined in 2005 by the National Retail Federation \u2014 has become the biggest online shopping day of the year, thanks to the deals and the hype the industry has created to fuel it.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That would make it the season's \u2014 and the year's \u2014 biggest \u2014 shopping day for e-commerce.",
      "Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday night, per Adobe \u2014 reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent every minute.",
      "For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales event right after midnight Pacific time on Saturday. Target's two days of discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday. Walmart rolled out its Cyber Monday offers for Walmart+ members on Sunday afternoon and opened it up to all customers three hours later, at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "Consumer spending for Cyber Week \u2014 the five major shopping days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday \u2014 provides a strong indication of how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays.",
      "Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a healthy pace.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",
      "Many economist have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing to automobiles.",
      "The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5% to 3.5% \u2014 compared to 3.9% in 2023.",
      "A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season won\u2019t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period. But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging signs for retailers.",
      "Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that discounts from Thanksgiving onward have \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d \u2014 and online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40 billion mark combined.",
      "U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2% increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That's also more than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1\u202fbillion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said. And on Saturday and Sunday, shoppers spent another $10.9 billion online, up 5.8% over last year.",
      "Adobe reported Monday that as of 6:30 p.m. ET, shoppers had spent $8.7 billion\u202fon the online shopping holiday. When the final tally is in, Adobe expects consumers will have spent between\u202f$13.2 billion\u202fand\u202f$13.5 billion\u202ffor the day, making Cyber Monday the biggest online shopping day of the year__and of all time, Adobe said.",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double digits, while in-store purchase rose a modest 0.7%.",
      "E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $4.6 million per minute \u2014 with top categories by volume including clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to Adobe. \u201cHot products\u201d included Lego sets, espresso machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care.",
      "Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the comfort of their homes.",
      "RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the Midwest.",
      "Sensormatic Solutions, which also tracks store traffic, said its preliminary analysis showed retail store traffic on Black Friday was down 8.2% compared to 2023.",
      "Grant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic Solutions, noted that in-store traffic was getting spread across multiple days since many retailers offered generous discounts before and after Black Friday.",
      "\u201cSome of the extended Black Friday promotions really ended up leading to a little bit of a softer day-of traffic than expected,\u201d Gustafson said.",
      "While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more \u201cexperience-driven spending\u201d in recent years, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic waned.",
      "Jie Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business, told The Associated Press ahead of the post-Thanksgiving shopping weekend that he expected shoppers to \u201cindulge themselves a bit more\u201d when it comes to \u201cself-gifting,\u201d increasing interest in categories like self care.",
      "Adobe notes that shoppers are also buying higher-ticket items this season \u2014 with consumers opening their wallets to invest or \u201ctrade up\u201d to more premium versions of products like electronics, appliances and sporting goods.",
      "Brie Carere, executive vice president and chief customer officer at FedEx, cited strong shipping volume for Thanksgiving weekend, and CyberMonday has had a good start. She anticipated that FedEx\u2019s shipping volume on the online shopping holiday will be slightly up over the 19 million items shipped a year ago on the holiday.",
      "But she said the truncated season \u2014 there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day \u2014 is making it harder for her retail customers to forecast.",
      "In fact, Carere said only four of FedEx\u2019s top 20 holiday e-commerce customers got their shipping predictions correct for the week before the Thanksgiving weekend. And she also noted that while FedEx predicts low single-digit percentage growth in shipping volume each day, she thinks that many retail customers will see a decline for the overall holiday period because of the truncated season.",
      "\u201cI do think that we\u2019re going to see some retailers be disappointed in their volume numbers,\u201d she said.",
      "Carere also doesn\u2019t anticipate much of a lull in shipping between Thanksgiving weekend and last two weeks before Christmas because of the shorter season.",
      "Jim Katsafanas, president of U.S. Small Business Sales, UPS, agreed, noting last week \u201cwe are going to see a pretty consistent surge of volume right through the end. \u201d",

      "Some companies have integrated models infused with newer generative AI technologies, allowing shoppers to seek advice by asking naturally phrased questions like \u201cWhat's the best wireless speaker?\u201d",
      "Retailers hope consumers use these chatbots, which are typically called shopping assistants - as virtual companions that help them discover or compare products. Prior chatbots were mostly used for task-oriented functions such as helping customers track down online orders or return ones that didn't meet expectations.",
      "Amazon, the king of online retail, has said its customers have been questioning Rufus - the generative AI- powered shopping assistant it launched this year - for information such as whether a specific coffee maker is easy to clean, or what recommendations it has for a lawn game for a child's birthday party.",
      "And Rufus, which is available for holiday shoppers in the U.S. and some other countries, is not the only shopping assistant out there. A select number of Walmart shoppers will have access this year to a similar chatbot the nation's largest retailer is testing in a few product categories, including toys and electronics.",
      "Perplexity AI added something new to the AI chat-shopping world last month by rolling out a feature on its AI-powered search engine that enables users to ask a question like \u201cWhat's the best women's leather boots?\" and then receive specific product results that the San Francisco-based company says are not sponsored.",
      "\u201cIt has been adopted at pretty incredible scale,\u201d Mike Mallazzo, an analyst and writer at retail research media company Future Commerce, said.",
      "Retailers with websites and e-commerce companies started paying more attention to chatbots when use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence text chatbot made by the company OpenAI, went mainstream in late 2022, sparking public and business interest in the generative AI technology that powers the tool.",
      "Victoria\u2019s Secret, IKEA, Instacart and the Canadian retailer Ssense are among other companies experimenting with chatbots, some of which use technology from OpenAI.",
      "Even before the improved chatbots, online retailers were creating product recommendations based on a customer's prior purchases or search history. Amazon was at the forefront of having recommendations on its platform, so Rufus' ability to provide some is not particularly groundbreaking.",
      "But Rajiv Mehta, the vice president of search and conversational shopping at Amazon, said the company is able to offer more helpful recommendations now by programming Rufus to ask clarifying or follow-up questions. Customers are also using Rufus to look for deals, some of which are personalized, Mehta said.",
      "To be sure, chatbots are prone to hallucinations, so Rufus and most of the tools like it can get things wrong.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, wrote in a November blog post that his firm tested Rufus by requesting gaming TV recommendations. The chatbot's response included products that were not TVs. When asked for the least expensive options, Rufus came back with suggestions that weren't the cheapest, Kaziukenas said.",
      "An Associated Press reporter recently asked Rufus to give some gift recommendations for a brother. The chatbot quickly spit out a few ideas for \u201cthoughtful gifts,\" ranging from a T-shirt and a keychain with charms to a bolder suggestion: a multifunctional knife engraved with the phrase \u201cBEST BROTHER EVER.\u201d",
      "After a 5-minute written conversation, Rufus offered more tailored suggestions - a few Barcelona soccer jerseys sold by third-party sellers. But it wasn\u2019t able to say which seller offered the lowest price. When asked during another search for a price comparison on a popular skin serum, Rufus showed the product's pre-discounted price instead of its present one.",
      "\u201cRufus is constantly learning,\u201d Amazon's Mehta said during an interview.",
      "Shop AI, a chatbot that Canadian e-commerce company Shopify launched last year, can also help shoppers discover new products by asking its own questions, such as soliciting details about an intended gift recipient or features the buyer wants to avoid. Shop AI has trouble, however, recommending specific products or identifying the lowest-priced item in a product category.",
      "The limitations show the technology is still in its infancy and has a long way to go before it becomes as useful as the retail industry - and many shoppers - wish it could be.",
      "To truly transform the shopping experience, shopping assistants will \u201cneed to be deeply personalized\u201d and be able - on their own - to remember a customer\u2019s order history, product preferences and purchasing habits, consulting giant McKinsey & Company said in an August report.",
      "Amazon has noted that Rufus' answers are based on information contained in product listings, community Q&As and customer reviews, which would include the fake reviews that are used to boost or diminish sales for products on its marketplace.",
      "The large language model that powers the chatbot was also trained on the company's entire catalog and some public information on the web, Trishul Chilimbi, an Amazon vice president who oversees AI research, wrote in the electrical engineering magazine IEEE Spectrum in October.",
      "But its unclear how Amazon and other companies are weighting different training components - such as reviews - in their recommendations, or how exactly the shopping assistants come up with them, according to Nicole Greene, an analyst at management consulting firm Gartner.",
      "Perplexity AI's new shopping feature allows users to enter search queries such as \u201cbest phone case\" and to receive answers derived from various sources, including Amazon and other retailers, such as Best Buy. Perplexity also invited retailers to share data about their products and said those that do would have an increased chance of having their items recommended to shoppers.",
      "But Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, suggested in a recent interview with Fortune magazine that he didn't know how the new shopping feature recommended products to customers. But in an interview with the AP, Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko pushed back on that characterization, saying Srinivas' comment \u201cwas probably taken out of context.\u201d",
      "The context, he said, is that with generative AI technology \u201cYou can\u2019t know in advance exactly what the output will be just based off of knowing what the inputs\u201d are from the training materials.",
      "Shevelenko said retailers and brands need to know they can't have their products recommended in Perplexity's search engine because they're \u201cjamming key words\u201d into their websites or using different techniques to show up better on search results",
      "\u201cThe way you show up in an answer is by having a better product and better features,\u201d he said."

      "Established nonprofits, everyday individuals and mutual aid groups all want your dollars to make a difference",
      "NEW YORK -- Millions displaced by global conflicts. Communities reeling from unseasonably strong natural disasters. Lives upended due to healthcare inequalities.",
      "In the middle of these crises are established nonprofits, everyday individuals and mutual aid groups \u2014 all seeking your dollars to make a difference. But with no shortage of worthy causes and the rise of new giving technologies, how should you donate?",
      "The choices can be immobilizing for those looking to open up their wallets. Many value conventional charities. But others \u2014 Gen Z and millennials, as well as the unmarried and less religious, according to 2021 research by the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy \u2014 like to crowdfund by pooling donations online for folks in dire circumstances.",
      "The approaches reflect differing assessments of impact and trustworthiness. But they aren't necessarily opposed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really: what is the right type of support that either an organization or a community or an individual needs?\u201d said Bloomerang Chief Customer Officer Todd Baylis, who previously co-founded the platform Qgiv to help nonprofits fundraise online. \"And being able to tailor that to the individual giver.\u201d",
      "Here are some questions worth considering as you determine which assistance best suits your objectives:",
      "It might come down to whether you want to make a big difference for one person or help seed large-scale change.",
      "Tiltify is a technology platform that helps nonprofits and individual crowdfunders alike raise money. If donors want to ensure that food gets to communities recovering from disasters, Tiltify CEO Michael Wasserman says a nonprofit contribution is probably best, as established organizations already have distribution pipelines and built-up expertise.",
      "But if you want to ensure a particular person can take care of themselves, he said, a direct donation to a crowdfunding campaign might make more sense than sending money \u201cthrough a charitable funnel.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt really depends on what your goal is as a donor: if you\u2019re trying to help out somebody specifically or if you\u2019re trying to help out people in plural,\u201d Wasserman said.",
      "You could do both at once, according to one nonprofit that delivers cash transfers. GiveDirectly reports sending more than $860 million to 1.6 million people across three continents. Senior Program Manager Richard Nkurunziza says the idea was initially met with fears of misuse. But GiveDirectly finds that cash donations are a dignified way to empower poor people to invest in their unique needs.",
      "In Rwandan villages, he said, recipients have spent donations on household renovations, new businesses and youth education \u2014 all of which ultimately benefit their entire community.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of agency,\u201d said Nkurunziza. \u201cIt gives an opportunity for the recipient to make a decision on how they use the funds for themselves.\u201d",
      "Crowdfunding could be considered \u201cmore democratic,\u201d according to Claire van Teunenbroek, a University of Twente professor specializing in online giving behavior. That's because donors have more control over their gifts' usage when they choose exactly who benefits.",
      "The disadvantage, she said, is that people with the greatest needs aren't always the ones with the most success. Humans are prone to supporting \u201ceasily sellable\u201d projects with highly emotional appeals. Studies have also shown racial disparities in crowdfunding.",
      "The most popular reason donors told Bloomerang they stopped giving was because they did not trust contributions were being used wisely, according to the company\u2019s Generational Giving Report. The second most common response was that donors no longer felt connected to the nonprofit they\u2019d previously supported.",
      "The answers underscore the need for recipients to actively prove their trustworthiness.",
      "Tax-exempt nonprofits must submit annual financial disclosures to the Internal Revenue Service that include publicly available information, including executives' salaries. Watchdogs, such as Charity Navigator, compile lists of verified nonprofits and assess their work.",
      "Crowdfunding, while convenient, is much more susceptible to fraud. The online sites are relatively unregulated, leaving the responsibility for protection up to donors and the platforms themselves. In GoFundMe's case, donations can be refunded up to one year after they are made. The company also advises that organizers identify themselves and their beneficiaries, and specify their plans for spending contributions.",
      "Online users mistakenly associate high donation numbers with credibility, according to van Teunenbroek. She said risk is better mitigated by making sure the project's description is detailed.",
      "\u201cFor a donor, if you prefer more certainty, then traditional nonprofits are probably better because they have an established reputation,\u201d she said.",
      "ALSAC CEO Rick Shadyac said his charity works hard to make donors feel confident that their money is supporting the mission of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital: improving pediatric cancer survival rates worldwide by covering the costs of care and researching treatments.",
      "Shadyac encouraged people to give regardless of the medium and to always look for reputable causes. Bonafide charities, he said, bring \u201cgreater degrees of confidence\u201d while crowdfunding requires more \u201cdue diligence.\u201d But he sees room for both.",
      "\u201cThey should actually complement each other,\" he said.",
      "\u201cSome of this is more in the realm of micro-philanthropy where they may be wanting to help a specific individual because they found themselves in difficult circumstances,\u201d he added. \"But if you want to help kids with cancer, you want to help cure heart disease, there are charities that are keenly focused on that.\u201d",
      "ALSAC gets nearly one quarter of its annual revenue during the last two months of the calendar, Shadyac said, around the time of year designated as \u201cGiving Season.\u201d The uptick could stem from the spirit of generosity around the holidays, he added. Sure enough, a 2023 study found that people in good moods are more likely to make a charitable donation.",
      "They might also be making their year-end tax plans.",
      "\u201cNot-for-profits give them the opportunity to address some things that are important to them while also getting a tax deduction,\u201d Shadyac said.",
      "Crowdfunding donations to individual campaigns, however, cannot be written off on your taxes. But crowdfunding can make it easier to identify with the ultimate beneficiaries of one's gift, van Teunenbroek said.",
      "Mutual aid refers to reciprocal support networks of neighbors who promptly meet each other's most pressing needs when existing systems fail to make them whole. Because of those reciprocal ties, participants often describe the act as \u201csolidarity, not charity.\u201d",
      "In the internet age, these groups often solicit cash contributions through online payment processors like Venmo, Cash App, PayPal or Zelle. Anyone can scan QR codes, which are usually reposted across social media accounts, to donate. The money goes straight to those impacted or helps purchase supplies for shared resources like community fridges. Transparency might come in the form of a screenshotted receipt shared by organizers on their profile.",
      "Tamara Kneese joined several mutual aid efforts during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic to take care of her neighbors in Oakland. Kneese, a director at the nonprofit research institute Data & Society, said these groups tend to start as immediate responses to crises that are acutely hurting disadvantaged communities. The idea, she added, is that \u201cstate abandonment cannot be addressed by charitable giving alone.\u201d",
      "Kneese said the challenges of such bottom-up, grassroots groups are that resources dwindle and people burn out. Only so many requests can be fulfilled. Organizers' politics clash.",
      "The benefits, she found, are that support comes from within the community and members have direct interactions with those using it.",
      "\u201cIt is not just a sense of charity, like you make a donation and you're done,\" she said. \"There is more of a relationship involved and it is not just transactional.\u201d",

      "DeCaprio is president of Local 54 of the Unite Here union, which opposes a smoking ban on the grounds that so much business would be lost by smokers taking their money elsewhere that it could cause one or more casinos to shut down, costing thousands of workers their jobs.",
      "\u201cShe should be ashamed of herself,\u201d said Ray Jensen, assistant director of United Auto Workers Region 9, which represents dealers at three Atlantic City casinos and is part of a lawsuit seeking to have the courts force an end to smoking in the gambling halls. \u201cShe should hand in her union card.\u201d",
      "DeCaprio said her union supports the health and safety of its members, adding improvements to the workplace environment need to be made.",
      "\u201cA balance needs to be reached that will both protect worker health and preserve good jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are protecting our members against multiple casino closures and job losses. The UAW is eager to sacrifice the entire casino industry and put 25,000 good jobs with benefits at risk.\u201d",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina legislative Republicans moved closer Monday to enacting a measure that would erode the powers of the incoming governor and other Democratic officials, and also placing on the ballot constitutional amendments that could buttress GOP voting and tax policies.",
      "Along party lines, the GOP-dominated state Senate voted successfully to override Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's veto of a bill that in part would weaken Gov.-elect Josh Stein, the next attorney general in Jeff Jackson and other Democrats also elected in November as lieutenant governor and schools superintendent.",
      "Those changes are within a 131-page measure initially approved two weeks ago during a lame-duck session of the General Assembly. Republicans advanced the measure as their current veto-proof majority over Cooper likely will end after this month as Democrats won additional House seats. That will give Stein, who takes office in January, a better chance to use his veto stamp to block successfully bills he opposes.",

He also said provisions altering executive branch powers were unconstitutional. One provision starting in the spring would end the governor's authority to appoint the State Board of Elections and transfer it to the state auditor, who will now be Republican Dave Boliek.",
      "The bill now returns to the House, where last month three Republicans voted against the measure. Such a margin, if left intact, could scuttle the attempted override expected next week. Senate leader Phil Berger said after Monday\u2019s vote he was confident that House Republicans would have the votes to complete the override. Even then, litigation is possible.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature has tried to change the election board\u2019s makeup for several years by passing laws that have been blocked by courts, including one last year that would move board appointment authority from the governor to the General Assembly.",
      "As with the Senate's initial debate on the bill two weeks ago, the chamber gallery was full of bill opponents who call it a Republican power grab after the electorate chose Democrats to top positions in the Nov. 5 elections.",
      "Republicans are \u201cnot listening to the voters in North Carolina,\u201d said demonstrator Della Hann, 64, of Southport. \u201cThere are checks and balances in government and they need to be respected.\u201d",

On Monday, Robinson cleared the gallery again following disruptions after Cooper's veto message was read and right before the vote.",
      "\u201cEverybody's got to go,\u201d Robinson said before calling for a 10-minute recess. To avoid potential arrest, protesters left the Legislative Building or quieted down outside the gallery.",
      "Senate Republicans proceeded later to approve in separate bills proposed amendments to the North Carolina Constitution related to photo voter identification and a cap on income taxes.",
      "Each received 30 votes \u2014 exactly the number needed for a constitutional referendum. To be placed on ballots statewide in November 2026, these measures still would have to be voted on by the House by the end of the year and receive 72 votes. Constitutional amendments aren't subject to vetoes.",
      "One proposed referendum would, if approved by a majority of voters, amend the constitution to say all North Carolina voters must show photo identification before voting. The constitution currently only specifies that it's required for in-person voting. ID exceptions are allowed now and would remain with the amendment. The other referendum would set a rate cap on income taxes at 5%, down from the current 7%.",
      "Individual and corporate income tax rates are currently both below 5% in the state, and state laws separate from the constitution already direct that people voting by mail provide a photocopy of a qualifying identification.",
      "Senate Republicans backing the ID question said it's important to ensure that all forms of voting will be treated equally going forward as it relates to photo ID, which the GOP successfully got approved in 2018 but didn't take effect until last year. And with Republicans approving multiple income tax reductions over the years that have boosted the state economy, Cabarrus County Republican Sen . Paul Newton said, it's time again to let voters decide whether they should remain permanently lower.",

      "Biden's three-day visit to Angola will focus largely on the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance the U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies.",
      "Biden's trip comes weeks before Republican Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20, finally delivering on Biden's pledge to visit sub-Saharan Africa. On his way to Angola, he stopped in the Atlantic Ocean island nation of Cape Verde for a brief, closed-door meeting with Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva.",

He also will travel to the Atlantic port city of Lobito for a look at the rail project. He will announce new developments on health, agribusiness and security, White House officials said.",
      "Biden had been expected to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit in December 2022. The trip was pushed back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among some Africans that their continent is still low priority for Washington.",

      "Many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which won't be complete until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration. Blunting China has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump\u2019s to-do list.",
      "\u201cAs long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it\u2019s going to keep being funded,\u201d said Christian-G\u00e9raud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Kirby said the Biden administration hopes Trump and his team see the value in Lobito but \u201cwe are still in office. We still have 50 days. This is a key major development not just for the United States and our foreign policy goals in Africa, but for Africans.\u201d",
      "The Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola\u2019s port of Lobito, strengthening a route west for Africa\u2019s critical minerals. It also ultimately aims to extend from Zambia and Congo to Africa\u2019s east coast through Tanzania and be a coast-to-coast rail link.",
      "While Biden\u2019s administration called it a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for U.S. investment in Africa, it\u2019s little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, with China dominant in mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, with most heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe rely on.",
      "Michelle Gavin, a former adviser on Africa to Obama, said the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend.",
      "The Lobito Corridor was \u201cnot just about trying to blunt China, but trying to imagine, OK, what does it look like if we actually were to show up in a more serious way?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one project. It\u2019s one good idea. And I\u2019m very glad we\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s not enough.\u201d",
      "Lobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola\u2019s long and strong ties with Beijing.",
      "The Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola\u2019s civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year.",
      "The visit will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America\u2019s value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden\u2019s trip to criticize the Louren\u00e7o government\u2019s authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while laws have been passed that severely restrict freedoms, according to rights groups.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 16:02:29 -0500",
    "summary": "A top Federal Reserve official says he is leaning toward supporting an interest rate cut when the Fed meets in two weeks but that evidence of persistent inflation before then could cause him to change that view",
    "story": [
      "A top Federal Reserve official says he is leaning toward supporting an interest rate cut when the Fed meets in two weeks but that evidence of persistent inflation before then could cause him to change that view",
      "WASHINGTON -- A top Federal Reserve official said Monday that he is leaning toward supporting an interest rate cut when the Fed meets in two weeks but that evidence of persistent inflation before then could cause him to change that view.",
      "Speaking at George Washington University, Christopher Waller, a key member of the Fed's Board of Governors, said he was confident that inflation is headed lower and that the central bank will likely keep reducing its key rate, which affects many consumer and business loans.",
      "But he noted that there's a risk that inflation \u201cmay be getting stuck above\u201d the Fed's 2% target, which would support an argument for keeping the Fed's rate unchanged this month.",
      "\u201cAt present, I lean toward supporting a cut to the policy rate at our December meeting,\" Waller said in his remarks to a conference held by the American Institute for Economic Research. \"But that decision will depend on whether data that we will receive before then surprises to the upside and alters my forecast for the path of inflation.\u201d",
      "Waller's caution reflects a notable shift in the economic and inflation outlook in the past month or so. Growth in consumer spending and the broader economy was robust in the July-September quarter. In addition, inflation picked up in October after having slowed for most of this year.",
      "And Donald Trump's election victory has raised the prospect of widespread tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, both of which could elevate inflation. Some economists say they think the Fed might decide to cut its rate more slowly to allow time to evaluate the effects of Trump's policies.",
      "With inflation having steadily fallen from its peak in 2022, the Fed reduced its key rate by a half-point in September and by a quarter-point in November. And it signaled in September that it expected to announce another quarter-point cut later this month. Yet inflation has remained above the Fed's target level, clouding the Fed's next step.",
      "In October, \u201ccore\u201d inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, accelerated a bit. It rose 2.8% compared with a year earlier, up from 2.7% in September.",
      "Waller stressed that if future economic reports showed inflation or growth deviating from the Fed's expected paths, he could favor keeping rates unchanged this month.",
      "\u201cIf the data we receive between today and the next meeting surprise in a way that suggests our forecasts of slowing inflation and a moderating but still-solid economy are wrong, then I will be supportive of holding the policy rate constant,\u201d he said.",
      "Even so, Waller said the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate is high enough to restrict economic growth and inflation and so a quarter-point rate cut wouldn't involve much risk of reigniting inflation.",
      "\u201cCutting again will only mean that we aren\u2019t pressing on the brake pedal quite as hard,\u201d he said.",
      "In his speech, Waller acknowledged some frustration over the recent persistence of inflation.",
      "\u201cI feel like an MMA fighter who keeps getting inflation in a choke hold, waiting for it to tap out, yet it keeps slipping out of my grasp at the last minute,\u201d he said. \"But let me assure you that submission is inevitable \u2014 inflation isn\u2019t getting out of the octagon.\u201d",
      "In recent remarks, other Fed officials have also suggested that they haven\u2019t yet made a final decision on whether to support a rate cut this month.",
      "Earlier Monday, Raphael Bostic, president of the Fed\u2019s Atlanta branch, said he was \u201ckeeping my options open\u201d when asked whether he favored a rate cut in two weeks."

      "HONG KONG -- Thousands of giant panda sculptures will greet residents and tourists starting Saturday in Hong Kong, where enthusiasm for the bears has grown since two cubs were born in a local theme park.",
      "The 2,500 exhibits were showcased in a launch ceremony of PANDA GO! FEST HK, the city's largest panda-themed exhibition, at Hong Kong's airport on Monday. They will be publicly displayed at the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui, a popular shopping district, this weekend before setting their footprint at three other locations this month.",
      "One designated spot is Ocean Park, home to the twin cubs, their parents and two other pandas gifted by Beijing this year. The design of six of the sculptures, made of recycled rubber barrels and resins among other materials, was inspired by these bears.",
      "The cubs \u2014 whose birth in August made their mother Ying Ying the world\u2019s oldest first-time panda mom \u2014 may meet visitors as early as February.",
      "In a separate media preview event on Monday, the new pair of Beijing-gifted pandas, An An and Ke Ke, who arrived in September, appeared relaxed in their new home at Ocean Park. An An enjoyed eating bamboo in front of the cameras and Ke Ke climbed on an installation. They are set to meet the public on Sunday.",
      "The displays reflect Hong Kong\u2019s use of pandas to boost its economy as the Chinese financial hub works to regain its position as one of Asia\u2019s top tourism destinations.",
      "Pandas are considered China\u2019s unofficial national mascot. The country\u2019s giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing\u2019s soft-power diplomacy.",
      "Hong Kong's tourism industry representatives are upbeat about the potential impact of housing six pandas, hoping to boost visitor numbers even though caring for pandas in captivity is expensive. Officials have encouraged businesses to capitalize on the popularity of the bears to seize opportunities in what some lawmakers have dubbed the \u201cpanda economy.\"",
      "The organizer of the exhibitions also invited some renowned figures, including musician Pharrell Williams, to create special-edition panda designs. Most of these special sculptures will be auctioned online for charity and the proceeds will be donated to Ocean Park to support giant panda conversation efforts.",
      "Ying Ying and the twin cubs' father, Le Le, are the second pair of pandas gifted by Beijing to Hong Kong since the former British colony returned to China\u2019s rule in 1997.",
      "The first pair were An An and Jia Jia who arrived in 1999. Jia Jia, who died at 38 in 2016, is the world\u2019s oldest-ever panda to have lived in captivity.",
      "The average lifespan for a panda in the wild is 14 to 20 years, while in captivity it\u2019s up to 30 years, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature."

      "Closing arguments have begun in the trial of a tech consultant in the stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco last year",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Closing arguments began on Monday in the trial of a tech consultant in the 2023 stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco, an event that shocked the broader tech community whose members mourned the loss of an entrepreneur they called charismatic and kind.",
      "San Francisco prosecutors say Nima Momeni stabbed Lee three times after hearing that Lee's drug dealer friend plied Momeni's younger sister with GHB and other drugs and sexually assaulted her.",
      "\u201cOne person called 911 pleading for help, saying somebody stabbed me,\u201d said Dane Reinstedt, assistant district attorney, adding that the other person never called police or told anyone what happened that night until the trial.",
      "Defense attorneys will make their closing arguments Tuesday in a trial that started Oct. 14. Prosecutors will then have a chance to respond to the defense\u2019s closing.",
      "Defense attorneys say Lee, 43, was on a multi-day drug bender of cocaine and ketamine that made him agitated and violent, and that he attacked the defendant with a knife. They said Momeni was forced to use his Krav Maga martial arts skills in the early morning hours of April 4, 2023, after making a \u201c bad joke \u2033 that upset Lee \u2014 and did not realize he had stabbed him.",
      "Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted of murder. He has pleaded not guilty in a case so high profile that San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins stepped into the room Monday for part of the closing.",
      "The trial has been emotionally taxing for family members of both men. Mahnaz Tayarani, mother of the defendant, has sat on one side of the court room while Lee\u2019s father, brother and ex-wife sat on the other.",
      "The prosecution on Monday started its closing argument with a 911 call in which Lee could be heard asking repeatedly for help. Lee's ex-wife, Krista Lee, cradled her daughter Scout as the 16-year-old wept on her mother's shoulder. They left the room. The Lees have two children.",
      "Reinstedt on Monday mocked Momeni\u2019s defense as he walked jurors through weeks of evidence.",
      "He said Momeni was furious with Lee for introducing Khazar Momeni, with whom he was friends, to a drug dealer who gave her GHB, known as a date-rape drug, hours before the stabbing. They say Momeni grilled Lee earlier in the evening about what happened to his sister at the drug dealer\u2019s apartment and sent text messages saying that the two men were creeps and sexual predators.",
      "Then, Momeni met up with Lee at his sister\u2019s condo, took a paring knife from her kitchen set, drove Lee to a secluded area by the Bay Bridge and stabbed him three times, Reinstedt said.",
      "\u201cThat protectiveness of the defendant\u2019s little sister is what led to all of this,\u201d Reinstedt said.",
      "Surveillance video shows the two men leaving the posh condo of Khazar Momeni around 2 a.m. and getting into Momeni\u2019s BMW. Other surveillance then shows them getting out of the car in an isolated section of the city by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Momeni testified he stopped his car after going over a pothole that caused Lee to spill the beer he was holding. Momeni said he then cracked a joke suggesting Lee should spend his last night visiting the city with family instead of trying to find a strip club to keep the party going.",
      "That\u2019s when Lee suddenly pulled a knife out of his jacket pocket, Momeni said. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "\u201cI was scared for my life,\u201d Momeni said in earlier testimony that was at times rambling and contentious.",
      "Reinstedt said Momeni's story made no sense given Lee's peaceful nature. He said Momeni never called police to report Lee's alleged attack or even after he learned Lee had died of stab wounds on the street where he had last seen him.",
      "The prosecutor said the puncture wounds were clean, clear and deep, and not the result of any kind of self-defense tussle, he said. Just about all of the DNA \u2014 99% \u2014 found on the handle of the knife belonged to Momeni, the prosecutor said.",
      "Video of the two men by the bridge is grainy, but Reinstedt said it clearly showed Momeni's figure lunging repeatedly at Lee. There was no deflecting and redirecting of any knife in Lee's hand, he said.",
      "Reinstedt also showed video of Momeni and Lee leaving the condo, Lee's jacket flapping to show there was no knife hidden inside.",
      "Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m., dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to his generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died."

      "Rocky Balboa fans are ready to go the distance to honor Philly\u2019s favorite fictional fighter almost 50 years after the first movie launched the enduring series of an underdog boxer persevering despite the odds",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Rocky Balboa fans are ready to go the distance \u2014 by bus, by ice skates, by 72 steps \u2014 to honor Philly\u2019s favorite fictional fighter almost 50 years after the first movie launched the enduring series of an underdog boxer persevering despite the odds.",
      "Yo, Adrian, Philly finally did it!",
      "The city Rocky called home at last has a week dedicated to the box office heavyweight champion of the world a year after the inaugural Rocky Day was held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art steps.",
      "It\u2019s Rocky, so of course there\u2019s a sequel.",
      "This year, it\u2019s RockyFest.",
      "The Rocky Bus Tour served as Round 1 over the weekend before the festival truly laced up its gloves for Tuesday\u2019s kickoff event \u2014 on Dec. 3, the 1976 release date of \u201cRocky\u201d \u2014 with area elementary school students running the Rocky steps.",
      "From there, Rocky is feted with a mural unveiling, movie marathons, RockyU discussions on the enduring appeal of Sylvester Stallone\u2019s most famous character, look-alike contests and even a bus tour. The tour weaves Rocky fanatics through the city and includes stops at Adrian and Paulie\u2019s fictional graves (not far from the real one for former Phillies announcer Harry Kalas), the Italian Market where Rocky trained, and the exterior site of Mighty Mick\u2019s Gym.",
      "\u201cIf no one has seen the movie,\u201d tour guide Adam Clements said before a recent trip, \u201cthere will be spoilers.\u201d",
      "Rocky fans can even recreate Rocky and Adrian\u2019s first date at a local ice rink.",
      "It seems almost as improbable as Rocky Balboa lasting 15 rounds with champion Apollo Creed that it took so long for Philadelphia to properly honor \u201cRocky\u201d and the other eight movies in the series (including three \u201cCreed\u201d films).",
      "Whether natives like it or not, Rocky is as much a part of the fabric of the city as the Founding Fathers and the Liberty Bell.",
      "Before most fans chug their first raw eggs of the day, the Rocky statue at the base of the museum steps already boasts a line that often snakes around the corner for most of the day. Movie clips are played ad nauseam \u2014 usually Adrian imploring Rocky to win \u2014 on the big screen at sporting events. The strains of \u201cGonna Fly Now\u201d stir ahead of kickoff for all Eagles games. Rocky\u2019s faithful followers run a 50-kilometer race each year that follows his trumped-up training route in a grueling tribute to their mythical champ.",
      "There\u2019s even a merchandise stand at the steps that sells \u201cItalian Stallion\u201d robes and plush Clubber Lang dolls a short run from where Paul C\u00e9zanne and Claude Monet\u2019s works hang in the museum.",
      "Choose your favorite canvas, there\u2019s a little something for everyone.",
      "While Stallone and \u201cCreed\u201d star Michael B. Jordan have made previous promotional stops at the Rocky steps, no actors were expected to attend this year's events.",
      "The 78-year-old Stallone did appear last year at a rain-soaked Rocky Day and credited the city for the character's success as much as anything the weathered fighter achieved on the big screen.",
      "\u201cI've been around the world,\u201d Stallone said. \u201cBut for some reason, these 72 steps inspire me, excite me. It's like you get to the top, you feel inspired, you feel special, hopeful, happy. Most of all, proud of yourself. To all of you, who, believe it or not are real-life Rockys, because you live your life on your own terms, you try and do the best you can and you just keep punching.\u201d",
      "The 1976 film won a best picture Oscar and in 2020 finished tied for No. 2 in The AP Top 25 favorite sports movies poll.",
      "The Philadelphia Visitors Center hatched RockyFest \u2014 which runs through Dec. 8 \u2014 in part for an overdue appreciation of the series as well as connecting locals and tourists to movie sites beyond the bronze statue.",
      "\u201cFor years, there were tourists coming every single day to get their photo at the Rocky statue and there was nothing here officially to greet them,\" said Maita Soukup, of the Philadelphia Visitor's Center. \u201dThere were no maps, no signage, no sort of visitor services infrastructure here at the Rocky statue and steps, even though it was such a big tourist attraction. That's why we wanted to open a visitor's center here. In the process of the city pursing that, Sly Stallone reached out to us and was like, let's do this in partnership.\u201d",
      "Just like Rocky, if the first festival is successful, expect II and III and IV and more.",

    "story": [
      "Florida State has hired Tony White to be its defensive coordinator after he developed consecutive top-20 defenses at Nebraska",
      "Florida State hired Tony White to be its defensive coordinator Monday, poaching him from Nebraska after the Cornhuskers posted top-20 defenses in consecutive years, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press.",
      "The person spoke on condition of anonymity because neither the Seminoles nor the Huskers have confirmed White's move, which is pending a state background check. ESPN reported that White is signing a three-year contract.",
      "White replaces Adam Fuller, who was fired last month following a 52-3 loss at Notre Dame.",
      "FSU coach Mike Norvell is moving quickly to fill staff vacancies in hopes of salvaging a recruiting class that has crumpled in recent weeks. National Signing Day is Wednesday, with the transfer portal opening next week.",
      "Norvell formally announced former Arkansas State, Auburn and Central Florida coach Gus Malzahn as his next offensive coordinator.",
      "Malzahn spent the last four seasons at UCF, where his team ranked in the top 10 in rushing and in the top 20 in total offense each of the last three years. He resigned Saturday following a second consecutive losing campaign in Orlando.",
      "\u201cHe has one of the most innovative minds in college football and a proven track record of developing elite offenses everywhere he\u2019s been,\u201d Norvell said in a statement. \"His offenses have consistently showcased a tremendous running game combined with explosive plays through the air. I\u2019m thrilled to work side-by-side with Gus again as we elevate the Florida State offense back to one of the elite groups in college football.\u201d",
      "Malzahn finished with a 28-24 mark at UCF. He coached at Auburn for eight seasons before being fired in 2020.",
      "Malzahn replaces offensive coordinator/offensive line coach Alex Atkins, who also was fired following the loss at Notre Dame. The Seminoles (2-10) rank 132nd in total offense and 131st in scoring offense (both out of 134 teams). They averaged 15.4 points a game, a considerable drop-off for a program that finished 13-1 last season and won the Atlantic Coast Conference.",
      "\u201cI am excited to be here at Florida State and to help us win championships,\u201d Malzahn said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to work with Coach Norvell, who is someone I believe in as a coach and leader.\u201d",
      "While Malzahn is leaving behind a head coaching job, White appears on track to become one someday.",
      "Nebraska coach Matt Rhule hired White away from Syracuse two years ago, and his work in his short time with the Huskers put him in the mix for head coaching jobs with the Orange, San Diego State and UCLA. He also interviewed for the defensive coordinator\u2019s job at Southern California, which earned him a raise to $1.6 million at Nebraska for this year.",
      "White, 45, brought a 3-3-5 base defense to Nebraska and went from 100th in total defense in 2022 to 11th last season, and their points-per-game average dropped from 27.6 to 18.3. Though Nebraska finished this regular season 6-6, the Huskers continued to have a top-20 defense and flourished with defensive end Ty Robinson and linebackers Isaac Gifford and John Butler.",

McCaffrey will be placed on injured reserve for the second time this season after previously missing the first eight games with Achilles tendinitis.",
      "\u201cI just feel for him,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cIt was a real frustrating year for him. He worked his ass off to get back to this point and I think he was really feeling good and about to take off and just had that real unfortunate injury last night. I know he\u2019s as crushed as anyone, but he\u2019ll get through this. He\u2019s a hell of a player, a hell of a person and an unbelievable 49er. He\u2019ll be back stronger than ever next year to help us.\u201d",

      "It has been a frustrating season for McCaffrey, who won the 2023 AP Offensive Player of the Year then signed a lucrative contract extension in the offseason.",
      "McCaffrey injured his Achilles tendon early in training camp and missed the first eight games of the season. He rushed for just 149 yards on 43 carries in his first three games back as he struggled to get back to form.",
      "He looked much better early Sunday night with seven carries for 53 yards, including a 19-yarder that was his longest of the season. He appeared to hurt his knee on an 18-yard run in the second quarter. He then went down immediately on his next carry on a sweep to the left on a snow-slicked field for a 5-yard loss.",
      "Mason had played well as McCaffrey's replacement, rushing for 789 yards and averaging 5.2 yards per carry this season.",
      "San Francisco will now turn to rookie Isaac Guerendo and promote Patrick Taylor from the practice squad. Shanahan said the team will also look to add another running back to the mix.",
      "In other injury news from the game, defensive lineman Kevin Givens tore his pectoral muscle and will be out for the rest of the season.",
      "Shanahan said cornerback Deommodore Lenoir should be back at practice Wednesday after missing the game with a knee injury and that stars Nick Bosa (hip, oblique) and Trent Williams (ankle) will be evaluated as the week goes on.",
      "Bosa and Williams have both missed the last two games. Williams has also been dealing with family tragedy as his wife announced on Instagram that she gave birth to stillborn Trenton O\u2019Brien Williams Jr. on Nov. 24. Sondra Williams also wrote that she was initially pregnant with twins and lost the other child earlier in the pregnancy.",
      "Shanahan said Williams spent time with his family last week but is trying to get back to play.",
      "\u201cHe was there at the hospital with her and got to meet him and say bye,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cThen he had to cremate him on Friday. So he\u2019s been dealing with that and he\u2019s working through it. We\u2019re all just trying to be there for him through it all.\u201d",
      "NOTES: OL Aaron Banks and DT Jordan Elliott remain in the concussion protocol. ... LB Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles (knee) is day to day. ... LB Dre Greenlaw will get more work this week after his practice window was opened last week for the first time since he tore his Achilles in the Super Bowl. ...

      "The Fighting Irish will find out next Sunday if they'll play at home in the first round of the College Football Playoff. They all but clinched an at-large spot with their win at Southern California on Saturday and, combined with Ohio State's loss, strengthened their position to be a host team Dec. 20 or 21.",
      "Their 49-35 win at USC, made possible by 99- and 100-yard interception returns for touchdowns late in the game, helped the Irish move up to No. 4 in The Associated Press college football poll Sunday. It's their highest ranking in four years. They were No. 5 in last week's CFP rankings and, after Ohio State's 13-10 loss to Michigan, should move up a spot when the new rankings come out Tuesday night.",
      "Coach Marcus Freeman and his players like to use their 16-14 loss to Northern Illinois as the starting point for measuring their progress.",
      "\u201cTo see where we were 84 days ago to where we are now, it's a testament to the trust and the decisions that those guys in that locker room and the coaching staff and everybody that helps have made,\" Freeman said. \"This is what it's all about, man. It's a journey, and you can't let the highest of highs and lowest of lows deter you from what you need to do to reach your goals.\u201d",
      "Since that dumbfounding September day they\u2019ve won 10 straight games, tied with Boise State for second-longest streak in the Football Bowl Subdivision. No. 1 Oregon has won 13 in a row.",
      "Turnover margin, besides wins, is one of the ways Notre Dame tracks progress. Leonard threw two interceptions against NIU and the Huskies converted both into field goals, including the game-winner in the final minute.",
      "Leonard has been picked off just three times in the last 10 games, and Notre Dame is second in the nation in turnover margin at plus-1.33 per game. The Irish also are one of the highest-scoring teams in the nation, at just under 40 points per game, and have a top-10 defense.",
      "\u201cSometimes you've got to lose to gain and make a big jump,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cI told our players Monday after that (NIU) game that this will be the greatest thing that ever happened to this football team if we learn from it and continue to use it. It's hard to say that. The greatest thing that happened to this program this season was a loss, because it taught us what it takes to have success.\u201d",
      "Checking in on five of the Top 25:",
      "Things have changed in a month's time for the Nittany Lions. At No. 3, they're back in the same spot as they were when they lost 20-13 to Ohio State at home. This week, they're headed to Indianapolis to play No. 1 Oregon in the Big Ten championship game for a top four seed in the CFP. The Buckeyes, meanwhile, are No. 7 after falling five spots in the rankings and waiting to find out their playoff fate. Since the loss, Penn State has won four straight and outscored opponents by an average of 39-12.",
      "Winning takes care of everything, so the fact Alabama committed four turnovers in its 28-14 Iron Bowl win over Auburn was only a minor inconvenience \u2014 this time. But QB Jalen Milroe has committed six turnovers over the last two games, and only eight players in the country have more than Milroe's 14 for the season, according to Sportradar.",
      "The Gamecocks could make a compelling case for a playoff spot. They've won six games in a row since starting 3-3 for their longest streak in 11 years. Their 17-14 win over No. 18 Clemson was their school-record fourth of the season against a ranked opponent, and it gave them four road wins for the first time since 2006. Redshirt freshman QB LaNorris Sellers is a rising star. He ran for a career-high 166 yards and two TDs and threw for 164 against the Tigers.",
      "The Rebels' hopes of earning the Group of Five playoff spot have been revived thanks to Tulane losing to Memphis. UNLV has won four straight since its 29-24 home loss to Boise State, and the Rebels get a rematch in Friday's Mountain West title game. UNLV was the third-highest G5 team in last week's CFP rankings, behind Boise State and Tulane. The Rebels likely will be the second-highest G5 team this week, meaning they can punch their ticket with a win on the blue turf.",
      "The strides the Orange have made under first-year coach Fran Brown have been overshadowed by turnarounds orchestrated by Curt Cignetti at Indiana and by Kenny Dillingham at Arizona State. Brown snagged Ohio State transfer Kyle McCord out of the portal and the two have led the Orange to their first nine-win season since 2018 and second since 2002. Their 42-38 win over Miami was their first against a top-10 team since 2017 and propelled them into the Top 25.",
      "Oregon has been No. 1 seven straight weeks and the unanimous choice for the fifth straight week. ... At four straight weeks, Notre Dame and South Carolina have the longest active streaks of rising in consecutive AP polls. ... Memphis secured back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time with its 34-24 win over Tulane. That allowed the Tigers to crack the Top 25 for the first time since 2020. ... This week marks the first time since Oct. 16, 2022, that the state of Louisiana has had no team in the Top 25. Tulane dropped out Sunday. LSU fell out Nov. 17.",

      "Chastened. Relieved. Defiant. The Manchester City manager displayed a whole range of emotions after his latest ordeal at Anfield that plunged the out-of-sorts English champions to an unlikely low.",
      "Make that seven matches without a win for a team which, not so long ago, never lost.",
      "That\u2019s all in the past for Guardiola, though.",
      "\u201cReset,\u201d he said after a 2-0 loss to Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling we start from here this season.\u201d",
      "How he intends to move on from the worst run of results in his managerial career remains to be seen. But it all starts Wednesday with a home game against Nottingham Forest.",
      "\u201cWe are not used to this,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cMany, many things are happening. The teams are good and we can\u2019t handle it right now. I have to find the solution to be stable and solid.",
      "\u201cThese players gave me a chance to lead maybe the best years of my life. All I can do is find a solution \u2014 in the right moment, the club will make the decision what is needed for this club to continue to be there.\u201d",
      "Was he referring to making signings in the January transfer window? City\u2019s fatigued and injury-ravaged squad sure needs some, especially in midfield.",
      "Or was he referring to his own future? It\u2019s not the first time in recent days that Guardiola brought up how fragile his position could quickly become if City keeps on losing.",
      "Moments before walking down the tunnel after the final whistle at Anfield, Guardiola held up one outstretched hand and an extra finger as a retort to taunts by Liverpool fans. It was a nod to the six Premier League titles he has won in eight full seasons at City.",
      "No. 7 doesn\u2019t look likely this season. Not with City already 11 points behind Liverpool.",
      "\u201cCall me delusional or something like that,\u201d Guardiola said, \u201cbut I have the feeling we will try to build back our confidence to win games.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Guardiola said he was taking some belief from recent training sessions. From the return to fitness of some players, such as Ruben Dias, Nathan Ake, Jack Grealish and Jeremy Doku. Maybe from a second-half display against Liverpool that, while hardly vintage City, at least showed some spirit and resolve, even if Liverpool appeared happy to play on the break and never looked troubled.",
      "It felt like Guardiola was relieved to come away from Anfield with the damage limited and City\u2019s hardest fixture of the season out of the way.",
      "Yet his comments will sound so hollow if City goes on to lose to \u2014 or even draw with \u2014 sixth-place Forest, which is only one point and one spot further back and has a manager in Nuno Espirito Santo who has enjoyed some surprise results at City with former club Wolverhampton. Forest also is the only team to beat Liverpool in 20 games this season.",
      "\u201cLet's not forget they are the champions,\u201d Espirito Santo said of City, \u201cthe team that won so many (titles) with so many quality players. It's going to be very tough.",
      "\u201cWe'll take what other opponents did right (against City) so we can do it again.\u201d",
      "Guardiola's masterplan might include a change of role for Grealish, who could yet play more centrally as a No. 10 rather than as a winger. Or a first start since September for Kevin De Bruyne, who has had to settle for cameo roles off the bench as he struggles to fully overcome a groin injury.",
      "Getting some energy into his midfield will be important as the absence of Rodri and Mateo Kovacic continues to bite hard and be City's biggest issue. That might come in the form of a new signing next month, unless Guardiola is working on a new plan on the training ground.",
      "A midweek victory for City, coupled with setbacks for Liverpool at Newcastle and Arsenal at home to Manchester United elsewhere Wednesday, could yet rekindle some belief that all is not lost this season.",
      "On current form, this is unlikely.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s almost a mini-crisis at Manchester City,\" said Jamie Carragher, a pundit for British broadcaster Sky Sports. \"I think City might have a fight on their hands for top four.\u201d",

      "The Rouge Direct group posted a footage on social networks showing Marseille supporters shouting threatening and insulting chants aimed at Monaco. The discriminatory chants at the Stade Velodrome are just the latest of in a long series of similar incidents as French soccer authorities struggle to tackle the issue.",

      "Following a match at the Parc des Princes years ago between PSG and Marseille during which home fans used homophobic insults, the league launched an action plan allowing spectators to report sexist, homophobic or racist incidents they witness. The abuse has not stopped, though, even intensifying in recent months.",
      "French clubs have been sanctioned with fines, and the league\u2019s disciplinary commission also ordered the closure of stands for similar cases in recent years. Also, French law provides for up to one year imprisonment and a 45,000 euros ($47,600) fine when anti-gay insults are made in public.",
      "Last season, some PSG players received a one-match suspended sentence by the league disciplinary committee for offensive chants aimed at Marseille after a home league match. Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Achraf Hakimi, Randal Kolo Muani and Layvin Kurzawa were filmed using insults while celebrating at the end of a 4-0 win against Marseille. The four players issued apologies. That match was also marred by homophobic chanting by sections of PSG fans targeting Marseille players.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 13:46:24 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Michael Andretti has been sidelined from his namesake motorsports organization and won\u2019t have any role with the Formula 1 program he spent the last four years desperately trying to launch",
      "Only the coldest of hearts won't empathize with Michael Andretti, who has been sidelined from his namesake motorsports organization and won't have any role with the the Formula 1 program he spent the last four years desperately trying to launch.",
      "His effort to get a program partnered with General Motors into F1 was approved last week, roughly a month after Andretti stepped aside from leading his race teams. F1's decision to expand its grid for Cadillac F1 came amidst a federal antitrust investigation into why Liberty Media refused to admit Andretti Global as an 11th team \u2014 and after Andretti partners Dan Towriss and Mark Walter took controlling interest of the effort.",
      "\u201cThe Cadillac F1 Team is made up of a strong group of people that have worked tirelessly to build an American works team,\u201d Andretti posted on social media. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the hard work they have put in and congratulate all involved on this momentous next step. I will be cheering for you!\u201d",
      "While he will have no role with the F1 team, it is unclear what his regular involvement will be with his IndyCar team. His famous father, 1978 F1 champion Mario Andretti, will be on the board of the F1 team and an ambassador.",
      "What changed F1's position on Andretti \u2014 an application it basically mocked in its January denial \u2014 is not known. Few have said much beyond noting GM's increased commitment to take a larger role beyond engine supplier.",
      "Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the president of F1's governing body, had championed the GM bid from the start and Andretti's application was the only one of seven to receive approval from the FIA. In an interview with The Associated Press, he called F1's decision to finally allow the GM team a spot in the sport \u201ca win for all of motorsports\u201d but also sympathized with Michael Andretti.",
      "\u201cI feel he should be proud because he's the founder who started this thing with his partners,\u201d Ben Sulayem said. \"We did the proper due process, we never favored anyone, and it is only because his application ticked all the boxes that the FIA approved it. Michael is a lovely person and I do not feel this was personal against Michael Andretti.",
      "\u201cThe other teams? For them, it was about the money. They don't want the money to go from split between 10 teams to split between 11 teams,\" he added. \"But it was only a matter of time before General Motors was going to be approved and I feel it is incorrect to say it happened because Michael stepped aside. What did Michael do? Why would people not want him? Because he spoke publicly? He didn't break any rules. He didn't abuse anyone. If people want to see it as personal, it is up to them. He doesn't annoy me.\"",
      "What likely did annoy F1 and Liberty Media, its commercial rights holder, was the Justice Department investigation. Liberty announced it was under investigation this summer, not long after Mario Andretti visited Washington to discuss the F1 snub with lawmakers.",
      "The FBI was allegedly at last month's Las Vegas Grand Prix and Ben Sulayem confirmed to AP he was interviewed by federal investigators.",
      "\u201cIt is the department that protects the interest of the United States and the FIA has nothing to hide,\u201d Ben Sulayem said. \u201cI was proud to speak to them and they were very polite and understanding. I wanted this to be cleared: I wanted GM in F1 because it is good for business.\u201d",
      "F1 currently has just one American team, owned by California businessman Gene Haas, despite a series-high three races in the United States. Should the Cadillac F1 team make it to the grid in 2026 as scheduled, there will be two American teams and Ford will officially join Red Bull that season as a technical partner.",
      "This Andretti-less F1 effort will be led by TWG Global, the investment company founded by Walter, who as CEO of Guggenheim Partners is the controlling owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Premier League club Chelsea, and Towriss, who became involved in motorsports initially as a sponsor for Andretti and took an ownership role in Andretti Global in 2022.",
      "Towriss is now the majority owner of the Andretti race teams and work on the F1 team will continue in Andretti's Indiana shop, its recently opened satellite factory in Silverstone and GM\u2019s facilities in North Carolina and Michigan. Towriss is the CEO of TWG Global\u2019s motorsports arm.",
      "There is no indication who the drivers will be for the F1 team, although Valtteri Bottas indicated last weekend he'd like to be considered and the original Andretti effort targeted current IndyCar driver Colton Herta, who is sponsored by Towriss' company, Gainbridge.",

      "Matthew Stafford passed for two fourth-quarter touchdowns, Kyren Williams rushed for 104 yards and a score, and the Los Angeles Rams beat New Orleans 21-14 to hand interim Saints coach Darren Rizzi his first loss",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Kryen Williams and the Los Angeles Rams strode to the locker room at halftime confident that the zero they had on the scoreboard was no indication of how the final 30 minutes would go.",
      "\u201cWe knew the second half was going to be ours,\u201d said Williams, who rushed for a season-high 104 yards, including a 4-yard touchdown, in the Rams' 21-14 victory over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt felt great. It felt like I was me, myself and I when I was out there playing like that,\" Williams said. \"I was playing instinctive football and had great energy.\u201d",
      "Matthew Stafford passed for two fourth-quarter touchdowns as the Rams (6-6) stayed close in the NFC West race and handed interim Saints coach Darren Rizzi his first loss.",
      "\u201cAll we could do is get one win this week, and we were able to,\u201d Rams coach Sean McVay said. \u201cThere was improvement for our team collectively, and that\u2019s what I want to continue to see.\u201d",
      "The Saints (4-8) drove inside the Rams 10-yard line in the final minutes, but Derek Carr\u2019s pass on fourth-and-3 was deflected from behind by edge rusher Jared Verse and fell incomplete.",
      "\u201cI realized the tight end was staying on me,\u201d Verse said, referring to the Saints' Foster Moreau. \u201cThe No. 1 rule on the edge is you can\u2019t be blocked by the tight end \u2014 you just can\u2019t. I just walked him back and was able to peel off and affect the throw.\u201d",
      "That allowed the Rams to run out the clock on the Saints and Rizzi, who had won his first two games since taking over after the firing of Dennis Allen.",
      "\u201cWe did a lot of things in the game that we set out to do and played the game in a lot of ways that we wanted to, but we didn\u2019t execute in crunch time,\" Rizzi said. \u201cWe had a chance to win there. We had a guy open in the end zone and we can\u2019t get the ball off. So, unfortunate.\u201d",
      "Stafford passed for 183 yards without a turnover. His scoring passes went for 3 yards to Demarcus Robinson and 7 yards to Puca Nacua, the latter putting the Rams up for good with 8:54 left.",
      "\u201cThe first half was definitely frustrating, but we knew at the same time, every time we were handing it off we were getting good yards,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cYou have to keep playing. Football is a game of ebbs and flows.\"",
      "Versatile New Orleans tight end Taysom Hill, who powered the Saints to their previous victory with one of the best games of his career, injured his left knee and was carted off the field after converting a fourth-and-short run late in the fourth quarter.",
      "The 34-year-old Hill, a fan favorite, waved from the cart as the Superdome crowd chanted his name. Rizzi did not provide an update on Hill after the game, saying he still needed to have imaging done before the full extent of his injury was understood.",
      "The Saints narrowly outgained the Rams and possessed the ball for more time, but struggled to get in the end zone. New Orleans settled for three field-goal attempts in the first half, with Blake Grupe hitting two from 54 yards but missing one from 36.",
      "That was enough to give New Orleans a 6-0 halftime lead before Williams' 10th TD of the season put the Rams up 7-6.",
      "\u201cKyren\u2019s energy was outstanding,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe was excellent in being really decisive. He was putting his foot in the ground, leveling off well and doing a great job on slash running to the second and third levels.\u201d",
      "Saints running back Alvin Kamara rushed for 112 yards on 23 carries.",
      "New Orleans' lone touchdown came on Carr's 28-yard pass in the fourth quarter to Marquez Valdes-Scantling, his fourth TD reception in four games since being signed midseason. Dante Pettis hauled in Carr's pass in tight coverage in the right corner of the end zone for a 2-point conversion that tied it at 14.",
      "Hill\u2019s departure capped off a tough day for New Orleans on the injury front. Starting center Erik McCoy was unable to return from his re-aggravated groin injury despite two weeks' rest, so Shane Lemieux started in his place. The offensive line took another hit in the fourth quarter when guard Nick Saldiveri was carted off with a left knee injury. Safety Tyrann Mathieu appeared to hurt his shoulder making a second-half tackle on Williams. He remained on the sideline after receiving treatment and said after the game that he expected to recover quickly.",

      "Ja\u2019Quan McMillian returned an interception for a game-sealing 44-yard touchdown with 1:48 remaining, and the Denver Broncos spoiled career-best performances by Cleveland quarterback Jameis Winston and receiver Jerry Jeudy, beating the Browns 41-32",
      "DENVER -- Jameis Winston had a night to remember \u2014 and one to forget.",
      "Ja\u2019Quan McMillian returned an interception 44 yards for a game-sealing touchdown with 1:48 remaining, and Denver spoiled career-best performances by Winston and ex-Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy in beating the Cleveland Browns 41-32 on Monday.",
      "The good for Winston: He threw for a franchise-record 497 yards and four touchdowns.",
      "The not-so-good: He tossed two interceptions that Denver returned for scores. The Broncos had three picks for 171 interception return yards against him.",
      "\u201cIt was my fault,\" Winston said. \"I\u2019ve got to play better.\u201d",
      "It was fully reminiscent of his best \u2014 and worst \u2014 year in 2019 with Tampa Bay, when he led the NFL in yards (5,109) and was second in TD passes (33) but also led the league in picks (30).",
      "\u201cI know I\u2019m better than this,\u201d Winston said. \u201cI\u2019m just praying for the Lord to deliver me from pick-6s. That's not me. Phenomenal game on offense, do some great things, but I mess it up.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Jeudy had nine catches for 235 yards \u2014 the most in NFL history by a receiver against his former team \u2014 and a TD. Jeudy played his first four seasons with Denver and was booed every time he caught the ball.",
      "\u201cThey only boo you,\u201d Jeudy said, \"when they know there\u2019s something great in you.\u201d",
      "Nik Bonitto intercepted Winston and took it 71 yards to the house late in the second quarter. Winston became the first NFL quarterback to throw for 400 or more yards with four or more TD passes and two pick-6s.",
      "Bo Nix finished with 294 yards passing, including a gorgeous deep ball from his own end zone that Marvin Mims Jr. hauled in for a 93-yard touchdown. Nix also threw two picks.",
      "The Broncos (8-5) enter their bye week in the seventh and final playoff spot in the AFC. Denver has a 76% probability of making the postseason, according to the NFL. The team hasn't been in the playoffs since winning the Super Bowl after the 2015 season.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, by any means, but we were able to finish,\u201d Broncos coach Sean Payton said. \u201dBig plays \u2014 the game was full of them.\"",
      "Winston surpassed the Browns record of 457 yards passing set by Josh McCown in 2015 against Baltimore. He threw a 70-yard TD pass to Jeudy and a pair of scores to tight end David Njoku in falling to 2-3 as a starter for the Browns (3-9) since replacing an injured Deshaun Watson.",
      "Cleveland led 32-31 on Winston\u2019s 5-yard TD pass to Nick Chubb when Nix drove the Broncos to the Browns 9. On fourth-and-1, Payton lined up to go for it but changed his mind after a timeout. Wil Lutz kicked a go-ahead 27-yard field goal with 2:54 remaining.",
      "Winston and the Browns had plenty of time to drive for a winning score, but Winston's throw to Elijah Moore was late and McMillian jumped the route. He fell to the turf untouched after making the catch, got up and sprinted to the end zone.",
      "\u201cThe fact they did it twice was kind of crazy,\u201d Nix said of the interception returns. \u201cI'm over there sitting, the benches have the heaters over there, and I don't even have to move. It's pretty nice for the offense when they bail us out like that.\u201d",
      "Jeudy, a first-round draft pick in 2020, was traded to Cleveland this spring after an up-and-down four seasons with Denver. He paused at the goal line before falling backward into the end zone on his long TD catch. He also caught a 2-point conversion to pull the Browns to 28-25.",
      "\u201cWe had a plan going into it in terms of trying to get him open. I thought the plan was solid,\u201d Cleveland coach Kevin Stefanski said. \"Jerry executed the plan really well. Got him open. Jameis made some throws. It\u2019s hard in the losing effort to feel good about anything.\u201d",
      "The play by Jeudy came just 11 seconds after Nix threw a laser from about 4 yards deep in his end zone to Mims at around the 42. Mims caught it in stride, raced to the end zone and jumped into the stands to celebrate.",
      "The Broncos relied on their running game in the first half, with Javonte Williams and Michael Burton scoring short TDs. It was Burton\u2019s second TD of his 10-year career.",
      "The Browns fell to 4-13 in the Mile High City. Dustin Hopkins missed a 47-yard field goal to the left on Cleveland\u2019s opening drive.",
      "Nix, who\u2019s earned the NFL Rookie of the Week three consecutive times, threw his first interception since Nov. 3. Chased by Myles Garrett, Nix tried to force a pass to Tony Franklin over the middle. Denzel Ward reached in and deflected the ball into the air and it was caught by Greg Newsome II.",
      "Winston and Jeudy got rolling early with a 44-yard completion on the Browns' first offensive play.",
      "\u201cThat wasn\u2019t supposed to go to me,\u201d Jeudy explained.",
      "Winston delivered a fiery pregame oration to his teammates, yelling, \u201cIt\u2019s got to come from your heart. I don\u2019t care about no Mile High. I care about how the Browns get down.\u201d",
      "Broncos: WR Jamari Thrash (shoulder) left the game. ... Ward (calf) and S Grant Delpit (head) were both off the field on Denver\u2019s late drive for the go-ahead field goal.",
      "Broncos: S Brandon Jones sustained a groin injury.",
      "Browns: At Pittsburgh on Sunday.",
      "Broncos: After a bye, host Indianapolis on Dec. 15.",

      "BANGKOK -- China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after the Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications.",
      "The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof.",
      "\u201cChina has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese companies, and malicious suppression of China\u2019s technological progress,\" Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine briefing Tuesday.",
      "\"I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction against Chinese companies,\u201d Lin said.",
      "China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite.",
      "Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report.",
      "The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials.",
      "China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology.",
      "After the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a so-called \u201centity list\u201d subject to strict export controls, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China\u2019s \u201crights and interests.\u201d Nearly all of the companies affected by Washington's latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.",
      "Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security.",
      "China's government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China\u2019s fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology.",
      "Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology.",
      "The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, \u201cabuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies.",
      "\u201cU.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China\u2019s related industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,\u201d it said.",
      "The U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year.",
      "The U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources.",
      "The export restrictions have had a mixed impact on prices for those critical minerals, with the price of antimony more than doubling this year to over $25,000 per ton. Prices for gallium, germanium and graphite also have mostly risen.",

      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year",
      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year? Artificial intelligence chatbots might help, but don't expect them to do all the work or always give you the right answers.",
      "Anyone scouring the internet for Cyber Monday deals is likely going to encounter more conversational iterations of the chatbots that some retailers and e-commerce sites have built to provide shoppers with enhanced customer service.",
      "Some companies have integrated models infused with newer generative AI technologies, allowing shoppers to seek advice by asking naturally phrased questions like \u201cWhat's the best wireless speaker?\u201d",
      "Retailers hope consumers use these chatbots, which are typically called shopping assistants - as virtual companions that help them discover or compare products. Prior chatbots were mostly used for task-oriented functions such as helping customers track down online orders or return ones that didn't meet expectations.",
      "Amazon, the king of online retail, has said its customers have been questioning Rufus - the generative AI- powered shopping assistant it launched this year - for information such as whether a specific coffee maker is easy to clean, or what recommendations it has for a lawn game for a child's birthday party.",
      "And Rufus, which is available for holiday shoppers in the U.S. and some other countries, is not the only shopping assistant out there. A select number of Walmart shoppers will have access this year to a similar chatbot the nation's largest retailer is testing in a few product categories, including toys and electronics.",
      "Perplexity AI added something new to the AI chat-shopping world last month by rolling out a feature on its AI-powered search engine that enables users to ask a question like \u201cWhat's the best women's leather boots?\" and then receive specific product results that the San Francisco-based company says are not sponsored.",
      "\u201cIt has been adopted at pretty incredible scale,\u201d Mike Mallazzo, an analyst and writer at retail research media company Future Commerce, said.",
      "Retailers with websites and e-commerce companies started paying more attention to chatbots when use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence text chatbot made by the company OpenAI, went mainstream in late 2022, sparking public and business interest in the generative AI technology that powers the tool.",
      "Victoria\u2019s Secret, IKEA, Instacart and the Canadian retailer Ssense are among other companies experimenting with chatbots, some of which use technology from OpenAI.",
      "Even before the improved chatbots, online retailers were creating product recommendations based on a customer's prior purchases or search history. Amazon was at the forefront of having recommendations on its platform, so Rufus' ability to provide some is not particularly groundbreaking.",
      "But Rajiv Mehta, the vice president of search and conversational shopping at Amazon, said the company is able to offer more helpful recommendations now by programming Rufus to ask clarifying or follow-up questions. Customers are also using Rufus to look for deals, some of which are personalized, Mehta said.",
      "To be sure, chatbots are prone to hallucinations, so Rufus and most of the tools like it can get things wrong.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, wrote in a November blog post that his firm tested Rufus by requesting gaming TV recommendations. The chatbot's response included products that were not TVs. When asked for the least expensive options, Rufus came back with suggestions that weren't the cheapest, Kaziukenas said.",
      "An Associated Press reporter recently asked Rufus to give some gift recommendations for a brother. The chatbot quickly spit out a few ideas for \u201cthoughtful gifts,\" ranging from a T-shirt and a keychain with charms to a bolder suggestion: a multifunctional knife engraved with the phrase \u201cBEST BROTHER EVER.\u201d",
      "After a 5-minute written conversation, Rufus offered more tailored suggestions - a few Barcelona soccer jerseys sold by third-party sellers. But it wasn\u2019t able to say which seller offered the lowest price. When asked during another search for a price comparison on a popular skin serum, Rufus showed the product's pre-discounted price instead of its present one.",
      "\u201cRufus is constantly learning,\u201d Amazon's Mehta said during an interview.",
      "Shop AI, a chatbot that Canadian e-commerce company Shopify launched last year, can also help shoppers discover new products by asking its own questions, such as soliciting details about an intended gift recipient or features the buyer wants to avoid. Shop AI has trouble, however, recommending specific products or identifying the lowest-priced item in a product category.",
      "The limitations show the technology is still in its infancy and has a long way to go before it becomes as useful as the retail industry - and many shoppers - wish it could be.",
      "To truly transform the shopping experience, shopping assistants will \u201cneed to be deeply personalized\u201d and be able - on their own - to remember a customer\u2019s order history, product preferences and purchasing habits, consulting giant McKinsey & Company said in an August report.",
      "Amazon has noted that Rufus' answers are based on information contained in product listings, community Q&As and customer reviews, which would include the fake reviews that are used to boost or diminish sales for products on its marketplace.",
      "The large language model that powers the chatbot was also trained on the company's entire catalog and some public information on the web, Trishul Chilimbi, an Amazon vice president who oversees AI research, wrote in the electrical engineering magazine IEEE Spectrum in October.",
      "But its unclear how Amazon and other companies are weighting different training components - such as reviews - in their recommendations, or how exactly the shopping assistants come up with them, according to Nicole Greene, an analyst at management consulting firm Gartner.",
      "Perplexity AI's new shopping feature allows users to enter search queries such as \u201cbest phone case\" and to receive answers derived from various sources, including Amazon and other retailers, such as Best Buy. Perplexity also invited retailers to share data about their products and said those that do would have an increased chance of having their items recommended to shoppers.",
      "But Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, suggested in a recent interview with Fortune magazine that he didn't know how the new shopping feature recommended products to customers. But in an interview with the AP, Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko pushed back on that characterization, saying Srinivas' comment \u201cwas probably taken out of context.\u201d",
      "The context, he said, is that with generative AI technology \u201cYou can\u2019t know in advance exactly what the output will be just based off of knowing what the inputs\u201d are from the training materials.",
      "Shevelenko said retailers and brands need to know they can't have their products recommended in Perplexity's search engine because they're \u201cjamming key words\u201d into their websites or using different techniques to show up better on search results",
      "\u201cThe way you show up in an answer is by having a better product and better features,\u201d he said.",

      "Consumers in the U.S. are scouring the internet for online deals as they look to make the most of the post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon on Cyber Monday",
      "Consumers in the United States are scouring the internet for online deals as they look to take advantage of the post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon with Cyber Monday.",
      "Even though e-commerce is now part and parcel of many people's regular routines and the holiday shopping season, Cyber Monday \u2014 a term coined in 2005 by the National Retail Federation \u2014 has become the biggest online shopping day of the year, thanks to the deals and the hype the industry has created to fuel it.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That would make it the season's \u2014 and the year's \u2014 biggest \u2014 shopping day for e-commerce.",
      "Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday night, per Adobe \u2014 reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent every minute.",
      "For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales event right after midnight Pacific time on Saturday. Target's two days of discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday. Walmart rolled out its Cyber Monday offers for Walmart+ members on Sunday afternoon and opened it up to all customers three hours later, at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "Consumer spending for Cyber Week \u2014 the five major shopping days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday \u2014 provides a strong indication of how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays.",
      "Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a healthy pace.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",
      "Many economist have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing to automobiles.",
      "The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5% to 3.5% \u2014 compared to 3.9% in 2023.",
      "A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season won\u2019t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period. But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging signs for retailers.",
      "Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that discounts from Thanksgiving onward have \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d \u2014 and online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40 billion mark combined.",
      "U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2% increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That's also more than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1\u202fbillion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said. And on Saturday and Sunday, shoppers spent another $10.9 billion online, up 5.8% over last year.",
      "Adobe reported Monday that as of 6:30 p.m. ET, shoppers had spent $8.7 billion\u202fon the online shopping holiday. When the final tally is in, Adobe expects consumers will have spent between\u202f$13.2 billion\u202fand\u202f$13.5 billion\u202ffor the day, making Cyber Monday the biggest online shopping day of the year__and of all time, Adobe said.",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double digits, while in-store purchase rose a modest 0.7%.",
      "E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $4.6 million per minute \u2014 with top categories by volume including clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to Adobe. \u201cHot products\u201d included Lego sets, espresso machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care.",
      "Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the comfort of their homes.",
      "RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the Midwest.",
      "Sensormatic Solutions, which also tracks store traffic, said its preliminary analysis showed retail store traffic on Black Friday was down 8.2% compared to 2023.",
      "Grant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic Solutions, noted that in-store traffic was getting spread across multiple days since many retailers offered generous discounts before and after Black Friday.",
      "\u201cSome of the extended Black Friday promotions really ended up leading to a little bit of a softer day-of traffic than expected,\u201d Gustafson said.",
      "While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more \u201cexperience-driven spending\u201d in recent years, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic waned.",
      "Jie Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business, told The Associated Press ahead of the post-Thanksgiving shopping weekend that he expected shoppers to \u201cindulge themselves a bit more\u201d when it comes to \u201cself-gifting,\u201d increasing interest in categories like self care.",
      "Adobe notes that shoppers are also buying higher-ticket items this season \u2014 with consumers opening their wallets to invest or \u201ctrade up\u201d to more premium versions of products like electronics, appliances and sporting goods.",
      "Brie Carere, executive vice president and chief customer officer at FedEx, cited strong shipping volume for Thanksgiving weekend, and CyberMonday has had a good start. She anticipated that FedEx\u2019s shipping volume on the online shopping holiday will be slightly up over the 19 million items shipped a year ago on the holiday.",
      "But she said the truncated season \u2014 there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day \u2014 is making it harder for her retail customers to forecast.",
      "In fact, Carere said only four of FedEx\u2019s top 20 holiday e-commerce customers got their shipping predictions correct for the week before the Thanksgiving weekend. And she also noted that while FedEx predicts low single-digit percentage growth in shipping volume each day, she thinks that many retail customers will see a decline for the overall holiday period because of the truncated season.",
      "\u201cI do think that we\u2019re going to see some retailers be disappointed in their volume numbers,\u201d she said.",
      "Carere also doesn\u2019t anticipate much of a lull in shipping between Thanksgiving weekend and last two weeks before Christmas because of the shorter season.",
      "Jim Katsafanas, president of U.S. Small Business Sales, UPS, agreed, noting last week \u201cwe are going to see a pretty consistent surge of volume right through the end. \u201d",

      "As temperatures drop into the teens, Minnesotans have embraced sauna culture for warmth and community",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- As another frigid winter settles over Minnesota with temperatures dipping into the teens, people like Ed Kranz are embracing the cold \u2014 and working up quite a sweat.",
      "Kranz and his wife, Colleen, are among Minnesotans who believe the best way to endure winter is to heat up in saunas and then cool off in their state's icy weather.",
      "On a bone-chilling Sunday morning, they set up a mobile wood-fired sauna from their business, Saunable, near a frozen lake in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan. After about 10 minutes of sweating in the 185 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius) sauna they moseyed outside into the 15-degree temperatures, lingering around a fire in bathing suits before repeating the process three or four more times. One brave soul dipped into a hole in the frozen lake for a post-sauna cold plunge.",
      "Their hot-and-cold venture is common in Minnesota, where plenty of residents embrace sauna culture for warmth and community. Devotees say they are mingling Old World traditions with newfangled internet-based communities, and making social connections in a society that can feel isolating.",
      "Sauna and cold plunges go together like peanut butter and jelly, said Glenn Auerbach, a self-described sauna evangelist and the founder and editor of SaunaTimes. Auerbach started the website in 2008 to share his thoughts, research and conversations with movers and shakers in the sauna world. He and his interlocutors mull over the nitty-gritty of sauna construction, how to cultivate \u201cgood sauna vibes\u201d and the potential health benefits of the sauna lifestyle.",
      "A typical temperature to achieve the holy trinity of the sauna experience \u2014 heat, steam and ventilation \u2014 is about 180 to 200 degrees F (82-93 degrees C), a temperature that starkly contrasts Minnesota's frigid winter weather.",
      "The craftiest in the sauna community can build a facility for about $10,000, according to Auerbach. Those looking to skip the physical labor can outsource the construction. Sauna's popularity, which enthusiasts say spiked following the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought with it a rise in manufacturers selling saunas for about $30,000 to $40,000.",
      "While sauna's cultural cache may have increased in recent years, the practice long predates the Instagrammable spaces now popping up, Auerbach said.",
      "The smell of cedar wood has been lodged in Justin Juntunen's memory ever since he first stepped into his family's sauna as a child. Juntunen, the founder of Cedar and Stone Nordic Sauna, is a descendant of Finnish immigrants who came to America in the 1880s. They brought with them an appreciation for saunas and the communal values the steam-filled rooms impart to local life.",
      "People in Finland say there are more saunas than cars, Juntunen said. When immigrants like his grandfather came to Minnesota to work in the mines, mills or docks, they would often save up to build a farmhouse. But they would build a sauna first, living in the space while the house was constructed. Later, saunas would serve as informal town centers.",
      "People gossiped in saunas, they gave birth in saunas and they died in saunas, Juntunen said. The public nature of the facilities reflects the egalitarian ethos that infuses Nordic culture, and sauna culture by extension, he added.",
      "\u201cThis is a tradition that\u2019s actually for everyone,\u201d Juntunen said. \u201cMy favorite Nordic proverb is all people are created equal, but nowhere more so than in the sauna.\"",
      "In addition to a desire for in-person experiences following the COVID-19 pandemic, sauna enthusiasts say interest rose after some of the internet\u2019s most famous figures, such as podcasters Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman, touted it.",
      "\u201cEvery big podcaster in the world discovered that you could jump in cold water and it feels kind of good. And then people click on it online,\u201d Juntunen said.",
      "In this way, technology has been a paradox for sauna culture, he added. Digital media helped sauna culture grow at the same time as saunas were billed as reprieves from the pervasive reach of technology over every facet of daily life.",
      "Either way, almost all of sauna culture's adherents say its rise is inextricably linked to a desire for community.",
      "Those who committed to building their own saunas have hosted friends, neighbors, and former high school hockey teammates over. This has created a new form of post-COVID-19 contagiousness: \u201cGood heat is contagious,\u201d Auerbach said.",
      "This core function of sauna culture spans generations. Juntunen's grandfather would rush to the sauna after work because it was the space where stories were told.",
      "\"It\u2019s a space where storytelling happens, where connection happens or silence happens,\" Juntunen said. \u201cI think that is a really beautiful example of what a sauna truly is.\u201d"

      "The case will only move forward if President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the FTC decides to continue the investigation and take it to court. Some analysts are expecting a lighter approach to the tech industry under Trump, though incoming Vice President JD Vance has praised Khan's work.",

      "Just over a month after Ernst & Young resigned as its public accounting firm, Super Micro Computer says a review committee has found no evidence of fraud or misconduct among the server maker\u2019s leadership",
      "NEW YORK -- Just over a month after Ernst & Young resigned as its public accounting firm, Super Micro Computer says a review committee has found no evidence of fraud or misconduct among the server maker\u2019s leadership.",
      "Super Micro is also searching for a new chief financial officer and appointing other executives per recommendations from the committee, which began its review several months ago \u2014 after EY communicated concerns over issues like transparency, internal control related to financial reporting and integrity of management while conducting its first audit for the company.",
      "Additional information that emerged during this review eventually led EY to resign as Super Micro's public accountant in October. Super Micro, which disagreed with EY's decision, later appointed BDO as its new independent auditor last month.",
      "Super Micro announced that the committee, formed by the board as well as external counsel, completed its review on Monday. The company said that the conclusions EY laid out in its resignation \u201cwere not supported by the facts\u201d found in this probe \u2014 maintaining that there was no evidence of misconduct.",
      "As a result, Super Micro does not expect past financial reports to be restated. Shares for Super Micro climbed over 20% Monday morning.",
      "Beyond the findings of this review, Super Micro also laid out plans to appoint new leadership, which it says follow recommendations from the committee. Super Micro disclosed that it has begun looking for a new CFO, with David Weigand continuing in the role until the board names a successor. The company also said it would be \u201caccelerating its search\u201d for a chief compliance officer and for a general counsel.",
      "In addition, Super Micro announced it has appointed Kenneth Cheung, current vice president of finance and corporate controller, as chief accounting officer.",
      "It's been a tumultuous year for Super Micro \u2014 and EY's resignation wasn't the first time its accounting practices have come into question. Back in August, short-selling firm Hindenburg Research released a report alleging ample accounting manipulation at the company, pointing to \u201cglaring accounting red flags\u201d and evidence of undisclosed transactions. It also accused Super Micro of rehiring top executives that were directly involved in a 2018 scandal. At the time, Super Micro said it would not comment \u201con rumors and speculation.\u201d",
      "Following these accusations, The Wall Street Journal and others reported that the Justice Department was beginning a probe into Super Micro, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Super Micro has been among tech companies recently riding a the artificial intelligence wave. In August, Super Micro reported fourth-quarter revenue of $5.31 billion, a more than 143% increase over the $2.18 billion it reported in the same quarter of 2023."

      "BANGKOK -- The U.S. Commerce Department has expanded the list of Chinese technology companies subject to export controls to include many that make equipment used to make computer chips, chipmaking tools and software.",
      "The 140 companies newly included in the so-called \u201centity list\u201d are nearly all based in China. But some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.",
      "The revised rules were posted Monday on the website of the U.S. Federal Register for publication later this week. They also limit exports of high-bandwidth memory chips to China. Such chips are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence.",
      "China\u2019s Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect its \u201crights and interests,\u201d without giving any details.",
      "\u201cThis is a typical act of economic coercion and non-market practice,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.",
      "Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the move was intended to impair China's ability to use advanced technologies that \u201cpose a risk to our national security.\u201d",
      "The addition of the companies to the \u201centity list\u201d means that export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with them.",
      "Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls, as the administration of President Joe Biden has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these Entity List actions is to stop PRC (Chinese) companies from leveraging U.S. technology to indigenously produce advanced semiconductors,\u201d Matthew S. Axelrod, the assistant secretary for export enforcement, said in a statement. \u201cBy adding key semiconductor fabrication facilities, equipment manufacturers, and investment companies to the Entity List, we are directly impeding the PRC\u2019s military modernization, WMD (weapons of mass destruction) programs, and ability to repress human rights.\u201d",
      "China has accused the U.S. of pursuing \u201ctechnology hegemony,\u201d as Washington steps up pressure on Chinese tech giant Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers of advanced technology by blocking access to American suppliers.",
      "It particularly objects to what it calls \u201clong-arm jurisdiction\u201d moves such as the U.S. decision to extend export controls to companies to apply to chip-making equipment makers in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore if they use any U.S. technology that might be sold to China.",
      "Pressure from Washington has spurred China to step up its efforts to develop its own advanced computer chips and other technologies, providing billions in subsidies and investments for the industry. Chinese manufacturers have made quick progress even though they remain years behind in some areas.",
      "Shares in Japanese computer chip makers and makers of related equipment surged Tuesday, with testing equipment maker Advantest surging 4.6%, Tokyo Electron gaining 4.6% and Applied Materials up 4.9%. Disco Corp., another chipmaker, jumped 6.9%, while the Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index gained 2.3%.",
      "Meanwhile, China's Naura Technology Group, whose companies were included in the new list, fell 3% and Piotech Inc., another chipmaker, lost 5.3%.",

    "story": [
      "A Delaware judge has reaffirmed her ruling that Tesla must revoke Elon Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package",
      "DOVER, Del. -- A Delaware judge has reaffirmed her ruling that Tesla must revoke Elon Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package",
      "Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick on Monday denied a request by attorneys for Musk and Tesla\u2019s corporate directors to vacate her ruling earlier this year requiring the company to rescind the unprecedented pay package.",
      "McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.",
      "The rulings came in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation package.",
      "McCormick concluded in January that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent. The compensation package initially carried a potential maximum value of about $56 billion, but that sum has fluctuated over the years based on Tesla\u2019s stock price.",
      "Following the original court ruling, Tesla shareholders met in June and ratified Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package for a second time, again by an overwhelming margin.",
      "Defense attorneys then argued that the second vote makes clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick pointed out, were adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package. They asked the judge to vacate her order directing Tesla to rescind the pay package.",
      "McCormick, who seemed skeptical of the defense arguments during an August hearing, said in Monday\u2019s ruling that those arguments were fatally flawed.",
      "\u201cThe large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,\u201d McCormick wrote in a 103-page opinion.",
      "The judge noted, among other things, that a stockholder vote standing alone cannot ratify a conflicted-controller transaction.",
      "\u201cEven if a stockholder vote could have a ratifying effect, it could not do so here due to multiple, material misstatements in the proxy statement,\u201d she added.",
      "Musk expressed his disagreement with the ruling in a post on X, the social media platform he owns. \u201cShareholders should control company votes, not judges,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, McCormick found that the $5.6 billion fee request by the shareholder\u2019s attorneys, which at one time approached $7 billion based on Tesla\u2019s trading price, went too far.",
      "\u201cIn a case about excessive compensation, that was a bold ask,\u201d McCormick wrote.",
      "Attorneys for the Tesla shareholder argue that their work resulted in the \u201cmassive\u201d benefit of returning shares to Tesla that otherwise would have gone to Musk and diluted the stock held by other Tesla investors. They value that benefit at $51.4 billion, using the difference between the stock price at the time of McCormick\u2019s January ruling and the strike price of some 304 million stock options granted to Musk.",
      "While finding that the methodology used to calculate the fee request was sound, the judge noted that the Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court has noted that fee award guidelines \u201cmust yield to the greater policy concern of preventing windfalls to counsel.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fee award here must yield in this way, because $5.6 billion is a windfall no matter the methodology used to justify it,\u201d McCormick wrote. A fee award of $345 million, she said, was \u201can appropriate sum to reward a total victory.\u201d",
      "The fee award amounts to almost exactly half the current record $688 million  in legal fees awarded in 2008 in litigation stemming from the collapse of Enron."

    "story": [
      "Scientists and culture experts in New Zealand have begun the first-ever dissection of a spade-toothed whale, the world's rarest whale species",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- It is the world\u2019s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how extraordinary it is,\u201d said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. \u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Van Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature -- which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July \u2014 is the first ever to take place.",
      "None has ever been seen alive at sea.",
      "The list of what scientists don\u2019t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don\u2019t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they\u2019ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don\u2019t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don\u2019t know how this one died.",
      "Over the next week, researchers studying the 5-meter (16-foot) -long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin hope to find out.",
      "\u201cThere may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,\u201d said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. \u201cWho knows what we\u2019ll discover?\u201d",
      "Only six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification.",
      "New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.",
      "DNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species \u2014 and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn\u2019t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before.",
      "On Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks \u2014 normal, they said, and not the cause.",
      "The dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with M\u0101ori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.",
      "Members of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -\u2013 a prayer -\u2013 over the creature before the study begins.",
      "\u201cAccording to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,\u201d said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.\u201d",
      "The iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale\u2019s head this week.",
      "\u201cIt all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "It\u2019s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean's deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery.",
      "The assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery.",
      "\u201cWhat we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,\u201d said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \u201cIn discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.\u201d"

      "Two company executives, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, will act as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a replacement for Gelsinger, who also stepped down from the company's board.",
      "The departure of Gelsinger, whose career spanned more than 40 years, underscores the turmoil at Intel. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Gelsinger started at Intel in 1979 and was its first chief technology officer. He returned to the company as chief executive in 2021.",
      "Gelsinger said his exit was \u201cbittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.\u201d",
      "Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer at Intel. Holthaus was appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, which includes the client computing, data center and AI groups.",
      "Frank Yeary, independent chair of Intel's board, will become interim executive chair.",
      "\u201cPat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021,\u201d Yeary said in a statement. \"As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.\u201d",
      "Gelsinger's departure comes as Intel\u2019s financial woes have been piling up. The company posted a $16.6 billion loss and halted its dividend in the most recent quarter, and its shares have fallen by about 60% since he took over as CEO. Gelsinger announced plans in August to slash 15% of its huge workforce \u2014 or about 15,000 jobs \u2014 as part of cost-cutting efforts to to save $10 billion in 2025.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s ascendance, meanwhile, was cemented earlier this month when it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",
      "Unlike some of rivals, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them. Under Gelsinger, the company has been working to build up its foundry business making semiconductors in the U.S. designed by other firms, in a bid to compete with rivals such as market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or TSMC.",
      "Intel has benefited from tens of billions of dollars that the administration has pledged to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness.",
      "After taking over as CEO, Gelsinger unveiled plans to build a $20 billion chipmaking facility in central Ohio, and poured billions more into expanding in Europe, where leaders were also worried about dependence on Asia.",
      "The Biden administration had said it would give Intel up to $8.5 billion in federal funding for semiconductor plants around the country, but last week it trimmed that amount, according to three people familiar with the grant who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Shares of the Santa Clara, California, company jumped in early trading Monday but ended the day down 0.5%.",

      "Closing arguments have begun in the trial of a tech consultant in the stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco last year",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Closing arguments began on Monday in the trial of a tech consultant in the 2023 stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco, an event that shocked the broader tech community whose members mourned the loss of an entrepreneur they called charismatic and kind.",
      "San Francisco prosecutors say Nima Momeni stabbed Lee three times after hearing that Lee's drug dealer friend plied Momeni's younger sister with GHB and other drugs and sexually assaulted her.",
      "\u201cOne person called 911 pleading for help, saying somebody stabbed me,\u201d said Dane Reinstedt, assistant district attorney, adding that the other person never called police or told anyone what happened that night until the trial.",
      "Defense attorneys will make their closing arguments Tuesday in a trial that started Oct. 14. Prosecutors will then have a chance to respond to the defense\u2019s closing.",
      "Defense attorneys say Lee, 43, was on a multi-day drug bender of cocaine and ketamine that made him agitated and violent, and that he attacked the defendant with a knife. They said Momeni was forced to use his Krav Maga martial arts skills in the early morning hours of April 4, 2023, after making a \u201c bad joke \u2033 that upset Lee \u2014 and did not realize he had stabbed him.",
      "Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted of murder. He has pleaded not guilty in a case so high profile that San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins stepped into the room Monday for part of the closing.",
      "The trial has been emotionally taxing for family members of both men. Mahnaz Tayarani, mother of the defendant, has sat on one side of the court room while Lee\u2019s father, brother and ex-wife sat on the other.",
      "The prosecution on Monday started its closing argument with a 911 call in which Lee could be heard asking repeatedly for help. Lee's ex-wife, Krista Lee, cradled her daughter Scout as the 16-year-old wept on her mother's shoulder. They left the room. The Lees have two children.",
      "Reinstedt on Monday mocked Momeni\u2019s defense as he walked jurors through weeks of evidence.",
      "He said Momeni was furious with Lee for introducing Khazar Momeni, with whom he was friends, to a drug dealer who gave her GHB, known as a date-rape drug, hours before the stabbing. They say Momeni grilled Lee earlier in the evening about what happened to his sister at the drug dealer\u2019s apartment and sent text messages saying that the two men were creeps and sexual predators.",
      "Then, Momeni met up with Lee at his sister\u2019s condo, took a paring knife from her kitchen set, drove Lee to a secluded area by the Bay Bridge and stabbed him three times, Reinstedt said.",
      "\u201cThat protectiveness of the defendant\u2019s little sister is what led to all of this,\u201d Reinstedt said.",
      "Surveillance video shows the two men leaving the posh condo of Khazar Momeni around 2 a.m. and getting into Momeni\u2019s BMW. Other surveillance then shows them getting out of the car in an isolated section of the city by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Momeni testified he stopped his car after going over a pothole that caused Lee to spill the beer he was holding. Momeni said he then cracked a joke suggesting Lee should spend his last night visiting the city with family instead of trying to find a strip club to keep the party going.",
      "That\u2019s when Lee suddenly pulled a knife out of his jacket pocket, Momeni said. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "\u201cI was scared for my life,\u201d Momeni said in earlier testimony that was at times rambling and contentious.",
      "Reinstedt said Momeni's story made no sense given Lee's peaceful nature. He said Momeni never called police to report Lee's alleged attack or even after he learned Lee had died of stab wounds on the street where he had last seen him.",
      "The prosecutor said the puncture wounds were clean, clear and deep, and not the result of any kind of self-defense tussle, he said. Just about all of the DNA \u2014 99% \u2014 found on the handle of the knife belonged to Momeni, the prosecutor said.",
      "Video of the two men by the bridge is grainy, but Reinstedt said it clearly showed Momeni's figure lunging repeatedly at Lee. There was no deflecting and redirecting of any knife in Lee's hand, he said.",
      "Reinstedt also showed video of Momeni and Lee leaving the condo, Lee's jacket flapping to show there was no knife hidden inside.",
      "Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m., dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to his generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died."

      "As countries shift towards renewable and cleaner energy, geothermal use is expected to grow: In Southeast Asia, geothermal power generation is expected to increase tenfold from 2020 to 2050, reaching 276 million megawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "With their steaming volcanoes and bubbling lakes, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 two archipelagic Southeast Asian countries located on the seismically active \u201cRing of Fire\u201d \u2014 are the second and third-largest users of geothermal energy in the world, with some of the highest geothermal energy potential. The U.S. is number one.",
      "Yet Indonesia uses less a tenth of its gargantuan reserves, making up 6% of its power supply. In the Philippines, about 8% of geothermal capacity has been developed, constituting 14.6% of the country's energy use, the country's largest source of renewable energy.",
      "Both countries plan to expand use of geothermal energy as they transition away from fossil fuels: Indonesia aims to increase the share of geothermal power generation by at least 8% by 2030, making it the second-largest renewable energy source after hydropower. The Philippine government is targeting several projects to boost geothermal capacity by adding nearly 1.5 gigawatts, nearly doubling its current use.",
      "But the exploratory stage of geothermal development \u2014 when companies do tests and drilling to confirm the size, temperature, pressure, and potential production rates of sites \u2014 is expensive and risky. That makes it hard to attract finance for development, said Shigeru Yamamura, an energy specialist at the Asia Development Bank.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most difficult part of developers, because (financially) they cannot take 100% of the exploration risk themselves,\u201d Yamamura told The Associated Press.",
      "Climate finance for geothermal development is limited for most Southeast Asian nations, accounting for only 9% of finance available for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \u2014 a political and economic bloc of ten states in the region, which includes Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "A 2024 ASEAN energy report said \u201cblended finance\u201d using both public and private sources, grants and green bonds could help bridge the gap.",
      "The Philippine government has announced green energy auction schemes for geothermal energy and is preparing a \u201csmart green grid plan\u201d that prioritizes renewable energy \u2014 vital to enable private developers to get financing from banks. This signals progress in policy support for investment, Yamamura said.",
      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has focused on geothermal as part of the country's energy transition. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources says it's working to shorten permitting times and considering ways to increase rates of return on investments in geothermal projects. The state electric utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, also said it's committed to ramping up geothermal energy development.",
      "The World Bank is providing a $150 million loan to scale up Indonesian investments in geothermal energy by reducing the risks of early-stage exploration. The Green Climate Fund and the Clean Technology Fund are providing a $127.5 million.",
      "Even when finance is secured, community pushback can slow development.",
      "In Indonesia, residents of villages have protested projects, citing safety and environmental concerns: Several geothermal sites in Indonesia have had deadly gas leaks in the past five years.",
      "Some Indonesian communities don't understand what geothermal energy is and how they could benefit from its development, said Timothy Ravis, a doctoral student in global development at Cornell University.",
      "Protests at geothermal sites in the Philippines have led at least one company to pay royalties to Indigenous groups worried about land degradation caused by geothermal development.",
      "Governments and businesses should work to gain the consent of communities near projects to help ensure they succeed, said Brommer.",
      "\u201cWe need to show that this development benefits all people, not just a company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's not about being a good neighbor, it's about being the best neighbor and really working with communities to respect their concerns.\"",

    "story": [
      "Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker that owns brands like Jeep and Ram and Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot",
      "NEW YORK -- Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the automaker, which owns car brands like Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, amid an ongoing struggle with slumping sales.",
      "The world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker announced that its board accepted Tavares' resignation Sunday, effective immediately.",
      "Stellantis noted Sunday that the process of finding a new, permanent CEO is \u201cwell under way.\u201d In the meantime, the company says a new interim executive committee, led by chairman John Elkann, will be established.",
      "As head of PSA Peugeot, Tavares took control of the Netherlands-based company in January 2021 \u2014 when it merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, creating an automotive giant that is the parent to several well-known brands today. Beyond Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, the company portfolio includes Dodge, Chrysler, Fiat, Peugeot, Maserati and Opel.",
      "Stellantis' North American operations had been the company\u2019s main source of profits for some time, but struggles piled up this year, with the company citing rising competition and larger market changes. As a result of lofty sticker prices and fewer affordable options, many high-priced vehicles have been left unsold on dealers' lots.",
      "For its third quarter, Stellantis posted 27% plunge in net revenues, as gaps in launching new products and action to reduce inventories also slashed global shipments of new vehicles by 20%.",
      "The carmaker reported net revenues of 33 billion euros (nearly $36 billion ) in the three-month period ending Sept. 30, down from 45 billion euros in the same period last year. All regions except South America reported double-digit dips in revenues \u2014 led by North America, which plunged 42% to 12.4 billion euros ($13.1 billion).",
      "In recent months, Tavares had come under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union after the release of dismal financial performance reports. He also oversaw cost-cutting efforts that included delaying factory openings and laying off union workers \u2014 further straining the company's relations with the UAW, which filed several grievances against Stellantis and threatened to strike in recent months.",
      "The UAW welcomed Tavares' resignation with president Shawn Fain calling the move \u201ca major step in the right direction for a company that has been mismanaged and a workforce that has been mistreated for too long.\u201d He noted that thousands of UAW members had been calling for Tavares' firing for weeks for what Fain called the CEO's \u201creckless mismanagement of the company.\u201d",
      "\u201cTavares is leaving behind a mess of painful layoffs and overpriced vehicles sitting on dealership lots,\u201d Fain said in a statement. He added that the union looks forward to sitting down with Stellantis\u2019 new chief executive and \u201cwill keep using all means available\u201d to hold the company accountable.",
      "Beyond the U.S., Stellantis has faced pressure in Italy \u2014 where lawmakers questioned the former chief executive over the company's production plans in October, with the far-right government accusing the company of relocating assembly plants to low-cost countries. Tens of thousands of autoworkers in the country also held a one-day walkout, calling for more employment certainty and protections.",
      "In efforts to revive sales, Stellantis previously made a number of leadership changes in October, which included naming new heads of operations in North America and Europe. At the time, the company expected Tavares to step down in early 2026, closer to the end of his five-year contract.",
      "The company confirmed in September that it was searching for a CEO to eventually succeed Tavares, but it maintained those efforts were part of standard leadership transition plans.",
      "In a statement Sunday, Stellantis\u2019 senior independent director Henri de Castries said that Stellantis' success is \u201crooted in a perfect alignment\u201d between shareholders, the company's board and the CEO \u2014 but noted \u201cdifferent views\u201d had emerged in recent weeks, resulting in the decision to approve Tavares' resignation.",
      "Elkann, the chairperson of Stellantis' board, thanked Tavares for \u201chis years of dedicated service and the role he has played in the creation of Stellantis\u201d in an additional statement. He added that he looks forward to appointing a new CEO.",
      "Stellantis did not comment further beyond Sunday's release. The announcement arrived shortly after Bloomberg reported Tavares' plans to step down, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter."

    "summary": "The U.S. Navy is making progress in deploying its first shipborne hypersonic weapon",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Navy is making progress in deploying its first shipborne hypersonic weapon",
      "The U.S. Navy is transforming a costly flub into a potent weapon with the first shipborne hypersonic weapon, which is being retrofitted aboard the first of its three stealthy destroyers.",
      "The USS Zumwalt is at a Mississippi shipyard where workers have installed missile tubes that replace twin turrets from a gun system that was never activated because it was too expensive. Once the system is complete, the Zumwalt will provide a platform for conducting fast, precision strikes from greater distances, adding to the usefulness of the warship.",
      "\u201cIt was a costly blunder. But the Navy could take victory from the jaws of defeat here, and get some utility out of them by making them into a hypersonic platform,\u201d said Bryan Clark, a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute.",
      "The U.S. has had several types of hypersonic weapons in development for the past two decades, but recent tests by both Russia and China have added pressure to the U.S. military to hasten their production.",
      "Hypersonic weapons travel beyond Mach 5, five times the speed of sound, with added maneuverability making them harder to shoot down.",
      "Last year, The Washington Post reported that among the documents leaked by former Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira was a defense department briefing that confirmed China had recently tested an intermediate-range hypersonic weapon called the DF-27. While the Pentagon had previously acknowledged the weapon's development, it had not recognized its testing.",
      "One of the U.S. programs in development and planned for the Zumwalt is the \u201cConventional Prompt Strike.\" It would launch like a ballistic missile and then release a hypersonic glide vehicle that would travel at speeds seven to eight times faster than the speed of sound before hitting the target. The weapon system is being developed jointly by the Navy and Army. Each of the Zumwalt-class destroyers would be equipped with four missile tubes, each with three of the missiles for a total of 12 hypersonic weapons per ship.",
      "In choosing the Zumwalt, the Navy is attempting to add to the usefulness of a $7.5 billion warship that is considered by critics to be an expensive mistake despite serving as a test platform for multiple innovations.",
      "The Zumwalt was envisioned as providing land-attack capability with an Advanced Gun System with rocket-assisted projectiles to open the way for Marines to charge ashore. But the system featuring 155 mm guns hidden in stealthy turrets was canceled because each of the rocket-assisted projectiles cost between $800,000 and $1 million.",
      "Despite the stain on its reputation, the three Zumwalt-class destroyers remain the Navy\u2019s most advanced surface warship in terms of new technologies. Those innovations include electric propulsion, an angular shape to minimize radar signature, an unconventional wave-piercing hull, automated fire and damage control and a composite deckhouse that hides radar and other sensors.",
      "The Zumwalt arrived at the Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, in August 2023 and was removed from the water for the complex work of integrating the new weapon system. It is due to be undocked this week in preparation for the next round of tests and its return to the fleet, shipyard spokeswoman Kimberly Aguillard said.",
      "A U.S. hypersonic weapon was successfully tested over the summer and development of the missiles is continuing. The Navy wants to begin testing the system aboard the Zumwalt in 2027 or 2028, according to the Navy.",
      "The U.S. weapon system will come at a steep price. It would cost nearly $18 billion to buy 300 of the weapons and maintain them over 20 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Critics say there is too little bang for the buck.",
      "\u201cThis particular missile costs more than a dozen tanks. All it gets you is a precise non-nuclear explosion, some place far far away. Is it really worth the money? The answer is most of the time the missile costs much more than any target you can destroy with it,\u201d said Loren Thompson, a longtime military analyst in Washington, D.C.",
      "But they provide the capability for Navy vessels to strike an enemy from a distance of thousands of kilometers \u2014 outside the range of most enemy weapons \u2014 and there is no effective defense against them, said retired Navy Rear Adm. Ray Spicer, CEO of the U.S. Naval Institute, an independent forum focusing on national security issues, and former commander of an aircraft carrier strike force.",
      "Conventional missiles that cost less aren\u2019t much of a bargain if they are unable to reach their targets, Spicer said, adding the U.S. military really has no choice but to pursue them.",
      "\u201cThe adversary has them. We never want to be outdone,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.S. is accelerating development because hypersonics have been identified as vital to U.S. national security with \u201csurvivable and lethal capabilities,\u201d said James Weber, principal director for hypersonics in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Critical Technologies.",
      "\u201cFielding new capabilities that are based on hypersonic technologies is a priority for the defense department to sustain and strengthen our integrated deterrence, and to build enduring advantages,\u201d he said."

      "Ultra low-cost online retailers Temu and Shein are giving Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season",
      "Shopping on Temu can feel like playing an arcade game. Instead of using a joystick-controlled claw to grab a toy, visitors to the online marketplace maneuver their computer mouses or cellphone screens to browse colorful gadgets, accessories and trinkets with prices that look too good to refuse.",
      "A pop-up spinning wheel offers the chance to win a coupon. Rotating captions warn that a less than $2 camouflage print balaclava and a $1.23 skeleton hand back scratcher are \u201cAlmost sold out.\u201d A flame symbol indicates a $9.69 plush cat print hoodie is selling fast. A timed-down selection of discounted items adds to the sense of urgency.",
      "Welcome to the new online world of impulse buying, a place of guilty pleasures where the selection is vast, every day is Cyber Monday, and an instant dopamine hit that will have faded by the time your package arrives is always just a click away.",
      "By all accounts, we\u2019re living in an accelerating age for consumerism, one that Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, its fierce rival, supercharged with social media savvy and an interminable assortment of cheap goods, most shipped directly from merchants in China based on real-time demand.",
      "The business models of the two platforms, coupled with avalanches of digital or influencer advertising, have enabled them to give Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season.",
      "Software company Salesforce said it expects roughly one in five online purchases in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada to be made through four online marketplaces based or founded in Asia: Shein, Temu, TikTok Shop - the e-commerce arm of video-sharing platform TikTok - and AliExpress.",
      "Analysts with Salesforce said they are expected to pull in roughly $160 billion in global sales outside of China. Most of the sales will go to Temu and Shein, a privately held company which is thought to lead the worldwide fast fashion market in revenue.",
      "Lisa Xiaoli Neville, a nonprofit manager who lives in Los Angeles, is sold on Shein. The bedroom of her home is stocked with jeans, shoes, press-on nails and other items from the ultra-fast fashion retailer, all of which she amassed after getting on the platform to purchase a $2 pair of earrings she saw in a Facebook ad.",
      "Neville, 46, estimates she spends at least $75 a month on products from Shein. A $2 eggshell opener, a portable apple peeler and an apple corer - both costing less than $5 - are among the quirky, single-use kitchen tools taking up drawer space. She acknowledges she doesn\u2019t need them because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t even cook like that.\u201d Plus, she\u2019s allergic to apples.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t eat apples. It will kill me,\u201d Neville said, laughing. \u201cBut I still want the coring thing.\u201d",
      "Shein, now based in Singapore, uses some of the same web design features as Temu\u2019s, such as pop-up coupons and ads, to persuade shoppers to keep clicking, but it appears a bit more restrained in its approach.",
      "Shein primarily targets young women through partnerships with social media influencers. Searching the company's name on video platforms turns up creators promoting Shein's Black Friday sales event and displaying the dozens of of trendy clothes and accessories they got for comparatively little money.",
      "But the Shein-focused content also includes videos of TikTokers saying they're embarrassed to admit they shopped there and critics lashing out at fans for not taking into account the environmental harms or potential labor abuses associated with products that are churned out and shipped worldwide at a speedy pace.",
      "Neville has already picked out holiday gifts for family and friends from the site. Most of the products in her online cart cost under $10, including graphic T-shirts she intends to buy for her son and jeans and loafers for her daughter. All told, she plans to spend about $200 on gifts, significantly less than $500 she used to shell out at other stores in prior years.",
      "\u201cThe visuals just make you want to spend more money,\u201d she said, referring to the clothes on Shein's site. \u201cThey're very cheap and everything is just so cute.\u201d",
      "Unlike Shein, Temu's appeal cuts across age groups and gender. The platform is the world\u2019s second most-visited online shopping site, software company Similarweb reported in September. Customers go there looking for practical items like doormats and silly products like a whiskey flask shaped like a vintage cellphone from the 1990s.",
      "Temu advertised Black Friday bargains for some items at upwards of 70% off the recommended retail price. Making a purchase can quickly result in receiving dozens of emails offering free giveaways. The caveat: customers have to buy more products.",
      "Ellen Flowers, 36, a lifestyle blogger who lives in Dallas, recently decided to pair a $3,500 dining table with $25 dining chairs from Temu to save money. She's also purchased clothes from Temu. The quality or fit wasn't always always great, so Flowers donated some unwanted pieces to thrift stores to avoid paying return shipping fees that would cost almost as much as the clothes.",
      "Flowers planned to buy stocking stuffers on Temu as well as baubles for an ornament-swapping party in early December. She also wanted to buy necklaces and bracelets for an activity at her 5-year-old niece's upcoming birthday party.",
      "\u201cI love buying my nieces presents,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cSince they\u2019re young, they don\u2019t need the Louis Vuitton handbag. I can give them a cute handbag from Temu. Then they\u2019ll lose interest in a month and I\u2019ll buy them another one.\u201d",
      "Despite their rise, Temu and Shein have proven particularly ripe for pushback. Last year, a coalition of unnamed brands and organizations launched a campaign to oppose Shein in Washington. U.S. lawmakers also have raised the possibility that Temu is allowing goods made with forced labor to enter the country.",
      "More recently, the Biden administration put forward rules that would crack down on a trade rule known as the de minimis exception, which has allowed a lot of cheap products to come into the U.S. duty-free. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to slap high tariffs on goods from China, a move that would likely raise prices and across the retail world.",
      "Both Shein and Temu have set up warehouses in the U.S. to speed up delivery times and help them better compete with Amazon, which is trying to erode their price advantage through a new storefront that also ships products directly from China.",
      "Meanwhile, Temu is onboarding Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that would allow the company to not be as exposed to changes around the de minimus trade rule, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse.",
      "The change comes as both Shein and Temu are attempting to expand beyond the bargain-hungry shoppers who popularized their platforms. Temu is allowing sellers to ship products to customers from local U.S. warehouses and says the move will allow it to sell larger items like furniture as it expands its selection of big-ticket items.",
      "Meanwhile, American children's clothing retailer The Children\u2019s Place signed a deal last month to distribute its products through Shein\u2019s platform. Last year, Shein went into business with women's fashion retailer Forever 21. It has been working to recruit other brands and reportedly has hopes of getting listed on the London Stock Exchange."

      "Mac Holdsworth died last year at his Melbourne family home at the age of 17 after a 47-year-old Sydney man who purported to be an 18-year-old woman demanded money for an intimate image the boy had shared.",
      "Since then, the grieving father has taken his tragic story to around 20 schools to warn students of the risks of social media.",
      "\u201cI saw firsthand the damage that social media could do. I saw Mac, my son, get sexually extorted on social media,\u201d Holdsworth said. \u201cHis mental health deteriorated at a rapid rate.\u201d",

      "Holdsworth described the government plan to ban children younger than 16 from social media as \u201cabsolutely essential for the safety of our children.\u201d",
      "But not all parents are convinced that banning young children from social media is the answer.",
      "Critics say the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents\u2019 authority to decide what\u2019s best for their children.",
      "They also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encounter, and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.",
      "Independent Sydney lawmaker Kylea Tink on Tuesday became the first member of the House of Representatives to speak publicly against the bill, which would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cAs a mom of three young adults ... I\u2019m very aware of the negative impacts of social media and the challenges of parenting in this digital world,\u201d Tink told Parliament. \u201cI also recognize, however, that my children are digital natives and are very literate about how these platforms work. For this reason, I encourage everyone involved in this debate to ensure they are listening to the voices of young Australians when it comes to this decision-making process rather than assuming that the grownups in the room know best.\u201d",
      "Tink was among 13 lawmakers who voted against the bill in the House on Wednesday. They were overwhelmed by 102 legislators who voted for it.",
      "The platforms have urged a Senate committee that examined the legislation on Monday to delay a vote until after a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies is completed next June.",
      "The four-hour committee meeting on Monday attracted 15,000 written submissions.",
      "X Corp. told the committee that billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's platform had \u201cserious concerns as to the lawfulness of the bill,\" including its compatibility with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.",
      "\u201cThere is no evidence that banning young people from social media will work and to make it law in the form proposed is highly problematic,\u201d X said.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation was \u201cinconsistent with what Australian parents have told us that they want, which is a simple and effective way for them to set controls and manage their teens\u2019 online experience.\u201d",
      "Under the bill, parental consent for children to use social media does not override the ban.",
      "Lizzie O\u2019Shea, chair of the Digital Rights Watch charity, which aims to uphold the digital rights of Australians, said she was appalled by the process and limited timeframe the government used to pass such significant and contentious legislation.",
      "She said she was very aware of the serious risks posed by social media platforms, \"but I do not support a ban personally because I understand both the limits of that particular policy and the expert evidence that is coming out from people who work in this space about the problems for young people being excluded from those spaces,\u201d O'Shea said.",
      "Her concerns centered on privacy, negative mental health impacts on excluded children and the possibility that young children would find ways to access social media spaces that would become even less child friendly as a result of the ban.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m profoundly aware of the dangers of large social media platforms running a certain kind of business model that prioritizes data extraction and exploitation of vulnerability over the public interest or the building of community and the protection of democracy,\" she said.",
      "Swinburne University digital media expert Belinda Barnet, who supports the ban, feels she is part of a minority among professionals in the digital field.",
      "\u201cI like it mainly because I think many of the social media platforms as they exist right now are not suitable environments for young children,\u201d she said."

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 21:45:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Joe Biden is the first president to pardon his child.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden called the prosecution of his son \"a miscarriage of justice.\"",
      "Hunter Biden's pardon is the latest in a long list of controversial White House immunity decisions.",
      "Still, President Joe Biden's unconditional, full absolution of his son is different in one unprecedented way: No commander-in-chief has ever granted clemency to his child, according to experts.",
      "While former President Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr., of a drug conviction on his last day in office in 2001 and President-elect Donald Trump did the same for his daughter Ivanka's father-in-law, Charles Kushner, of tax evasion and witness tampering convictions in the final days of his first term, Biden has broken new ground in presidential pardon history, experts told ABC News.",
      "\"This is a first,\" said Jeffrey Crouch, an assistant professor of American politics at American University and author of the book \"The Presidential Pardon Power.\" \"In terms of the legal side of things, the president has the power to grant clemency to just about anybody he wants.\"",
      "Under a section called the \"Commander-in-chief clause,\" Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution says the president \"shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\"",
      "\"The idea is that it's a check on decisions of the federal judiciary and the president is entrusted with this responsibility,\" Crouch told ABC News. \"And the reason the President has the responsibility is because the framers of the constitution decided that the president should have this ability. It should be virtually unchecked and it should be part of the system of separated powers and checks and balances, and that the president should be able to unilaterally decide whether to shorten someone's punishment or to offer them a full pardon, or some variation of the options that are available.\"",
      "Crouch said the only limit placed on a president's pardon power is that it must pertain to crimes committed against the United States, meaning only federal offenses.",
      "\"If someone commits a state offense, the state will have its own process that the person will need to go through, whether it's a parole board or a governor or whatever the case might be,\" Crouch said.",
      "Hunter Biden pleaded guilty over the summer to federal charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes from 2016 to 2020. In a separate case, he was convicted of making false statements on a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives form when he purchased a handgun in 2018 and said he was not using drugs at that time.",
      "Hunter Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 12 in the federal gun case in Delaware and on Dec. 16 in the tax evasion case in California.",
      "Due to the pardons his father issued on Sunday, both convictions are expected to be thrown out.",
      "President Biden issued the pardons despite repeatedly making public statements that he would not interfere with justice. In a statement, he called the prosecution of his son \"a miscarriage of justice\" by his own Department of Justice.",
      "\"From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" Biden wrote.",
      "He added, \"Here's the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice -- and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.\"",
      "The president's decision to pardon his son immediately provoked a backlash from Republicans and Democrats, who viewed it as an abuse of executive branch power and pointed out that arguments the president made of his son being the target of political prosecution are the same ones rejected by the courts handling his cases. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump called the pardon \"an abuse and miscarriage of Justice.\"",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, condemned the pardon in an interview Monday on Fox News and issued a warning to President Biden.",
      "\"Joe Biden may come to regret this decision because, having given his son a blanket pardon of 11 years to include the time when Joe Biden was vice president, Hunter Biden now can't plead the fifth if he appears before Congress or appears before a grand jury,\" Cotton said.",
      "He added, \"He has to testify about exactly what he was up to, for instance, when he was traveling to China on Air Force Two and meeting with Chinese communist princelings, or why being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on a Ukrainian energy company's board for which he had no qualifications. So, that may be one unintended consequence of the pardon that Joe Biden didn't fully think through.\"",
      "The full pardon is not just for Hunter Biden's recent convictions but covers any crime he may have committed over a nearly 11-year span from Jan. 1, 2014, to Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "\"It's critical,\" Kim Wehle, a law professor and ABC News contributor, said of the time frame covered in the pardon.",
      "She noted that Trump has picked Kash Patel as FBI director and Pam Bondi as Attorney General.",
      "\"These folks have publicly stated that they're on board with using the Justice Department as a mechanism of vengeance and retribution. So the breadth of that pardon suggests that President Biden understands that without that, Hunter Biden could be targeted for a vindictive prosecution,\" said Wehle, the author of \"Pardon Power: How the Pardon System Works -- And Why.\"",
      "\"He faced jail time with these two convictions and Donald Trump will be in charge of the federal Bureau of Prisons, so he would be in charge of Hunter Biden's day-to-day life,\" Wehle said. \"I can understand why a president would not want his son to be put through that moving forward.\"",
      "Crouch described the pardon as \"extraordinarily broad\" and said there are similarities to the pardon President Gerald Ford granted President Richard Nixon in 1974.",
      "\"It was not necessarily tied to specific offenses. It was tied to a time range and it covered Nixon's entire presidency,\" Crouch said. \"So any federal offenses that Nixon committed or may have committed during his presidency were covered and the language of the Hunter Biden pardon seems a bit similar to that in terms of its breadth.\"",
      "Asked if a presidential pardon can be overturned, Crouch said, \"It's not possible.\" He said even the U.S. Supreme Court would not have a say in Hunter Biden's pardon.",
      "Crouch said the closest a pardon has come to being overturned occurred in 2008 when then-President George W. Bush pardoned New York developer Isaac Robert Toussie for fraudulently obtaining federally insured mortgages. After facing criticism that Toussie's father was a big Republican donor, Bush took back the pardon, claiming it hadn't been completed.",
      "\"You can stop something that hasn't been completed, but you can't take back a pardon that's been completed,\" Crouch said. \"And the Hunter Biden language in the pardon suggests any and all federal offenses is pretty broad and there's no taking that back.\"",
      "Crouch said most modern presidents have relied on the Office of the Pardon Attorney in the Department of Justice to investigate requests for pardons, but are not obligated to do so.",
      "\"It's designed to handle the bureaucratic side of that process, to take some of the burden off the president individually, and, frankly, to give the president someone to blame when things go awry. That's how most modern presidents approach clemency,\" Crouch said.",
      "Biden didn't go through the Office of the Pardon Attorney before deciding to pardon his son. The president made the decision after discussing it with his family during their time together in Nantucket for Thanksgiving, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News on Monday.",
      "During Trump's first term, according to Crouch, he used the Office of the Pardon Attorney roughly 25 times for his 238 clemency grants.",
      "\"He had an internal process where, according to reporters, he would hear something on television, or someone would talk with him, or he'd read something, and those are the cases that would be considered for clemency,\" Crouch said of Trump.",
      "Crouch said the Office of the Pardon Attorney rarely recommends granting pardons.",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he posted on social media, \"As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?\"",
      "Crouch said that while legal scholars have debated whether a president can pardon himself, the question remains unsettled.",
      "\"The answer is nobody knows until somebody tries it. It's not really clear what would happen,\" Crouch said.",
      "Asked if Biden could pardon Trump before leaving office, Couch said, \"Biden can pardon anyone he would like.\"",
      "\"The question is what would be the benefit to doing that? It would be highly controversial,\" Crouch said. \"And so when you look at highly controversial cases, you've got to think about why would the president do this?\"",
      "Crouch said there have been other controversial presidential pardons made in recent history.",
      "Besides pardoning his brother, former President Clinton caused a firestorm in 1999 when he commuted the sentences of 16 members of the FALN, a Puerto Rican paramilitary organization that set offer bombs in the United States, mostly in New York and Chicago. Clinton agreed to grant the FALN members clemency in exchange for them renouncing violence.",
      "In the last days of his presidency in 2001, Clinton pardoned financier and fugitive Marc Rich, whose ex-wife participated in Clinton's presidential campaigns and was a major donor to his presidential library. One of the critics to publicly condemn the Rich pardon was none other than then-Sen. Joe Biden.",
      "\"I think either the president had an incredible lapse in memory or was brain-dead when he did that one. I mean, I just think it's totally indefensible,\" Biden said in a Feb. 11, 2001, Fox News Sunday interview.",
      "In 2007, then-President George W. Bush commuted the 31-month federal sentence for Scooter Libby, former chief of staff for Vice President Dick Cheney, who was convicted of obstruction of justice, perjury and making false statements stemming from a White House leak that criminally exposed the covert identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson. Trump later granted Libby a full pardon.",
      "In 1992, Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush, pardoned Caspar Weinberger, the former Secretary of Defense, and five others, absolving them from any further punishment for their illegal dealings in the Reagan-era Iran-Contra scandal. Critics argued that Bush Sr. granted the pardons at a time when he was a lame-duck president with no political consequences.",
      "In 2017, Trump pardoned former Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was charged with criminal contempt of court for disobeying a federal judge's order to stop racially profiling in detaining individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. Trump also pardoned in 2020, former Gen. Michael Flynn, his first national security advisor, who was convicted of lying to FBI agents as part of special counsel Robert Muller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.",
      "\"There's no limit on the number of pardons that a president can give,\" Crouch said. \"The president can pardon as many people or as few people as you would like. He can do it at any time he would like.\"",

      "He needs to go to school for the sake of his future, she told him.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have everything,\u201d said Betom, an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Tommy attends school on the tribe's reservation in southeastern Arizona. \u201cYou have everything. You have running water in the house, bathrooms and a running car.\u201d",
      "A teacher and a truancy officer also reached out to Tommy's family to address his attendance. He was one of many. Across the San Carlos Unified School District, 76% of students were chronically absent during the 2022-2023 school year, meaning they missed 10% or more of the school year.",
      "___",
      "This story is part of a collaboration on chronic absenteeism among Native American students between The Associated Press and ICT, a news outlet that covers Indigenous issues.",
      "____",
      "Years after COVID-19 disrupted American schools, nearly every state is still struggling with attendance. But attendance has been worse for Native American students \u2014 a disparity that existed before the pandemic and has since grown, according to data collected by The Associated Press.",
      "Out of 34 states with data available for the 2022-2023 school year, half had absenteeism rates for Native American and Alaska Native students that were at least 9 percentage points higher than the state average.",
      "Many schools serving Native students have been working to strengthen connections with families, who often struggle with higher rates of illness and poverty. Schools also must navigate distrust dating back to the U.S. government's campaign to break up Native American culture, language and identity by forcing children into abusive boarding schools.",
      "History \"may cause them to not see the investment in a public school education as a good use of their time,\u201d said Dallas Pettigrew, director of Oklahoma University's Center for Tribal Social Work and a member of the Cherokee Nation.",
      "The San Carlos school system recently introduced care centers that partner with hospitals, dentists and food banks to provide services to students at multiple schools. The work is guided by cultural success coaches \u2014 school employees who help families address challenges that keep students from coming to school.",
      "Nearly 100% of students in the district are Native and more than half of families have incomes below the federal poverty level. Many students come from homes that deal with alcoholism and drug abuse, Superintendent Deborah Dennison said.",
      "Students miss school for reasons ranging from anxiety to unstable living conditions, said Jason Jones, a cultural success coach at San Carlos High School and an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Acknowledging their fears, grief and trauma helps him connect with students, he said.",
      "\u201cYou feel better, you do better,\u201d Jones said. \"That\u2019s our job here in the care center is to help the students feel better.\u201d",
      "In the 2023-2024 school year, the chronic absenteeism rate in the district fell from 76% to 59% \u2014 an improvement Dennison attributes partly to efforts to address their communities' needs.",
      "\u201cAll these connections with the community and the tribe are what\u2019s making a difference for us and making the school a system that fits them rather than something that has been forced upon them, like it has been for over a century of education in Indian Country,\u201d said Dennison, a member of the Navajo Nation.",
      "In three states \u2014 Alaska, Nebraska, and South Dakota \u2014 the majority of Native American and Alaska Native students were chronically absent. In some states, it has continued to worsen, even while improving slightly for other students, as in Arizona, where chronic absenteeism for Native students rose from 22% in 2018-2019 to 45% in 2022-2023.",
      "AP's analysis does not include data on schools managed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Education, which are not run by traditional districts. Less than 10% of Native American students attend BIE schools.",
      "At Algodones Elementary School, which serves a handful of Native American pueblos along New Mexico's Upper Rio Grande, about two-thirds of students are chronically absent.",
      "The communities were hit hard by COVID-19, with devastating impacts on elders. Since schools reopened, students have been slow to return. Excused absences for sick days are still piling up \u2014 in some cases, Principal Rosangela Montoya suspects, students are stressed about falling behind academically.",
      "Staff and tribal liaisons have been analyzing every absence and emphasizing connections with parents. By 10 a.m., telephone calls go out to the homes of absent students. Next steps include in-person meetings with those students\u2019 parents.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s illness. There\u2019s trauma,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cA lot of our grandparents are the ones raising the children so that the parents can be working.\u201d",
      "About 95% of Algodones' students are Native American, and the school strives to affirm their identity. It doesn't open on four days set aside for Native American ceremonial gatherings, and students are excused for absences on other cultural days as designated by the nearby pueblos.",
      "For Jennifer Tenorio, it makes a difference that the school offers classes in the family\u2019s native language of Keres. She speaks Keres at home, but says that\u2019s not always enough to instill fluency.",
      "Tenorio said her two oldest children, now in their 20s, were discouraged from speaking Keres when enrolled in the federal Head Start educational program \u2014 a system that now promotes native language preservation \u2014 and they struggled academically.",
      "\u201cIt was sad to see with my own eyes,\u201d said Tenorio, a single parent and administrative assistant who has used the school's food bank. \u201cIn Algodones, I saw a big difference to where the teachers were really there for the students, and for all the kids, to help them learn.\u201d",
      "Over a lunch of strawberry milk and enchiladas on a recent school day, her 8-year-old son Cameron Tenorio said he likes math and wants to be a policeman.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s inspired,\u201d Tenorio said. \u201cHe tells me every day what he learns.\u201d",
      "In Arizona, Rice Intermediate School Principal Nicholas Ferro said better communication with families, including Tommy Betom's, has helped improve attendance. Since many parents are without working phones, he said, that often means home visits.",
      "Lillian Curtis said she has been impressed by Rice Intermediate's student activities on family night. Her granddaughter, Brylee Lupe, 10, missed 10 days of school by mid-October last year but had missed just two days by the same time this year.",
      "\u201cThe kids always want to go \u2014 they are anxious to go to school now. And Brylee is much more excited,\u201d said Curtis, who takes care of her grandchildren.",
      "Curtis said she tells Brylee that skipping school is not an option.",
      "\u201cI just told her that you need to be in school, because who is going to be supporting you?\u201d Curtis said. \u201cYou've got to do it on your own. You got to make something of yourself.\u201d",
      "The district has made gains because it is changing the perception of school and what it can offer, said Dennison, the superintendent. Its efforts have helped not just with attendance but also morale, especially at the high school, she said.",
      "\u201cEducation was a weapon for the U.S. government back in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cWe work to decolonize our school system.\u201d",

    "title": "What a 'deep state' investigation could look like if Kash Patel becomes FBI director",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 21:47:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's how Kash Patel, President-elect Trump's choice to lead the FBI, might try to make good on his pledge to rid the government of the so-called \"deep state.\"",
    "story": [
      "Here's how the Trump loyalist might try to eliminate the so-called \"deep state.\"",
      "Trump loyalist Kash Patel, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to become the next FBI director, has said the FBI's investigation of alleged ties between Trump or his associates and Russia, launched more than eight years ago, was such a massive \"criminal enterprise\" that it \"drowns Watergate.\"",
      "And he says the current and former U.S. officials who he claims orchestrated \"Russia Gate\" should be prosecuted, while \"thousands and thousands and thousands\" of government employees need to be fired for aiding the so-called \"deep state\" -- what conspiracy theorists claim is a cadre of career government employees working together to secretly manipulate policy, undermine elected leaders, and take down Trump.",
      "As a senior House investigator during part of Trump's first term, Patel helped direct the House Republicans' probe of the Russia investigation, which led to Patel joining the Trump administration in 2019.",
      "When Patel appeared on Trump ally Steve Bannon's podcast last December, Bannon asked him if -- as someone expected to take on a senior national security role in what they hoped would be Trump's next administration -- Patel was \"highly confident\" he could quickly deliver \"serious prosecutions and accountability\" for the \"evil deeds\" of the \"deep state.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Patel responded.",
      "It's unclear if comments like that reflect pre-election posturing or genuine intentions, especially considering that multiple official inquiries into \"Russia Gate\" have not supported the types of grand claims Patel and other Trump allies have made about it. But, if Patel becomes FBI director and actually launches such investigations, how would he conduct them, who would he target, and what type of \"accountability\" would he seek?",
      "Patel's media interviews, his other public statements, and a book that he published last year titled \"Government Gangsters\" -- which Trump praised as a \"roadmap to end the Deep State's reign\" -- offer potential clues.",
      "Patel spent several years as a prosecutor in the Justice Department's National Security Division before becoming a House investigator and then joining the Trump administration. In the final year of Trump's presidency, Patel was appointed acting deputy director of national intelligence -- the second-in-command of the entire U.S. intelligence community -- and then chief of staff to the acting U.S. defense secretary, a position critics claimed he was unqualified to hold.",
      "Of efforts to dig into \"Russia Gate,\" Patel said on his \"Kash's Corner\" podcast in July 2021, \"I would basically run this entire investigation as if it was a giant conspiracy.\"",
      "At the time, he had high hopes that a probe by special counsel John Durham, who was appointed under the first Trump administration to scrutinize the Russia investigation, would ultimately produce a wave of indictments.",
      "\"[It was] the greatest political fraud in American history,\" Patel said of the alleged conspiracy. \"No one person could pull this off alone. It's impossible.\"",
      "More recently, at a September Trump campaign rally in Las Vegas, Patel offered this summary of what he believes happened: In 2016, the Democratic Party \"illegally spen[t] campaign dollars to hire a foreign intelligence asset from overseas and funnel fake, false information into the Federal Bureau of Investigation, only to have them go to a secret surveillance court, lie to a federal judge, just so that they could illegally surveil their political opponent,\" he said.",
      "But that's not what happened, according to Durham's final report, as well as a separate report from the Justice Department's inspector general and other publicly-released government records.",
      "In July 2016, based on uncorroborated information the FBI received suggesting Russia might try to help Trump win the 2016 election, the agency launched a wide-ranging investigation into whether Trump and his associates were working with Russia.",
      "Separately, a law firm working for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign hired a private investigator, former British spy Christopher Steele, to conduct opposition research on Trump, and Steele compiled a series of reports with shocking claims about Trump and his associates.",
      "When FBI officials in Washington -- already looking at Trump's associates -- then received those reports in September 2016, they asked a secret surveillance court for approval to eavesdrop on Trump adviser Carter Page. The FBI officials heavily relied on Christopher Steele's reports in their applications to obtain that approval. According to Durham, the FBI came to learn after its first application was approved that much of Steele's information originated from a Russian national who either fabricated it or passed it on from a former Democratic staffer.",
      "In his final report on the matter, Durham blasted the FBI for using \"unvetted and unverified\" information to open a \"full investigation\" and to repeatedly obtain approval for intrusive surveillance of Page. Durham said \"senior FBI personnel\" and federal prosecutors \"displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor\" toward the allegations they received, and they failed to sufficiently disclose contrary information when they learned it.",
      "But Durham also said his investigation didn't find evidence proving that any FBI official \"intentionally\" tried to \"falsely accuse Trump of improper ties to Russia,\" or intentionally sought to provide inaccurate information to the surveillance court.",
      "\"[T]he Office was unable to establish that any government officials acted with a criminal intent to violate the law, as opposed to mere negligence or recklessness,\" Durham wrote in his final report.",
      "Through its own investigation, the Justice Department's inspector concluded that while there were \"fundamental errors\" and significant \"failures\" in the FBI probe, the investigation itself was reasonably opened based on the information the FBI had received.",
      "Still, Patel has repeatedly insisted that \"laws were broken,\" as he said during a podcast in August 2021.",
      "\"And the evidence is there,\" he claimed, without providing specifics.",
      "Over the past few years, Patel has provided varying numbers regarding how many people he claims may have committed crimes related to the Russia probe.",
      "In some interviews, he's suggested there's only a handful. In other interviews, he's said as many as 20 people -- inside and outside of government -- need to be scrutinized.",
      "In an interview two months ago, Patel insisted he doesn't \"have a hit list\" of people he would target. But spread across his many interviews, he has repeatedly identified certain people by name.",
      "Current FBI Director Cristopher Wray, who was nominated by Trump at the start of his first administration and would now be replaced by Patel, has been frequently mentioned. So have former FBI Director James Comey, who Wray replaced after Trump fired him, and Comey's former deputy, Andy McCabe.",
      "McCabe \"basically orchestrated this entire thing for Comey,\" Patel claimed on a March 2022 podcast, regarding the Russia probe.",
      "Ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI attorney Lisa Page, who exchanged personal text messages criticizing Trump as they worked on a major investigation related to him, \"broke the law\" and \"weaponized the system of justice against a political target they hated,\" Patel said on the Shawn Ryan podcast two months ago. Strzok was fired from the bureau in 2018 and subsequently reached a settlement with the Justice Department over his claims that his privacy rights were violated when his text messages were released.",
      "In its final report on the matter, the Justice Department's inspector general said it uncovered no evidence that \"political bias or improper motivation influenced\" the investigation of alleged ties between Trump or his associates and Russia.",
      "Still, in a June 2022 interview, Patel said, \"I would be able to bring cases against all of them.\"",
      "And, on his podcast in July 2021, Patel said that if he were in charge of the federal investigation, he would grant immunity to Lisa Page so she could testify against more than a dozen others he'd consider subpoenaing.",
      "In other interviews, Patel has said Steele and a slew of Obama administration officials -- including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper -- potentially committed crimes, even though the multiple probes that reviewed the matter resulted in no charges against them.",
      "And in the interview two months ago, Patel said that several former Trump administration officials -- former Attorney General Bill Bar, former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, former CIA Director Gina Haspel, former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and former National Security Council staffer Fiona Hill -- might also deserve prosecution.",
      "\"I don't know that it ever gets to the level of treason singularly with any of them, but what you have is a build-up of so many actions by the deep state that it becomes borderline treasonous,\" he said of officials from both the Obama and Trump administrations.",
      "The multiple federal inquiries into \"Russia Gate\" have not produced evidence to support charges against any of those officials.",
      "Patel has also identified many others, including saying in a 2021 interview that Jake Sullivan, who was Hillary Clinton's foreign policy adviser during her 2016 campaign and now serves as President Joe Biden's national security adviser, \"has got problems as well,\" without offering any details.",
      "Appearing on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday, Sullivan said he has \"50 days left to continue to try to protect this country from threats,\" and, \"I'm going to spend every day doing that and not worrying about other things.\"",
      "Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Clinton, Brennan, Clapper, Barr, Rosenstein, Haspel, Esper, Hill and Sullivan are all among 60 current and former officials identified in Patel's book as \"Members of the Executive Branch Deep State\" -- people who he called \"corrupt actors of the first order.\"",
      "Like Barr, Rosenstein, Haspel and Esper, nearly a third of the 60 were appointed to senior roles by Trump or members of his administration.",
      "\"[A]ll those who manipulated evidence, hid exculpatory information, or in any way abused their authority for political ends must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" Patel wrote in his book.",
      "Many -- if not all -- of those referenced by Patel have denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Patel has also suggested that members of the media should be targeted for investigation.",
      "\"We will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media,\" Patel said on Bannon's podcast last year. \"Yes, we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens [and] who helped Joe Biden rig the presidential election, we're going to come after you.\"",
      "\"Whether it's criminally or civilly, we'll figure that out, but we're putting you all on notice,\" he added.",
      "Patel has suggested that prosecutors who bring such conspiracy cases need to be \"more creative.\"",
      "In 2021, Durham indicted attorney Michael Sussmann for allegedly lying to the FBI about Democrats' connections to the origins of Trump-related allegations he provided them, separately from Steele's reports. But when a jury in Washington, D.C., acquitted Sussmann a year later, Patel said on a podcast that Durham was \"too much by the book\" and \"too much of a straight arrow.\"",
      "Patel was particularly upset that Durham followed Justice Department guidelines in the case and filed charges where the central actions allegedly took place -- in \"liberal\" Washington, D.C.",
      "\"He has to get more creative,\" Patel said. A conspiracy case \"can be brought anywhere any part of the conspiracy occurred, so if some guy moved through southwest Utah for a split second, you can bring the whole case there,\" Patel claimed.",
      "When Durham then put Igor Danchenko, Steele's original source for the dossier allegations, on trial in Northern Virginia for allegedly lying about his role to the FBI, Patel predicted things would be \"entirely different\" there. But the jury in Virginia rejected a Durham case for the second time, acquitting Danchenko.",
      "Patel, in his book last year, nonetheless said the Justice Department must \"drastically curb\" the number of cases it prosecutes in Washington because it is \"perhaps the most liberal jurisdiction in America.\"",
      "Durham ultimately brought few indictments from his investigation. The only person successfully prosecuted was Kevin Clinesmith, who Patel once described as a \"medium-level attorney at the FBI\" and who altered an email supporting the final application for surveillance of Carter Page, eight months after the FBI began its surveillance. Clinesmith pleaded guilty to a false statement charge and was sentenced to a year's probation, with the judge saying that while the criminal conduct was serious, it did not necessarily alter the secret court's decision to approve further surveillance.",
      "Though Patel often says criminal investigations are a key part of seeking justice for the crimes of \"Russia Gate,\" he has also emphasized there are others way to help rid government of so-called \"Deep State\" actors.",
      "\"You walk in on Day 1 and you fire literally everyone that was part of that Deep State,\" he said to cheers at the conservative CPAC conference last year. \"It'll be thousands and thousands and thousands, and nobody has had the guts to do that. But President Trump will.\"",
      "In his book, Patel called for a \"comprehensive housecleaning\" at the Justice Department and a wholesale overhaul of the FBI, which he called \"the prime functionary of the Deep State.\"",
      "He wrote that \"unaccountable bad actors\" at the top of the FBI and other agencies are \"aided and abetted by staff in the government who are either in on the game or too afraid to speak up.\"",
      "Wray has pushed back against such claims for years, saying as early as Trump's first year in office that the FBI he knows \"is tens of thousands of brave men and women working as hard as they can to keep people they will never know safe from harm.\"",
      "At the CPAC event last year, Patel said \"the biggest scam in government\" is the assertion that career government employees can't be easily fired.",
      "\"There are ways to do it. Don't believe anybody that says, 'Oh, these guys are in for life,'\" he insisted.",
      "Speaking at another conservative event in October, just two weeks before the presidential election that would lead to his nomination as FBI director, Patel was even more blunt.",
      "\"We are on a mission to annihilate the deep state,\" he said."

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 18:15:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The measure helped worsen the Great Depression, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "The measure helped worsen the Great Depression, experts said.",
      "A Republican president-elect pledges support for expansive tariffs as a means of protecting U.S. businesses and hamstringing global competitors.",
      "That description may conjure up former President Donald Trump, but it also applies to Herbert Hoover, who led the country nearly a century ago during the onset of the Great Depression.",
      "Within months of the stock market crash, Hoover signed into law the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, a 1930 measure that increased tariffs for a broad swathe of imported goods. In response, several countries imposed retaliatory tariffs and trade plummeted. Many economists view the measure as a factor that exacerbated the nation's economic downturn.",
      "\"A whole generation of Republicans and Democrats after World War II was very much conditioned against tariff hikes because of the experience of the 1930s. Now we have a new generation of leaders who are much more willing to pull the trigger on higher tariffs,\" Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College and author of \"Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression,\" told ABC News.",
      "Here's what to know about the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, its economic impact, and what its legacy means for tariffs promised by Trump, according to experts.",
      "What is the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act?",
      "The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act arrived at a moment of economic crisis.",
      "As the stock market wobbled and financial panic took hold, Congress negotiated a set of tariff increases that initially aimed to protect U.S. farmers from foreign competition but ultimately extended to a wide range of manufactured goods.",
      "The measure is named after its key supporters in Congress: Republican Sen. Reed Smoot of Utah and Republican Rep. Willis Hawley of Oregon. It passed the Senate by a narrow margin of 44 to 42, and sailed through the House of Representatives by a vote of 264 to 147. Hoover signed Smoot-Hawley into law in June 1930.",
      "For products already facing tariffs, the law, on average, raised the import tax from 40% to nearly 60%, making for an increase of roughly 20 percentage points, Kris Mitchener, a professor of economics at Santa Clara University who studies Smoot-Hawley, told ABC News. It also significantly expanded the number of goods subject to a tariff, he added.",
      "\"It culminated in a more or less complete rewrite of the tariff schedule,\" Mitchener said, referring to the nation's tariff code.",
      "What happened after Smoot-Hawley took effect, and did it cause the Great Depression?",
      "The Smoot-Hawley tariffs set off a near-immediate trade war, in which several foreign nations responded to tariffs by slapping U.S. imports with taxes of their own.",
      "For instance, Canada placed tariffs on 16 products that accounted for roughly a third of U.S. exports, according to a working paper co-authored by Mitchener in 2021. France and Spain both slapped taxes on imported American automobiles, a major U.S. industry.",
      "\"America's trade partners responded by targeting U.S. exports,\" Mitchener said. \"The most important declines were in the products that were targeted.\"",
      "As a result, trading partners suffered reduced output, but so did the United States, Michener said.",
      "The trade slowdown weakened the economy and exacerbated the nation's economic downturn, experts said. However, the Great Depression had taken hold before the effects of Smoot-Hawley, ruling it out as a cause of the crisis, they added.",
      "\"Smoot-Hawley impacted the U.S. economy at a vulnerable moment,\" Irwin said.",
      "What could the legacy of Smoot-Hawley mean for Trump's tariff proposals?",
      "Smoot-Hawley cast a shadow over tariff policy for decades, Irwin said. \"It gave tariffs a bad name,\" he added.",
      "For decades, prominent members of both major parties focused on the risks posed by tariffs, occasionally citing Smoot-Hawley, Irwin said.",
      "\"The Smoot-Hawley tariff ignited an international trade war and helped sink our country into the Great Depression,\" then-president Ronald Reagan said during a radio address in 1986.",
      "The measure also played a key role in shifting tariff authority from Congress toward the executive branch, since lawmakers sought a speedy way to roll back the tariffs, experts said.",
      "In 1934, the Reciprocal Tariffs Act gave the president the power to increase or reduce tariff levels by up to 50%. A series of subsequent laws helped shift additional tariff authority to the president.",
      "\"Now, Congress doesn't have much to do with setting tariffs,\" Irwin said.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump said he could enact tariffs without support from Congress. He is largely accurate in his description of the wide latitude enjoyed by the president in setting and implementing some tariffs, experts previously told ABC News.",
      "\"Trump is using the delegated powers to pass tariffs,\" Irwin said. \"That's completing the circle of Smoot-Hawley in some sense.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 16:28:44 -0500",
    "summary": "A day after President Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden, prosecutors rebutted the president's allegation that their charges were motivated by politics.",
    "story": [
      "Prosecutors said Hunter Biden's federal charges weren't motivated by politics.",
      "Less than 24 hours after President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden and criticized his prosecution as a \"miscarriage of justice,\" prosecutors in special counsel David Weiss' office defended the integrity of their work in a pair of court filings and fiercely rebutted the president's allegation that their charges were motivated by politics.",
      "\"In total, eleven different [federal] judges appointed by six different presidents, including his father, considered and rejected the defendant's claims, including his claims for selective and vindictive prosecution,\" wrote prosecutor Leo Wise in a ten-page filing in Hunter Biden's tax case on Monday.",
      "President Biden on Sunday issued a blanket pardoned to his son, who earlier this year was convicted on federal gun charges and pleaded guilty to separate tax-related charges, and was scheduled to be sentenced in both cases later this month.",
      "In Monday's filing, prosecutors urged the federal judge overseeing Hunter Biden's tax case in California not to dismiss his indictment, and instead close the docket -- which would allow the record to continue to exist.",
      "\"The government does not challenge that the defendant has been the recipient of an act of mercy. But that does not mean the grand jury's decision to charge him, based on a finding of probable cause, should be wiped away as if it never occurred,\" Wise wrote. \"It also does not mean that his charges should be wiped away because the defendant falsely claimed that the charges were the result of some improper motive.\"",
      "Mark Osler, an expert in presidential pardons at the University of St. Thomas, said Weiss' overture raises \"a technical issue -- either way, the case goes away -- but an important one.\"",
      "\"[Prosecutors] want the indictment to remain on the record,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Without directly addressing President Biden's criticism of the case as selective and unfair, the filing highlighted how Hunter Biden's lawyers made \"every conceivable argument\" to dismiss the case and failed to provide evidence that prosecution was vindictive.",
      "\"The court similarly found his vindictive prosecution claims unmoored from any evidence or even a coherent theory as to vindictiveness,\" the filing said. \"And there was none and never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case. The defendant made similar baseless accusations in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Those claims were also rejected.\"",
      "Prosecutors also opposed dismissing Hunter Biden's indictment on gun charges in Delaware, arguing in a similar filing that \u201cbecause there was no defect in the grand jury\u2019s indictment, there is no reason to dismiss it here.\u201d",
      "\u201cDefense counsel misrepresents the law. Nothing requires the dismissal of the indictment in this case,\u201d that filing said.",

      "Following his meeting Monday with Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth, Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville told reporters Hegseth would be \"great\" for the position.",
      "Tuberville said he didn't talk with Hegseth about his \"personal\" life on Monday, but later clarified that they indeed spoke on the phone about the misconduct allegations against Hegseth.",
      "\"I'm gonna leave the personal stuff between y'all and him whenever he has an opportunity to sit down with you and explain, you know, the allegations that you're all pushing out,\" Tuberville told reporters.",
      "In 2017, Hegseth paid a settlement agreement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault, Tim Parlatore, an attorney for Hegseth, previously confirmed. Parlatore claimed Hegseth was the victim of \"blackmail\" and \"false claims of sexual assault,\" and said he paid the settlement only because he feared his career would suffer if her allegations were made public.",
      "According to a 22-page police report obtained by ABC News, Hegseth's accuser told police that he took her phone and blocked her from leaving his hotel room on the night of the incident.",
      "On Sunday, the New Yorker published an investigation into Hegseth that alleged that \"a trail of documents, corroborated by the accounts of former colleagues, indicates that Hegseth was forced to step down by both of the two nonprofit advocacy groups that he ran -- Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America -- in the face of serious allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety, and personal misconduct.\"",
      "The New York Times published an email Friday that Hegseth's mother, Penelope Hegseth, sent him in 2018, saying he had routinely mistreated women for years. Penelope Hegseth confirmed the contents of the email to the New York Times in a phone interview, but said in the interview to the Times that she regretted her original sentiments expressed in the email and sent her son an immediate follow-up email expressing regret for what she had said.",
      "ABC News has not independently confirmed the New Yorker or New York Times' reporting.",
      "Speaking to reporters after their meeting, Tuberville praised Hegseth and sidestepped questions about his alleged pattern of misconduct.",
      "\"I've known him for a while. Pete's the type of guy that he's going to work. He's got a great work ethic. He's very, very smart. He understands the business side as well as the military side.\" Tuberville said. \"He's actually fought in wars. He is a good age too. Somebody that can relate to the young men and women that we need to recruit in the military.\"",
      "Asked if any of the allegations in the New Yorker article concerned him, Tuberville left the explanation up to Hegseth.",
      "\"Well, I'm gonna leave that to his explanation of all that. I can't comment on that,\" he said. \"Obviously, if it's to a certain degree, people are not going to vote to confirm it, but what I know when I talk to him about what I've read, what I've studied and been around him, I'll vote for him.\"",
      "As Tuberville took question after question on Hegseth's allegations, he was asked if Hegseth needed to defend himself forcefully and provide an explanation to the American people.",
      "\"That's up to him,\" Tuberville said. \"Eventually he's gonna have to come out and start visiting with the media. I think, right now, his number one objective is to go out and and sell himself to you know, at least 51 or 52 Senators. That's the job he needs to do to get confirmed.\"",
      "Tuberville mentioned a dozen of senators are meeting with Hegseth as a group Monday night, but he did not elaborate further."

    "summary": "Reactions varied in the aftermath of an announcement on Sunday evening that President Joe Biden had pardoned his son, Hunter Biden.",
    "story": [
      "Both sides of the aisle reacted after the pardon was issued Sunday.",
      "Reactions started coming through shortly after the announcement on Sunday evening that President Joe Biden had pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, for his tax evasion and federal gun charges.",
      "A reversal for the president, the pardon came about two weeks before his son was scheduled for sentencing in both cases: on Dec. 12 on the gun-related charges in Delaware, and on Dec. 16 on the tax charges in California.",
      "Hunter Biden first released a statement directly after the pardon was issued, saying in part, \"I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering.\u201d",
      "Shortly afterward, his sister, Ashley Biden, posted to her stories on Instagram: \u201cThank you, Dad! What they have tried to do to my brother is cruel + politically motivated. Period. Proud Sister + Daughter!\u201d",
      "However, there was a less receptive response from Washington, D.C.",
      "House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, Republican of Kentucky, said President Biden \"lied from start to finish\" about the circumstances surrounding his son's case.",
      "In a statement on Sunday, he said, \"Joe Biden has lied from start to finish about his family\u2019s corrupt influence peddling activities. Not only has he falsely claimed that he never met with his son\u2019s foreign business associates and that his son did nothing wrong, but he also lied when he said he would not pardon Hunter Biden.\"",
      "\"The charges Hunter faced were just the tip of the iceberg in the blatant corruption that President Biden and the Biden Crime Family have lied about to the American people,\" he added. \"It\u2019s unfortunate that, rather than come clean about their decades of wrongdoing, President Biden and his family continue to do everything they can to avoid accountability.\"",
      "And Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan posted on X: \u201cDemocrats said there was nothing to our impeachment inquiry. If that\u2019s the case, why did Joe Biden just issue Hunter Biden a pardon for the very things we were inquiring about?\u201d",
      "President-elect Donald Trump addressed the pardon by bringing up those who had been arrested for storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 -- whom he referred to as \"J-6 Hostages.\"",
      "\"Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\" he posted to Truth Social.",
      "Steven Cheung, the spokesperson for President-elect Donald Trump, also responded indirectly, providing a statement to ABC News that said the circumstances go to show that the Department of Justice had weaponized the justice system -- before adding that Trump intends to fix that during his second term in the White House.",
      "\u201cThe failed witch hunts against President Trump have proven that the Democrat-controlled DOJ and other radical prosecutors are guilty of weaponizing the justice system,\" the statement said.",
      "\"That system of justice must be fixed and due process must be restored for all Americans, which is exactly what President Trump will do as he returns to the White House with an overwhelming mandate from the American people,\" it continued.",

    "title": "Why Republicans start out as favorites in the 2026 Senate elections",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 17:28:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Democrats need to flip four Senate seats in 2026 to reclaim a majority, but have few clear targets.",
    "story": [
      "Democrats need to flip four seats for a majority, but have few clear targets.",
      "In politics, timing can be everything. While the 2026 midterm elections are still two years away, we can already say that Republicans' position in the race for the U.S. Senate exemplifies this maxim. Although midterms tend to be rough for the president's party, the GOP starts as favorites to retain the majority they just won in the Senate, thanks to how that timing interacts with the chamber's current partisan makeup and its underlying fundamental structures, which are hardwired in a way that currently boosts Republicans.",
      "Part of that hardwiring can be found in Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution, which calls for the Senate to be divided into three groups of seats (known as classes) that each serve staggered six-year terms, such that only about one-third of the chamber's seats are up for reelection every two years. As a result, in our highly partisan era, the set of seats that happen to be on the ballot in a given year can matter almost as much to each party's prospects of winning a majority as the overall electoral environment. By contrast, the U.S. House of Representatives is more at the mercy of national electoral conditions because all 435 seats are up in each election.",
      "In November 2026, we will likely see at least 35 Senate seats up for election: 33 seats in Class II, a special election in Ohio for Vice President-elect JD Vance's seat and another likely special election in Florida for the seat currently held by Sen. Marco Rubio, whom President-elect Donald Trump has nominated to become secretary of state. Depending on other events, additional special elections could also occur.",
      "The Senate map favors the GOP",
      "Heading into 2026, Republicans have about as favorable of a Senate map as they could hope for under the circumstances. This is true despite the fact that the incoming presidential party must defend 22 of the 35 seats that will likely be up for election (including Vance's and Rubio's seats). Strikingly, though, only one of those 22 Republican-held seats \u2014 held by Sen. Susan Collins of Maine \u2014 is in a state that outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris carried in the 2024 presidential election. The other 21 seats are all in states that Trump won. In contrast, Democrats will be defending just 13 seats overall, but two of them are in states that Trump won this year.",
      "This is important because most voters these days back the same party for president and Senate, so each party's target list of seats begins with any seats held by the opposition in states that the party carried in the last presidential election, and then any other seats that were relatively competitive. Looking ahead to 2026, the Democrats are expected to go into the election holding 47 Senate seats (including two held by independents who caucus with them), so they would need to flip four seats to win a majority \u2014 while also defending their seats in Trump-won Michigan and Georgia. With just one Republican seat expected to come up in a state Trump lost, this map doesn't give Democrats many obvious opportunities.",
      "Now, this is not to say that Democrats have no chance of winning back the Senate in 2026 \u2014 just that they need some combination of a very favorable electoral environment, a sizable swing back in their direction from the 2024 presidential cycle and/or a shift in the party coalitions. More often than not, the president's party does indeed lose Senate seats in midterms: In 13 of 20 midterms since World War II, the party in the White House has lost at least one seat.",
      "But the degree of difficulty Democrats face in 2026 is unusually high because Republicans are defending just about the fewest clearly vulnerable seats that any president's party has had to defend in a recent midterm. Beyond Collins's seat, only one other Republican seat up in 2026 is in a state that Trump won by fewer than 10 percentage points against Harris: North Carolina, which Trump carried by about 3 points and where Republican Sen. Thom Tillis is seeking reelection.",
      "The number of vulnerable seats for a president's party has been a crucial factor in past midterms' Senate results. For instance, Democrats faced a particularly tough map in 2014, when they had to defend seven seats that then-President Barack Obama had lost in 2012; they lost all seven of those, plus two others for a net loss of nine. Conversely, Democrats went into 2022 in much better shape because they didn't have to defend a single seat in a state that President Joe Biden lost; that likely helped them avoid a midterm loss, as they wound up gaining one seat in Republican-held Pennsylvania.",
      "In the next Congress, Collins will be the only GOP senator out of 53 in total who represents a state that Harris won. Across all presidential and midterm cycles over the past four decades, this represents the most Senate seats a party has held in states won by their presidential nominee in the last presidential election. (The previous record involved Trump, too, when the GOP headed into the 2020 presidential election holding 51 seats in states he'd carried in 2016.)",
      "These circumstances also get at Republicans' larger structural edge: Each state gets two seats in the Senate, but these days, there are consistently more red-leaning states than blue-leaning states relative to the country as a whole. For example, 29 states leaned redder at the presidential level than the national popular vote in 2024, while 31 did so in 2020 and 32 in 2016. That means Republicans now hold more Senate seats in comfortably red territory than they ever have, while Democrats have relied on \"crossover\" seats in red-leaning states to hold onto majorities in recent years. Even after losing a few of these critical seats in 2024 (in West Virginia, Montana and Ohio), Democrats currently hold 10 seats in states won by Trump, and they would need to once again win in hostile territory to retake the majority in 2026.",
      "Democrats' difficult climb to regain a majority",
      "For Democrats, then, the list of seats that they have a realistic chance of flipping is pretty short after Maine and North Carolina. To make further inroads \u2014 and have any shot at picking up the four seats they need \u2014 Democrats' best path likely involves winning some of the five seats expected to be on the ballot that are in states Trump carried by 10 to 15 points.",
      "While it would not be historically out of the question for Democrats to win seats that are this red, it would rank as unusual compared with recent midterms. In the past three midterms, the most unfavorable seat that a non-presidential party has flipped was the GOP's 2014 victory in Iowa, which Obama carried by nearly 6 points in 2012 (Republicans that year also flipped Colorado, which Obama had won by slightly more than 5 points). We have to go back even further to find a seat flip to the non-presidential party after its state was truly uncompetitive in the preceding presidential election; in the 2010 midterms, the GOP won Obama's old seat in Illinois even after he'd won the state by 25 points in 2008.",
      "It's certainly very early to break down the races in these seven states. After all, we don't know just who will run in any of them, whom Republican Gov. Mike DeWine might appoint to Vance's seat in Ohio, or whether Florida will definitely have a special election \u2014 as the Senate will need to confirm Rubio as secretary of state before his seat officially opens up. But let's take a quick look at what we know so far.",
      "In Maine, Collins has said she plans to run for her sixth term in 2026. However, she's never had to run in a tough midterm environment for her party \u2014 her only previous midterm under a Republican president came in the 2002 cycle, which was an unusually good one for the GOP because then-President George W. Bush held a very high approval rating following the Sept. 11 attacks. Additionally, Collins has never had a primary challenger, but that could change if she upsets Trump and the party base \u2014 the moderate will be looking to strategically break with Trump this cycle to shore up her reelection chances. That said, there's also a good chance that one of her strongest potential general election opponents won't run against her: Democratic Rep. Jared Golden has managed to regularly win a red-leaning, rural seat in Maine, but he once worked for Collins and might instead campaign for the state's open gubernatorial seat.",
      "North Carolina, meanwhile, has truly been a \"close, but no cigar\" state for Democrats in recent federal elections. The party has suffered narrow losses for president and/or Senate in 2012, 2014, 2016, 2020, 2022 and now 2024. But Tillis, who first won this seat in the red wave midterm of 2014, will have to walk a fine line by showing enough independence from Trump while not overly upsetting the GOP's right flank and provoking a serious primary challenge. Already viewed as suspect by many conservatives, Tillis is probably more in danger than Collins of having to contend with a notable primary opponent. As for Democrats, the biggest name floating around is outgoing Gov. Roy Cooper, although outgoing Rep. Wiley Nickel has already filed for the race.",
      "The upcoming special election in Ohio will remain murky for some time, especially until we know who will take Vance's place. DeWine is far from a MAGA Republican, and he could choose a more traditional conservative who'll campaign to retain the seat in 2026. However, such an appointee would almost certainly have to contend with a major primary challenge in a state that has an incredibly deep bench of Republican officeholders. For Democrats, Sen. Sherrod Brown just lost his seat in Ohio earlier this month, but he hasn't ruled out the idea of running in 2026. Neither has former Rep. Tim Ryan, who lost to Vance in the state's 2022 Senate contest.",
      "Florida's situation is even fuzzier. The state has raced to the right in recent years, and many Republicans might want the seat \u2014 including, perhaps, the man doing the appointing, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is termed out of office in 2026. Remember, DeSantis briefly ran for Senate in 2016 when Rubio was campaigning for president, but shifted gears when Rubio decided to run for reelection. But DeSantis is facing calls by some Republicans, including Sen. Rick Scott, to appoint Republican National Committee Chair Lara Trump, the incoming president's daughter-in-law who previously looked at running in North Carolina's 2022 Senate contest.",
      "The Republican incumbents in the other three states all look set to seek reelection. In Alaska, Sen. Dan Sullivan comfortably retained his seat in 2020, but he could have to contend with outgoing Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola, who just narrowly lost reelection in the state's at-large House seat. In Iowa, Sen. Joni Ernst appears interested in becoming secretary of defense, but she starts as a clear favorite for reelection. And in Texas, Sen. John Cornyn just lost the race to become the GOP's Senate leader, so we shouldn't rule out the idea of a retirement. Still, he's consistently said he plans to run again.",
      "Of course, Democrats not only need to gain seats but also hold onto the 13 they are defending in 2026. That list really starts with Democratic Sens. Gary Peters of Michigan and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, who have to survive in seats in states that Trump narrowly carried in the presidential race. Still, that's on the low end when it comes to the number of highly-endangered seats Democrats will have to defend in 2026, compared to where other non-presidential parties stood in midterms over the past three decades.",
      "This is a very different situation for Democrats than the last time Trump was in the White House. Like in 2026, Republicans in 2018 didn't have many vulnerable seats to defend, helping them limit their losses to Nevada, which Trump had lost in 2016, and Arizona, which he'd narrowly won. But Democrats that year had to defend 10 seats in states that Trump carried in 2016, and the GOP ended up picking up four of those to produce an overall Republican net gain of two seats.",
      "Helpfully for Democrats, seats held by the non-presidential party on the whole tend to not flip to the president's party in a midterm. Trump carried both Michigan and Georgia this year by fewer than 3 points, and dating back to 1994, the out party has lost just three of 13 midterm Senate races in states that the president's party carried narrowly (by fewer than 5 points) two years prior. To use the 2018 example, Democrats held onto three of their four seats in states that Trump carried narrowly (losing just one, in Florida). Their other three losses came in solidly red states Trump had won by at least 18 points (Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota) \u2014 and they also held onto seats in solidly red Montana, Ohio and West Virginia. Democrats won't be defending any seats like these in 2026.",
      "Plus, it's proved even more unusual for the non-presidential party to lose a seat in a state it carried in the last presidential election. In fact, the unusually strong GOP midterm in 2002 was the last time that happened: Democrats lost hold of Minnesota, which Al Gore had won by 2 points (although that Senate race was also unusual given the tragic death of Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone in a plane crash just days before the election). Looking at the 2026 map through this lens, it would be highly unusual for Democrats to lose seats in states like Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New Jersey and Virginia that Harris won by between about 3 and 6 points.",
      "* * *",
      "Republicans are early favorites to retain control of the Senate in 2026. They have few vulnerable seats to defend and can afford to lose up to three without losing their majority, due to Vance's tie-breaking vote in a 50-50 Senate. Still, a small sliver of hope for Democrats may lie in the fact that 2026 will be Trump's second midterm cycle as president. Although Trump won't have two consecutive terms in office, his presence in the White House could still tap a bit into what has sometimes been called \"the six-year itch\" \u2014 when voters tire of a president and the opposition performs especially well in that president's second midterm.",
      "Additionally, an especially unpopular Trump could put some GOP-held seats on the board that shouldn't be competitive. For example, when Democrats won the December 2017 special election for Senate in dark-red Alabama, they weren't just helped out by the presence of a terrible Republican nominee (although that was a huge part of it): That race also took place when Trump's approval rating hit its lowest point during his first term in office. Weird things can happen. But Democrats are going to need a lot of things to go their way in 2026 to have a shot at taking back the Senate.",

      "A number of Democratic leaders are downplaying the strength of Donald Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris as the inevitable result of an inflation-fueled anti-incumbent backlash that shaped elections worldwide. But others are convinced that the Democratic Party is facing an acute crisis that requires an urgent overhaul of its brand, message and economic policies.",
      "Trump swept every battleground state on Nov. 5, becoming the first Republican candidate to win the national popular vote since George W. Bush in 2004. Yet nearly half the country voted against him. With the final votes still being counted in some places, Trump won the popular vote by just 1.6 percentage points. He carried the seven top swing states by about 760,000 votes combined out of more than 151 million cast nationwide.",

The group will recommend, among other things, that Democrats do a better job listening to voters instead of pollsters, while offering a more forward-looking positive alternative to Trump's MAGA movement.",
      "If they do not make significant changes, according to a preview of that briefing, Priorities believes there is no guarantee that key elements of the Democratic base \u2014 especially young people and voters of color \u2014 will return to the party in future elections.",
      "Some of the loudest voices calling for dramatic changes represent the party's far-left wing, which is often ignored by establishment Democrats who control the party's messaging, strategy and policy platform. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders irked some party leaders the day after the election with a scathing critique: \u201cIt should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.\u201d",

      "Rounds has \u201cno complaints\u201d about the FBI director that Trump wants to fire.",
      "Republican Sen. Mike Rounds emphasized his support for current FBI Director Christopher Wray after President-elect Donald Trump announced he intended to nominate loyalist Kash Patel for the department's top job.",
      "\u201cI think the president picked a very good man to be the director of the FBI when he did that in his first term,\u201d Rounds told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl about Wray. \u201cWhen we meet with him behind closed doors, I've had no objections to the way that he's handled himself, and so I don't have any complaints about the way that he's done his job right now.\u201d",
      "However, Rounds reiterated the president-elect\u2019s right to select his Cabinet and Trump's selection of Patel is not surprising.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't surprise me that he will pick people that he believes are very loyal to himself, and that's been a part of the process,\u201d Rounds said. \u201cEvery president wants people that are loyal to themselves.\u201d",
      "In his book \"Government Gangsters,\" Patel calls for a \"comprehensive housecleaning\" of the Justice Department and an eradication of \"government tyranny\" within the FBI, promising to fire and prosecute officials. Patel has also promoted conspiracy theories about the \u201cDeep State\u201d and vehemently defended Jan. 6 rioters.",
      "FBI directors are nominated and confirmed to serve 10-year terms. After being nominated by Trump, Wray's term began in August 2017. Months earlier, Trump had fired James Comey, who was still less than four years into his tenure as director. Trump did not mention Wray in his Truth Social post announcing Patel for director, but unless Wray resigns the position, Trump will have to fire him to nominate a new leader.",
      "\"The president has the right to make nominations, but normally these are for a 10-year term,\" Rounds explained. \"We'll see what his process is and whether he actually makes that nomination.\"",
      "Rounds reiterated that although the Senate will give Trump the \u201cbenefit of the doubt,\u201d it will uphold its \u201cconstitutional role.\u201d",
      "\"We still go through a process, and that process includes advice and consent, which, for the Senate, means advice or consent sometimes,\" Rounds promised.",
      "Turning to the global stage, Rounds \u2014 a staunch supporter of the U.S. aiding Ukraine in its war against Russia \u2014 called Russian President Vladimir Putin a \u201ctyrant\u201d and suggested that negotiating with him may be futile.",
      "\u201cI think Mr. Putin is a tyrant. I think dealing with him is going to be extremely difficult,\u201d Rounds said, expressing hope for Trump to succeed but recognizing that this would present a challenge for \u201cany president.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want to see Ukraine with its sovereignty protected,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think it's going to be a major, major task to overcome what Putin is offering\u201d on Ukraine giving up territory to end the war.",

      "In regard to Trump\u2019s promise to slap 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico, Rounds said the president-elect is a \u201csuccessful businessman\" who \"really does believe that tariffs can be a great tool.\"",

      "Billionaire businessman Massad Boulos, father of Trump's son-in-law Michael Boulos, will serve as White House senior adviser on Arab and Middle East affairs, Trump announced on his Truth Social media platform. Born in Lebanon, Massad Boulos runs Nigeria-based Boulos Enterprises, which produces and distributes mechanical equipment and motorcycles.",
      "\"Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene,\" Trump wrote. \"He has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community.\"",

      "During the final stretch of Trump's victorious presidential campaign, Boulos appeared with him at campaign stops in Dearborn, Michigan, an Arab American stronghold, and was praised by Trump for helping him flip Michigan from a blue to a red state.",
      "\u201cObviously the No. 1 point that is of high priority within the Arab American community is the current war in the Middle East,\" Boulos told The Associated Press in June. \"And the question is, who can bring peace and who is bringing war? And they know the answer to that.\"",
      "In September, Boulos met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, the New York Times reported. Palestinian officials told the Times the meeting was part of an outreach effort to Trump, but Boulos told the newspaper that it was \"purely personal\" and that he didn't inform Trump about it before or after.",

      "The announcement of Boulos being picked as a White House senior adviser came a day after Trump picked billionaire real estate developer Charles Kushner to serve as ambassador to France. Kushner is the father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who served as a senior White House adviser during Trump's first term as president.",
      "Jared Kushner is married to Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, Ivanka.",
      "Charles Kushner pleaded guilty in March 2005 to assisting in the filing of false tax returns, retaliating against a cooperating witness and making false statements to the Federal Election Commission. He was sentenced to two years in prison.",

      "DETROIT -- A Stellantis joint venture with Samsung SDI has won a commitment from the U.S. government for up to a $7.54 billion loan to help build two electric vehicle battery plants in Kokomo, Indiana.",
      "The project being built by StarPlus Energy LLC is expected to create at least 2,800 jobs at the plants and hundreds more at a nearby park for parts supply companies, the Energy Department said Monday in a statement.",
      "The loan still must be finalized, but the government said the commitment shows its intent to finance the project. To get the loan, StarPlus must develop a plan to engage with community and labor leaders to create good paying jobs. It also has to meet technical, legal, environmental and financial conditions before the government will fund the loan.",
      "It's unclear whether the loan will be finalized before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to end funding for such projects, which he called the \u201cgreen new scam.\u201d A message was left Monday seeking comment from the Trump transition team.",
      "The Energy Department didn't directly answer a question about whether the loan would be funded before the inauguration, but said it would be irresponsible for \"any government to turn its back on private sector partners, states, and communities that are benefiting from lower energy costs and new economic opportunities\u201d from the loans.",
      "The plants would make battery cells and modules for electric vehicles to be sold in North America, the department said. At full capacity, the plants will produce enough batteries to supply about 670,000 vehicles per year.",
      "\u201cThis will greatly expand EV battery manufacturing capacity in North America and reduce America's reliance on adversarial foreign nations like China,\u201d the statement said.",

      "\u201cLike the first threads of this quilt\u2026 this movement is fully woven into the fabric and history of America,\u201d Biden said. \u201cShining a light on the memory and the legacy of all the sisters and brothers, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, moms and dads, partners and friends who have lost, we've lost to this terrible disease.\u201d",

      "Biden pointed out the \u201cstigma of misinformation\u201d and failures of the U.S. government to act when the epidemic was raging, saying it \u201ccompounded pain and trauma for a community watching a generation of loved ones and friends perish.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was horribly, horribly wrong,\u201d he said.",
      "Biden highlighted the progress that\u2019s been made under his administration in the fight against HIV/AIDS and fighting the stigma of discrimination against the HIV community. He also called attention to Dr. Anthony Fauci, who attended the event, for his leading efforts to advance the fight over his career.",
      "As he prepared to leave for Africa in the evening, Biden credited former President George W.

      "Minnesota Republicans are suing to try to force a rerun of a state House race where the incumbent Democrat won by 14 votes but investigators concluded that election workers probably destroyed 20 valid absentee ballots after failing to count them",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota Republicans filed a lawsuit Monday to try to force a rerun of a state House race where the incumbent Democrat won by 14 votes \u2014 but in which investigators concluded that election workers probably destroyed 20 valid absentee ballots after failing to count them.",
      "It's a race that could determine the balance of power in the Minnesota House, where leaders from both parties are working out the details of a power-sharing agreement that currently presumes a 67-67 tie when the Legislature convenes next month. A Republican victory in a special election could shift that balance to a two-vote, 68-66 GOP majority.",
      "Democrats have a one-vote majority in the state Senate. So regardless of the outcome in the disputed race, Minnesota will be returning to some degree of divided government in 2025 after two years of full Democratic control.",
      "\u201cThe actions of Scott County elections officials constitute a serious breach of not only Minnesota Election Law, but the public trust in our electoral system,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "Democratic Rep. Brad Tabke was declared the winner last week of the swing suburban Shakopee-area District 54A race by 14 votes after a recount and the official canvass. But Scott County election officials had said earlier, after a post-election audit, that they were unable to account for 21 absentee ballots in the district southwest of Minneapolis.",
      "County Attorney Ronald Hocevar reported last Wednesday that his preliminary investigation determined that election workers most likely threw at least 20 of those absentee ballots away, and that they may have been in a paper bale that a recycler had already sent away for shredding. He wrote that they \u201cmost likely will not be recovered,\u201d and that even if they were found, it's unlikely that an unbroken chain of custody could be proven to assure that they weren't tampered with.",
      "In Minnesota, absentee voters complete their ballots, place them in a security envelope to protect their privacy, then place that envelope inside a signature envelope with identifying information on the outside so that election workers can check those ballots in. Once the counting begins, the ballots are supposed to be removed from the security envelopes and tabulated.",
      "The county attorney concluded that the 20 ballots, all from the same precinct, were properly accepted for counting on Oct. 17, but \u201cmost likely were never removed from their secrecy envelopes,\u201d and were probably still in them when those envelopes were thrown away. The investigation didn\u2019t determine what happened to the 21st ballot, which was cast in a different precinct.",
      "It\u2019s not the first time in recent years that absentee ballots have gone missing.",
      "When a small number of military ballots in Pennsylvania ended up in a trash can in 2020, President Donald Trump repeatedly seized on the case to support his claims of fraud heading into that election. After investigating, authorities found a temporary county election worker had mistakenly discarded seven military ballots in the trash and mishandled two others. The ballots were later retrieved from a garbage dumpster and counted, and the worker was fired.",
      "Minnesota House Republicans filed Monday's lawsuit on behalf of GOP candidate Aaron Paul, asking a court to declare the results invalid and Tabke's seat vacant, saying the \u201cundisputed facts\u201d make it impossible to rely on the results.",
      "The current House minority leader, Rep. Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, said a new election is the best way to protect the integrity of the process.",
      "\"We appreciate the efforts by Scott County to investigate this matter and be transparent about their findings,\u201d Demuth said in a statement.",
      "But House Democrats said they believe they will win the court challenge.",
      "\u201cRep. Brad Tabke won the election in District 54A by the count on Election Night and in the recount,\" current Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, said in a statement. \"We expect Rep. Tabke will prevail again in the election contest.\u201d",
      "Republicans also filed a lawsuit last month over a different House race, in the suburban Roseville area, where they allege the winner doesn't live in the district.

      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year",
      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year? Artificial intelligence chatbots might help, but don't expect them to do all the work or always give you the right answers.",
      "Anyone scouring the internet for Cyber Monday deals is likely going to encounter more conversational iterations of the chatbots that some retailers and e-commerce sites have built to provide shoppers with enhanced customer service.",
      "Some companies have integrated models infused with newer generative AI technologies, allowing shoppers to seek advice by asking naturally phrased questions like \u201cWhat's the best wireless speaker?\u201d",
      "Retailers hope consumers use these chatbots, which are typically called shopping assistants - as virtual companions that help them discover or compare products. Prior chatbots were mostly used for task-oriented functions such as helping customers track down online orders or return ones that didn't meet expectations.",
      "Amazon, the king of online retail, has said its customers have been questioning Rufus - the generative AI- powered shopping assistant it launched this year - for information such as whether a specific coffee maker is easy to clean, or what recommendations it has for a lawn game for a child's birthday party.",
      "And Rufus, which is available for holiday shoppers in the U.S. and some other countries, is not the only shopping assistant out there. A select number of Walmart shoppers will have access this year to a similar chatbot the nation's largest retailer is testing in a few product categories, including toys and electronics.",
      "Perplexity AI added something new to the AI chat-shopping world last month by rolling out a feature on its AI-powered search engine that enables users to ask a question like \u201cWhat's the best women's leather boots?\" and then receive specific product results that the San Francisco-based company says are not sponsored.",
      "\u201cIt has been adopted at pretty incredible scale,\u201d Mike Mallazzo, an analyst and writer at retail research media company Future Commerce, said.",
      "Retailers with websites and e-commerce companies started paying more attention to chatbots when use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence text chatbot made by the company OpenAI, went mainstream in late 2022, sparking public and business interest in the generative AI technology that powers the tool.",
      "Victoria\u2019s Secret, IKEA, Instacart and the Canadian retailer Ssense are among other companies experimenting with chatbots, some of which use technology from OpenAI.",
      "Even before the improved chatbots, online retailers were creating product recommendations based on a customer's prior purchases or search history. Amazon was at the forefront of having recommendations on its platform, so Rufus' ability to provide some is not particularly groundbreaking.",
      "But Rajiv Mehta, the vice president of search and conversational shopping at Amazon, said the company is able to offer more helpful recommendations now by programming Rufus to ask clarifying or follow-up questions. Customers are also using Rufus to look for deals, some of which are personalized, Mehta said.",
      "To be sure, chatbots are prone to hallucinations, so Rufus and most of the tools like it can get things wrong.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, wrote in a November blog post that his firm tested Rufus by requesting gaming TV recommendations. The chatbot's response included products that were not TVs. When asked for the least expensive options, Rufus came back with suggestions that weren't the cheapest, Kaziukenas said.",
      "An Associated Press reporter recently asked Rufus to give some gift recommendations for a brother. The chatbot quickly spit out a few ideas for \u201cthoughtful gifts,\" ranging from a T-shirt and a keychain with charms to a bolder suggestion: a multifunctional knife engraved with the phrase \u201cBEST BROTHER EVER.\u201d",
      "After a 5-minute written conversation, Rufus offered more tailored suggestions - a few Barcelona soccer jerseys sold by third-party sellers. But it wasn\u2019t able to say which seller offered the lowest price. When asked during another search for a price comparison on a popular skin serum, Rufus showed the product's pre-discounted price instead of its present one.",
      "\u201cRufus is constantly learning,\u201d Amazon's Mehta said during an interview.",
      "Shop AI, a chatbot that Canadian e-commerce company Shopify launched last year, can also help shoppers discover new products by asking its own questions, such as soliciting details about an intended gift recipient or features the buyer wants to avoid. Shop AI has trouble, however, recommending specific products or identifying the lowest-priced item in a product category.",
      "The limitations show the technology is still in its infancy and has a long way to go before it becomes as useful as the retail industry - and many shoppers - wish it could be.",
      "To truly transform the shopping experience, shopping assistants will \u201cneed to be deeply personalized\u201d and be able - on their own - to remember a customer\u2019s order history, product preferences and purchasing habits, consulting giant McKinsey & Company said in an August report.",
      "Amazon has noted that Rufus' answers are based on information contained in product listings, community Q&As and customer reviews, which would include the fake reviews that are used to boost or diminish sales for products on its marketplace.",
      "The large language model that powers the chatbot was also trained on the company's entire catalog and some public information on the web, Trishul Chilimbi, an Amazon vice president who oversees AI research, wrote in the electrical engineering magazine IEEE Spectrum in October.",
      "But its unclear how Amazon and other companies are weighting different training components - such as reviews - in their recommendations, or how exactly the shopping assistants come up with them, according to Nicole Greene, an analyst at management consulting firm Gartner.",
      "Perplexity AI's new shopping feature allows users to enter search queries such as \u201cbest phone case\" and to receive answers derived from various sources, including Amazon and other retailers, such as Best Buy. Perplexity also invited retailers to share data about their products and said those that do would have an increased chance of having their items recommended to shoppers.",
      "But Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, suggested in a recent interview with Fortune magazine that he didn't know how the new shopping feature recommended products to customers. But in an interview with the AP, Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko pushed back on that characterization, saying Srinivas' comment \u201cwas probably taken out of context.\u201d",
      "The context, he said, is that with generative AI technology \u201cYou can\u2019t know in advance exactly what the output will be just based off of knowing what the inputs\u201d are from the training materials.",
      "Shevelenko said retailers and brands need to know they can't have their products recommended in Perplexity's search engine because they're \u201cjamming key words\u201d into their websites or using different techniques to show up better on search results",
      "\u201cThe way you show up in an answer is by having a better product and better features,\u201d he said."

      "Even though e-commerce is now part and parcel of many people's regular routines and the holiday shopping season, Cyber Monday \u2014 a term coined in 2005 by the National Retail Federation \u2014 has become the biggest online shopping day of the year, thanks to the deals and the hype the industry has created to fuel it.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That would make it the season's \u2014 and the year's \u2014 biggest \u2014 shopping day for e-commerce.",
      "Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday night, per Adobe \u2014 reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent every minute.",
      "For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales event right after midnight Pacific time on Saturday. Target's two days of discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday.

      "Consumer spending for Cyber Week \u2014 the five major shopping days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday \u2014 provides a strong indication of how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays.",
      "Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a healthy pace.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",
      "Many economist have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing to automobiles.",
      "The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5% to 3.5% \u2014 compared to 3.9% in 2023.",
      "A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season won\u2019t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period. But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging signs for retailers.",
      "Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that discounts from Thanksgiving onward have \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d \u2014 and online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40 billion mark combined.",
      "U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2% increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That's also more than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1\u202fbillion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said. And on Saturday and Sunday, shoppers spent another $10.9 billion online, up 5.8% over last year.",
      "Adobe reported Monday that as of 6:30 p.m. ET, shoppers had spent $8.7 billion\u202fon the online shopping holiday. When the final tally is in, Adobe expects consumers will have spent between\u202f$13.2 billion\u202fand\u202f$13.5 billion\u202ffor the day, making Cyber Monday the biggest online shopping day of the year__and of all time, Adobe said.",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double digits, while in-store purchase rose a modest 0.7%.",
      "E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $4.6 million per minute \u2014 with top categories by volume including clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to Adobe. \u201cHot products\u201d included Lego sets, espresso machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care.",
      "Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the comfort of their homes.",
      "RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the Midwest.",
      "Sensormatic Solutions, which also tracks store traffic, said its preliminary analysis showed retail store traffic on Black Friday was down 8.2% compared to 2023.",
      "Grant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic Solutions, noted that in-store traffic was getting spread across multiple days since many retailers offered generous discounts before and after Black Friday.",
      "\u201cSome of the extended Black Friday promotions really ended up leading to a little bit of a softer day-of traffic than expected,\u201d Gustafson said.",
      "While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more \u201cexperience-driven spending\u201d in recent years, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic waned.",
      "Jie Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H.

      "But she said the truncated season \u2014 there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day \u2014 is making it harder for her retail customers to forecast.",
      "In fact, Carere said only four of FedEx\u2019s top 20 holiday e-commerce customers got their shipping predictions correct for the week before the Thanksgiving weekend.

      "\u201cWe stand in sorrow and solidarity with the friends and family of the people we were not able to find over the past 24 hours,\u201d Chief Warrant Officer James Koon, a search and rescue mission coordinator at Coast Guard Sector Southeast Alaska, said in a statement.",
      "The Coast Guard began the search after the Wind Walker\u2019s crew sent a Mayday call at 12:10 a.m. Sunday that the 50-foot (15-meter) boat was overturning off Point Couverden, southwest of Juneau. The Coast Guard tried to get more information as it mobilized a response, but the crew didn\u2019t answer, according to a Coast Guard press release.",
      "The state ferry Hubbard overheard the broadcast and reached the scene first, followed by a Coast Guard MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter and a response boat, according to the press release. A winter storm warning remained in effect as responders faced heavy snow, winds up to 60 mph (96 kph) and 6-foot (1.8-meter) seas.",
      "Two Coast Guard cutters \u2014 the Healy and the Douglas Denman \u2014 joined the search. Responders found seven empty cold-water immersion suits and two strobe lights but no other sign of the boat or its crew. The Healy also used underwater sonar but found no signs of the ship.",
      "The helicopter crew spotted the cold-water immersion suits from the air near Spasski Bay, located about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southwest of Point Couverden. Four of the survival suits were in the waters of the bay and three were seen on land, Coast Guard Petty Officer John Hightower said.",
      "The suits were empty, and it was not immediately clear if they had been worn, he said.",
      "The full-body suits are made of a neoprene-like material \u201cthat you can put on very quickly and easily over your clothes, and it\u2019s meant to help you survive in cold water,\u201d Hightower said. They also have a floatation device inside them, along with an inflatable pillow so a person in the water can rest their head and remain afloat.",
      "The area searched by the cutters was fairly small since they had the Wind Walker\u2019s emergency beacon GPS coordinates, Hightower said. Since the crew reported the ship was overturning, it\u2019s possible it capsized and sank.",
      "\u201cThat seems like the most likely but, you know, we try not to rule anything out since we haven\u2019t been able to confirm it ourselves,\u201d he said.",

Through several years in the post \u2014 including most of 2023 and all of 2024 \u2014 the GOP has held veto-proof majorities in each General Assembly chamber.",
      "While referencing a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in caucus leadership, Batch praised Blue on Monday for \u201cbringing forth his many years of experience gained through a historic tenure in both chambers of the General Assembly to deliver results for the people of North Carolina.\u201d",
      "Blue, who was reelected to a Wake County Senate seat last month, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a text seeking comment.",
      "In the next two-year session starting in January, Republicans will continue to hold at least 30 of the 50 Senate seats. But barring changes in an unresolved district race, House Republicans will fall just short of veto-proof control in their chamber \u2014 giving more leverage to Democratic Gov.-elect Josh Stein and his legislative allies.",
      "Batch was first elected to the House in 2018 but lost a reelection bid two years later. In early 2021, she filled a Senate vacancy and was elected again in 2022 and last month. Batch is a breast cancer survivor who has spoken out on issues involving health care and support for abortion rights.",
      "Batch said the Democratic caucus \"remains focused on creating a North Carolina where every resident can build the life they want for their families and themselves, and we are ready to work to get North Carolina back on the right track.\u201d",
      "The Senate Democratic Caucus also on Monday reelected Sen. Jay Chaudhuri of Wake County as the minority whip.",
      "Separately on Monday, the House Democratic Caucus reelected Rep. Robert Reives of Chatham County for another two-year term as minority leader. Reives joined the House in early 2014 and was elected the Democrats' leader after the 2020 elections, succeeding then-Rep. Darren Jackson."

      "A top Federal Reserve official says he is leaning toward supporting an interest rate cut when the Fed meets in two weeks but that evidence of persistent inflation before then could cause him to change that view",
      "WASHINGTON -- A top Federal Reserve official said Monday that he is leaning toward supporting an interest rate cut when the Fed meets in two weeks but that evidence of persistent inflation before then could cause him to change that view.",
      "Speaking at George Washington University, Christopher Waller, a key member of the Fed's Board of Governors, said he was confident that inflation is headed lower and that the central bank will likely keep reducing its key rate, which affects many consumer and business loans.",
      "But he noted that there's a risk that inflation \u201cmay be getting stuck above\u201d the Fed's 2% target, which would support an argument for keeping the Fed's rate unchanged this month.",
      "\u201cAt present, I lean toward supporting a cut to the policy rate at our December meeting,\" Waller said in his remarks to a conference held by the American Institute for Economic Research. \"But that decision will depend on whether data that we will receive before then surprises to the upside and alters my forecast for the path of inflation.\u201d",
      "Waller's caution reflects a notable shift in the economic and inflation outlook in the past month or so. Growth in consumer spending and the broader economy was robust in the July-September quarter. In addition, inflation picked up in October after having slowed for most of this year.",
      "And Donald Trump's election victory has raised the prospect of widespread tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, both of which could elevate inflation. Some economists say they think the Fed might decide to cut its rate more slowly to allow time to evaluate the effects of Trump's policies.",
      "With inflation having steadily fallen from its peak in 2022, the Fed reduced its key rate by a half-point in September and by a quarter-point in November. And it signaled in September that it expected to announce another quarter-point cut later this month. Yet inflation has remained above the Fed's target level, clouding the Fed's next step.",
      "In October, \u201ccore\u201d inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, accelerated a bit. It rose 2.8% compared with a year earlier, up from 2.7% in September.",
      "Waller stressed that if future economic reports showed inflation or growth deviating from the Fed's expected paths, he could favor keeping rates unchanged this month.",
      "\u201cIf the data we receive between today and the next meeting surprise in a way that suggests our forecasts of slowing inflation and a moderating but still-solid economy are wrong, then I will be supportive of holding the policy rate constant,\u201d he said.",
      "Even so, Waller said the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate is high enough to restrict economic growth and inflation and so a quarter-point rate cut wouldn't involve much risk of reigniting inflation.",
      "\u201cCutting again will only mean that we aren\u2019t pressing on the brake pedal quite as hard,\u201d he said.",
      "In his speech, Waller acknowledged some frustration over the recent persistence of inflation.",
      "\u201cI feel like an MMA fighter who keeps getting inflation in a choke hold, waiting for it to tap out, yet it keeps slipping out of my grasp at the last minute,\u201d he said. \"But let me assure you that submission is inevitable \u2014 inflation isn\u2019t getting out of the octagon.\u201d",
      "In recent remarks, other Fed officials have also suggested that they haven\u2019t yet made a final decision on whether to support a rate cut this month.",
      "Earlier Monday, Raphael Bostic, president of the Fed\u2019s Atlanta branch, said he was \u201ckeeping my options open\u201d when asked whether he favored a rate cut in two weeks."

      "Struggling chipmaker Intel says in a surprise announcement that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired",
      "Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, the struggling chipmaker said Monday in a surprise announcement.",
      "Two company executives, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, will act as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a replacement for Gelsinger, who also stepped down from the company's board.",
      "The departure of Gelsinger, whose career spanned more than 40 years, underscores the turmoil at Intel. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Gelsinger started at Intel in 1979 and was its first chief technology officer. He returned to the company as chief executive in 2021.",
      "Gelsinger said his exit was \u201cbittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.\u201d",
      "Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer at Intel. Holthaus was appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, which includes the client computing, data center and AI groups.",
      "Frank Yeary, independent chair of Intel's board, will become interim executive chair.",
      "\u201cPat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021,\u201d Yeary said in a statement. \"As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.\u201d",
      "Gelsinger's departure comes as Intel\u2019s financial woes have been piling up. The company posted a $16.6 billion loss and halted its dividend in the most recent quarter, and its shares have fallen by about 60% since he took over as CEO. Gelsinger announced plans in August to slash 15% of its huge workforce \u2014 or about 15,000 jobs \u2014 as part of cost-cutting efforts to to save $10 billion in 2025.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s ascendance, meanwhile, was cemented earlier this month when it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",
      "Unlike some of rivals, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them. Under Gelsinger, the company has been working to build up its foundry business making semiconductors in the U.S. designed by other firms, in a bid to compete with rivals such as market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or TSMC.",
      "Intel has benefited from tens of billions of dollars that the administration has pledged to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness.",
      "After taking over as CEO, Gelsinger unveiled plans to build a $20 billion chipmaking facility in central Ohio, and poured billions more into expanding in Europe, where leaders were also worried about dependence on Asia.",
      "The Biden administration had said it would give Intel up to $8.5 billion in federal funding for semiconductor plants around the country, but last week it trimmed that amount, according to three people familiar with the grant who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Shares of the Santa Clara, California, company jumped in early trading Monday but ended the day down 0.5%.",

      "Investigators conducted their first search warrant when Naresh Bhatt was home with the couple's baby and discovered blood in the bedroom as well as the bathroom, Lugo said.",

      "Chief Public Defender Tracey Lenox did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment on the new charges against Bhatt, who is already in jail awaiting trial on separate charges in the case.",
      "The investigation has drawn international attention to the small northern Virginia community, where homicide cases are rare. The disappearance of Mamta Bhatt, a pediatric nurse, spurred community members and her family in Nepal to band together to try to figure out what happened.",
      "They posted on social media, hosted community events and held a rally. Within days, community members began to apply public pressure on her husband.",

      "Years after COVID-19 disrupted American schools, nearly every state is still struggling with attendance",
      "SAN CARLOS, Ariz. -- After missing 40 days of school last year, Tommy Betom, 10, is on track this year for much better attendance. The importance of showing up has been stressed repeatedly at school \u2014 and at home.",
      "When he went to school last year, he often came home saying the teacher was picking on him and other kids were making fun of his clothes. But Tommy's grandmother Ethel Marie Betom, who became one of his caregivers after his parents split, said she told him to choose his friends carefully and to behave in class.",
      "He needs to go to school for the sake of his future, she told him.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have everything,\u201d said Betom, an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Tommy attends school on the tribe's reservation in southeastern Arizona. \u201cYou have everything. You have running water in the house, bathrooms and a running car.\u201d",
      "A teacher and a truancy officer also reached out to Tommy's family to address his attendance. He was one of many. Across the San Carlos Unified School District, 76% of students were chronically absent during the 2022-2023 school year, meaning they missed 10% or more of the school year.",
      "___",
      "This story is part of a collaboration on chronic absenteeism among Native American students between The Associated Press and ICT, a news outlet that covers Indigenous issues.",
      "____",
      "Years after COVID-19 disrupted American schools, nearly every state is still struggling with attendance. But attendance has been worse for Native American students \u2014 a disparity that existed before the pandemic and has since grown, according to data collected by The Associated Press.",
      "Out of 34 states with data available for the 2022-2023 school year, half had absenteeism rates for Native American and Alaska Native students that were at least 9 percentage points higher than the state average.",
      "Many schools serving Native students have been working to strengthen connections with families, who often struggle with higher rates of illness and poverty. Schools also must navigate distrust dating back to the U.S. government's campaign to break up Native American culture, language and identity by forcing children into abusive boarding schools.",
      "History \"may cause them to not see the investment in a public school education as a good use of their time,\u201d said Dallas Pettigrew, director of Oklahoma University's Center for Tribal Social Work and a member of the Cherokee Nation.",
      "The San Carlos school system recently introduced care centers that partner with hospitals, dentists and food banks to provide services to students at multiple schools. The work is guided by cultural success coaches \u2014 school employees who help families address challenges that keep students from coming to school.",
      "Nearly 100% of students in the district are Native and more than half of families have incomes below the federal poverty level. Many students come from homes that deal with alcoholism and drug abuse, Superintendent Deborah Dennison said.",
      "Students miss school for reasons ranging from anxiety to unstable living conditions, said Jason Jones, a cultural success coach at San Carlos High School and an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Acknowledging their fears, grief and trauma helps him connect with students, he said.",
      "\u201cYou feel better, you do better,\u201d Jones said. \"That\u2019s our job here in the care center is to help the students feel better.\u201d",
      "In the 2023-2024 school year, the chronic absenteeism rate in the district fell from 76% to 59% \u2014 an improvement Dennison attributes partly to efforts to address their communities' needs.",
      "\u201cAll these connections with the community and the tribe are what\u2019s making a difference for us and making the school a system that fits them rather than something that has been forced upon them, like it has been for over a century of education in Indian Country,\u201d said Dennison, a member of the Navajo Nation.",
      "In three states \u2014 Alaska, Nebraska, and South Dakota \u2014 the majority of Native American and Alaska Native students were chronically absent. In some states, it has continued to worsen, even while improving slightly for other students, as in Arizona, where chronic absenteeism for Native students rose from 22% in 2018-2019 to 45% in 2022-2023.",
      "AP's analysis does not include data on schools managed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Education, which are not run by traditional districts. Less than 10% of Native American students attend BIE schools.",
      "At Algodones Elementary School, which serves a handful of Native American pueblos along New Mexico's Upper Rio Grande, about two-thirds of students are chronically absent.",
      "The communities were hit hard by COVID-19, with devastating impacts on elders. Since schools reopened, students have been slow to return. Excused absences for sick days are still piling up \u2014 in some cases, Principal Rosangela Montoya suspects, students are stressed about falling behind academically.",
      "Staff and tribal liaisons have been analyzing every absence and emphasizing connections with parents. By 10 a.m., telephone calls go out to the homes of absent students. Next steps include in-person meetings with those students\u2019 parents.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s illness. There\u2019s trauma,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cA lot of our grandparents are the ones raising the children so that the parents can be working.\u201d",
      "About 95% of Algodones' students are Native American, and the school strives to affirm their identity. It doesn't open on four days set aside for Native American ceremonial gatherings, and students are excused for absences on other cultural days as designated by the nearby pueblos.",
      "For Jennifer Tenorio, it makes a difference that the school offers classes in the family\u2019s native language of Keres. She speaks Keres at home, but says that\u2019s not always enough to instill fluency.",
      "Tenorio said her two oldest children, now in their 20s, were discouraged from speaking Keres when enrolled in the federal Head Start educational program \u2014 a system that now promotes native language preservation \u2014 and they struggled academically.",
      "\u201cIt was sad to see with my own eyes,\u201d said Tenorio, a single parent and administrative assistant who has used the school's food bank. \u201cIn Algodones, I saw a big difference to where the teachers were really there for the students, and for all the kids, to help them learn.\u201d",
      "Over a lunch of strawberry milk and enchiladas on a recent school day, her 8-year-old son Cameron Tenorio said he likes math and wants to be a policeman.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s inspired,\u201d Tenorio said. \u201cHe tells me every day what he learns.\u201d",
      "In Arizona, Rice Intermediate School Principal Nicholas Ferro said better communication with families, including Tommy Betom's, has helped improve attendance. Since many parents are without working phones, he said, that often means home visits.",
      "Lillian Curtis said she has been impressed by Rice Intermediate's student activities on family night. Her granddaughter, Brylee Lupe, 10, missed 10 days of school by mid-October last year but had missed just two days by the same time this year.",
      "\u201cThe kids always want to go \u2014 they are anxious to go to school now. And Brylee is much more excited,\u201d said Curtis, who takes care of her grandchildren.",
      "Curtis said she tells Brylee that skipping school is not an option.",
      "\u201cI just told her that you need to be in school, because who is going to be supporting you?\u201d Curtis said. \u201cYou've got to do it on your own. You got to make something of yourself.\u201d",
      "The district has made gains because it is changing the perception of school and what it can offer, said Dennison, the superintendent. Its efforts have helped not just with attendance but also morale, especially at the high school, she said.",
      "\u201cEducation was a weapon for the U.S. government back in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cWe work to decolonize our school system.\u201d",

      "China has announced a ban on exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications",
      "BANGKOK -- China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after the Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications.",
      "The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof.",
      "\u201cChina has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese companies, and malicious suppression of China\u2019s technological progress,\" Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine briefing Tuesday.",
      "\"I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction against Chinese companies,\u201d Lin said.",
      "China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite.",
      "Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report.",
      "The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials.",
      "China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology.",
      "After the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a so-called \u201centity list\u201d subject to strict export controls, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China\u2019s \u201crights and interests.\u201d Nearly all of the companies affected by Washington's latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.",
      "Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security.",
      "China's government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China\u2019s fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology.",
      "Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology.",
      "The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, \u201cabuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies.",
      "\u201cU.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China\u2019s related industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,\u201d it said.",
      "The U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year.",
      "The U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources.",
      "The export restrictions have had a mixed impact on prices for those critical minerals, with the price of antimony more than doubling this year to over $25,000 per ton. Prices for gallium, germanium and graphite also have mostly risen.",

      "Missouri\u2019s governor has denied clemency for Christopher Collings, an inmate who is scheduled to be executed Tuesday for sexually assaulting and killing a 9-year-old girl",
      "ST. LOUIS -- Missouri\u2019s governor on Monday denied clemency for Christopher Collings, a death row inmate facing execution for sexually assaulting and killing a 9-year-old girl and leaving her body in a sinkhole.",
      "Collings, 49, is scheduled to receive a single injection of pentobarbital at 6 p.m. CST Tuesday at the state prison in Bonne Terre, Missouri, for the 2007 killing of fourth-grader Rowan Ford. It would be the 23rd execution in the U.S. this year and the fourth in Missouri.",
      "\u201cMr. Collings has received every protection afforded by the Missouri and United States Constitutions, and Mr. Collings\u2019 conviction and sentence remain for his horrendous and callous crime,\u201d Republican Gov. Mike Parson said in a statement.",
      "Parson\u2019s decision likely sealed Collings\u2019 fate. Earlier Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an appeal on behalf of Collings, without comment. No additional appeals are planned, Collings' attorney, Jeremy Weis, said.",
      "Parson's decision was not unexpected \u2014 a former sheriff, Parson has overseen 12 previous executions without granting clemency. Weis said Parson has allowed other executions to proceed for inmates with innocence claims, intellectual disabilities and for men who were \u201creformed and remorseful\u201d for their crimes.",
      "\u201cIn each case of redemption, the Governor has ignored the evidence and sought vengeance,\u201d Weis said in a statement.",
      "Collings confessed to killing Rowan, a child who referred to him as \u201cUncle Chris\u201d after Collings lived for several months with the girl\u2019s family in tiny Stella, Missouri. Rowan was killed on Nov. 3, 2007. Her body was found in a sinkhole outside of town six days later. She had been strangled.",
      "The clemency petition said an abnormality of Collings\u2019 brain causes him to suffer from \u201cfunctional deficits in awareness, judgment and deliberation, comportment, appropriate social inhibition, and emotional regulation.\u201d It also noted that he suffered from frequent and often violent abuse as a child.",
      "\u201cThe result was a damaged human being with no guidance on how to grow into a functioning adult,\u201d the petition stated.",
      "The petition also challenged the fairness of executing Collings when another man charged in the crime, Rowan\u2019s stepfather, David Spears, also confessed but was allowed to plead to lesser crimes. Spears served more than seven years in prison before his release in 2015.",
      "Collings told authorities that he drank heavily and smoked marijuana with Spears and another man in the hours before the attack on Rowan, according to court records. Collings said he picked up the sleeping child from her bed, took her to the camper where he lived and assaulted her there. He said he strangled the child with a rope when he realized she recognized him.",
      "Collings told investigators that he took the girl's body to a sinkhole. He burned the rope used in the attack, along with the clothes he was wearing and his bloodstained mattress, prosecutors said.",
      "Spears also implicated himself in the crimes, according to court documents and the clemency petition. A transcript of Spears\u2019 statement to police, cited in the petition, said he told police that Collings handed him a cord and that he killed Rowan.",
      "\u201cI choke her with it. I realize she\u2019s gone. She\u2019s ... she\u2019s really gone,\u201d Spears said, according to the transcript. It was Spears who led authorities to the sinkhole where her body was found, according to court documents.",
      "No phone listing could be found for Spears.",
      "The Supreme Court appeal challenged the reliability of the key law enforcement witness at Collings\u2019 trial, a police chief from a neighboring town who had four AWOL convictions while serving in the Army. Failure to disclose details about that criminal history at trial violated Collings\u2019 right to due process, Weis contended.",
      "\u201cHis credibility was really at the heart of the entire case against Mr. Collings,\" Weis said in an interview.",
      "Three men have been executed in Missouri this year \u2014 Brian Dorsey on April 9, David Hosier on June 11 and Marcellus Williams on Sept. 24. Only Alabama, with six, and Texas, with five, have performed more executions than Missouri in 2024."

      "Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said postal workers processed more than 99 million general election ballots \u2014 making extra deliveries and collections and working to identify problems that could lead to incorrect deliveries. They also ensured ballots were delivered even after hurricanes brought devastation  to parts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina just weeks before Election Day, he said.",
      "Almost 99.9% of general election mail ballots were delivered to election officials within a week and 97.7% of them were delivered within three days, postal officials said. The three-day return rate was similar to 2020 but slightly lower than the rate during the 2022 mid-term elections.",
      "There were some notable problems even with the overall strong performance.",
      "Election offices in California, Montana, Louisiana, New Mexico and elsewhere reported receiving completed ballots in the mail that should have gone to other states. The California Secretary of State\u2019s office, for example, said about 150 mail ballots from Oregon voters were misdirected to California before being sent back. The Postal Service report did not address those issues.",
      "State election officials warned ahead of the election that problems with the nation\u2019s mail delivery system threatened to disenfranchise voters after problems surfaced during the primary season. At the time, some mailed ballots were postmarked on time but received too late to be counted and some properly addressed ballots were returned as undeliverable.",

      "Luxury car maker Jaguar has unveiled its new electric concept car and, like a recent controversial teaser video, it has divided opinion.",
      "Some on social media said the new Type 00 car was \"exciting\" and \"absolutely stunning\", while others called it \"rubbish\" and told Jaguar's designers to \"go back to the drawing board\".",
      "The carmaker, which is embarking on the biggest change in its history, announced a new logo and released a so-called \"social media tease\" last month, ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand.",
      "Many critics pointed out that the promotional video did not feature an actual car but the firm was also praised by some for its bold new approach.",
      "Last month, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) stopped selling new Jaguar cars in the UK ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand in 2026.",
      "Sales of its cars have been plummeting in recent years, and some have argued that as its traditional, heritage image does not seem to be working, the rebranding is a gamble with a limited downside.",
      "Following the deluge of publicity following last month's teaser video, Jaguar urged people to \"trust and reserve judgement\" over the rebrand of the business, which has a history dating back more than a century.",
      "The Type 00 model unveiled at a Miami art fair is a concept car and so will not go into production for sale to the public.",
      "However, it gives a pointer to the direction of the brand's new models, which are expected to cost in excess of \u00a3100,000 when they go on sale.",

      "\"I wanted something more futuristic,\" he told the BBC. \"I mean, Jaguar have been saying they will copy nothing, but there's quite a bit of other concept cars in that new Jag.\"",
      "'Too big'",
      "Beatrix Keim, director at the Center of Automotive Research, said that Jaguar's concept car was \"too big, too unreal\".",
      "\"This is not the way to go,\" she said, given that there are already big cars in the market and \"electric cars cannot only be for the rich\".",
      "\"Of course, Jaguar is a luxury brand,\" she added. \"But I don't think that this is the direction which Jaguar at current point of time needs, because it's losing out on volume as well. And this is not a volume car.\u201d",
      "Amanda Stretton, a racing driver and motoring journalist, also agreed the Jaguar concept car was too big.",
      "\"It's an absolute nonsense,\" she said. \"It needs to be shrunk by about 50% to be practical.\"",
      "Should you pay more for parking if you have a big car?",
      "But Andy Palmer, a former boss of Aston Martin and Nissan's ex-chief operating officer, said Jaguar needed to change as it had been \"failing as a brand for a long time now\".",
      "He called the new design \"a brave change of direction\" although he agreed it was \"huge\".",
      "\"The rhetoric around electric cars has to be one of how you move the cars to being more affordable,\" he said. \"Jaguar is an outlier.\"",
      "Stretton also said Jaguar was going in the \"wrong direction\" on price.",
      "\"The market for cars in excess of \u00a3100,000 is not enormous. So Jaguar\u2019s trying to break into a market that's already tightly fought.\"",
      "May said Jaguar cars had traditionally been \"very reasonably priced compared with, for example, Aston Martin\".",
      "\"So I'd like to see something more like half the price that they're toting at the moment.\"",
      "JLR said the decision to stop selling new Jaguar cars in the UK last month was a deliberate move to \"create some breathing space\" before unveiling its new look.",

      "Judge Kathaleen McCormick upheld her previous decision from January, in which she argued that board members were too heavily influenced by Mr Musk.",
      "Reacting to the ruling, Mr Musk wrote on X: \"Shareholders should control company votes, not judges.\"",
      "Tesla vowed to appeal against the ruling, saying the decision was \"wrong\".",

      "He has used his platform to make his views known on a vast array of topics, and his status seems set to climb higher still following Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election.

    "story": [
      "House prices grew at the fastest annual pace for two years in November, according to the latest survey from Nationwide.",
      "The lender said the price of a typical UK home rose by 3.7% last month compared to a year earlier, with property values close to a record high.",
      "It said the acceleration in house price growth was \"surprising, since affordability remains stretched by historic standards\".",
      "Housing experts predict the market will see the number of sales increase over the next few months, ahead of changes to stamp duty due to take place in April.",
      "House prices rose by 1.2% between October and November, Nationwide said, the biggest month-on-month increase since March 2022.",
      "The average property now costs \u00a3268,144, according to the building society, close to the record high of \u00a3273,751 reached in August 2022.",
      "Nationwide noted that the housing market had remained \"relatively resilient\" in recent months, with the number of mortgages approved at near pre-pandemic levels.",
      "Mortgage approvals in October hit the highest monthly level since August 2022, according to Bank of England figures released last week.",
      "Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said low levels of unemployment combined with pay increases that were outstripping inflation had helped to \"underpin\" the housing market.",
      "Stamp duty",
      "In the Budget in October, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that reduced stamp duty rates in England and Northern Ireland would end in April next year.",
      "Some housing market analysts said this announcement was behind the big rise in prices last month. However, Mr Gardner said it was \"unlikely\" this had been the case \"since the majority of mortgage applications commenced before the Budget announcement\".",
      "The changes will mean that house buyers will start paying stamp duty on properties over \u00a3125,000, instead of over \u00a3250,000 at the moment.",
      "First-time buyers currently pay no stamp duty on homes up to \u00a3425,000, but this will drop to \u00a3300,000 in April.",
      "Nationwide said it expected a jump in house sales in the first three months of 2025 as people tried to beat the deadline, followed by a decline in activity in the following few months.",
      "Overall, Mr Gardner said he expected the housing market to strengthen gradually as consumers' spending power was boosted by lower interest rates and higher pay.",
      "However, Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that with prices near record highs and mortgage rates remaining \"relatively high\", there was a \"a growing chance that affordability raises its ugly head again\".",
      "Mortgage rates",
      "Mortgage rates started falling in the summer after the Bank of England began cutting its key interest rate.",
      "However, mortgage rates have edged up in recent weeks on expectations that the Bank will not cut rates as quickly as had been previously expected.",
      "In addition, there are still millions of people who are set to see their mortgage repayments increase over the next few years, as their current fixed-rate deals come to an end.",
      "Last week, the Bank of England estimated that about 4.4 million mortgage holders are expected to see payments rise by 2027.",
      "It said a typical owner-occupier coming off a fixed rate in the next two years would see their monthly mortgage repayments increase by around \u00a3146.",
      "According to financial information website Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate is currently 5.52%, while the average five-year fixed rate is 5.28%.",
      "To get over the problem of mortgage affordability, an increasing number of homebuyers are taking out deals over longer-than-usual time periods.",
      "Ultra-long, or extended, mortgages have become more popular as people aim to spread the cost of buying a house.",
      "More than a million mortgages have been issued in the past three years which homebuyers are set to still be repaying into pension age.",

      "In 2016, celebrity chef Nigella Lawson was named as brand ambassador.",
      "\u201cTyphoo is such an iconic brand,\u201d said Supreme chief executive Sandy Chadha. The company said the decision to buy it was a mix of \"sound business rationale and personal affinity\".",
      "It added that the deal was part of Supreme\u2019s strategy to branch out into other areas. Currently the company works with soft drinks, gym supplements and multivitamin gummy brands, as well as non-food items such as batteries and home lighting. It also manufactures sports nutrition and wellness and soft drinks, and also has its own sales websites to sell direct to customers.",
      "Supreme distributes to stores including B&M, Home Bargains, Sainsbury's, Tesco, The Range and Poundland, as well as HM Prison and Probation Service.",
      "Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Supreme had bagged a bargain by buying the firm out of administration, and that now \u201cit\u2019s highly likely that Supreme will want to steam ahead and find efficiencies to cut costs and try and coax the company back to profit\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt has loyal custom it can build on, but also will spy new opportunities given tea\u2019s wellness image to tie into the ambitions of its supplements and multivitamin arm,\u201d she added.",
      "Typhoo fell into administration after its pre-tax losses rose from \u00a39.6m to \u00a338m. Its sales fell from \u00a333.7m to \u00a325.3m, according to its latest results which covered the year to the end of September 2023.",
      "Its debts became more than the value of its assets, and costs related to a break-in at its Wirral plant added to its woes.",
      "But Supreme said buying the company was a \"significant step\" and that Typhoo would \"thrive\" because of the brand loyalty customers had to the tea brand.",
      "Although priced at the cheaper end of the tea market, and despite a rebrand attempt, Typhoo had been suffering from what analysts say is a wider downturn in sales of black tea.",
      "A cuppa remains a daily staple for many in Britain, but competition from the likes of coffee, soft drinks and herbal tea have eaten in to sales.",
      "However, despite many people cutting back on living costs as prices rise, Typhoo remained one of the biggest names in tea along with PG Tips, Tetley and Yorkshire Tea.",

    "story": [
      "The boss of car-making giant Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, has quit with immediate effect following a boardroom clash.",
      "His abrupt exit from the company - which owns brands including Vauxhall, Jeep, Fiat, Peugeot and Chrysler - comes two months after Stellantis issued a profit warning.",
      "Last week, the firm also announced plans to close its Vauxhall van-making factory in Luton, putting about 1,100 jobs at risk.",
      "Before his resignation, Mr Tavares was one of the most powerful people in the global motor industry.",
      "In a statement announcing Mr Tavares' departure, Henri de Castries, Stellantis\u2019 senior independent director said: \"Stellantis\u2019 success since its creation has been rooted in a perfect alignment between the reference shareholders, the board and the chief executive.",
      "\"However, in recent weeks different views have emerged which have resulted in the board and the chief executive coming to today\u2019s decision.\"",
      "Mr Tavares had a reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter.",
      "He made his name at Renault, working with the colourful and controversial chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, before taking the top job at PSA Group.",
      "At the time, the French group was close to bankruptcy. He was credited with turning it around before orchestrating a merger with Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis in 2021, creating a global giant.",
      "\"He was known for being able to turn around companies that were troubled,\" Hans Greimel, Asia editor at Automotive News, told the BBC.",
      "However, Mr Tavares\u2019 position has been undermined recently by a dramatic fall in sales and profits at the company.",
      "\"Critics would say he was just cost-cutting too much and delaying products and also hurting quality,\" said Mr Greimel.",
      "In September, Stellantis had issued a profit warning after it reported a sharp drop in sales in North America.",
      "Dealers found themselves struggling to shift a glut of unsold vehicles, which customers simply didn\u2019t want to buy.",
      "The company was criticised for producing too many cars of the wrong type, failing to adapt to changing customer tastes and losing ground to more dynamic rivals.",
      "Prof David Bailey from the Birmingham Business School, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that while there is \u201chuge turmoil in the car industry generally\u201d Stellantis has its own \u201cparticular problems\".",
      "He said: \u201cWhat\u2019s really, really driving that, I think, is the situation in North America where they\u2019ve had appalling results, a very dated product line-up, rising inventories and slipping market share as a result of which all the stakeholders involved \u2013 suppliers, dealers, workers, investors  - are deeply unhappy.",
      "\"I think that has penetrated the board and made his position untenable.\u201d",
      "Five ways to persuade more people to buy electric cars",
      "Vauxhall closure set to have '\u00a3310m impact on Luton'",
      "Stellantis' share price has fallen by 40% since the start of this year, a far worse performance than its rivals. Following Mr Tavares' departure on Monday, it fell further, down more than 9%.",
      "Mr Tavares already agreed to step down in 2026, rather than extending his contract \u2013 a move that arguably weakened his position significantly.",
      "Stellantis said it now expects to appoint a new boss by the middle of next year.",
      "In the meantime, it will set up a new interim executive committee, headed by the firm's chair John Elkann who is a member of the powerful Agnelli family of Italian industrialists.",
      "Mr Elkann controls a significant voting stake in the group on behalf of his family.",
      "He is the one currently leading the search for Mr Tavares\u2019 successor and his views will be crucial in shaping the future of the automotive giant.",
      "Mr Tavares frequently made headlines in the UK by casting doubt over the future of Vauxhall operations, linking it to issues such as Brexit and government plans to force carmakers to build more electric cars.",
      "It is not yet clear whether his departure will affect the planned closure of Stellantis' Luton plant.",
      "Stellantis's Vauxhall plant in Luton currently builds petrol and diesel vans and had been due to start making its medium-sized Vivaro electric van from 2025, before the decision to close it.",
      "The company is now planning to combine its electric van production at its other UK plant in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire.",
      "In Europe, Stellantis has suffered the same fate as many other manufacturers \u2013 coming under pressure from Chinese rivals at a time when take-up of electric vehicles has been more sluggish than expected.",
      "A tie-up with the China's Leapmotor may reap dividends, but is in its early stages.",
      "On what the change at the top means for Luton, Prof Bailey said: \"I think everything is up in the air. Whether or not that could be reversed I don\u2019t know. One would hope but I suspect that that has gone sadly.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think there are any guarantees about the future whatsoever of Stellantis\u2019s operations in the UK.\""

    "title": "Five ways to persuade more people to buy electric cars",
    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:20:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Demand for electric cars is lower than expected, the industry says. What might help to boost sales?",
    "story": [
      "The government is facing a backlash from car manufacturers, who claim that current rules designed to promote electric vehicles are too harsh.",
      "They say consumer demand for electric cars has fallen far short of what was expected, meaning they are struggling to sell enough.",
      "Ford insists this was a factor in its recent decision to cut 800 UK jobs.",
      "Vauxhall's owner Stellantis is to close its van-making plant in Luton - partly, it says, because of the new rules.",
      "So what could be done to encourage more consumers to buy electric?",
      "1. Subsidise the cost",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) are generally more expensive to buy than their petrol or diesel equivalents. This is partly because they still represent a relatively small proportion of cars being built, so economies of scale \u2013 when the cost comes down the more you build \u2013 have not yet properly kicked in.",
      "The government already offers some subsidies to make EVs cheaper. They attract a low rate of company car tax, for example. Salary sacrifice schemes allow workers to lease cars cheaply through their employers, using their untaxed income, which can offer significant savings.",
      "But since the abolition of the plug-in grant for cars in 2022, there has not been a similar incentive for people who cannot get a car through their company. People within the industry believe that should change.",
      "Automotive journalist Quentin Willson, who now fronts the campaign group FairCharge, thinks the government should consider \u201cinterest free loans on used electric vehicles for lower income drivers and halve the VAT on new cars\u201d. This, he suggests, could be funded by abandoning the current freeze on fuel duty.",
      "2. Make cheaper electric cars",
      "The price of electric cars is coming down, partly due to cheaper battery packs. Despite sharp fluctuations in the value of metals used to make them, such as lithium and cobalt, battery pack prices have fallen by about 70% since 2015.",
      "This has helped reduce the price gap between electric and conventional cars. Earlier this year, Stellantis began offering the electric version of its Frontera model at the same price as the petrol hybrid model.",
      "However, that doesn\u2019t mean it is easy to find a low-budget electric car. There is a shortage of truly cheap options on the market.",
      "That is partly because a number of manufacturers have preferred to focus on more expensive and potentially more profitable models. But as Roger Atkins, founder of the Electric Vehicles Outlook consultancy, puts it, \u201ccars that cost \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000 are not the kind of cars everyone can buy\u201d.",
      "However, change is around the corner. The Dacia Spring went on sale in the UK a few weeks ago, with a starting price of \u00a314,995. The newly launched Leapmotor T03 costs very little more, while Chinese giant BYD has said it will bring a version of its super-budget Seagull model to the UK next year.",
      "Vauxhall owner to close Luton factory",
      "Ford calls for incentives to buy electric cars as backlash grows",
      "3. Cut out the confusion",
      "The government says the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2030 \u2013 but will it?",
      "Plans to force conventional cars off the market were originally meant to take effect in 2040, under plans introduced by Theresa May's government. But the target was brought forward to 2030 under Boris Johnson, then delayed to 2035 under Rishi Sunak.",
      "People within the industry claim the changing target has sent out mixed messages and confused consumers, leading some people to delay buying an electric car until the situation becomes clearer.",
      "According to Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of electric charging guide Zapmap, many drivers are \u201cconfused about dates, concerned on costs and have questions about charging.\u201d She says \u201ca consistent factual communication programme\" is needed, supported by government.",
      "4. Cut VAT on public charging points",
      "Although the cost of using public charging points can vary widely depending on the provider and the charging speed you choose, public chargers are usually more expensive than charging at home.",
      "This is partly due to tax. An EV owner charging a car on their drive will pay 5% VAT on the electricity they consume. But if they use a public charger they will pay 20%. People who are unable to charge at home are left with no choice but to pay the higher rate.",
      "The industry, EV advocates and even a House of Lords committee have called for the public rate to be reduced to 5%",
      "Consultant Roger Atkins claims the current policy is \u201cdivisive\u201d, because it \u201cfavours better-off people who can charge at home on their driveways\u201d.",
      "5. Sort out the public charging network",
      "Read any survey of potential buyers\u2019 attitudes towards electric cars, and concerns about charging infrastructure will be at or near the top. People worry about whether they will be able to find a charger at a busy service station, or in a rural area.",
      "The number of charging points is growing. According to ZapMap, as of October this year, there were 71,459 charging points across the UK, at 36,060 locations. This was a 38% increase on the year before.",
      "But not everyone is happy. Complaints from existing owners struggling to find a charging point, having to queue for a long time or arriving to find it broken are not hard to find.",
      "As more EVs come onto the roads, many more charging points will be needed. The government wants 300,000 in place by 2030 \u2013 but the current rate of expansion is not fast enough to reach it.",
      "Part of the blame appears to lie with local authorities, who are responsible for granting planning permission for new rapid charging hubs. According to Roger Atkins, the process simply takes too long.",
      "Simon Smith, of charging firm Instavolt agrees that red tape is a problem. He thinks that difficulties getting grid connections for rapid charging stations is also a \"critical barrier\" to expanding the network.",
      "\"We need greater support to address planning delays, local council resistance and grid connectivity challenges\", he says."

      "Mel was horrified when she was forced to give a client oral sex without a condom, when she knew a sexually transmitted infection (STI) was going round the brothel. But she felt she had no option.",
      "\u201cMy choice was either to spread the disease, or make no money.\u201d",
      "She had become an escort when she was 23 - she needed money, and quickly started earning beyond expectations. She thought she had struck gold, but the experience with the STI brought her sharply back to earth.",
      "Mel will now be able to refuse any client or sexual act she feels uncomfortable with - meaning she could have handled that situation differently.",
      "\u201cI could have pointed the finger at my madam [employer] and said: \u2018You're violating these terms and this is how you should treat me.\u2019 I would have been legally protected.\u201d",
      "Belgium\u2019s decision to change the law was the result of months of protests in 2022, prompted by the lack of state support during the Covid pandemic.",
      "One of those at the forefront was Victoria, president of the Belgian Union of Sex Workers (UTSOPI) and previously an escort for 12 years.",
      "For her, it was a personal fight. Victoria regards prostitution as a social service, with sex being only about 10% of what she does.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s giving people attention, listening to their stories, eating cake with them, dancing to waltz music,\u201d she explains. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about loneliness.\u201d",
      "But the illegality of her job before 2022 raised significant challenges. She worked in unsafe conditions, with no choice over her clients and her agency taking a big cut of her earnings.",
      "In fact, Victoria says she was raped by a client who had become obsessed with her.",
      "She went to a police station, where she says the female officer was \u201cso hard\u201d on her.",
      "\"She told me sex workers can't be raped. She made me feel it was my fault, because I did that job.\u201d Victoria left the station crying.",
      "Every sex worker we spoke to told us that at some point they had been pressured to do something against their will.",
      "Because of that, Victoria fiercely believes this new law will improve their lives.",
      "\u201cIf there is no law and your job is illegal, there are no protocols to help you. This law gives people the tools to make us safer.\u201d",
      "Pimps who control sex work will be allowed to operate legally under the new law - provided they follow strict rules. Anyone who has been convicted of a serious crime will not be allowed to employ sex workers.",
      "\u201cI think many businesses will have to shut down, because a lot of employers have a criminal record,\u201d says Kris Reekmans. He and his wife Alexandra run a massage parlour on Love Street in the small town of Bekkevoort.",

      "Kris and his wife employ 15 sex workers, and pride themselves on treating them with respect, protecting them and paying them good salaries.",
      "\u201cI hope the bad employers will be shut out and the good people, who want to do this profession honestly, will stay - and the more the better,\u201d he says.",
      "Erin Kilbride from Human Rights Watch is of similar mind - and says, by putting restrictions on employers, the new law will significantly \u201ccut away at the power they have over sex workers\u201d.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s about not being outside in the freezing weather and having sex with strangers who pay to access your body.\u201d",
      "Under Belgium\u2019s new law, each room where sexual services take place must be equipped with an alarm button that will connect a sex worker with their \u201creference person\u201d.",
      "But Julia believes there is no way to make sex work safe.",
      "\u201cIn what other job would you need a panic button? It\u2019s not the oldest profession in the world, it\u2019s the oldest exploitation in the world.\u201d",
      "How to regulate the sex industry remains a divisive issue globally. But for Mel, bringing it out of the shadows can only help women.",
      "\u201cI am very proud that Belgium is so far ahead,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a future now.\u201d",

    "published": "Sat, 30 Nov 2024 01:58:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Once restricted to only big cities, high-end specialty coffee chains are finding new customers across India.",
    "story": [
      "\"It's not just about brewing a good cup of coffee but connecting with customers on a deeper level.\"",
      "It was this one thought that made Harmanpreet Singh leave his family bakery to open a specialty coffee shop in the northern Indian city of Jalandhar.",
      "It was an unexpected decision - coffee has always been popular in southern states, traditionally served strong and frothy in a steel tumbler. But it's still not the first choice of beverage in the vast swathes of north India, where drinking tea is an intrinsic part of the culture.",
      "For Mr Singh, the journey began in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic when he saw a growing demand for specialty coffee, particularly among the city's youth and the overseas residents who returned to the country at that time.",
      "Recognising this shift, he moved to the southern city of Bengaluru to learn brewing techniques. \"I studied everything - from the way coffee is served to the role things like decor, cutlery, music and even packaging played in the overall experience,\" he said.",
      "Three months later, Mr Singh put his learnings to test and opened Buland Caf\u00e9 in Jalandhar.",
      "Today, the cafe has 40 outlets across the city and has become a favourite spot for the city's youth, who come here to relax or work over piping cups of coffee.",
      "The beans, roasted in various blends, are sourced from the famed coffee estates of  Karnataka. Mr Singh says he personally trained his staff on how to brew the perfect cuppa and take care of the coffee machine.",
      "\"It's a thriving scene,\" he says.",
      "Mr Singh is among a crop of young entrepreneurs that are benefitting from a wave of specialty coffee consumption in small north Indian towns and cities.",
      "India has had a vibrant cafe culture for years - but it has been largely restricted to big cities where homegrown specialty and international coffee chains dominate the market.",
      "However, post-Covid, several tier-two cities are also seeing a boom in demand for such spaces as people embrace practices like remote working and look for new places to meet their friends and families.",
      "Cafe owners say more Indians are now willing to pay more for coffee that's roasted in smaller batches and customised as per their preferences.",
      "\"Clients have become more knowledgeable about the roasts and are interested in the origins of their coffee,\" says Bharat Singhal, the founder of Billi Hu roasteries.",
      "In fact, more than 44% of the Indian population now drinks coffee, a 2023 report by CRISIL, a marketing analytical company, shows.",
      "While a lot of it comes from home consumption, the growing demand for specialty coffee in small cities plays a big part, says Bhavi Patel, a coffee consultant and dairy technologist.",
      "Roastery owners say the growth is also evident in numbers. \"Subscription based orders have surged by 50% in one year,\" says Sharang Sharma, the founder of Bloom Coffee Roasters. \"Customers have moved from French presses to pour-over or espresso machines, adopting more sophisticated brewing methods.\"",
      "While India is often associated with tea, it also has a long coffee-drinking history.",
      "The culture took shape in the 1900s when Indian Coffee Houses emerged as a hangout spot for the intellectual and elite class. Housed in colonial-styled buildings, these cafes served English breakfasts with steaming hot coffee and offered a space to discuss politics and mobilise support during pivotal periods in history.",
      "A shift occurred in the 1990s when economic reforms opened India to the world, allowing entrepreneurs to open private coffee shops frequented by young peeople, who saw it as a hip experience.",
      "Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day (CCD), which opened in 1996, quickly became one of India\u2019s most popular and widespread coffee chains. At its peak, CCD boasted over 1,700 outlets, serving as a popular gathering spot for students and young adults. But mounting debt, management issues and the untimely death of its founder led to a closure of most of its outlets across India.",
      "In 2012, the arrival of international giant Starbucks spurred the rise of homegrown specialty coffee brands like Blue Tokai Roasters, Third Wave Coffee and Subko Coffee.",
      "Mr Singhal says that while big cities like Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai, and Bengaluru still dominate the scene, smaller cities are quickly catching up.",
      "However, it's not just changing palettes that's driving consumption. \"Often it's social media,\" Mr Singh says. \"People want good coffee but they also want to be in a space that's trendy and which they can post online.\"",
      "Nishant Sinha from Lucknow city is among those who understood the trend early on.",
      "His Roastery Coffee House offers trendy ambience, free wi-fi and cosy seating options along with an array of coffee roasts. While the beans are sourced from coffee estates in the south, the food is distinctively north Indian.",
      "Others like Jatin Khurana in the northern city of Ludhiana are experimenting with flavours.",
      "At his Urban Buhkkad cafe, Mr Khurana serves the \"Shadi Wali Coffee [the wedding coffee]\" - a wedding favourite in the 1990s, which became famous for its blend of instant coffee, milk, sugar, and a sprinkle of chocolate powder.",
      "But instead of coffee powder, Mr Khurana uses freshly grounded beans, available in different roasts and varieties, to enhance its flavours. \"The idea is to capture the essence of the beverage that many Indians grew up drinking,\" he says.",
      "It's an exciting time to be in the business - but growth comes with its own set of challenges.",
      "\"Demand is growing, but a smaller coffee shop owners tend to cut corners, whether it\u2019s by opting for substandard machines, serving weaker coffee shots, or hiring inexperienced baristas,\" Mr Singhal says.",
      "And running the business is not always profitable given the high price of coffee and the infrastructural costs involved in running such spaces.",
      "When Neha Das and Nishant Ashish opened The Eden\u2019s caf\u00e9 in Ranchi in 2021, they wanted to create a safe and relaxed space for young students to get together in the city.",
      "Today, their hazelnut coffee and cold brews have become a favourite of many.",
      "\"It took some time but longevity requires more than profit,\" Ms Das says.",
      "\"It\u2019s about dedication, crafting local flavours, and understanding customers, even if it means working with slim profit margins for the long haul.\""

    "story": [
      "Mohamed Al Fayed manipulated Harrods managers to conceal his crimes, sacking those he could not control, an ex-director has told the BBC.",
      "Jon Brilliant, who worked in Al Fayed's private office for 18 months, says the late entrepreneur plied him with envelopes full of cash - totalling about $50,000 (\u00a339,000)  - to try to compromise and control him.",
      "\u201cHe tried to own you. And ultimately, I got fired because I couldn't be bought,\u201d he says.",
      "Harrods didn't respond to Mr Brilliant's claims. It has previously said that it was \u201cutterly appalled\u201d by the abuse allegations, adding that it is a \u201cvery different organisation to the one owned and controlled by Al Fayed\u201d.",
      "Mr Brilliant says he was \u201chorrified\u201d when he first heard the allegations that Al Fayed had abused hundreds of women and says he \u201cbeat himself up\u201d about whether there was anything he should have questioned more.",
      "He told the BBC about surveillance, sackings, and a culture designed to keep top managers from trusting or communicating with one another.",
      "This made it harder for them to do their duty as directors to exercise independent judgement and check Al Fayed\u2019s power - or ask questions which may have revealed more to them about how he was treating women.",
      "\u201cI 100% can see how the management structure and culture was set up to cover it up, mask it from people,\u201d says Mr Brilliant.",
      "Four other former directors have anonymously confirmed elements of this picture.",
      "A US citizen, Mr Brilliant was 36 when he joined the firm in August 2000. He was hired to relaunch the Harrods online business.",
      "He says that shortly before his first business trip to visit Microsoft in Seattle, Al Fayed gave him a brown envelope containing $5,000 (\u00a33,993) in $50 notes.",
      "After the trip he tried to return the full amount. He says Al Fayed refused, asking him, \u201cYou didn't need any entertainment?\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant replied that he did not need it - he had been too busy to visit the cinema or theatre, and someone else had paid for dinner.",
      "Receiving cash ahead of business trips - large-value notes of pounds, francs or dollars depending on his destination - continued over the following six months.",
      "Three senior colleagues suggested to Mr Brilliant at the time that Al Fayed was trying to get him to compromise himself.",
      "Mr Brilliant says they told him: \u201cHe was trying to get you to come back and say \u2018oh, I spent money on drugs or I spent money frolicking, doing something that I shouldn't have been doing,\u2019 and that he would then use that information against you if you should ever turn on him.\u201d",
      "He adds: \u201cI am certainly aware of people who... succumbed to the temptation.\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant continued trying to return the money, until his family arrived in London and he started looking for a home. With Al Fayed\u2019s consent, he put it towards the purchase of a property.",
      "Al Fayed had form for using envelopes of cash as a tool of power and control. It had caused a scandal in the 1990s after he paid MPs to ask questions in the House of Commons - and then exposed those who had accepted his gifts.",
      "Mr Brilliant believes he was not immune to Al Fayed\u2019s extensive use of bugging and surveillance, carried out by the Harrods owner\u2019s large team of security guards.",
      "\u201cEven when I tell this story to you right now, I get kind of goosebumps and the hair stands up on the back of my neck, realising that my phones were being listened in on,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant\u2019s first suspicion that he may have been bugged came in 2002, shortly before he was fired. After a disagreement about the funding of Fulham FC, words from a private phone conversation with someone in the US were quoted back to him in a meeting.",
      "Another former Harrods director, who wanted to remain anonymous, told us he had moved into an Al Fayed-owned property when he started at the store and one of the security team warned him it was bugged.",
      "The director says he and his wife would jokingly say \u201cgood morning\u201d to the security guards who might be listening when they woke up.",
      "He noticed that many directors kept a personal mobile phone as well as a work phone, because they feared the Harrods phone might be bugged.",
      "Mr Brilliant, who has returned to the US, says he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d when he first heard the BBC investigation.",
      "\u201cI do look back and say, \u2018should I have seen something? Did I miss something?\u2019 And I've gone over it and over it,\u201d he says.",
      "He worked in Al Fayed\u2019s \u201cring of steel\u201d office suite on the fifth floor of Harrods, protected by two sets of security doors. There was a group of administrative assistants who were all young, blonde and attractive - he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant recalls them as \u201cobedient\u201d. He explains: \u201cThere was this notion of \u2018do this, jump, how high should I jump?\u2019 - and really being on the ball. Mohamed demanded a lot of people, and they were serving their role.\u201d",
      "He adds that he now questions whether the women acted in that way because of what may had been happening.",
      "When challenged on whether he should have done more to protect the women he says he asks himself whether he could have.",
      "\u201cI wasn't privy to that amount of information that would otherwise suggest that there was something deeper going on.\u201d",
      "'Frontal lobotomy'",
      "Mr Brilliant says Harrods\u2019 managers were set in opposition to each other and then expected to keep a watchful eye on their rivals.",
      "In addition to his core role, he was given partial oversight of a range of Al Fayed\u2019s interests, including Fulham FC and the Paris Ritz.",
      "\u201cI was asked to oversee people I had no right overseeing,\u201d says Mr Brilliant. In turn, he found that \u201cpeople were looking over my shoulder\u201d.",
      "Information was treated like a \u201ccurrency\u201d and people would jockey to share it to \u201ccurry favour\u201d with the boss, he says.",
      "This has been corroborated by an anonymous director. \u201cThere was no trust between directors,\u201d he told us. \u201cEveryone was on the defensive.\u201d",
      "In his 1997 biography of Al Fayed, journalist Tom Bower described Harrods as a \u201cmedieval court\u201d where executives\u2019 survival depended on \u201cutter loyalty\u201d and \u201ca drip of salacious gossip to sow doubts about rivals\u201d.",
      "Senior managers at Harrods were sacked with such regularity that Mr Brilliant says it was a \u201crunning joke\u201d in the store.",
      "Managers were sacked or quit so frequently that The Sunday Times began to publish a regular count, which reached 48 in 2005 - before a legal letter put a stop to it.",
      "Many dismissals ended in legal action or employment tribunals. Some were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), although Mr Brilliant was not.",

      "The BBC has tried to contact as many long-serving former Harrods directors as possible, but none were willing to give an interview.",
      "Although he only worked there for 18 months, Mr Brilliant said he wanted to speak to the BBC for two reasons.",
      "\u201cOne, if there's anything that I'm able to say or do that shows support for these women who have been horrifically treated, traumatised, I want to do whatever I can.",

      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",

      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",

      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",

      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",

What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

    "story": [
      "Boeing, Nike and Starbucks have all changed their chief executives in recent months. But just how important is the person in the top job for the successful running of such huge companies?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only one cat who\u2019s on the hot seat,\u201d says Alan Lafley, who was CEO of global consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble from 2000 to 2010, and then again from 2013 to 2015.",
      "With P&G selling everything from Pampers nappies, to Head & Shoulders shampoo, and Fairy washing up liquid, it has more than five billion customers around the world. And its workforce now exceeds 107,000 people.",
      "Mr Lafley equates leading a firm of that vast size with being the manager of one of England\u2019s Premier League football teams. Specifically, he says the job comes with the same risk of being sacked if results are not as good as expected.",
      "\u201cWith the football players, if they have a bad season, they're not gone,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead it is the coach or manager that\u2019s going to go.\u201d",
      "Coffee giant Starbucks announced a change of CEO in August, following falling sales caused by factors including a complicated menu, tough competition in China, and boycotts linked to the war in the Middle East. The hope is that new boss Brian Niccol can transform the firm\u2019s fortunes.",
      "To lure him away from the success he was enjoying running US restaurant chain Chipotle, Starbucks is paying him more than $100m (\u00a379m) in his first year, plus the use of a private jet to allow him to commute 1,000 miles from his home in California to the firm\u2019s head office in Seattle, Washington state.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty obvious that there's a big hope for him and his ability to turn that company around,\u201d says executive coach Alisa Cohn, who explains that top pay packages are set by a company\u2019s board of directors, and reflect their expectations of the CEO they\u2019re appointing.",
      "Investors welcomed Mr Niccol\u2019s appointment  with a 24.5% jump in Starbucks share price the day it was announced. The same day Chipotle fell 7.5%.",
      "Mr Niccol is now continuing efforts to simplify Starbucks\u2019 menu.",
      "\u201cCEOs are the ones who are setting the strategy for the company,\u201d adds Ms Cohn. \u201cThey're the ones setting the culture for the company, and, truthfully, the buck stops with them in terms of their accountability.\u201d",
      "Marcia Kilgore is a Canadian entrepreneur behind skincare brands Soap & Glory and Beauty Pie, plus footwear firm Fitflop. She says that the role of CEO is complicated, demanding, and critical to a company\u2019s success.",
      "\u201cYou need to have somebody who can really look at the different streams of work that need to be done, and make those organised and prioritised,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cAnd someone who can make sure that the different teams in the company are working together harmoniously, and ensuring that time is not wasted, money is not wasted, and energy is not wasted on things that are not going to move the dial for the company.\u201d",
      "The failure to make the right choices and lead teams in the right direction was why Mr Lafley became the boss of P&G in 2000.",
      "His predecessor Durk Jager resigned as a result of the failure of a huge global restructuring that he led. Cutting 15,000 jobs and 10 factories was meant to increase profits, but instead led to repeated profit warnings and a steep share price collapse.",
      "Mr Lafley says that as CEO it\u2019s not about doing everything yourself, but \u201cenabling and empowering everybody in the organisation\u201d to do what needs to be done.",
      "\u201cWe had 100,000 people looking to the new CEO to tell them two things \u2013 \u2018what happened?\u2019, and \u2018what are we going to do next?\u2019.\u201d",
      "He explains that he decided to refocus the firm on serving customers and innovating new products, telling staff that \u201cI have confidence that we\u2019re all going to get us out of where we are and back on track\u201d.",
      "Mr Lafley adds that clearly communicating his plans with employees was so \u201chugely important\u201d that in those pre-Zoom days he flew around the world to meet staff in person.",
      "Inspiration and communication are also seemingly at the heart of the approach of new Nike CEO Elliott Hill. On getting the job in September he wrote to staff telling them he had \u201cgreat confidence in his team and our future together\u201d despite years of falling sales.",
      "Ms Cohn who has worked with companies including Google, Etsy and Johnson & Johnson says that whatever the plans of a new CEO, confidence is vital for any success.",
      "\u201cThe most important quality that you need to be the CEO is knowing that you will be able to be the CEO,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a sense of confidence, and healthy ego that you need to bring to the table.",
      "\u201cThe second thing you need to bring to the table is an ability to adapt. You've got to be able to assess the situation, make some important decisions, and then adapt them as you go\u201d.",
      "It\u2019s not something she thinks can always be taught, which is why she says so many people get \"stuck\" at lower levels in a company. Ms Cohn adds: \u201cYou need to develop your own sort of internal state to know that you can handle the pressure, the difficulty, the spotlight\u201d.",
      "That pressure is one the reasons why top CEO\u2019s are often compensated with huge pay packages. When it comes to the S&P 500 group of the US\u2019s biggest companies last year, the top earner was Hock Tan at Broadcom who got $162m, followed by Nikesh Arora with $151m at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, and Stephen Schwarzman with $120m at investment giant Blackstone.",
      "The average for an S&P500 CEO last year was a record $16.3m, according to executive consultants Equilar. It means they are getting 196 times as much as the average worker at their companies and critics says CEO\u2019s aren\u2019t worth that much more than their staff.",
      "\u201cThis is based on the foolish notion that the person in the corner office is somehow almost single-handedly responsible for corporate value,\u201d says Sarah Anderson from the Washington based progressive think tank the Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "She think it\u2019s a problem that is getting worse, and spreading around the world.  \u201cI think runaway CEO pay is bad for our economy, bad for democracy and bad for business,\u201d she adds.",
      "Mr Lafley agrees that the ratio between staff and CEOs\u2019 pay is \u201ctoo high\u201d, but reasons that firms are having to compete to attract the best talent.",
      "He thinks the answer lies in paying CEOs \u201ca rather modest basic salary, and then everything else is incentive\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn the end, it's sort of like a coach. If you're not motivating people, and you're not enabling them to do what you're asking them to do, then you're not doing the job.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Yasmin - not her real name - came from Iran to study for a master\u2019s degree at a new university in the UK, but she was \"shocked\" to find many of her fellow students had limited English, and only one or two were British.",
      "\"How is it possible to continue this coursework without understanding a British accent or English properly?\" she tells BBC File on 4.",
      "Most students paid other people to do their coursework, she explains, and some would pay people to register their attendance at lectures for them.",
      "Yasmin's experience reflects a growing concern. The University and College Union (UCU) says some institutions are overlooking language skills to receive high fees from overseas students, and one professor tells us 70% of his recent master\u2019s students had inadequate English.",
      "Universities UK - which represents 141 institutions - rejects the claims and says there are strict language requirements for students coming from abroad.",
      "Jo Grady from the UCU, which represents 120,000 lecturers and university staff, says it is an open secret that students who lack English skills find ways to come to the UK to study.",
      "\"When we speak to members we hear about the tricks that are pulled in order to have people pass the relevant language test and get on to courses,\" she says.",
      "About seven out of 10 students studying on master\u2019s courses in England are now from overseas, far higher than on other types of higher education course, says Rose Stephenson from the Higher Education Policy Institute, an independent think tank.",
      "In England, university tuition fees for undergraduate domestic students are capped at \u00a39,250, rising to \u00a39,535 per year in 2025-26. Each of the other UK nations set their own fees. But fees for overseas students studying in England have no upper limit.",
      "Tuition fees: How much does university cost in the UK?",
      "Tuition fees: How much does university cost in the UK?",
      "\"You can charge a foreign student as much as they're willing to pay,\" says Ms Stephenson.",
      "Post-graduate fees are not capped either, so a master\u2019s degree at an elite university could cost \u00a350,000.",
      "Because undergraduate tuition fees for domestic students in England have not kept up with inflation, there has been a real-terms cut in university funding, says Ms Stephenson - with international students, in effect, subsidising the below-cost fees of home students.",
      "One whistleblower who worked at an education provider that prepares international students for university, told us agents would target families abroad who had the money to pay.",
      "The whistleblower - who has previously also spoken to the Sunday Times - said: \"We knew that those universities are increasingly desperate and would go along with our plans without much scrutiny into how those students were being found.",
      "\"No independent party is looking at the grades or the examinations. It's the Wild West, in a way.\"",
      "The whistleblower worked for Study Group, one of dozens of providers feeding the UK university system, and taking fees from students in the process.",
      "Based in the UK, Study Group is a registered provider which says it works for more than 50 universities with a network of 3,500 agents in 99 countries.",
      "Study Group strongly disputes the whistleblower's claims, saying overseas students earn their places on merit. It adds that any decision to admit a student on to a course is taken by the university, not Study Group, and rejects the claim that entry criteria are waived for any reason.",
      "It says courses it runs are robustly \"scrutinised by partner universities\".",
      "Yasmin paid \u00a316,000 for her course in international finance at a university in southern England. She later found out that of the 100 students on most of her modules, \"maybe 80 or 90 of them bought assignments\" from so-called \"essay mills\" based overseas. In England it is a criminal offence to complete work for a student which they can pass off as their own.",
      "When Yasmin told her tutor what was happening, he took no action. Yasmin says she now feels her master\u2019s degree has been \"devalued\".",
      "A Russell Group university professor, who has taught at several universities and wants to remain anonymous, echoes Yasmin's concerns. He tells File on 4 that 70% of his students at master\u2019s degree level over the past five years did not have sufficient English language skills to be on the course.",
      "\"There have certainly been occasions when very simple questions have not been able to be understood by students who I am teaching,\" he says.",
      "The professor told us he has had to adapt his teaching technique, and says students even use translation apps in class. But he insists fault does not lie with international students themselves, who are mostly trying their best, and says the situation varies from subject to subject.",
      "They pass, he says, because courses are often assessed through assignments, rather than exams. Some students use essay mills and pay for others to write their work or, increasingly, use artificial intelligence (AI). Both methods, he says, can defeat current anti-plagiarism software.",
      "UCU\u2019s Jo Grady says it is hardly surprising some students with poor English skills feel they need help from other people, or even use AI to do their work, as an \"act of desperation\".",
      "She says her members tell their managers that enrolling students without good English \"is a bad idea\u2026 they will struggle, and we will also struggle to teach them\". However, she says \"university managers and leaders pursue it regardless, because of the money and income it will bring in\".",
      "Some universities are in financial crisis, says Ms Grady, and have become dependent on high-fee paying overseas students who \"pay eye-watering sums of money\".",
      "\"Institutions are chasing money. They're not necessarily chasing the best candidates. And it's a corruption of what higher education should be.\"",
      "University cash crisis to get worse despite tuition fee rise, BBC told",
      "Drop in foreign student visas worrying for UK universities",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, rejects the suggestion some overseas students are being allowed on courses with poor English language skills as a way of boosting income.",
      "She says universities carry out strict checks on those they enrol - including minimum language levels, as set by the UK government.",
      "\"Students will need to be able to afford the fee to study in the UK, but beyond that it\u2019s a question of taking students who apply, and applying a merit-based criteria,\" she says. \"It is absolutely central that this is a system that people trust.\"",
      "Ms Stern says international students are attracted by the quality of the UK's universities and says it would be \"unwise\" to rely on international income to fund domestic education and research, because overseas student numbers could be affected by geopolitics or shifts in exchange rates.",
      "Meanwhile, international student numbers are falling. Data on UK student visa applications from the first half of this year shows there has been a 16% decline in applications, resulting in a loss of income for some institutions. This drop is, in part, being attributed to changes in UK student visa rules preventing most postgraduate students from bringing dependents.",
      "It is contributing to the worst financial crisis for universities since fees were first introduced. Last month, the government regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), estimated that by 2025-26, 72% of universities could be spending more money than they have coming in, and warned that \"rapid and decisive action is necessary\".",
      "The Department for Education told the BBC a reliance on overseas students has been identified as a risk, and many universities will have to change their business models, adding that the government is committed to managing migration carefully."

      "But campaign group The Dad Shift says it is \"failing working families\".",
      "Labour says it is carrying out a review of parental leave.",
      "Introduced by the previous Conservative government, shared parental leave is a state-funded scheme that allows parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay after the birth or adoption of a child.",
      "But new analysis, seen exclusively by BBC News, shows it might not benefit all dads equally.",
      "The figures, from a Freedom of Information request submitted to HMRC by The Dad Shift, show the top 20% of earners make up 60% of those to use shared parental leave.",
      "Just 5% of those who took up shared parental leave came from the bottom 50% of earners.",
      "And since its introduction in 2014, the government has paid \u00a340m in shared parental leave payments to families in London - almost 10 times more than in the north-east of England.",

    "summary": "The row could be raised by the Greek prime minister when he meets Sir Keir Starmer on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "A deal that could see the Parthenon Sculptures returned to Greece is \"close\", a former adviser to the country's government has told the BBC.",
      "Prof Irene Stamatoudi said it \"seems negotiations have gone forward\" over relocating the antiquities - also known as the Elgin Marbles - which were taken from Athens more than 200 years ago and are displayed in the British Museum.",
      "It comes as Sir Keir Starmer and his Greek counterpart met for talks in Downing Street on Tuesday, though No 10 has said the issue is not on the agenda.",
      "The sculptures were not discussed at the opening of the meeting, according to an official account released by No 10.",
      "The meeting comes amid reports that talks over a deal which would see the statues moved to Athens have recently progressed.",
      "The status of the sculptures has been a source of diplomatic tension between the UK and Greece for decades.",
      "Greece says they were stolen, but the British Museum rejects that and says they were legally obtained. Talks between Greece and the museum have been going on since 2021.",
      "What are the Elgin Marbles?",
      "'Every Greek felt offended' - how Athens sees the Elgin Marbles row",
      "Prof Stamatoudi, who advised the Greek culture minister during previous Elgin Marbles negotiations, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme she believes \"a deal is close\" but was unsure if it was \"close enough\".",
      "She said the Greek government has proposed a \"cultural, strategic partnership\" which would involve other antiquities being sent to the British Museum to fill the gallery which would be left vacant by any return.",
      "Negotiations over what could be sent to the British Museum are \"secret\", Prof Stamatoudi said, adding that while she is not personally involved in this round of talks, she believes it would involve \"antiquities that attract public attention\".",
      "Prof Statamoudi said securing the return is something \"all Greeks are passionate about\" as the antiquities are widely considered to be part of the country\u2019s \"cultural heritage\".",
      "Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has made securing the return of the Elgin Marbles a political priority.",
      "The issue caused a diplomatic spat last year when then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak cancelled a planned meeting with Mitsotakis after he indicated he would use it to raise the issue.",
      "The previous government said the sculptures should remain in the museum. In opposition, Labour's view was they wouldn't stand in the way of a loan arrangement between the British Museum and Athens if one was arranged.",
      "Government sources in Athens have told Greek media Mitsotakis wants to \"pick up the thread\" with Starmer following a meeting between the pair in November 2023.",
      "Earlier this week, Greek government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said Mitsotakis would raise the issue again with Starmer but that it was more of a matter for the British Museum than the government.",
      "He also denied a Sky News report that three private meetings had taken place between senior Greek officials and  members of the British Museum board of directors.",
      "Downing Street said Starmer told the Greek prime minister he hoped to \"build on our strong bilateral relationship and to talk about our common issues\", while Mitsotakis said Greece and the UK would strengthen their relationship during \"turbulent times\".",
      "Starmer is thought to be more open to the statues being relocated than his predecessor, providing a deal can be struck between the Greek government and the British Museum.",
      "The Elgin Marbles were crafted in the 5th century BC and were originally displayed in the Parthenon in Athens. They are considered among the most prized antiquities from the Ancient Greek period.",
      "They were removed by British aristocrat Lord Elgin while Athens was part of the Ottoman Empire and were badly damaged en route to London, where they have been displayed since."

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 17:41:09 GMT",
    "summary": "A funding award of \u00a315,000 to the band was blocked by former Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch.",
    "story": [
      "Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has said it is \"unbelievable\" that the Labour government have decided to no longer contest a discrimination case brought by Belfast rap group Kneecap.",
      "The group won its case against the UK government over a decision Badenoch took when she was a minister to withdraw an arts grant.",
      "The group was awarded \u00a314,250 - the same amount they were initially granted.",
      "A government spokesperson said the decision was made not to continue contesting the band's challenge as \"we do not believe it is in the public interest\".",
      "They added: \u201cThis government\u2019s priority is to try to reduce costs and help protect the taxpayer from further expense.\"",
      "Badenoch described the move as \"yet another cowardly decision after giving away the Chagos Islands\".",
      "\"Labour will always capitulate rather than defend UK interests,\" a spokesperson for the Conservative leader added.",
      "The decision to block the grant, taken by Badenoch when she was business and trade minister, was described in court by Kneecap's barrister as \"unlawful and procedurally unfair\".",
      "In a statement, the band said Badenoch and her department had \"tried to silence us and they have failed\".",
      "The band said it would split the \u00a314,250 equally between two youth organisations who work with Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland \"to create a better future for our young people\".",
      "Kneecap originally applied for a grant allocated to support UK-registered artists in global markets in December 2023.",
      "The group, who have faced controversy for their lyrics and political outlook, were successful in their application, but were subsequently blocked from receiving the funding after an intervention by the Department for Business and Trade.",
      "At the time, then-UK Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch's spokesperson said they did not want to hand taxpayers' money \"to people that oppose the United Kingdom itself\".",
      "The band's music and marketing heavily features themes relating to Irish republicanism and opposition to British rule in Northern Ireland.",
      "The group have courted controversy and it claimed it was told a 2019 tour, entitled Farewell to the Union, had angered the then Conservative government.",
      "Kneecap have also antagonised unionists in Northern Ireland - one of their best known records is called Get Your Brits Out, a parody rap in which the band go on an imaginary, drug-fuelled night out with prominent members of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).",
      "In statement following Friday's court hearing, band member DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed said: \"For us this action was never about \u00a314,250, it could have been 50p.\"",
      "The group said its motivation for taking the case was \"equality\".",
      "\"This was an attack on artistic culture, an attack on the Good Friday Agreement itself and an attack on Kneecap and our way of expressing ourselves.\"",
      "In a statement following the settlement, Badeonch's spokesperson said \"this case is not about whether a band promotes violence or hates the UK, as Kneecap clearly do; this is about whether government ministers have the ability to stop taxpayers' money subsidising people who neither need nor deserve it\".",
      "\"Labour would rather waste your money than stand up to a group of Irish republicans who go to court because the UK government won\u2019t hand them cash.\"",
      "'Generosity and support'",
      "Kneecap have said it will split the money awarded to them between two Belfast charities, Gl\u00f3r Na M\u00f3na in Ballymurphy and RCity Belfast on the Shankill Road.",
      "Sarah Jane Waite, director of RCity Belfast, expressed the charity's thanks for the \"generosity and support from Kneecap\".",
      "She said the donation will be used toward a number of projects, including both local and international programmes.",
      "Feargal Mac Ionnrachtaigh, executive director of Gl\u00f3r Na M\u00f3na, said it was a \"pleasant surprise\" to receive news about the funding.",
      "The club, based in west Belfast, was previously attended by Kneecap member Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh, known by his stage name Mo Chara.",
      "Mr Mac Ionnrachtaigh added that they are a grassroots group in a disadvantaged area, and the money will be put to \"good use\" including towards the construction of a new building.",
      "\"The key for us is... 25 years after the Good Friday Agreement, we have built a sector through the medium of Irish, but we're still finding ourselves in mobile huts and substandard accommodation,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.",
      "\"This donation goes to the heart of that.\"",
      "Mr Mac Ionnrachtaigh said Mo Chara was part of the \"new generation\" of Irish-medium youth availing of the Gl\u00f3r Na M\u00f3na's services, and added he would be speaking to the group on Friday evening to thank them for the donation.",
      "\"The idea of creating social change through youth, through art, through culture is what Kneecap are ultimately about and what both of these youth projects are ultimately about,\" he said.",
      "\"This funding today will go a long way to elevate that.\"",
      "Who are Kneecap?",
      "Kneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio from west Belfast who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise.",
      "The group was formed in 2017 by three friends who go by the stage names of Mo Chara, M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap and DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed.",
      "Their rise to fame inspired a semi-fictionalised film starring Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender.",

      "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been denied bail for the third time by a judge in New York City.",
      "Two judges previously denied Mr Combs's release from custody, primarily due to concerns about potential witness tampering, deeming it a significant risk if he was freed before trial, which is scheduled for May 2025.",
      "Mr Combs is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution.",
      "He has entered a plea of not guilty and has also denied more than two dozen sexual assault accusations lodged in a flurry of civil lawsuits.",
      "The judge cited evidence in the case showing Mr Combs\u2019s alleged attempts at witness tampering, his violation of prison regulations while behind bars and claims he ran a \"criminal enterprise\" including forced labour and kidnapping.",
      "US District Judge Arun Subramanian concluded the court could not trust Mr Combs if released on bail.",
      "\u201cThe Court finds that the government has shown by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community,\" the judge wrote in Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Prosecutors had opposed granting Mr Combs bail, citing his misconduct while in custody.",
      "In a recent court filing, prosecutors accused the rap mogul of misusing jail communications to influence witnesses in his case and coercing others in his orbit to post online in order to sway public opinion and benefit his defence.",
      "But defence attorneys for Mr Combs said he should be released so he has adequate time to prepare for his trial next year.",
      "Earlier this month, Judge Subramanian ordered prosecutors in the case to destroy all copies of nearly 20 pages seized during a recent search of the former hip-hop star\u2019s jail cell.",
      "Some of the documents included handwritten notes to his attorneys and thoughts on his legal strategy, court filings show.",

      "Diddy called witnesses from prison, prosecutors say",
      "Diddy faces more than two dozen lawsuits as he sits in jail",
      "Mr Combs's legal team said the search was unlawful and that the material was subject to attorney-client privilege, a legal doctrine that safeguards confidential communications between lawyers and those they represent.",
      "But prosecutors said the information wasn't protected due to Mr Combs's alleged actions, which could be considered obstruction of justice and witness tampering.",
      "They claimed Mr Combs had encouraged his children to post a video on social media featuring their birthday celebration with the aim of swaying prospective jurors.",
      "Allegedly, Mr Combs sent hundreds of text messages using an app called ContactMeASAP, marketed as \"an innovative text messaging service for federal inmates to communicate with loved ones via real-time messages\".",
      "According to authorities, Mr Combs has maintained two accounts on the platform, communicating with dozens of individuals, including attorneys and others not listed on his approved contacts list at the jail.",
      "Lisa Bloom, an attorney for Dawn Richard, who filed a civil lawsuit against Mr Combs in September, also alleges that he was contacting witnesses from prison.",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, she said one person had called her client a liar, and that phone tracking showed this person had had more than 100 points of contact with Mr Combs from jail.",
      "\u201cThe strong implication there is that he talked her into making those statements, perhaps gave her money. We don't know. But that would be witness tampering,\" Ms Bloom told Newsnight.",
      "Prosecutors have stated their investigation is ongoing, leaving open the possibility of additional charges or defendants.",
      "Ms Bloom said she believes others could be charged in the investigation.",
      "\"He didn't do this by himself,\" Ms Bloom said. \"He had an operation that people were brought in by others, so he didn't do everything himself. And we think it's very important that not only do predators get brought to justice, but those who conspire with them, who help them, who are complicit.\"",
      "Dozens of civil lawsuits also have been filed against Mr Combs accusing him of coercing and abusing both men and women, blackmailing them with video recordings of sexual encounters, threatening witnesses, and in some cases, physically beating them.",
      "Several cases include accusations from people who were underage at the time of the alleged assaults.",
      "Mr Combs has vehemently denied all the allegations.",
      "His legal team previously offered a $50m bail package that included house arrest and no female visitors, but it was rejected by the court.",

      "Ador however has said its contract with NewJeans still stands, as the agency has not violated any terms.",
      "This dispute is the latest development in a long-running conflict between former NewJeans producer Min Hee-Jin and Hybe's chairman Bang Si-hyuk, which has made headlines in South Korea.",

      "K-pop star gives tearful testimony on harassment",
      "NewJeans face uncertainty after failed ultimatum",
      "One of the group's members, Hanni, has alleged that she suffered workplace harassment while working with the label.",
      "\"This is not the type of work ethic we respect and not one we want to be a part of, and to continue working under a company with no intention of protecting NewJeans would only do us harm,\" Hanni said.",
      "She added the group had faced \"mistreatment, not just towards us but also including our staff\", and said the group had experienced \"deliberate miscommunications and manipulation in multiple areas\".",
      "Ador maintains that its contract with NewJeans remains valid as it has not violated its duty and has asked the group to \"continue their activities\" with the agency.",
      "\"A unilateral claim that trust has been broken does not constitute valid grounds for termination of a contract,\" Ador said in the statement after the group's announcement.",
      "\"We regret that the press conference on the termination of the contract took place without sufficient consideration, and even before we gave our response to the demand letter,\" the agency said.",
      "NewJeans said they would like to work with Min, the group's former mastermind  who left Ador in August following accusations that she had planned to split from Hybe, taking NewJeans with her.",
      "This would have made NewJeans and Ador independent of Hybe. Min has denied the accusations against her.",
      "She has previously accused Hybe of launching another girl group, Illit, that was copying NewJeans' music and appearance.",
      "On 13 November, NewJeans filed a legal notice to Ador demanding the company resolve breaches of their exclusive contracts within 14 days.",
      "They said that failure to meet their demands would result in the termination of their contracts.",
      "The group has asked for an apology for a comment allegedly made by an executive at Belift Lab, another subsidiary of Hybe, and accused the company of workplace bullying. They have also asked for the immediate reinstatement of Min.",
      "They added that they would fulfil their contractual obligations, but at the conference warned their fans they might not be able to use the band's name after the contract terminates.",
      "Prior to the NewJeans' announcement, the band were committed to a seven-year contract, which runs out in 2029.",
      "The contract includes a clause specifying that parties can unilaterally terminate the contract if the other has violated its duty. However, the matter is likely to go to court as both sides do not agree. In such a scenario, a judge would decide if the contract can be terminated and if one side owes the other any damages.",
      "In October, the K-pop news site Koreaboo estimated that the members would have to pay about 300bn South Korean Won (about \u00a3170m) to terminate the contract early.",
      "But group singer Haerin said it made \"no sense\" that the group would be liable to pay a contract breach fee.",
      "\"We never broke any rules,\u201d Haerin said. \u201cWe did nothing but try our best - they are the ones at fault. Hybe and Ador are the ones responsible.\"",

      "In October, a member of the group, Hanni, 20, testified at the Labour Committee of South Korea's National Assembly at a hearing about workplace harassment.",
      "She alleged that entertainment agency Hybe had deliberately undermined her band, and accused senior managers of deliberately ignoring her.",
      "Following several incidents, she said: \"I came to the realisation that this wasn\u2019t just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us.\"",

      "But was McCartney right? Was the rise of the world's most famous band partly down to the murder of the 35th president of the United States?",
      "Did The Beatles crack America because Kennedy was killed?",
      "'Unstoppable force'",
      "When The Beatles landed at the recently-renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport on 7 February 1964, it was just 70 days after the the 46-year-old Democrat had been murdered.",
      "Kennedy was shot as his motorcade drove through Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963 and his death threw his country into a period of mourning.",
      "Dr Patrick Andelic, assistant professor of American History at Northumbria University, said it was a moment that shook the nation to its core, partially because of JFK's own pop culture persona.",
      "\"In a sense, Kennedy was the first TV president, which was relatively new at this point,\" he said.",
      "\"By the beginning of the '60s, 90% of American families had TVs, so the way news and media was consumed totally changed.\"",
      "He said the president was, like The Beatles, \"young, handsome, witty and energetic, which translated really well to TV\".",
      "\"He embraced television and was well suited to it,\" he said.",
      "\"And that makes the shock and trauma of his death sharper in the aftermath.",
      "\"It was the first killing of a sitting president in 60 years.\"",
      "It was, of course, TV which also helped The Beatles become a phenomenon in their homeland.",
      "Settling on their now final line-up of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr in 1962, the Liverpool four-piece had already scored two number one albums in 1963 with Please Please Me and With The Beatles.",
      "When that success was coupled with the famous 1963 Royal Variety Performance appearance during which Lennon asked \"the people in the cheaper seats to clap their hands\" and the rest to just \"rattle their jewellery\" they became a national sensation.",
      "Senior music industries lecturer Dr Holly Tessler, from the University of Liverpool, said it was that show that \"made them stars overnight\".",
      "\"At this point, The Beatles were an unstoppable force in the UK,\" she said.",
      "Fear of failure",
      "The Beatles' youthful exuberance was central to their success, chiming with the legions of British teenagers that had begun to follow them.",
      "Dr Andelic said in America, JFK had a similar appeal.",
      "\"Kennedy projected youth and vitality and in his inaugural address, he spoke of the torch being passed to a new generation of Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"His death cut that short in a shocking way.\"",
      "He said in the aftermath, the nation started \"to look for more positive things, stability and reassurance\".",
      "\"When The Beatles arrive, I think they represented that.",
      "\"They were also young, vital, and [in the footage] of them getting off the plane, they were being silly.",
      "\"So, for a nation shattered by a trauma, The Beatles represented an opportunity to laugh and have fun again.\"",
      "Winning over a portion of America's youth was one thing, but cracking the national market was another.",
      "Many British acts had tried and failed to mirror the transatlantic appeal of their US counterparts, who had seen great chart success in the UK, and crack the American market.",
      "There had been limited success for those that came before The Beatles.",
      "Lonnie Donegan, the titular \"King of Skiffle\", had two top ten hits, while Cliff Richard, then the biggest act in Britain, had only made it into the US top 40 on one occasion.",
      "Spencer Leigh, author of many books on The Beatles, said the trend of British acts failing to \"make it\" in the United States, had seen Capitol, one of the country's biggest record companies, even refuse to distribute The Beatles' music for fear of the same result.",
      "\"Artists from the UK didn't sell well in America and it seemed Capitol looked down its nose at the British work,\" he said.",
      "Capitol's concerns were understandable. The singles Please Please Me, From Me To You and She Loves You had all been released in the US in 1963 and seen limited success, so they were reluctant to put out I Want To Hold Your Hand.",
      "The band's manager Brian Epstein and Capitol's parent company EMI managed to change the label's minds and on Boxing Day 1963, about a month after Kennedy's assassination, the single hit America's stores.",
      "Its impact was huge and by the first week of February, it was at the top of the US charts, a position it would hold for seven weeks.",
      "The success meant more than 3,000 fans and a large press pack were at the airport when the band touched down.",
      "For Spencer Leigh, it was what came next, not what had happened before, that led to their global success.",
      "\"My view is the people screaming for The Beatles at the airport were young and didn't know much about politics,\" he said.",
      "\"For me, the turning point was the Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "'Fleeting at best'",
      "At 20:00 on 9 February 1964, The Beatles made the first of three appearances on the programme, which was one of America's most popular TV variety shows.",
      "The TV channel CBS reportedly received more than 50,000 requests for seats at its 700-capacity studio ahead of the band's visit and those who failed to get their hands on any huddled excitedly around TVs at home.",
      "\"More than 70 million people watched the first one and they performed so well,\" Leigh said.",
      "He said one of the moments that really caught the audience's attention was when cameras panned to each band member, flashing their names on the screen.",
      "\"They put a caption on John Lennon saying 'sorry girls he's married',\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not sure how much [the band] appreciated that.\"",
      "About a month after those first three performances, The Beatles made US chart history by becoming the first act to hold the top five slots simultaneously.",
      "Beatlemania had now gone global and the rest was history.",
      "For Dr Tessler, the notion that America went down with the death of JFK and back up with the arrival of The Beatles is too simplistic.",
      "For her too, it was the Ed Sullivan Show appearances, rather than the assassination aftermath that set The Beatles on the road to pop immortality.",
      "\"I really struggle with the idea that The Beatles owe their US success to JFK being shot,\" she said.",
      "\"Their manager Brian Epstein had already been to America and done the deal to get them on the Sullivan show weeks before Kennedy was killed, and there was so much hype when the band finally landed in the US.",
      "\"America might have wanted a distraction from that feeling of 'what's next' after the assassination, but The Beatles became the story so quickly that the connection to Kennedy was only fleeting at best.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:40:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician says winning the Mercury Prize helped put an end to his \"desperate\" search for approval.",
    "story": [
      "When Michael Kiwanuka was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2020, he thought he knew the deal.",
      "He'd been up for the prestigious album award twice before. Like most artists, he said it was an honour to be nominated. A win would be nice, but not particularly life-changing.",
      "He was wrong.",
      "When Annie Mac ambushed him on The One Show to reveal it was third time lucky, a switch was flipped.",
      "\"It sort of woke me up,\" the singer-songwriter reveals.",
      "\"I'd been desperately looking for approval from my peers and certain [media] outlets - and the Mercury freed me from that desperation.",
      "\"It allowed me to feel that, actually, I just want to make the records that come naturally.\"",
      "The realisation was particularly powerful because his winning album, simply titled Kiwanuka, had grappled with his sense of inferiority as a musician, a black man, a partner and a friend.",
      "External validation didn't silence the voices in his head - but it gave him a healthy dose of perspective.",
      "\"When you have impostor syndrome and you\u2019re busy beating yourself up, you're actually using up all your energy doing that, as opposed to being like, 'Wow, how amazing it is to be making my own record?', or, 'How amazing that I'm playing the Pyramid Stage [at Glastonbury]?'",
      "\"The list is so long of how cool this job is, and I spent most of my time moaning. Winning the Mercury kicked off that feeling of, oh, I've got to sort this out.\"",
      "You could see that newfound freedom when he played at Glastonbury in June. Basking in the late afternoon sun, the 37-year-old took to the stage wearing a bright white kanzu robe - a traditional tunic from Uganda, where his parents are from.",
      "And when a malfunctioning synthesizer forced him to abort a performance of his new song Small Changes, the former perfectionist just laughed it off.",
      "\"I could hear my friend Joe laughing, and I sort of forgot I was on the Pyramid Stage,\" he recalls.",
      "\"A second later, I heard the crowd cheer, and it lifted me up off the ground.",
      "\"It was an amazing feeling. I felt like I had a massive battery pack from these people. I could do no wrong. Wherever I went, they would hold me up.\"",
      "Afterwards, the musician realised that one simple moment of fallibility had put the audience on his side.",
      "\"They saw the real me for a second, rather than what I thought people wanted to see,\" he reflects. \"It was really eye-opening.\"",
      "It\u2019s a little odd to hear the musician describe himself as a people pleaser.",
      "Since the release of his debut album Home Again in 2012, his music has worked in opposition to the trend-chasing virality of modern pop. His grooves are unhurried and thoughtful, his lyrics deeply introspective, and his inspirations - such as Isaac Hayes, Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye - decidedly old-school.",
      "His second album, Love & Hate, brought him to international attention after its opening track, Cold Little Heart, was picked to be the opening theme for hit TV show Big Little Lies,  starring Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman.",
      "Kiwanuka, released in 2019, earned him the Mercury Prize and his first Grammy Award nomination. But the densely-arranged, sumptuous soul often pushed his voice back in the mix \u2013 something he has confronted on his latest record, Small Changes.",
      "\"I fell in love with my voice again, which sounds weird,\" he says. \"But I realised being able to sing, and to have a voice that sounds good on recording, is a blessing.",
      "\"So I started to want that to be heard more than all the other stuff - the drums or the guitars or the strings. And that really aided the sound of the record.\"",
      "Chart battle",
      "The result is his smallest, most understated album to date. Aided once again by producers Inflo and Danger Mouse, he has created a suite of spacious, slow-burning confessionals that compel you to lean in and pay attention, slowly revealing their beauty on repeated listens.",
      "Reviews have been ecstatic. Awarding a score of 9/10, Uncut magazine called it \"rich, moving and inventive\", while Dork said the \"perfectly-balanced\" collection was \"genuine, gracious, and absolutely first-class\".",
      "The record is locked in a two-way battle for this week's UK number one album with Kendrick Lamar\u2019s surprise release GNX \u2013 but you get the impression Kiwunka won't pay too much attention to chart positions.",
      "For him, fulfilment came in the studio, surrounded by some of his favourite musicians -  including legendary bassist Pino Palladino and Janet Jackson\u2019s producer Jimmy Jam, who popped in to say hello and ended up contributing organ parts to half of the record.",
      "Each song is about a small change Kiwanuka has made in his life - confronting depression, rediscovering the innocence of childhood, and weathering the ups and downs of marriage.",
      "His languorous voice can tend towards the melancholy, but the lyrics are full of hope. \u201cSmall changes solve the problems,\u201d he sings on the title track.",
      "Despite that, the album was written during a period of major upheaval, as Kiwanuka moved away from London, became a father, and stared down the barrel of middle age.",
      "\"I realised, at the age of 37, it\u2019s the first time I can talk about something that happened 10 years ago, and I was still an adult,\" he laughs.",

      "\"And that song, Small Changes, I just loved the feeling of it when I wrote it in the studio.",
      "\"It sounded the way I felt about change - part hopeful, part excited, but also with the melancholy of realising that, sometimes change is hard and it's overwhelming and you've got no control over it.\"",
      "The power of commitment",

      "\"I feel like, in this day and age, it's almost revolutionary to stick something through to the very end. And, actually, it can negate that worried feeling the world is giving us right now.",

      "He added that the bill was \"a enormous and fundamental change in the UK\" from what this \"wonderful group of doctors believes in and has practiced up until now\", however, \"society has spoken through the MPs\" and the issues had been \"extensively debated\".",

      "Sam Royston, director of policy at Marie Curie, agreed action was needed on palliative care: \u201cWe have taken a neutral position on assisted dying, but we do not take a neutral position on the need for improvement on palliative care.",

      "But Prof Sam Ahmedzai, a retired palliative care doctor and former NHS adviser on end-of-life care, said he had been to countries where both systems worked well in parallel with each other - and in some places where assisted dying had been introduced, palliative care had been improved.",

      "Under the proposed new law, people like Jan - who have been told they have less than six months to live - would be able to access drugs to end their lives, but only with the agreement of two doctors and a High Court judge who would review the decision.",
      "Jan would like to die at home with her son and daughter by her side but she knows that isn\u2019t likely, even if the bill does pass, because she only has months to live.",
      "\u201cIt leaves me with a very poor set of options,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should make it right for people, give them the opportunity to have a smooth passing \u2013 a comfortable death.\u201d",

You\u2019re dead.\u201d",

      "Becki shares those fears. She says it would open the door to people being subjected to coercive control or being pressured to end their lives prematurely.",
      "\u201cThis law potentially puts people in a position where they think they are a burden and the easy option is to end their life. That\u2019s very worrying, especially at a time when people are at their most vulnerable.\u201d",

      "'Prolonged and very unpleasant'",
      "Friday\u2019s vote is just the latest attempt to introduce assisted dying - it was first debated in Parliament in 1936.",
      "The current bill - called the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill - has been introduced by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater.",

      "Like Mark, he has also been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s but he is not yet in the advanced stages of the disease.",
      "\u201cThe likelihood, if you\u2019ve got Parkinson\u2019s disease, your ending is going to be prolonged and very unpleasant,\u201d he tells BBC News. He supports the bill \u2013 even though it would not give him the right to end his life.",
      "Symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s include parts of the body shaking uncontrollably and slow movement. In the most advanced stages, the disease people can find themselves unable to move and unable to speak.",

      "The example most regularly cited is Canada, which opponents say is an example of a so-called \"slippery slope\".",
      "Legislation introduced there in 2016 was initially just for the terminally ill, but was extended in 2021 to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. There have been delays to further extensions, but it is still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years.",
      "Sir Nicholas says: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand the moral argument, which is that because I wish to exercise sovereignty over my own body, that I am in some way facilitating a 'slippery slope\u2019 for abusive treatment of people who don\u2019t actually want to [end their lives].\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s vote - if it passes - would just be the beginning of a long parliamentary process; weeks of scrutiny by a committee of MPs will follow, as they go through the legislation line-by-line.",
      "The bill will then return to the House of Commons and then the House of Lords where it could be amended in further votes.",
      "Even if MPs vote in favour of the bill - there is still a long way to go before these proposed changes become law.",

Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease. Of the 367 patients who took a lethal dose of medication last year, the vast majority (91.6%) said loss of autonomy was a key concern, while others cited:",

      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",
      "Critics say the more the law is widened, the more disabled and vulnerable people will be put at risk. There has also been a dramatic growth in the number of people using Maid. Four in 100 deaths in Canada are now medically assisted, compared to about one in 100 in Oregon.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP who proposed the assisted dying bill in Westminster, says the Canadian system is not what is being debated for England and Wales, where eligibility would be restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Europe",
      "Across Europe, six countries have some form of legalised assisted dying: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. In all of them - unlike the proposals in England and Wales - help to die is not restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 01:36:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Wearable tech claims to help monitor our health, but many doctors remain sceptical.",
    "story": [
      "Wearable tech \u2013 currently dominated by smart watches - is a multi-billion dollar industry with a sharp focus on health tracking.",
      "Many premium products claim to accurately track exercise routines, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycle and sleep patterns, among others.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",
      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

      "Davies wrote that his approach would have \"united the centre right\" in Wales and \"won over new support to the Conservative Party\".",

      "\"In many cases, it was impossible to offer clarity of message, with statements contradicted publicly by certain members. This made it unclear to the public exactly what the Conservative Party in Wales stands for.\""

      "A World War Two veteran has said Sir Keir Starmer has a \"golden opportunity\" to end what she describes as a \"brutal\" policy of freezing the pensions of some Britons who move overseas.",
      "Anne Puckridge, who is days away from turning 100, is one of just over 453,000 British pensioners living abroad who do not get any annual rise in their state pension.",
      "She has received \u00a372.50 a week since she moved to Canada in 2001, at the age of 76, to be nearer her daughter.",

      "She will meet Pensions Minister Emma Reynolds later, after her request to meet Sir Keir was turned down due to \"pressures on his diary\".",
      "Previous governments have rejected calls to uprate frozen pensions, citing the cost as a barrier.",

      "It comes as Sir Keir Starmer and his Greek counterpart met for talks in Downing Street on Tuesday, though No 10 has said the issue is not on the agenda.",
      "The sculptures were not discussed at the opening of the meeting, according to an official account released by No 10.",

      "The status of the sculptures has been a source of diplomatic tension between the UK and Greece for decades.",
      "Greece says they were stolen, but the British Museum rejects that and says they were legally obtained. Talks between Greece and the museum have been going on since 2021.",
      "What are the Elgin Marbles?",
      "'Every Greek felt offended' - how Athens sees the Elgin Marbles row",
      "Prof Stamatoudi, who advised the Greek culture minister during previous Elgin Marbles negotiations, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme she believes \"a deal is close\" but was unsure if it was \"close enough\".",
      "She said the Greek government has proposed a \"cultural, strategic partnership\" which would involve other antiquities being sent to the British Museum to fill the gallery which would be left vacant by any return.",
      "Negotiations over what could be sent to the British Museum are \"secret\", Prof Stamatoudi said, adding that while she is not personally involved in this round of talks, she believes it would involve \"antiquities that attract public attention\".",
      "Prof Statamoudi said securing the return is something \"all Greeks are passionate about\" as the antiquities are widely considered to be part of the country\u2019s \"cultural heritage\".",
      "Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has made securing the return of the Elgin Marbles a political priority.",
      "The issue caused a diplomatic spat last year when then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak cancelled a planned meeting with Mitsotakis after he indicated he would use it to raise the issue.",
      "The previous government said the sculptures should remain in the museum. In opposition, Labour's view was they wouldn't stand in the way of a loan arrangement between the British Museum and Athens if one was arranged.",
      "Government sources in Athens have told Greek media Mitsotakis wants to \"pick up the thread\" with Starmer following a meeting between the pair in November 2023.",
      "Earlier this week, Greek government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said Mitsotakis would raise the issue again with Starmer but that it was more of a matter for the British Museum than the government.",
      "He also denied a Sky News report that three private meetings had taken place between senior Greek officials and  members of the British Museum board of directors.",
      "Downing Street said Starmer told the Greek prime minister he hoped to \"build on our strong bilateral relationship and to talk about our common issues\", while Mitsotakis said Greece and the UK would strengthen their relationship during \"turbulent times\".",
      "Starmer is thought to be more open to the statues being relocated than his predecessor, providing a deal can be struck between the Greek government and the British Museum.",
      "The Elgin Marbles were crafted in the 5th century BC and were originally displayed in the Parthenon in Athens. They are considered among the most prized antiquities from the Ancient Greek period.",
      "They were removed by British aristocrat Lord Elgin while Athens was part of the Ottoman Empire and were badly damaged en route to London, where they have been displayed since."

      "By the same date, unsafe cladding in buildings over 11 metres should either be fixed or have a date for completion, otherwise landlords will face penalties.",
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner said she was taking \"decisive action\" but campaigners said the proposals were \"extremely disappointing\" and would \"only make a horribly complicated process worse\".",
      "The drive to remove certain types of cladding from buildings was triggered by the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people.",

      "In the years since the fire, there have been efforts to remove similar materials from other tower blocks.",

      "\"The government may be patting itself on the back by announcing a target date for all high-rise buildings in government-funded schemes to have been remediated; however, the building safety fund first opened for registrations in June 2020, so a target date of nine years from then is underwhelming.\"",

      "He also pointed to an increase of \u00a33.4bn in next year\u2019s Scottish Budget.",
      "Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative social security spokeswoman Liz Smith accused ministers of \"hoodwinking\" pensioners by pretending that a full winter fuel payment was being introduced.",

      "Ms Crawford said: \u201cIt would have been absolutely fantastic to be in a position to reinstate the full winter fuel payment for pensioners in Scotland as of now, but we do appreciate that logistically that would just have not been possible.\"",
      "It has been previously reported that up to 40% of eligible pensioners do not apply for Pension Credit.",

      "Yet the number of approvals has risen by just 17% over the same period, while refusals almost doubled from 27,100 to 53,100.",
      "That means 81,000 more pensioners have received the extra cash since the summer, out of a possible 880,000 people who the government believes are eligible for the money.",
      "The UK government is urging pensioners to check if they are eligible for the benefit.",
      "Those who apply before 21 December will receive backdated payments of both Pension Credit and the winter fuel allowance.",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions has deployed 500 extra staff to handle claims for the benefit.",
      "This is a significant policy announcement from the Scottish government.",
      "Having said they would match the UK government\u2019s decision to restrict the winter fuel payment to older people in receipt of Pension Credit, they have now decided to do something different.",
      "They\u2019ve found a bit of extra cash to help the neediest households this winter. They are also promising ALL Scottish pensioner households a winter fuel payment of at least \u00a3100 next year, with the poorest pensioners continuing to receive \u00a3200-\u00a3300.",

      "She met ministers from the federal government in Baghdad and regional leaders in Kurdistan in the north where many smuggling gangs are based.",
      "The agreement will involve greater intelligence sharing and more joint law enforcement operations, all designed to increase the number of smugglers that are prosecuted.",
      "As part of the deal, the UK will give Iraqi law enforcement \u00a3300,000 for training in border security, focused on organised immigration crime and drug trafficking. On top of this, the authorities in the Kurdistan region of Iraq will get support worth \u00a3200,000 to help tighten their border security and tackle irregular migration.",
      "The home secretary was accompanied by Martin Hewitt, the government's new Border Security Commander, who met his Iraqi counterpart. Both men will play a huge role in trying to make the agreement work.",
      "The BBC team were the only broadcast journalists travelling with Cooper. The focus in Baghdad was a half-day meeting with her Iraqi counterpart, Abdul Amir al-Shammari.",
      "They met at the interior ministry before visiting the Iraqi human trafficking centre.",

      "MPs' vote to back the legalisation of assisted dying in England and Wales is historic.",
      "It means such a law has moved a step closer to being passed - but it is only one step along a path likely to last many months. Even then, the legislation could take two years to come into force.",
      "There are still many parliamentary hurdles the Terminally Ill (End of Life) Bill must clear before it becomes law, with five stages handled by MPs and five more by peers, and further rounds of voting.",
      "If it successfully navigates this process, we could see the law change to allow some terminally-ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP behind the bill, told the Commons there would a period of up to two years before any new law was implemented because \"it is more important to get this right than to do it quickly\".",
      "But it is also possible the bill could fall and not become law at all.",

      "The measure was introduced by Labour MP Leadbeater as a private members' bill (PMB), which is a way for backbenchers to bring forward new laws in addition to the government's agenda.",
      "It was also brought forward as a conscience issue, meaning MPs are free to vote according to their beliefs rather than in line with their party.",
      "A bill's first reading is a formality, where Leadbeater read out its name in the Commons and a date was set for the next stage.",
      "The real debate between MPs got under way during its second reading on Friday.",
      "At the end of the debate, Leadbeater's bill was backed in principle by 330 votes to 275.",
      "It will now move on to be scrutinised at committee stage, where it will be scrutinised line by line by a smaller group of MPs.",
      "Report stage then follows, allowing any MPs to propose amendments. The Commons Speaker will decide which ones are debated and voted on.",
      "After this, MPs get a a final chance to vote for or against the bill at what is known as third reading - and some may change their mind about it - after which all five stages must be repeated by peers in the House of Lords.",

      "The government might decide to intervene in the parliamentary process to change some of the normal procedures that apply to PMBs from now on - for example to allow more Commons time at report stage.",
      "But so far it has not indicated it is planning to do this.",
      "A PMB's committee would not normally have the power to call in experts to give evidence, but MPs approved a motion straight after Friday's main vote to allow it to do so.",
      "PMBs do not have timetabled committee sessions, potentially giving extra time to examine the legislation.",
      "The prime minister, who voted for the bill, has said a government impact assessment will be carried out and published as the bill proceeds.",
      "Another issue is that the ministers who heads the two main departments that would have to implement the legislation - Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood - were among the MPs who opposed the bill on Friday.",
      "All bills must complete their parliamentary stages by the end of the year's parliamentary session. These are not set in stone.",
      "Report stage onwards needs to take place during the Friday sessions set aside for PMBs, and can run only from 25 April.",
      "In practical terms, that means the committee stage needs to be completed quite  quickly to leave sufficient time for the remaining stages of the bill to take place.",
      "A particular risk to the bill's passage could be at report stage where, if many  amendments are tabled, Parliament could run out of time to debate them all.",
      "Throughout the parliamentary process, lobbying from both sides will continue to shore up support and change MPs' minds, in time for the final vote."

      "For the first time in almost a decade, MPs will vote on Friday on giving terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death. While it\u2019s something that remains illegal in most countries, more than 300 million people now live in countries which have legalised assisted dying.",

      "The proposed bill in England and Wales comes with safeguards supporters say will make it the strictest set of rules in the world, with patients needing the approval of a High Court judge. Critics on the other hand say changing the law would be a dangerous step that would place the vulnerable at risk. They argue the focus should be on improving patchy access to palliative care.",

      "The US",
      "Across the US, assisted dying - which some critics prefer to call assisted suicide - is legal in 10 states, as well as in Washington DC. Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease. Of the 367 patients who took a lethal dose of medication last year, the vast majority (91.6%) said loss of autonomy was a key concern, while others cited:",

      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",
      "Critics say the more the law is widened, the more disabled and vulnerable people will be put at risk. There has also been a dramatic growth in the number of people using Maid. Four in 100 deaths in Canada are now medically assisted, compared to about one in 100 in Oregon.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP who proposed the assisted dying bill in Westminster, says the Canadian system is not what is being debated for England and Wales, where eligibility would be restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Europe",
      "Across Europe, six countries have some form of legalised assisted dying: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. In all of them - unlike the proposals in England and Wales - help to die is not restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",
      "In both countries, patients can self-administer the lethal medication. But it can also be administered by a doctor or nurse, usually via an intravenous injection.",

    "story": [
      "The first snow of winter has fallen in Sanmartin, a village in Romania\u2019s eastern Carpathian mountains.",
      "Shepherd J\u00f3zsef R\u00e1cz and his sons keep 500 ewes up on the high pasture here. It\u2019s a hard life: when he\u2019s not worrying about milking his sheep, which he does three times a day, he\u2019s worrying about protecting them from predators.",
      "Each year, J\u00f3zsef loses five or six of his herd to a wolf, or a bear. It\u2019s why he keeps 17 dogs.",
      "\u201cA good dog is the best tool a shepherd has, to protect his flock at night, and in the daytime too,\u201d the farmer says.",
      "On Tuesday, 45 years of strict protection for grey wolves in Europe came to an end, after conservation officials adopted EU measures to downgrade the animal's protected status.",
      "The news means that grey wolves will be moved from Annex II (strictly protected) to Annex III (protected) of the Bern Convention.",
      "This will remove many of the safeguards that have allowed the animals to flourish in Europe and means each EU country will be able to set an annual quota of wolves to kill.",
      "The Commission argued that the number of wolves in the EU has almost doubled, from 11,000 in 2012 to over 20,000 today, and that they were causing too much damage to livestock.",
      "But wildlife campaigners say improved protection methods, including trained sheep dogs, would be a better solution than removing safeguards. They say that wolves keep down numbers of deer and wild boar, which damage trees and crops. Wolves also prevent the spread of diseases by eating sick animals.",
      "In the town of Baile Tusnad, in a valley near J\u00f3zsef\u2019s village, wildlife experts met recently to discuss large carnivores. Most, though not all, oppose the hunting of wolves and bears.",
      "\u201cAfrican swine fever is spreading all over Europe,\u201d said Michal Haring, a biologist from Slovakia, \u201cand the wolf is a very good \u2018doctor\u2019 for this, suppressing the disease. Wolves cannot catch it.\u201d",
      "Another argument against shooting wolves is that they hunt in packs of five to eight, usually a pair and their offspring. If the older wolves are shot, the pack fragments, making it harder for them to catch deer and wild boar.",
      "\u201cIndividual wolves are more likely to attack sheep and other domesticated animals,\u201d Mr Haring explains.",
      "Campaigners also pointed to a 2023 EU report, which states that only around 50,000 of Europe\u2019s 68 million sheep and goats are killed by wolves each year \u2013 0.065% of the total number \u2013 adding that the overall impact of wolves on EU livestock is \u201cvery small\u201d.",
      "Moreover, it says there have been no fatal wolf attacks on humans for 40 years.",
      "\u201cIf we expect countries like India or Indonesia to protect their tigers,\u201d says Laurent Schley, head of the Wildlife department in the Luxembourg government, \u201cand Africans to protect lions and elephants, then we as relatively rich Europeans should be willing to tolerate some wolves.\u201d Luxembourg is one of the few western European countries where no wolves have been sighted yet, Mr Schley believes it\u2019s only a matter of time.",
      "\u201cWe have very high densities of deer and wild boar, so the conditions for the wolf are there.",
      "\"Of course, if individual wolves or packs start killing too much livestock, or were to show aggression towards humans, we would have to draw the line. Human safety always comes first.\u201d",
      "But back on the mountainside, J\u00f3zsef says wolves are dangerous because \u201cthey\u2019re clever animals\u201d. He favours tougher legal measures to cull the predators.",
      "Bears approach through the forest, treading on branches and alerting his dogs, J\u00f3zsef says: if they break into the wickerwork enclosure where his herd stay at night, they will only grab one animal.",
      "If a pack of wolves get in though, they can kill dozens of sheep at a time.",
      "Last year, J\u00f3zsef\u2019s favourite dog, Moody, was killed by wolves, in broad daylight, as they moved from one pasture to the next. All they found was his bloodied pelt.",
      "The more wolves there are, J\u00f3zsef says, the more likely they will take his sheep.",
      "And it takes a long time to train a good dog."

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 01:12:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Governments don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay more, argues an expert.",
    "story": [
      "It is the perfect start to a holiday: your plane ticket is cheap, your cabin baggage is safely stowed, the engines are roaring into life - and the pilot has announced that there\u2019s no need to worry about the environmental impact.",
      "This is Jet Zero, a vision where air travel is entirely carbon neutral thanks to new technology and green ventures that offset the environmental impact. The plan was drafted in 2022 when Boris Johnson was prime minister, marking a step towards the government\u2019s legal obligation to reach net zero by 2050. The Labour government has since made a similar pledge, and in addition it wants all domestic flights and UK airport operations to reach zero emissions by 2040.",
      "This is no easy feat when you consider the scale of the challenge: one passenger taking an economy-class flight from London to New York generates 309kg of carbon dioxide, which would take roughly a year to absorb via 10 mature trees.",
      "Multiply this on the global scale and the aviation industry would need to plant roughly 100 billion mature trees each year to offset its emissions. For UK emissions alone you\u2019d need a forest almost the size of Wales.",
      "So, just how realistic is the plan to hit Jet Zero by 2050? And what is the knock-on cost for passengers?",
      "Earlier this year, Anthony Browne, who was the aviation minister in the Conservative government at the time, said that he thought any increase in ticket prices would be \u201cmarginal\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe don't think the difference will be noticeable to most consumers,\u201d he said.",
      "But some experts claim that politicians are not being realistic. Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, argues that there \u201cdefinitely would be higher cost\u201d.",
      "\u201cGovernments desperately don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay for what they do.\u201d",
      "But ultimately, the cost depends on which methods are employed to cut or reduce emissions.",
      "From sharklets to UltraFans",
      "The previous government said that it aimed reach Jet Zero by focusing on \"the rapid development of technologies\u201d, as well as operational improvements and - among other things - more sustainable fuel types.",
      "This is not an entirely new quest. Aircraft around the world have been steadily getting cleaner since 1969 when the first high-bypass turbofan engines were used on the new Boeing 747 aircraft. In the years since there have been other innovations including sharklets, or upturned wing tips on modern planes that reduce drag and save, on average, 4% of fuel per trip.",
      "More developments are in the pipeline, including a new type of jet engine, developed by Rolls Royce, called the \u201cUltraFan\u201d, which will reduce average fuel consumption by 10%.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s a gearbox, the turbine can run very fast, much more efficiently, the fan can run slower and be much bigger,\u201c explains Simon Burr, a director at Rolls-Royce.",
      "The problem is that, though it was first tested in 2023, it\u2019s unlikely to be available on commercial aircraft until the 2030s because of production lead times - and even then, a 10% improvement is impressive but not a game changer.",
      "Aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions come primarily through jet engines using carbon-rich fossil fuels, which produce CO2 when burned, so there have been attempts to create an alternative type made from renewable biomass and waste resources, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).",
      "The first SAF flight ran between London and Amsterdam in 2008 using fuel derived from a mixture of Brazilian babassu nuts and coconuts.",
      "Now the British government says that 22% of all jet fuel from UK aviation has to come from sustainable sources by 2040. But this comes with further challenges.",
      "In the UK, SAF is mainly made from cooking oil, some of which is shipped from Asia, and shipping is responsible for 2% of global CO2 emissions.",
      "Alternative methods of creating SAF require large quantities of electricity as part of the manufacturing process. This would involve a vast amount of renewable energy to make it sustainable.",
      "\"It's very hard, to think there is such a thing as a sustainable aviation fuel,\u201d says Sir Dieter Helm. \u201cThere are aviation fuels that are less polluting than the ones being used at the moment, and you can use elements of biofuel and chip fat and so on.",
      "\"Think about the scale that's required to do it.\u201d",
      "Remapping the sky",
      "There is another more unexpected way that airlines could reduce emissions. That is, making their flight paths more direct to reduce fuel consumption.",
      "Currently most planes fly on routes determined by a network of beacons, many of which were put in place decades ago. As a result they don\u2019t always fly by the shortest route, but \"airspace modernisation\", as it is known, will allow for straighter paths to destinations.",
      "Satellite technology is required to do this: aircraft flying over the Atlantic used to have to fly at least 40 miles apart, but the satellite technology means that aircraft can in theory fly as close as 14 miles apart, allowing more aircraft to fly on the direct flight paths.",
      "The Jet Zero Strategy estimates that this, together with other fuel efficiency improvements, could cut emissions by as much as 15% by 2050.",
      "But the National Air Traffic Services (NATS), which control most flights in and out of England and Wales, caution that these changes are neither easy nor quick. \u201cIt's a very, very complicated thing to do,\u201d warns Chris Norsworthy, director of future planning.",
      "\u201cThe national infrastructure change of this type takes many years. The deployments we've made already are years in the making.\u201d",
      "The electric plane race",
      "Hidden away in a mini aircraft hangar of sorts, just outside Bristol, inventor Stephen Fitzpatrick has spent seven years working on a pioneering aircraft that could be the basis of another solution. His carbon fibre creation, known as VX4, has eight propellers and looks like a giant drone, but what's crucial is that it doesn\u2019t use fuel. Instead it is powered by lithium-ion batteries similar to those in electric cars.",
      "The batteries alone weigh 800kg, which brings the first challenge: the sheer weight limits how far it can fly.",
      "Mr Fitzpatrick says the VX4 will have a range of around 100 miles to begin with. \u201cEach year the batteries that we use will improve... Over time, we\u2019ll be able to develop a hybrid powertrain, probably using hydrogen fuel cells and batteries, and that will increase the range further.\u201d",
      "The prospect of replacing jet engine-powered long-haul flights is, however, remote. \u201cThere is no battery chemistry in the world that will give us the energy we need to take hundreds of passengers over the Atlantic,\u201d he concedes.",
      "Harnessing hydrogen in other ways may be a better bet.",
      "The British-American aircraft company, ZeroAvia, says it expects to have an 80-seater powered entirely by hydrogen in the air within two to three years. Airbus is developing something similar.",
      "Both are propeller planes, however, with limited speeds and ranges.",
      "The pricetag for passengers",
      "The reductions from SAF, fuel efficiency improvements and zero carbon aircraft will only cut aviation emissions by around a third, according to the previous government's estimates. So another part of the Jet Zero strategy involves a pricing scheme to charge airlines for CO2 emissions and carbon offsetting.",
      "Airlines already pay a duty for each flight someone takes in the UK, a cost that is passed to passengers. In much of the UK (excluding Scotland) this adds \u00a37 to each domestic flight, \u00a314 to short-haul ones and \u00a392 for long-haul. But carbon offsetting means paying another fee.",
      "Some schemes have been highly controversial, with questions around how to prove how many trees have been prevented from being cut down.",
      "Cait Hewitt, policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation, is concerned that the current informal offsetting projects may be counterproductive: \u201cThey could actually have made that problem a bit worse over time by giving consumers the false impression that the emissions from their flight [are] being cancelled out somehow by an offset.\u201d",
      "The Lebanon ceasefire is a respite, not a solution for the Middle East",
      "How service charges in flats spiralled out of control",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "Duncan McCourt, chief executive of Sustainable Aviation, an umbrella group for UK airlines, airports, manufacturers and others in the business, is optimistic that removing carbon from flying won\u2019t add much more than a few pounds to the cost of an airline ticket.",
      "\u201cWe think we can do it while enabling people to continue to fly and continue to get that benefit of flying, such as connecting people, such as being able to go on holiday,\u201d he says.",
      "But the Jet Zero plan says nothing directly about the knock-on cost to passengers. Instead, it refers to \u201cdemand management\u201d.",
      "Sir Dieter Helm has his own take on what Jet Zero means for holidaymakers and fully believes that it will lead to higher costs. As for the likelihood of the government hitting its Jet Zero target on time, he is unconvinced of this too, but he also suggests that this may not be the point.",
      "\u201cIt depends whether you think Jet Zero is\u2026 genuinely a target and they mean to achieve it. I'm really sceptical about the second.\u201d",
      "And now, the number of flights taken annually by people in the UK is projected to rise even further, translating into an additional 150 million more flights a year. So the scale of the government's challenge, which was large enough when it began, is only set to grow.",

    "summary": "The carmaker's new look is praised as \"exciting\" but others say it should \"go back to the drawing board\".",
    "story": [
      "Luxury car maker Jaguar has unveiled its new electric concept car and, like a recent controversial teaser video, it has divided opinion.",
      "Some on social media said the new Type 00 car was \"exciting\" and \"absolutely stunning\", while others called it \"rubbish\" and told Jaguar's designers to \"go back to the drawing board\".",
      "The carmaker, which is embarking on the biggest change in its history, announced a new logo and released a so-called \"social media tease\" last month, ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand.",
      "Many critics pointed out that the promotional video did not feature an actual car but the firm was also praised by some for its bold new approach.",
      "Last month, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) stopped selling new Jaguar cars in the UK ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand in 2026.",
      "Sales of its cars have been plummeting in recent years, and some have argued that as its traditional, heritage image does not seem to be working, the rebranding is a gamble with a limited downside.",
      "Following the deluge of publicity following last month's teaser video, Jaguar urged people to \"trust and reserve judgement\" over the rebrand of the business, which has a history dating back more than a century.",
      "The Type 00 model unveiled at a Miami art fair is a concept car and so will not go into production for sale to the public.",
      "However, it gives a pointer to the direction of the brand's new models, which are expected to cost in excess of \u00a3100,000 when they go on sale.",
      "Jaguar's chief creative officer, Gerry McGovern, said he welcomed the attention the new direction had been getting.",
      "\"It has already stirred emotions and it will continue to,\" he said. \"Jaguar has no desire to be loved by everybody.\"",
      "Car industry analyst Karl Brauer was sceptical. The company seems to be \"sacrificing Jaguar's past to the hopes of a better future,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work.\"",
      "Many on social media said the new model looked similar to existing cars, and James May, broadcaster and former presenter of Top Gear, said he was \"slightly disappointed\" by it.",
      "\"I wanted something more futuristic,\" he told the BBC. \"I mean, Jaguar have been saying they will copy nothing, but there's quite a bit of other concept cars in that new Jag.\"",
      "'Too big'",
      "Beatrix Keim, director at the Center of Automotive Research, said that Jaguar's concept car was \"too big, too unreal\".",
      "\"This is not the way to go,\" she said, given that there are already big cars in the market and \"electric cars cannot only be for the rich\".",
      "\"Of course, Jaguar is a luxury brand,\" she added. \"But I don't think that this is the direction which Jaguar at current point of time needs, because it's losing out on volume as well. And this is not a volume car.\u201d",
      "Amanda Stretton, a racing driver and motoring journalist, also agreed the Jaguar concept car was too big.",
      "\"It's an absolute nonsense,\" she said. \"It needs to be shrunk by about 50% to be practical.\"",
      "Should you pay more for parking if you have a big car?",
      "But Andy Palmer, a former boss of Aston Martin and Nissan's ex-chief operating officer, said Jaguar needed to change as it had been \"failing as a brand for a long time now\".",
      "He called the new design \"a brave change of direction\" although he agreed it was \"huge\".",
      "\"The rhetoric around electric cars has to be one of how you move the cars to being more affordable,\" he said. \"Jaguar is an outlier.\"",
      "Stretton also said Jaguar was going in the \"wrong direction\" on price.",
      "\"The market for cars in excess of \u00a3100,000 is not enormous. So Jaguar\u2019s trying to break into a market that's already tightly fought.\"",
      "May said Jaguar cars had traditionally been \"very reasonably priced compared with, for example, Aston Martin\".",
      "\"So I'd like to see something more like half the price that they're toting at the moment.\"",
      "JLR said the decision to stop selling new Jaguar cars in the UK last month was a deliberate move to \"create some breathing space\" before unveiling its new look.",
      "It announced the transition to electric vehicles in 2021, keeping all of its three British plants open as part of the strategy.",
      "Jaguar has been the weakest link within the JLR group, which has been owned by Tata Motors for almost a decade.",
      "Jaguar sold 180,000 cars in 2018, but last year sales were down to 67,000.",
      "The Range Rover and Land Rover Defender were behind JLR's highest profits since 2015, which were announced earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "Wearable tech \u2013 currently dominated by smart watches - is a multi-billion dollar industry with a sharp focus on health tracking.",
      "Many premium products claim to accurately track exercise routines, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycle and sleep patterns, among others.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",
      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

    "summary": "Ads for games are meant to say if they contain loot boxes - BBC News has found most do not.",
    "story": [
      "The most popular mobile games in the UK are being advertised without disclosing they contain loot boxes - random in-game purchases which critics say are \"exploitative\" and \"foster addiction\".",
      "The regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), says it bans and removes ads which fail to make the clear whether or not a game contains a loot box.",
      "But a BBC investigation found only two of the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store actually followed those rules.",
      "Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers & Gamblers Education Trust (Ygam), called the findings \"deeply concerning\".",
      "\"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the ASA said: \"This is an ongoing area of our work, and we\u2019re closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly.\"",
      "However, some say the regulator lacks the teeth to deal with the problem.",
      "\"The ASA, although it has upheld some complaints, it takes so long to properly process all of these things - they will go to a company and say, 'you should comply', but they don't comply,\" said Leon Y  Xiao, a video game regulation researcher at the IT University of Copenhagen.",
      "\"People are walking into a video game not knowing the potential risks, and this is assuming that people have even understood the risk of loot boxes to begin with.\"",
      "What is a loot box?",
      "Loot boxes contain random digital items that gamers can only reveal through gameplay or - more controversially - by making a payment.",
      "Game-makers have previously defended them as being akin to a chocolate egg containing a plastic toy, with children not knowing exactly what they are getting until the egg is bought and opened.",
      "But critics say they are in fact a form of gambling, with a report in 2022 by the Norwegian Consumer Council concluding they \"often involve exploiting consumers through predatory mechanisms, fostering addiction, targeting vulnerable consumer groups and more.\"",
      "The same year, the UK government resisted pressure to regulate loot boxes, saying the video game industry could self-regulate instead.",
      "Trade body Ukie published guidance in July 2023, including the requirement to disclose loot boxes prior to games being purchased, which the industry was given a year to comply with.",
      "But, more than 12 months later, the BBC has discovered the vast majority of major mobile games containing loot boxes are still flouting the rules, with most games only disclosing their presence if would-be players tap a small information button on the Play Store.",
      "Adrian Hon, head of game developer Six to Start, said the games industry had a track record of \"conveniently ignoring or forgetting regulations that might interfere with their ability to sell to players\".",
      "\"We know that many people, including children, struggle with overspending on loot boxes,\" he said, adding they were deliberately designed to be \"habit-forming\".",
      "\"The least that games companies could do is disclose the presence of loot boxes, but they won't even do that - it's an indictment of their priorities and lack of care towards vulnerable players.\"",
      "Non-compliance",
      "The BBC checked the adverts for the top 45 highest grossing games on Google's Play Store, which along with Apple's App Store are where the vast majority of people access mobile games.",
      "Of those 45, 26 were labelled as including loot boxes - 22 of which were being actively advertised at the same time.",
      "However, only two of those titles spelt out the presence of the loot boxes in their ads.",
      "The highest-grossing game on the Play Store to contain loot boxes, Monopoly GO, was among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts.",
      "The game has been downloaded more than 50 million times, generating more than $3bn (\u00a32.37bn) in revenue according to the IP's owner Hasbro.",
      "Mr Xiao told the BBC the findings were in line with preliminary results of his own research, which has also found around 90% of games containing loot boxes are not disclosing this in their ads.",
      "The BBC has approached Hasbro, Meta and the ASA for comment.",
      "Zo\u00eb Osmond, CEO of GambleAware, said she was \"extremely concerned\" about \"gambling-like activities\" becoming normalised for children.",

      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Thermal imaging tech has become cheaper and homeowners are using it to track down heat loss.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s like X-ray vision \u2013 for heat loss. Last year, web engineer Jamie Matthews bought a thermal imaging camera. His home, in the southeast of England, was about to give up some of its secrets.",
      "The colourful images on the device\u2019s small screen soon revealed how his loft hatch was letting him down.",
      "\u201cThat was really obvious on the camera,\u201d he says, explaining that he could see cool areas on the hatch, where heat was apparently escaping.",
      "Mr Mathews, who runs a software company that supplies the clean tech industry, also found some other small gaps in external walls and parts of his roof that appeared less well insulated than others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good fun and it certainly shows up things that may not be immediately obvious,\u201d he says.",
      "While Mr Matthews was able to draught-proof some areas himself, he says he would take a more methodical approach if he were planning any major changes to his home. The web engineer later had a professional heat loss survey carried out when he installed a heat pump, for example.",
      "That approach is sensible, according to building physics researchers who spoke to the BBC. There are signs that thermal cameras are becoming more popular, as homeowners seek to slash their heating bills and carbon emissions. Local councils are increasingly allowing residents to borrow the devices for free, for example.",
      "But there is no substitute for professional advice if you are planning big works or interventions, experts say.",
      "Thermal cameras work by using a sensor to detect infrared light, which we cannot see, but which we can sometimes feel as heat. Such devices aren\u2019t cheap. Mr Matthews spent roughly \u00a3160 on his, though organisations including local councils and energy supplier Octopus Energy do loan them out to people free of charge so that they can gain a basic understanding of heat loss in their homes.",
      "Wiltshire Council recently made 11 devices available to borrow from local libraries, as well as a brief guide on how to use them. There has been \u201chuge uptake\u201d says Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, such that the council now has a waiting list for interested residents.",
      "\"Expert advice, combined with a measured approach to the findings from thermal imaging, will give residents the best chance of making informed decisions about energy-saving home improvements,\" says Cllr Blair-Pilling.",
      "Small interventions could help people keep their homes warm and reduce the risk of cold-related health conditions, he adds.",
      "However, Jo Atkinson, senior consultant in buildings decarbonisation at Energy Systems Catapult, a research organisation, expresses concern over the growing availability of thermal cameras: \u201cIn my opinion, the risks are too great for making the wrong choices.\u201d",
      "It is possible to misinterpret thermal camera images, she says, noting that if a wall has been warmed by the sun, an image of that wall taken outside could make it look as though heat is escaping, when it is not. Reflective surfaces can also appear, misleadingly, to be leaking heat.",
      "While using a thermal camera as a starting point for understanding your home is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, according to Ronita Bardhan at the University of Cambridge, it is important to ask for independent expert advice when planning any renovation works.",
      "Thermal camera imagery can make it look as though some areas of your home are losing a lot of heat, but this might simply be a result of how the camera has been calibrated, how the user holds it and moves it around, and which colour palette was chosen for the display.",
      "Dr Bardhan adds that there is a risk of triggering \u201cretrofit anxiety\u201d in homeowners.",
      "Plus, if people go on to alter their insulation, for example, such measures should be taken with great care as improper installation can cause damp and mould.",
      "North Somerset Council provides thermal cameras to residents, on loan, and this scheme is also currently operating on a waiting list basis due to its popularity. The Council has published introductory advice on how to use the cameras, including an online video.",
      "The Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a charity, highlights a more detailed guide from the National House-Building Council, which describes how to use thermal cameras. However, a CSE spokeswoman adds that the organisation still recommends people seek expert advice.",
      "Phil Steele, future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy, agrees: \u201cYou have got to be careful.\u201d Thermal cameras can, for instance, make the corners of rooms look very cold but this is simply a reflection of reduced air circulation in those areas, rather than an insulation problem, he explains.",
      "Octopus Energy has around 500 cameras that it loans out to customers every winter. Last year, the firm distributed the devices roughly 3,800 times.",
      "Thermal camera-wielding homeowners who have spoken to the BBC, such as Mr Matthews, say they have treated the imagery with caution.",
      "Louise Green, a designer in London, says she read online training materials before using a thermal camera to search for points of heat loss in a house shortly after she and her partner moved in.",
      "In her case, Miss Green rented the camera from Library of Things, a community-focused organisation that makes various items available for people to borrow. The device indicated loss of heat around windows and doors in Miss Green\u2019s home. She and her partner were able to compare the results to their neighbour\u2019s better-insulated property.",
      "\u201cIt just confirmed what we knew already, but it was still interesting to see, you know, were there any other areas?\u201d she explains.",
      "Darrell Taylor at Flir, a firm that makes thermal cameras, says that members of the public can access some free training materials on his company\u2019s website.",
      "He adds that Flir aims to make thermal images as clear and easy to interpret as possible \u2013 including by merging optical imagery with thermal imagery, to add more detail to the final picture. And he suggests that, in the future, Flir cameras may offer machine learning-based instructions and advice as people use the devices.",
      "Those who know how best to interpret thermal camera imagery can find extraordinary hidden problems in a building, though.",
      "Dr Bardhan recently took a very high resolution camera to a viewing of a house she was considering buying. But the thermal images revealed cracks in a wall, which later proved to be signs of subsidence.",
      "\u201cThat would probably not have been exposed unless I had gone in and seen it,\u201d she says. Dr Bardhan decided not to make an offer on the property.",

    "summary": "She is now in a race for her life - if she can pay back 75% of what she took, she could be spared.",
    "story": [
      "Vietnamese property tycoon Truong My Lan has lost her appeal against her death sentence for masterminding the world\u2019s biggest bank fraud.",
      "The 68-year-old is now in a race for her life because the law in Vietnam states that if she can pay back 75% of what she took, her sentence will be commuted to life imprisonment.",
      "In April the trial court found that Truong My Lan had secretly controlled Saigon Commercial Bank, the country\u2019s fifth biggest lender, and taken out loans and cash over more than 10 years through a web of shell companies, amounting to a total of $44bn (\u00a334.5bn).",
      "Of that prosecutors say $27bn was misappropriated, and $12bn was judged to have been embezzled, the most serious financial crime for which she was sentenced to death.",
      "It was a rare and shocking verdict - she is one of very few women in Vietnam to be sentenced to death for a white collar crime.",
      "On Tuesday, the court said there was no basis to reduce Truong My Lan's death sentence. However, she could still avoid execution if she returns $9bn, three-quarters of the $12bn she embezzled. It's not her final appeal and she can still petition the president for amnesty.",
      "During her trial Truong My Lan was sometimes defiant, but in the recent hearings for her appeal against the sentence she was more contrite.",
      "She said she was embarrassed to have been such a drain on the state, and that her only thought was to pay back what she had taken.",
      "Born into a Sino-Vietnamese family in Ho Chi Minh City, Truong My Lan started as a market stall vendor, selling cosmetics with her mother. She began buying land and property after the Communist Party introduced economic reform in 1986. By the 1990s, she owned a large portfolio of hotels and restaurants.",
      "When she was convicted and sentenced in April, she was the chairwoman of a prominent real estate firm, Van Thinh Phat Group. It was a dramatic moment in the \"Blazing Furnaces\" anti-corruption campaign led by then-Communist Party Secretary-General, Nguyen Phu Trong.",
      "All of the remaining 85 defendants were convicted. Four were sentenced to life in jail, while the rest -including Truong My Lan's husband and niece - were given prison terms ranging from 20 years to three years suspended.",
      "The State Bank of Vietnam is believed to have spent many billions of dollars recapitalising Saigon Commercial Bank to prevent a wider banking panic. The prosecutors argued that her crimes were \"huge and without precedent\" and did not justify leniency.",
      "Truong My Lan\u2019s lawyers said she was working as fast as she could to find the $9bn needed. But cashing in her assets has proven difficult.",
      "Some are luxury properties in Ho Chi Minh City which could, in theory, be sold quite quickly. Others are in the form of shares or stakes in other businesses or property projects.",
      "In all the state has identified more than a thousand different assets linked to the fraud. These have been frozen by the authorities for now. The BBC understands the tycoon has also reached out to friends to raise loans for her to help reach the target.",
      "Her lawyers have argued for leniency from the judges on financial grounds. They said that while she is under sentence of death it would be hard for her to negotiate the best price for selling her assets and investments, and so harder for her to raise $9bn.",
      "She could do much better if under a life sentence instead, they say.",
      "\u201cThe total value of her holdings actually exceeds the required compensation amount,\u201d lawyer Nguyen Huy Thiep told the BBC before her appeal was rejected.",
      "\u201cHowever, these require time and effort to sell, as many of the assets are real estate and take time to liquidate. Truong My Lan hopes the court can create the most favourable conditions for her to continue making compensation.\u201d",
      "Few had expected the judges to be moved by these arguments. She is now, in effect, in a race with the executioner to raise the funds she needs.",
      "Vietnam treats the death penalty as a state secret. The government does not publish how many people are on death row, though human rights groups say there are more than 1,000 and that Vietnam is one of the world\u2019s biggest executioners.",
      "Typically there are long delays, often many years before sentences are carried out, although prisoners are given very little notice.",

      "Shared on 3 October, the post included a video that showed Yati Narsinghanand delivering comments against Prophet Muhammad that many Muslims found hurtful.",
      "The 60-year-old priest is the head of the powerful Dasna Devi temple in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Ghaziabad town and has been repeatedly in the news for openly calling for violence against Muslims. In 2022, he was arrested for making Islamophobic and misogynistic comments and spent a month in jail.",

Police opened a case against the fact-checker after Uditya Tyagi \u2013 a politician from India\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a close aide of the priest - lodged a complaint.",
      "In the initial complaint, Zubair faced somewhat milder charges - including promoting enmity between different religious groups, defamation and giving false evidence. But last week, police added Section 152 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita - as India\u2019s new legal code is called - to the list of charges, accusing him of \u201cendangering sovereignty, unity and integrity of India\u201d.",
      "This, legal experts say, allows police to arrest Zubair. His lawyer has sought interim bail and also asked the court to throw out the case.",

      "But the messages we\u2019ve received are almost uniformly bleak, suggesting that motivation is a problem.",
      "Some questioned whether one of the operation\u2019s initial goals - to divert Russian soldiers from Ukraine\u2019s eastern front - had worked.",
      "The orders now, they said, were to hang onto this small sliver of Russian territory until a new US president, with new policies, arrives in the White House at the end of January.",
      "\u201cThe main task facing us is to hold the maximum territory until Trump\u2019s inauguration and the start of negotiations,\u201d Pavlo said. \u201cIn order to exchange it for something later. No-one knows what.\u201d",
      "Towards the end of November, President Zelensky indicated that both sides had the change of US administration in mind.",
      "\u201cI am sure that he [Putin] wants to push us out by 20 January,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt is very important for him to demonstrate that he controls the situation. But he does not control the situation.\u201d",
      "In an effort to help Ukraine thwart Russian counterattacks in Kursk, the US, UK and France have all permitted Kyiv to use long-range weapons on targets inside Russia.",
      "It doesn\u2019t seem to have done much to lift spirits.",
      "\u201cNo-one sits in a cold trench and prays for missiles,\u201d Pavlo said.",
      "\u201cWe live and fight here and now. And missiles fly somewhere else.\u201d",
      "Atacms and Storm Shadow missiles may have been used to powerful, even devastating, effect on distant command posts and ammunition dumps, but such successes seem remote to soldiers on the front lines.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about missiles,\u201d Myroslav said. \u201cIn the bunkers we talk about family and rotation. About simple things.\u201d",
      "For Ukraine, Russia\u2019s slow, grinding advance in eastern Ukraine underlines the necessity of clinging on in Kursk.",
      "In October alone, Russia was able to occupy an estimated 500 sq km of Ukrainian territory, the most it\u2019s taken since the early days of the full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "By contrast, Ukraine has already lost around 40% of the territory it seized in Kursk in August.",
      "\u201cThe key is not to capture but to hold,\u201d Vadym said, \u201cand we\u2019re struggling a bit with that.\u201d",
      "Despite the losses, Vadym thinks the Kursk campaign is still vital.",
      "\u201cIt did manage to divert some [Russian] forces from the Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions,\u201d he said.",
      "But some of the soldiers we spoke to said they felt they were in the wrong place, that it was more important to be on Ukraine\u2019s eastern front, rather than occupying part of Russia.",
      "\u201cOur place should have been there [in eastern Ukraine], not here in someone else\u2019s land,\u201d Pavlo said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need these Kursk forests, in which we left so many comrades.\u201d",
      "And despite weeks of reports suggesting that as many as 10,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Kursk to join the Russian counter-offensive, the soldiers we\u2019ve been in contact have yet to encounter them.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen or heard anything about Koreans, alive or dead,\u201d Vadym responded when we asked about the reports.",
      "The Ukrainian military has released recordings which it says are intercepts of North Korean radio communications.",
      "Soldiers said they had been told to capture at least one North Korean prisoner, preferably with documents.",
      "They spoke of rewards - drones or extra leave - being offered to anyone who successfully captures a North Korean soldier.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to find a Korean in the dark Kursk forest,\u201d Pavlo noted sarcastically. \u201cEspecially if he\u2019s not here.\u201d",
      "Veterans of previous doomed operations see parallels in what\u2019s happening in Kursk.",
      "From October 2023 until July this year, Ukrainian forces attempted to hold onto a tiny bridgehead at Krynky, on the left bank of the Dnipro River, some 25 miles (40km) upstream from the liberated city of Kherson.",
      "The bridgehead, initially intended as a possible springboard for advances further into Russian-held territory in southern Ukraine, was eventually lost.",
      "The operation was hugely costly. As many as 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers are thought to have been killed or gone missing.",
      "Some came to see it as a stunt, designed to distract attention from the lack of progress elsewhere.",
      "They fear something similar might be happening in Kursk.",
      "\u201cGood idea but bad implementation,\u201d says Myroslav, a marine officer who served in Krynky and is now in Kursk.",
      "\u201cMedia effect, but no military result.\u201d",
      "Military analysts insist that for all the hardship, the Kursk campaign continues to play an important role.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the only area where we maintain the initiative,\u201d Serhiy Kuzan, of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Centre, told me.",
      "He acknowledged that Ukrainian forces were experiencing \u201cincredibly difficult conditions\u201d in Kursk, but said Russia was devoting vast resources to ejecting them - resources which it would prefer to be using elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThe longer we can hold this Kursk front - with adequate equipment, artillery, Himars and of course long-range weapons to strike their rear - the better,\u201d he said.",
      "In Kyiv, the senior commanders stand by the Kursk operation, arguing that it\u2019s still reaping military and political rewards.",
      "\"This situation annoys Putin,\u201d one said recently, on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe is suffering heavy losses there.\"",
      "As for how long Ukrainian troops would be able to hold out in Kursk, the answer was straightforward.",

      "The ruling party, Georgian Dream, says it won the vote fair and square and insists it\u2019s the largely ceremonial president, Salome Zourabichvili, who has no legitimacy. Her time in office is almost up, so why is it she is the one who plans to stay on to maintain stability, it asks.",

      "Whatever the extent of contacts, Moscow is bound to prefer Georgian Dream, who have within a short period trashed Georgia\u2019s links with the EU and US, to a passionately pro-Western opposition.",
      "The nightly protests show no sign yet of abating, despite temperatures falling close to freezing, and there is no indication yet of a resolution.",
      "Georgia has seen protests before, but not like this, says Lasha Dzebisashvili. Public servants from all walks of life have signed letters and petitions, and several ambassadors have resigned, including Georgia\u2019s ambassador to the US, a clear blow for the ruling party.",
      "The long stretch of Rustaveli Avenue is where this story will play out in front of parliament in Tbilisi, but the protests are being felt in other towns and cities too, including Batumi and Poti on the Black Sea, Zugdidi in the north-west and Kutaisi.",
      "On Sunday night, a large crowd of protesters formed outside the public broadcaster, demanding that the president be given airtime rather than the usual pro-government fare.",
      "It didn\u2019t happen and gradually the protesters marched towards the centre of the capital, halting the traffic and chanting \u201cGeorgia, Georgia\u201d.",
      "Nika Gvaramia and his fellow opposition leaders believe the clear way out is for free and fair elections, not under the existing election commission but under the auspices of the EU and US: \u201cIf Georgian Dream is sure they won the elections, let\u2019s go with new ones.\u201d",
      "That seems highly unlikely as it would require an implicit admission that the original vote was unfair.",

      "But 20 January is a long way ahead and this small state in the Caucasus will not be top of his agenda. And Georgia\u2019s business sector for one will not be happy with a continuing stalemate or with the government doing lasting damage to ties with the West."

      "Prosecutors have asked that Filippo Turetta, 22, be sentenced to life in jail for stabbing to death his ex-girlfriend Giulia Cecchettin last November.",
      "Over the last year a huge amount of detail about the killing has emerged, forming a picture of an increasingly anguished young woman harassed by her possessive ex-boyfriend who refused to accept the end of their relationship.",
      "The case, which captivated Italians, has thrust the concepts of femicide, patriarchy and male violence into the headlines.",
      "On 11 November 2023 Mr Turetta picked up his ex-girlfriend Ms Cecchettin, a 22-year-old biomedical engineering student from the Venice province, to take her shopping for an outfit for her upcoming graduation.",
      "Later that evening, he stabbed her more than 70 times, and left the student's body at the bottom of a ditch, wrapped in plastic bags.",
      "Then, he disappeared. For a week, Italians followed the search for the couple with baited breath. The discovery of Ms Cecchettin\u2019s body on 18 November was met with an unprecedented outpouring of grief. The next day, Mr Turetta was arrested in Germany. He readily admitted to killing Ms Cecchettin and was extradited to Italy.",
      "To raise awareness of the signs of controlling relationships, Ms Cecchettin\u2019s family recently shared a list she wrote a few months before her death, titled \u201c15 reasons I had to break up with him\u201d.",
      "In it, Ms Cecchettin said Mr Turetta insisted she had a \u201cduty\u201d to help him study, complained if she sent him fewer emoji hearts than usual, didn\u2019t want her to go out with friends and needed her to text him all the time.",
      "\u201cThey were the typical signs of possessiveness,\u201d Giulia\u2019s father Gino Cecchettin told the BBC. \u201cHe would deny her her own space, or demand to always be included. He always needed to know everything she said to her friends or even her therapist.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe realised later that she thought she was the cause of his pain, that she felt responsible for it,\u201d he said.",
      "In an 80-page statement written from jail in childlike handwriting, Mr Turetta said since Ms Cecchettin broke up with him he spent every day hoping to get back with her. \u201cI didn't feel like I could accept any other outcome,\u201d he wrote.",
      "In his police interrogation Mr Turetta confirmed that, on the night he killed her, Ms Cecchettin had just told him he was too dependent and needy.",
      "\u201cI shouted that it wasn\u2019t fair, that I needed her,\u201d Mr Turetta said, adding that he killed her after getting \u201cvery angry\u201d when she tried to get out of the car.",
      "\u201cI was selfish and it's only now I realise it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI didn't think about how incredibly unfair that was to her and to the promising and wonderful life she had ahead of her.\u201d",
      "Mr Turetta\u2019s lawyer Giovanni Caruso has argued that his client should be spared an \u201cinhuman and degrading\u201d life sentence and pushed back against allegations that the killing had been premeditated.",
      "\u201cHe is not Pablo Escobar,\u201d Mr Caruso said - a line of defence Giulia\u2019s father told the BBC made him feel \u201cviolated all over again\u201d.",
      "Stories of femicide routinely top the news agenda in Italy, but Giulia Cecchettin\u2019s story attracted an unusual amount of attention from the start. The week-long search for the young couple gripped people; the revelation that Ms Cecchettin had been killed just days before her graduation moved them. More than 10,000 attended her funeral.",
      "But it was the tearful and furious interview given by Giulia\u2019s sister Elena, in which she said that Filippo Turetta was not a \u201cmonster\u201d but \u201cthe healthy son of a patriarchal society\u201d which sparked a heated debate on male violence and gender roles in modern Italy.",

      "In November, at the launch of a foundation established by Gino Cecchettin in memory of Giulia, Education Minister Giuseppe Valditara argued that the patriarchy no longer existed in Italy and said the rise in sexual violence was instead \u201clinked to the marginalisation and perversion that stems from illegal immigration\u201d.",
      "The comments sparked outrage. \u201cGiulia was killed by a respectable, white Italian man,\u201d Elena Cecchettin hit back. \u201cMy father has done something to prevent violence. What is the government doing?\u201d",
      "Since his daughter\u2019s death, Gino Cecchettin has thrown himself headfirst into a battle to teach teenagers how to handle emotions and relationships, touring schools to tell pupils his daughter's story.",
      "He also hopes that sharing Giulia's own voice and words could help others - like one voice message she sent friends in which she sounds both exasperated by Mr Turetta\u2019s insistence and riddled with guilt about his suicidal thoughts. \u201cI wish I could disappear,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m worried he could hurt himself.\u201d",

      "A government department has also said that the national anti-violence helpline experienced a surge in calls after Ms Cecchettin\u2019s murder, and that the number of calls is now 57% higher than last year.",

      "Certain that the National Assembly would reject the bill, Barnier used executive powers under article 49.3 of the French constitution to force it through.",
      "\"I don't think French people will forgive us for choosing party interests over the future of the country,\" Barnier told MPs on Tuesday as he explained the reasons for his decision. \"Now, everybody will need to assume their own responsibility as I have assumed mine.\"",

    "summary": "The US president has previously vowed not to intervene in his son's case.",
    "story": [
      "Since Hunter Biden's conviction on federal felony gun and tax charges over the summer, the White House has insisted that President Joe Biden had no intention of pardoning his son.",
      "But on Sunday, the president issued a controversial sweeping pardon, saying his son had been subject to attacks from his political rivals.",
      "Republicans have been quick to denounce the move - citing Biden's previous pledges not to intervene on Hunter\u2019s behalf. The move has also cast a renewed spotlight on the role of presidential pardons and the independence of the US justice system.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump called the intervention an \u201cabuse\u201d, while House Oversight Committee chair James Comer accused President Biden of seeking to \u201cavoid accountability\u201d.",
      "Did Biden rule out a pardon?",
      "Hunter Biden pleaded guilty in two separate trials over the summer - one on federal tax charges and one of lying about his drug use on a form when buying a handgun.",
      "In the aftermath of his conviction, the White House immediately made it clear that he could not expect a presidential pardon from his father.",
      "In an interview with ABC in June, when asked whether he had \u201cruled out a pardon\u201d for his son, Biden replied: \u201cYes.\u201d",
      "Biden also told reporters at a G7 summit in June: \"I said I'd abide by the jury decision, and I will do that. And I will not pardon him.\u201d",
      "As recently as 7 November - just two days after Donald Trump clinched his return to the White House - Biden administration officials were still insisting that the president had no intention of pardoning his son.",

      "Analysis: Biden's pardon for son shows presidents now act differently",
      "Full story: Biden highlights 'miscarriage of justice'",
      "When asked in a news conference if President Biden would be tempted to help Hunter, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been asked that question multiple times, our answer stands, which is no.\u201d",
      "Biden also emphasised in June that he was \u201csatisfied\u201d that his son had received a fair trial - in contrast to his comments on Sunday where he said Hunter had been the subject of \u201ca miscarriage of justice\u201d.",
      "Is there precedent for Biden\u2019s move?",
      "Presidential pardons are not rare and there have been examples of previous presidents pardoning family members.",
      "In January 2001 - just before he left office - Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother for drug distribution convictions dating back to 1985.",
      "And Donald Trump pardoned Charles Kushner - the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner - in December 2020 for making false statements during an investigation, witness tampering and tax evasion.",
      "Over the weekend the president-elect appointed Charles Kushner as his nominee to be US ambassador to France, a move which has raised some eyebrows in Paris.",
      "But Hunter Biden's pardon differs from the previous examples in several ways - most notably that a president has never pardoned his own son before.",
      "The length of the pardon President Biden has granted has also faced some scrutiny. Hunter Biden\u2019s pardon covers any crimes committed by his son over an almost 11-year period from 1 January 2014 to 1 December 2024.",
      "Jeffrey Crouch, an assistant professor of politics at American University, told the BBC that it \"is highly unusual to have a presidential pardon that covers such a broad time span\".",
      "Another distinguishing factor is that Hunter Biden has yet to be sentenced and is due to appear in court later this month. According to the US justice department it is \u201chighly unusual\u201d for a president to pardon someone before they are sentenced for a federal offence.",
      "Jeffrey Crouch told the BBC that officials normally recommend a five-year waiting period before applying a pardon.",
      "The move is not unheard of, however. For example, in 2017 Donald Trump pardoned ex-Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio - convicted of criminal contempt - before he was sentenced.",
      "What has Biden said about Trump\u2019s past pardons",
      "Biden has been outspoken in attacking some of the pardons his predecessor issued during his first term in office.",
      "In 2019, Biden attacked Trump for pardoning two US army officers - one of whom had been convicted and one who was set to stand trial - for war crimes in Afghanistan.",
      "Biden said the then-president had betrayed \u201cthe rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional and the men and women who wear the uniform honourably\u201d.",
      "Later, in 2020, when Trump commuted the sentence of his informal adviser Roger Stone, Biden called his rival \u201cthe most corrupt president in modern American history\u201d.",
      "More broadly, during his 2020 campaign, Biden accused Trump of undermining the office of the attorney general and politicising the office.",
      "\"The attorney general is not the president's lawyer. It\u2019s the people's lawyer,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe never saw anything like the prostitution of that office like we see it today.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 10:10:27 GMT",
    "summary": "Biden says his son Hunter was \"unfairly\" prosecuted over tax and gun possession - but earlier he had ruled out a pardon.",
    "story": [
      "US President Joe Biden has issued an official pardon for his son Hunter, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases, despite previously ruling it out.",
      "In a statement, the president said his son had been \"singled out\" and called his cases \"a miscarriage of justice\".",
      "Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to tax charges earlier in September, and was found guilty of being an illegal drug user in possession of a gun in June - becoming the first child of a sitting president to be a convicted of a crime.",
      "Reacting to the pardon, President-elect Donald Trump said: \"Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the [6 January] Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\"",

      "Trump was referring to his supporters who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 in a bid to overturn Trump's defeat in the 2020 election.",
      "Joe Biden's full and unconditional pardon for his son comes after the president had repeatedly said he would not give him clemency.",
      "Just a couple of months ago, in September, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Biden would not issue a pardon for his son.",
      "She repeated that stance last month in another briefing, saying: \"We\u2019ve been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands, which is no.\"",
      "Before that, in June, on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy, Biden had said he would neither pardon his son nor commute his sentence.",
      "\"I said I'd abide by the jury decision, and I will do that. And I will not pardon him,\" he told reporters covering the summit.",
      "But on Sunday evening, President Biden said although he believed in the justice system, \"politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice\".",
      "\"From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department\u2019s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" he said.",
      "Biden said he wrestled with the decision, and added: \"Once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further.\"",
      "\"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,\" he said.",
      "The announcement comes after the president gathered his family together to spend the Thanksgiving weekend in Nantucket. Reporters spotted Biden out for a walk on Friday with Hunter and his four-year-old son Beau, as well as Biden's daughter Ashley.",
      "Senior Republicans in Washington reacted furiously to news of the pardon, with House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer saying the president \"lied from start to finish\" about the circumstances surrounding his son's case.",
      "But there were signs of unease among Democrats too. Representative Greg Stanton of Arizona became the first politician in his party to disagree publicly with the decision, saying on X: \"I respect President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong.\"",
      "In a statement, Hunter Biden said mistakes he made during the darkest days of his addiction had been \"exploited to publicly humiliate and shame\" his family for political sport.",
      "\"I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering,\" the 54-year-old added.",
      "The younger Biden has been sober for five-and-a-half years, his father said.",
      "This is not the first time a US president has pardoned a member of their family.",
      "Bill Clinton pardoned his younger half-brother, Roger Clinton, for a 1985 cocaine-related offence in 2001.",
      "In 2020, Donald Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter Ivanka. President-elect Trump has recently announced that Kushner will be the new ambassador to France.",
      "Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to nine counts of federal tax fraud in September, for which he had been facing up to 17 years in prison.",
      "He was also convicted of three felonies in connection with a gun purchase in June, for which he had been facing up to 25 years in prison.",
      "Sentencing for these cases had been scheduled for 12 and 16 December.",
      "His legal troubles had been a dark cloud over his father's presidential campaign, which came to an end in July after Biden pulled out of the election race.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 03:29:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Critics say that Kash Patel does not have the experience of past FBI directors - and some fear he will politicize the agency.",
    "story": [
      "Critics of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the FBI have expressed doubts that he is qualified to lead the US government\u2019s principal law enforcement agency.",
      "Some also raised fears that Kash Patel, a marginal figure in Trump's first administration known for his loyalty, aims to dismantle an apolitical federal security service and refashion it into a means of partisan retribution.",
      "\"Look, 99.9% of the bureau is made up of hard working agents who adhere to the principles of fidelity, bravery and integrity,\" Jeff Lanza, a former FBI agent, said. \"But he's said that he's coming in to just decimate the agency. How is that going to go well and how will that play into the morale of the agents who have to work under him?\"",
      "The FBI director leads 37,000 employees across 55 US field offices. They also oversee 350 satellite offices and more than 60 other foreign locations expected to cover almost 200 countries.",
      "Former FBI and Department of Justice officials who spoke to BBC said the job is  difficult, and it would be nearly impossible for someone like Patel, who has limited management experience, to operate effectively.",
      "Gregory Brower, a former FBI assistant director and deputy general counsel who worked closely with the past two directors, called the job \"nonstop\".",
      "\"It's relentless. It's high stakes. It requires expert judgment, stamina, experience, and a strong ethical and moral compass,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Who else is in Trump's top team?Just how big was Trump's victory?",
      "Who else is in Trump's top team?",
      "Just how big was Trump's victory?",
      "When he announced his pick for FBI director, Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People\".",
      "Patel began his career as a federal public defender in Miami before working as a terrorism prosecutor at the Department of Justice between 2014 and 2017. He then spent two years as senior aide to Republicans who led the House Intelligence Committee, reportedly fighting the investigation of Trump and Russian collusion in the 2016 election.",
      "When Democrats took control of the House in 2019, he was hired as a staffer on Trump\u2019s National Security Council. In February 2020, he became principal deputy in the Office of Director of National Intelligence - then led by acting director Richard Grenell.",
      "By November of that year, he had moved to the Pentagon to serve as chief ofstaff to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller - a position he held until Trump left office two months later.",
      "\u201cKash Patel has served in key national security positions throughout the government. He is beyond qualified to lead the FBI and will make a fantastic Director,\" Alex Pfeiffer, a Trump transition spokesman, told the BBC.",
      "Those critical of Patel cite past FBI directors, many of whom worked their way up through the justice department or FBI for decades, as a better measure of the qualifications needed to lead the agency.",
      "\"It's certainly not like the backgrounds that we've seen other directors of the FBI and those who have overseen other similarly sized and important federal agencies bring to their jobs,\" Brower said of Patel's experience.",
      "Some pointed to former US Attorney General Bill Barr\u2019s recollection in his 2022 memoir of Trump's attempt to place Patel in a senior FBI position in his first term to stress the point further.",
      "\u201cI categorically opposed making Patel deputy FBI director. I told Mark Meadows it would happen \u2018over my dead body,'\u201d he wrote. \u201cSomeone with no background as an agent would never be able to command the respect necessary to run the day-to-day operations of the bureau.\u201d",
      "Since leaving office, Patel has promised in interviews that, if Trump returns to office, he and others will use the government to go after political opponents - including politicians and members of the media who he alleges without evidence helped overturn the 2020 US presidential election results.",
      "\"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\" Patel told Steve Bannon, a White House chief strategist in Trump's first term, on the War Room podcast.",
      "\"We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly. We'll figure that out. But yeah, we're putting you all on notice\u2026 We're actually going to use the Constitution to prosecute them for crimes they said we have always been guilty of but never have.\"",
      "Trump said during his reelection campaign that he considers Patel\u2019s book - titled Government Gangsters - to be a \u201cblueprint\u201d for his next administration.",
      "In the memoir, which criticises the so-called deep state, Patel calls for \"comprehensive housecleaning\" of the FBI by firing \u201cthe top ranks\u201d.",
      "On a recent podcast, he said the incoming Trump administration intends to retain about 50 members of the FBI\u2019s Washington staff, and the remaining workforce would be put into the field. They would, in essence, \"close that building down\", he said, referring to FBI headquarters.",
      "\u201cOpen it up the next day as the museum to the deep state,\u201d he added.",
      "The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Mr Grenell and other former Trump administration officials who worked with Patel have praised his nomination and characterised him as a hardworking public servant.",
      "\u201cI have no doubt that Kash Patel will inspire our line FBI agents who want to fight crime, destroy the cartels, capture spies, and jail mobsters, thugs, fraudsters and traffickers,\u201d Robert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s last national security adviser, said on X.",
      "Few, however, mentioned current FBI Director Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump after the then-president fired the agency\u2019s last leader - James Comey - or that he still has three years remaining on his term.",
      "Ultimately, it remains up to the Senate who will vote on whether Patel's nomination will be confirmed.",
      "While most senators have remained relatively quiet about Patel and a few Republicans have praised the pick, there is some apparent scepticism.",
      "Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, seemed to raise some doubt that he would receive the necessary votes.",
      "\u201cI think the president picked a very good man to be the director of the FBI when he did that in his first term,\u201d Rounds told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see what his (Trump\u2019s) process is, and whether he actually makes that nomination,\u201d Rounds commented about Patel. \u201cWe still go through a process, and that process includes advice and consent, which, for the Senate, means advice or consent sometimes.\u201d",
      "Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat who will soon hand his gavel to Republicans, stressed that Trump knows Wray\u2019s term has not yet expired and called for his colleagues to block Patel's confirmation.",
      "\u201cNow, the President-elect wants to replace his own appointee with an unqualified loyalist,\u201d Durbin said in a statement. \u201cThe Senate should reject this unprecedented effort to weaponize the FBI for the campaign of retribution that Donald Trump has promised.\u201d",

      "An Islamic school teacher, Masud Abdulrasheed, is struggling to come to terms with the killing of his seven-year-old daughter in drone strikes by Nigeria's military during a religious festival in their large but sparsely populated village exactly a year ago.",
      "The military said the bombing was caused by \"a failure of intelligence\", leading the army to mistake the open-air festival in Tudunbiri for a gathering of jihadist fighters.",
      "\"The incident of December 3rd, 2023 was a great tragedy that shouldn\u2019t have happened,\" military spokesman Maj-Gen Edward Buba told the BBC. \"The armed forces regret that incident. And if we could bring the lives lost back, we would.\"",
      "Warning: This story contains graphic details which some readers may find distressing",
      "About 85 people were killed, including Mr Abdulrasheed's little daughter Habeebah, when unmanned drones dropped two bombs on the village in northern Kaduna state.",
      "\"The first bomb dropped on us at around 10 pm, close to a tree where women and children were seated,\" Mr Abdulrasheed recalled. \"We ran for safety, but moments later we gathered to help those injured and also called for help, but the second bomb was dropped and it killed more people.\"",
      "Mr Abdulrasheed described Habeebah as \"the most caring among my children\".",
      "\"She would always give me whatever gift she was given, even if I didn\u2019t need it,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The 36-year-old was one of the organisers of the annual festival, known as Maulud, held to celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammad.",
      "Many of his students were killed in the tragedy.",
      "\"We saw dead bodies all over the place as if they were sleeping. Body parts were strewn around the tree branches and rooftops. We had to pack them inside sacks and buried all the dead in a mass grave.",
      "\"There is nothing more devastating than seeing people you invited for a celebration coming to meet their end. I am so heartbroken,\" Mr Abdulrasheed said.",
      "As the father of four spoke to the BBC, he sat his second daughter, Zaharau, beside him on a mat outside their home. He gently pulled up her top to show a wound on her stomach.",
      "Four-year-old Zaharau was hit by shrapnel. It took at least an hour to drive her and the other wounded to the nearest hospital in Kaduna city.",
      "Although she underwent surgery, her wound still hasn't fully healed.",
      "\"When my daughter and the others that got injured were at the hospital, they were well taken care of. We thank the government for that.",
      "\"But things changed after they got discharged, months later. The hospital has refused to continue with their [free] treatment. They keep giving us excuses.\"",
      "Walking around Tudunbiri, there is hardly a family not affected by the tragedy of that fateful night.",
      "Twenty-year-old Aisha Buhari lost three of her younger brothers. She survived, suffering an injury to her left arm that is yet to heal.",
      "Sitting on a stool, she cried and wiped her tears with her hijab as she recalled the last moments of her brothers.",
      "\"That night, I just finished talking with them and stepped away for a moment when the first bomb hit, only for me to see their dead bodies on the ground moments later,\" Ms Buhari said.",
      "\"When they rushed me to the hospital, I could not think of anything but my brothers. I cried so much.\"",
      "As Ms Buhari spoke, she paused to wipe the pus oozing from her wound.",
      "\"There was no house or farm task I could not do before the incident, but now I can\u2019t do anything properly. I depend on people to help with something as basic as washing clothes,\" she said.",
      "Kaduna state governor Uba Sani told the BBC that he would look into the plight of villagers like Ms Buhari.",
      "\"Thank you BBC for this information. I will personally go back to Tudunbiri, and if I find people that still need treatment, I will take care of it,\" he promised.",
      "\"The instruction I gave was that all the injured should be treated and none of them should be discharged until they are fully recovered,\" he added.",
      "Undeterred by last year\u2019s tragedy, the Muslim faithful in Tudunbiri celebrated the festival again this year, but held it two months earlier.",
      "The occasion also marked the inauguration of a mosque the authorities have built for them over the bomb site, as a form of compensation.",
      "Mr Abdulrasheed acts as the mosque's imam as the previous one was killed in the air strikes.",
      "\"We are happy about the new mosque, but we can never forget what happened,\" Mr Abdulrasheed told the BBC. \"Any time I come here, I always remember that day, and I feel depressed. As we celebrate this year\u2019s Maulud, we also mourn those that we lost.\"",
      "For years, Nigeria's military has been battling armed jihadists and criminals, who raid villages and kidnap people for ransom in parts of the north.",
      "This has led to an upsurge in air strikes aimed at targeting them.",
      "The Nigerian Air Force has obtained \"a multitude\" of new aircraft, the editor of Defence Web, Guy Martin, told the BBC.",
      "This included Chinese-built unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones.",
      "\"Chinese UAVs are cheaper, making them more accessible. Nearly a third of African countries have acquired UAVs, mainly from Turkey and China,\" Mr Martin said, pointing out that it was strikes from UAVs that caused the disaster in Tudunbiri.",
      "\"Intelligence failure, poor coordination, and inadequate operator training are some of the reasons for erroneous strikes. The rapid deployment of UAV technology often outpaces the development of proper training and engagement protocols for military personnel,\" Mr Martin added.",
      "Maj-Gen Buba told the BBC that the military had found itself operating in a \"challenging and complex\" operational environment.",
      "\"But we have grown in our equipment holding and in our deployments of more experienced commanders and troops,\" he said.",
      "According to consulting firm SBM Intelligence, the Nigerian Air Force carried out 17 accidental air strikes between January 2017 and September 2024, killing more than 500 people.",
      "\"One mistake is enough; when we see hundreds being killed in erroneous attacks, we should be concerned,\" Human Rights Watch (HRW) Nigeria researcher Anietie Ewang said.",
      "In response, Maj-Gen Buba said that rights campaigners should \"give us more credit for being more transparent, for working with the people, and for being more accountable for our actions, as was revealed particularly during the Tudunbiri incident\".",
      "\"We will do everything possible to ensure that this never happens [again],\" Maj-Gen Buba added.",
      "He said that two army personnel were being court-martialled over the incident and while the case was still in progress, the military had redeployed them and relieved them of their command.",
      "Both the federal and state government have also unveiled development projects for the village as part of efforts to show remorse for the deaths, with Sani telling the BBC that the construction of a hospital and skills acquisition centre was almost complete.",
      "\"We have been supporting the people of Tudunbiri, and we will continue to do that,\" he said.",
      "\"They are my people,\" the governor added.",
      "But in a cruel irony, more than 20 people in the village reported that their farmland had been confiscated for the projects.",
      "They include 50-year-old Hashim Abdullahi, who told the BBC: \"I am not happy because this hospital has taken my means of livelihood and I was not compensated. I have been rendered jobless and can\u2019t provide for my family.\"",
      "In response, Sani said: \"For the people that genuinely have land, the department of land in Kaduna is working with the head of the community to ensure that the right people are given their land back.\"",
      "Nigeria's Vice-President Kashim Shettima also visited the village following the killings, promising - in conjunction with the state government - justice and financial compensation.",
      "People were told they would receive 2.5 million naira ($1,500; \u00a31,180) for each person killed in their family, while those injured were offered about 750,000 naira ($500).",
      "\"It is a difference that authorities actually carried out compensation this time around, but there is a sense that it has been very arbitrary,\" Ms Ewang said.",
      "\"We need to see the authorities take much-needed action towards justice, accountability, and compensation for victims in all of the other incidents of air strikes where they have accepted it was an error,\" she added.",
      "Ms Buhari told the BBC that her family had received the 7.5 million naira for her three brothers who were killed, and she got 750,000 naira for her injuries - though this was not enough.",
      "\"I usually buy drugs at a pharmacy to dress the wound because that\u2019s all I can afford to do now. The hospital doesn\u2019t attend to us any more. Sometimes the pain would be very severe for weeks,\" she said.",
      "\"We hope the government will come to our aid again so that I can get proper care for my arm. I can\u2019t wait to use it again,\" Ms Buhari added.",
      "Mr Abdulrasheed told the BBC he had not received financial compensation for the injuries suffered by his four-year-old.",
      "\"I always feel worried when I look at her condition,\" he said.",
      "He said he had received the full financial compensation for the death of his seven-year-old, but no amount of money could replace her.",
      "\"Every time I visit the grave site, I remember those we used to live together with but now they are no more. I miss them all. I miss my daughter.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 10:49:28 GMT",
    "summary": "The European Commission says numbers have soared and the animals are now causing damage to livestock.",
    "story": [
      "The first snow of winter has fallen in Sanmartin, a village in Romania\u2019s eastern Carpathian mountains.",
      "Shepherd J\u00f3zsef R\u00e1cz and his sons keep 500 ewes up on the high pasture here. It\u2019s a hard life: when he\u2019s not worrying about milking his sheep, which he does three times a day, he\u2019s worrying about protecting them from predators.",
      "Each year, J\u00f3zsef loses five or six of his herd to a wolf, or a bear. It\u2019s why he keeps 17 dogs.",
      "\u201cA good dog is the best tool a shepherd has, to protect his flock at night, and in the daytime too,\u201d the farmer says.",
      "On Tuesday, 45 years of strict protection for grey wolves in Europe came to an end, after conservation officials adopted EU measures to downgrade the animal's protected status.",
      "The news means that grey wolves will be moved from Annex II (strictly protected) to Annex III (protected) of the Bern Convention.",
      "This will remove many of the safeguards that have allowed the animals to flourish in Europe and means each EU country will be able to set an annual quota of wolves to kill.",
      "The Commission argued that the number of wolves in the EU has almost doubled, from 11,000 in 2012 to over 20,000 today, and that they were causing too much damage to livestock.",
      "But wildlife campaigners say improved protection methods, including trained sheep dogs, would be a better solution than removing safeguards. They say that wolves keep down numbers of deer and wild boar, which damage trees and crops. Wolves also prevent the spread of diseases by eating sick animals.",
      "In the town of Baile Tusnad, in a valley near J\u00f3zsef\u2019s village, wildlife experts met recently to discuss large carnivores. Most, though not all, oppose the hunting of wolves and bears.",
      "\u201cAfrican swine fever is spreading all over Europe,\u201d said Michal Haring, a biologist from Slovakia, \u201cand the wolf is a very good \u2018doctor\u2019 for this, suppressing the disease. Wolves cannot catch it.\u201d",
      "Another argument against shooting wolves is that they hunt in packs of five to eight, usually a pair and their offspring. If the older wolves are shot, the pack fragments, making it harder for them to catch deer and wild boar.",
      "\u201cIndividual wolves are more likely to attack sheep and other domesticated animals,\u201d Mr Haring explains.",
      "Campaigners also pointed to a 2023 EU report, which states that only around 50,000 of Europe\u2019s 68 million sheep and goats are killed by wolves each year \u2013 0.065% of the total number \u2013 adding that the overall impact of wolves on EU livestock is \u201cvery small\u201d.",
      "Moreover, it says there have been no fatal wolf attacks on humans for 40 years.",
      "\u201cIf we expect countries like India or Indonesia to protect their tigers,\u201d says Laurent Schley, head of the Wildlife department in the Luxembourg government, \u201cand Africans to protect lions and elephants, then we as relatively rich Europeans should be willing to tolerate some wolves.\u201d Luxembourg is one of the few western European countries where no wolves have been sighted yet, Mr Schley believes it\u2019s only a matter of time.",
      "\u201cWe have very high densities of deer and wild boar, so the conditions for the wolf are there.",
      "\"Of course, if individual wolves or packs start killing too much livestock, or were to show aggression towards humans, we would have to draw the line. Human safety always comes first.\u201d",
      "But back on the mountainside, J\u00f3zsef says wolves are dangerous because \u201cthey\u2019re clever animals\u201d. He favours tougher legal measures to cull the predators.",
      "Bears approach through the forest, treading on branches and alerting his dogs, J\u00f3zsef says: if they break into the wickerwork enclosure where his herd stay at night, they will only grab one animal.",
      "If a pack of wolves get in though, they can kill dozens of sheep at a time.",
      "Last year, J\u00f3zsef\u2019s favourite dog, Moody, was killed by wolves, in broad daylight, as they moved from one pasture to the next. All they found was his bloodied pelt.",
      "The more wolves there are, J\u00f3zsef says, the more likely they will take his sheep.",
      "And it takes a long time to train a good dog."

      "Short of another surprise,  France will once more be without a government on Wednesday.",
      "That is when Michel Barnier, appointed by President Macron after July\u2019s inconclusive parliamentary election,  faces a no-confidence motion over the budget - a vote he will almost certainly lose.",
      "As the left-wing MP Alexis Corbi\u00e8re put it in the National Assembly this afternoon: \u201cThat\u2019s it for Barnier. He\u2019s out of here.\u201d",
      "The arithmetic is merciless for the former Brexit negotiator, who now stands to end his career as the shortest-lived prime minister in France\u2019s Fifth Republic.",
      "From the start he has been leading an anomaly:  a minority government whose very survival depended on the indulgence of its enemies.",
      "In the National Assembly, Barnier could count on his own conservative group and the Macronites. But this centrist bloc has been easily outnumbered by a left-wing coalition on one side, and on the other the populist right of Marine Le Pen.",
      "And when those two forces combine - as they will in Wednesday\u2019s censure motion - then the numbers are too much, and Barnier must fall.",
      "It is a crisis that has been waiting to happen, but was deferred till now by long procedural haggling over the 2025 budget.",
      "Shortly after taking office in September, he proposed a budget that promised \u20ac60bn (\u00a349bn) in deficit reduction - necessary, he said, to satisfy Brussels and get the country\u2019s finances back in shape.",
      "But because he lacked a majority, his budget was then disfigured by opposition amendments - from both left and populist right - which removed taxes and introduced more spending, thus changing its essential nature.",
      "After much parliamentary to-ing and fro-ing with the conservative dominated Senate, Barnier came back with a new text, or technically texts, because there is a social security budget as well as the overall budget.",
      "But that version remains unacceptable to the opposition.",
      "Marine Le Pen, who could save Barnier if she chose to, made a series of new demands, including removing a new tax on electricity, and restoring fully index-linked pensions).",
      "Barnier gave ground - quite a lot in fact.  But it wasn\u2019t enough.  And now Le Pen plans to pull the plug.",
      "Barnier and his supporters have made much of their one good argument - the chaos scenario.",
      "What responsible party leader, they said, could want to tip France into the uncertainty and instability of yet another government crisis?",
      "Would Marine Le Pen really want to take the blame for the inevitable turbulence on the financial markets, the hike in borrowing costs, the spending cuts that would follow?",
      "Her response has been to say that warnings of doom are exaggerated: there will be no catastrophe. Technically France might not have a budget (which it won\u2019t if Barnier is ousted on Wednesday) but systems will kick in. The constitution allows for matters to be administered for a time by decree.",
      "Up to a point she is right.",
      "If Barnier falls, he will probably stay in power in a caretaker capacity while Macron (who is inconveniently in Saudi Arabia this week) seeks a replacement.",
      "That could take weeks, as it did in the summer after Macron lost his disastrously mismanaged early elections and Gabriel Attal stayed as caretaker until September.",
      "In the meantime a special law could be passed carrying the 2024 budget into 2025, so that civil servants are paid and hospitals meet their heating bills. An eventual new government would then pass a retrospective \u201ccorrective\u201d budget to set the books straight.",
      "But the bigger picture is much more serious.",
      "The original political crisis triggered by Macron\u2019s June dissolution of parliament has been exposed as the chronic disaster it always was. There is no \u201cfix\u201d with a \u201cconsensus-building\u201d negotiator of the Barnier mould.",
      "Barnier was the best the president could offer. And if Barnier has failed, it shows the situation is truly intractable.",
      "No new elections can be called until July. No stable government is conceivable.   Some say the only answer is for Macron himself to go. Until now that\u2019s been regarded as political fantasy.",

      "Rebel forces have launched their largest offensive against the Syrian government in years.",
      "They have captured a swathe of land across the north-west of the country, including most of the second city of Aleppo, after the Syrian military rapidly withdrew its troops.",
      "The rebels are now battling the military near the central city of Hama, while the government\u2019s key ally Russia is carrying out air strikes against them.",
      "Why is there a war in Syria?",
      "A peaceful, pro-democracy uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 turned into a full-scale civil war that has devastated the country and drawn in regional and world powers.",
      "More than half a million people have been killed and 12 million have been forced to flee their homes, about five million of whom are refugees or asylum seekers abroad.",
      "Prior to the rebels\u2019 offensive, the war had felt as if it were effectively over after Assad\u2019s government regained control of cities with the help of Russia, Iran and Iranian-backed militias. However, large parts of the country remain out of the government\u2019s direct control.",
      "These include northern and eastern areas controlled by a Kurdish-led alliance of armed groups supported by the United States.",
      "The rebels\u2019 last remaining stronghold is in the north-western provinces of Aleppo and Idlib, which border Turkey and is home to more than four million people, many of them displaced.",
      "The north-west is dominated by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), but Turkish-backed rebel factions - known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) - also control territory there with the support of Turkish troops.",
      "What is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham?",
      "HTS was set up in 2012 under a different name, al-Nusra Front, and pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda the following year.",
      "Al-Nusra Front was regarded as one of the most effective and deadly of the groups ranged against President Assad. But its jihadist ideology appeared to be its driving force rather than revolutionary zeal - and it was seen at the time as at odds with the main rebel coalition known as the Free Syrian Army.",
      "In 2016, Al-Nusra broke ties with al-Qaeda and took the name Hayat Tahrir al-Sham when it merged with other factions a year later. However, the UN, US, UK and a number of other countries continue to consider HTS as an al-Qaeda affiliate and frequently refer to it as al-Nusra Front.",
      "HTS consolidated its power in Idlib and Aleppo provinces by crushing its rivals, including al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) group cells, and set up the so-called Syrian Salvation Government to administer the territory.",
      "The eventual goal of HTS is to topple Assad and establish some form of Islamic governance. But it had shown little sign of attempting to reignite the conflict on a major scale and renew its challenge to Assad\u2019s rule - until now.",

      "Bowen: Syria's rebel offensive is astonishing - but don't write off Assad",
      "Why did the rebels launch an offensive?",
      "For several years, Idlib remained a battleground as Syrian government forces tried to regain control.",
      "But in 2020, Turkey and Russia brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake Idlib. The ceasefire largely held despite sporadic fighting.",
      "In October, the UN special envoy for Syria said HTS had carried out a significant raid into government-held areas, Russia had resumed air strikes for the first time in months, and pro-government forces had significantly accelerated drone strikes and shelling.",
      "On Wednesday, HTS and allied groups said they had launched an offensive to \u201cdeter aggression\u201d, accusing the government and allied Iran-backed militias of escalation in the north-west.",
      "But it came at a time when the Syrian government and its allies were preoccupied with other conflicts.",
      "The Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, which was crucial in helping Assad push back rebels in the early years of the war, has suffered recently from Israel\u2019s offensive in Lebanon, while Israeli strikes have eliminated Iranian military commanders in Syria and degraded supply lines to pro-government militias there. Russia is also distracted by the war in Ukraine.",
      "Without them, Assad\u2019s forces have been left exposed.",
      "How have the government and its allies responded?",
      "President Assad has vowed to \u201ccrush\u201d the rebels, referring to them as \u201cterrorists\u201d.",
      "In a call with his Iranian counterpart Massoud Pezeshkian on Monday, he blamed the US and other Western countries for the offensive, saying them were trying to \u201credraw the map\u201d of the region.",
      "Pezeshkian emphasised that Iran stood \u201cfirmly alongside the Syrian government and people\u201d, and that preserving Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity was a cornerstone of its regional strategy.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia also considered the situation around Aleppo as \u201can attack on Syrian sovereignty\u201d, and that it was \u201din favour of the Syrian authorities bringing order to the area and restoring constitutional order as soon as possible\u201d.",
      "What are Western powers and Turkey saying?",

    "summary": "An act of clemency by Hunter Biden's father continues a tradition by American presidents.",
    "story": [
      "US President Joe Biden has issued a presidential pardon for his son Hunter, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases.",
      "The move has proven controversial, since the outgoing president previously ruled out such a move. But he claimed the cases against his son were politically motivated.",
      "His use of his pardoning powers continues a tradition of presidents on both sides of the American political divide granting clemency to people close to them.",
      "What did Hunter Biden do?",
      "Hunter Biden was awaiting sentencing later this month in two federal cases.",
      "In June, he became the first child of a sitting US president to be criminally convicted - in a case relating to his gun ownership. He was found guilty by a jury in Delaware of three charges for lying about his drug use on a form when buying a handgun.",
      "He was also awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in September in a federal tax case that centred on whether he paid enough tax from 2016-19. The nine charges included failure to file and pay his taxes, tax evasion and filing a false return.",
      "He faced up to 25 years in prison in the gun case and 17 years in the tax case, though he was likely to get much shorter tariffs and to serve the two sentences concurrently, experts told the New York Times.",

      "President Biden's statement in full",
      "What has the president said in the past about pardoning his son?",
      "Analysis: Biden's pardon for son shows presidents now act differently",
      "Full story: Biden highlights 'miscarriage of justice'",
      "What is a presidential pardon?",
      "The US Constitution decrees that a president has the broad \"power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment\".",
      "In this case, the president's \"full and unconditional pardon\" is unusually sweeping.",
      "It covers any potential federal crimes the younger Biden may have committed during a period of more than 10 years from January 2014 to December 2024.",
      "That spans a period beyond Hunter Biden's tax and gun offences and dates back to the year he joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father, then US vice-president, had a key role in US policy towards Kyiv.",
      "The wording of the pardon also makes clear that it covers any offence that the younger Biden \"has committed or may have committed\".",
      "The pardon represents legal forgiveness, ends any further punishment and restores rights such as being able to vote or run for public office.",
      "Although the pardoning power is considered broad, it is not limitless. For example, a president can only issue pardons for federal (national-level) crimes.",
      "The issue is relevant because there is a question mark over the sentencing of Trump in his hush-money case in New York. He will be unable to pardon himself in that state-level case when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "How many pardons have other presidents issued?",
      "There is a long-standing precedent of US presidents on both sides of the political divide issuing pardons - including to people close to them. This is the 26th pardon issued by Biden, a Democrat.",
      "In 2020, Trump, a Republican, pardoned Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter Ivanka. Kushner was sentenced to two years in prison in 2004 for charges including tax evasion, campaign finance offences and witness tampering.",
      "And in 2001, Bill Clinton, pardoned his younger half-brother, Roger Clinton, for a cocaine-related offence that dated back to 1985.",
      "In both cases, the pardons were given to people who had already served a sentence. President Biden's intervention in his son's case comes before sentencing.",
      "Trump granted 237 acts of clemency during his four years in the White House, according to the Pew Research Center, comprising 143 pardons and 94 commuted sentences. Many were in a flurry before he left office.",
      "That number is significantly fewer than his predecessor Barack Obama, who during his eight-year stint granted 1,927 acts of clemency, according to Pew. These were 1,715 commutations and 212 pardons.",
      "Most of those who received executive clemency under Obama had been convicted of narcotics charges at the height of the so-called US war on drugs.",
      "One of the most controversial presidential pardons was granted by Gerald Ford to his predecessor Richard Nixon in 1974 - covering acts that occurred during the Watergate Scandal. It was described as an effort to heal the nation.",
      "What have Biden and Trump said about pardons?",
      "The day after he took office in 2021, Biden emphasised that he would do things differently to Trump. His press secretary told reporters that the flurry of last-minute pardons issued by Trump was \"not a model... for how President Biden would use his own power. He would use his own power far more judiciously\".",
      "Biden said after his son's conviction that he would not issue a pardon. In the statement announcing his U-turn, he acknowledged that he had pledged to \"not interfere with the justice department\u2019s decision-making\". But, he said, the younger Biden had been \"singled out\" and subjected to a \"miscarriage of justice\".",
      "Trump is among those who have attacked Biden for the move, calling it an \"abuse\".",
      "The incoming president asked whether Biden would also pardon supporters of his who were prosecuted over the US Capitol riot on 6 January 2021.",
      "Trump, who faced a series of legal issues while away from the White House, has repeatedly made the allegation that the US justice system has been weaponised against him and his supporters.",
      "He has promised to issue pardons of his own for those who rioted in Washington. But who exactly will be granted clemency, and whether pardons will extend to those convicted of the most serious and violent offences, is still an open question."

    "summary": "The country's president has already shown he is prepared to go to brutal lengths to save his regime.",
    "story": [
      "The reignited war in Syria is the latest fallout from the turmoil that has gripped the Middle East since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October last year.",
      "The attacks, and Israel\u2019s response, upended the status quo. Events in Syria in the last few days are more proof that the war gripping the Middle East is escalating, not subsiding.",
      "During a decade of war after 2011, Bashar al-Assad\u2019s rule survived because he was prepared to break Syria to save the regime he had inherited from his father.",
      "To do that he relied on powerful allies, Russia, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. They intervened on his side against rebel groups that ranged from the jihadist extremists of Islamic State to militias supported by the US and the rich Gulf monarchies.",
      "Now Iran is reeling from severe blows inflicted by Israel, with US support, on its security in the Middle East. Its ally Hezbollah, which used to send its best men to fight for the Assad regime in Syria, has been crippled by Israel\u2019s attacks. Russia has launched air strikes in the last few days against the rebel offensive in Syria \u2013 but its military power is almost entirely earmarked to fight the war in Ukraine.",
      "The war in Syria did not end. It dropped out of the place it used to occupy in headline news, partly because of turbulence across the Middle East and beyond, and because it is almost impossible for journalists to get into the country.",
      "In places the war was suspended, or frozen, but Syria is full of unfinished business.",
      "The Assad regime has never regained the power it had used to control Syria before 2011, the year of the Arab uprisings, though it still kept a gulag of Syrian prisoners in its jails.",
      "Even so, until the last few days, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad controlled the major cities, their surrounding countryside and the main highways connecting them.",
      "Now a coalition of rebel groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has broken out of Idlib, the province along the border with Turkey that it controls, and in only a few days since 27 November swept away Syrian troops in a series of \"astonishing\" events, as one senior international diplomat told me.",
      "Two days into the offensive, they were posting photos of fighters who had taken the ancient citadel of Aleppo, which had been an impregnable base for government troops between 2012 and 2015, when the city was divided between rebels and regime forces.",
      "The atmosphere in Aleppo seems calm after the rout of government troops. One photo on social media showed uniformed and armed rebel fighters queuing for fried chicken at a fast-food outlet.",
      "HTS has roots in al-Qaeda, though it broke with the group in 2016 and at times has fought its rump loyalists. But HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the UN Security Council and countries including the US, the European Union, Turkey and the UK.  (The Syrian regime calls all its opponents terrorists.)",
      "The leader of HTS, Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani, has a long history as a jihadist leader in Iraq and Syria. In recent years, though, he has moved away from strict jihadist ideology to try to broaden the appeal of his group.",
      "The rebranding is also being used to attract support for the offensive, which HTS calls Operation Repelling the Aggression. That name, and its official announcements, avoid jihadist language and Islamist references.",
      "Neutral language, according to Mina al-Lami, the jihadist media specialist at BBC Monitoring, is designed to distance what\u2019s happening from the jihadist past of HTS and present the offensive as a joint rebel enterprise against the regime.",
      "Syrians are generally repelled by extreme religious rhetoric. As jihadist groups came to dominate the rebellion after pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed after the first year or so of war after 2011, many Syrians either stayed neutral or sided reluctantly with the regime because they feared the murderous jihadist ideology of Islamic State.",
      "The offensive led by HTS comes out of the splintered political landscape of northern Syria. Much of the north-east is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group led by Kurds and supported by the United States, which stations around 900 troops in the area.",
      "Turkey is a big player, controlling borderlands where it has deployed its own regular troops as well as the militias it sponsors. Sleeper cells drawn from the remnants of Islamic State sometimes mount deadly ambushes on roads through the Syrian desert.",
      "Reports from Syria say that the rebel forces have captured significant supplies of military equipment, including helicopters, and are pressing on towards Hama, the next significant city on the road to Damascus.",
      "Without a doubt the regime and its allies will be working to steady themselves and to hit back, especially with air power. The rebels do not have an air force, though in another sign of the way that unmanned aerial vehicles are revolutionising warfare, there are reports that they used a drone to kill a senior regime intelligence official.",
      "The renewed fighting in Syria is causing international alarm. The UN envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, issued a statement saying that \"the latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international security\u2026 No Syrian party or existing group of actors can resolve the Syrian conflict via military means\".",
      "Pedersen added that there had been \"a collective failure to bring about a genuine political process\" to implement UN Security Council resolution 2254, which was passed in 2015. That laid out a roadmap for peace, with the principle in the text that \u201cthe Syrian people will decide the future of Syria\u201d.",
      "The objective was a future shaped by free elections and a new constitution. But that meant Assad and his family giving up a country that they treated for years as their personal fief. More than half a million dead attest to their determination not to let that happen.",
      "It is too soon to write the Assad regime off. It has a core of genuine support. Some Syrians see it as the least bad option \u2013 better than the jihadists who came to dominate the rebellion. But if other anti-Assad groups \u2013 and there are many \u2013 rise up, his regime will once again be in mortal danger.",

      "\"She came to my house, we sat, we chatted and talked,\" Erivo said. \"And we just talked about everything and nothing. We were there for ages, and it was very, very easy, so part of us kind of knew, 'Oh, this might, this might work. We'll be okay, and I think we'll be able to get along with each other, and we'll find it.'\"",
      "Their connection deepened during a dinner hosted by director Jon M. Chu.",

      "\"It means people can see the human being behind the character a little bit more,\" she shared. \"That meant I had to allow myself to do that a little bit, which was terrifying, but I knew it would be meaningful. That was really the only way to play this role.\"",
      "As Erivo reflected on her journey with \"Wicked\", she said she remains proud of the bravery it took to bring authenticity to Elphaba.",
      "\"You have to put yourself on the line a little bit\u2026 This is scary, but it's the only way to play her is to reveal a bit more of me,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "On any red carpet, Selena Gomez is the picture of beauty, poise and confidence. But she'll be the first to tell you that things aren't always what they appear. For instance, her latest film: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez.\" Gomez co-stars as the wife of a powerful Mexican drug lord who secretly transitions. The film is a hard-hitting true crime story, a poignant love story, a journey of self-discovery \u2013 and a musical. But somehow it all works.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" click on the video player below:",
      "Gomez said shooting left her \"a little sore\" from all the dance numbers. So, why did she want to do it? \"I found it incredibly compelling,\" she said. \"I've never really seen a movie like this before. I don't think I've ever been this proud of something in the acting field.\"",
      "And that's really saying something; at 32, Gomez has a lot to be proud of: She's an accomplished actor, but she's also a very successful singer-songwriter, and thanks to her wildly popular Rare Beauty line of cosmetics, she's a billionaire, and a very active philanthropist. It's all quite impressive, and even more so when you realize where she started.",
      "Gomez was born in the Texas town of Grand Prairie. Her mom, Mandy Teefy, was only 16 years old. Selena's parents split when she was five. She says the family had a lot of love, and not much else, with tough times when her mother struggled to put food on the table. \"My mom worked multiple jobs,\" she said. \"She also was finishing high school when she was having me. When I'm doing something great today, it just makes me more thankful for the lessons that my mother taught me.\"",
      "Gomez was barely 10 when she landed a part on TV's \"Barney & Friends,\" and a few years later she became a fixture on the Disney Channel, on such shows as \"Wizards of Waverly Place.\"",
      "She branched out into music, and became a pop sensation. And when the pandemic came, she switched gears again, hosting \"Selena + Chef,\" a popular online cooking show shot in the kitchen of her L.A. home. \"We had cameras everywhere, from every aspect of it,\" she said.",
      "And how are her cooking skills now? \"They're not that great, I'm not gonna lie!\" she laughed.",
      "And then, in 2021 she helped cook up one of the biggest hits on TV: \"Only Murders in the Building.\" She praised her co-stars, Steve Martin and Martin Short: \"These men, Steve and Martin, have been working longer than I've been alive, but they are the first ones to be on set. They take time to ask everyone they run into how their day is. And on top of it, they think everything through. They are wonderful people, and they've helped me grow up in a lot of ways. These guys have become my friends and allies and people I can ask advice from. I couldn't be more grateful to work with them.\"",
      "Gomez is the first to admit that she's had a magical life, and that it hasn't always been a bed of roses. She's been open about her health struggles, like having lupus and receiving a kidney transplant.",
      "She also decided to take her struggles with anxiety and depression, and her bipolar diagnosis, public. Her 2022 documentary, \"Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me,\" is an unvarnished look at her life \u2013 the highs and the very deep lows.",
      "She admits she was a little nervous about sharing it with the world but, \"once I released it, it felt like a huge relief, because I am a firm believer that one of the strongest things you can do is be vulnerable. And that doesn't mean you have to pour your heart out to everyone. But I made that choice, because I knew I wasn't the only one that felt that way. And if my world was already out there for everyone to see, I'd like to tell my part of the story. And to add on that, it's a dream what I'm doing.\"",
      "Part of what her dream is was a benefit held last month for her Rare Impact Fund, a charity aimed at helping young people who suffer from the same mental health challenges she's been through. \"This is probably the most important thing to me, besides my family,\" she said. \"This is the cherry on top of everything.\"",
      "Another high point is her relationship with music producer Benny Blanco, whom People Magazine named one of the sexiest men alive. \"Yeah, that's my man!\" Gomez said. \"To know that there is someone in the world that deeply cares about every tiny detail about who I am, I'm really, really lucky.\"",
      "It's clear from \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" that she's an artist who likes to take risks. But Selena Gomez's gutsiest move has been sharing her real self, and that has made all the difference.",
      "I asked, \"The reaction in general has been overwhelmingly positive, hasn't it?\"",
      "\"Sure. Maybe,\" Gomez replied.",
      "Maybe?\u00a0 \"It's not that I really need anyone's approval,\" she added. \"I think I'm just really, I'm okay with where I am and who I am. And I'm glad. I'm glad that I finally got there.\"",

    "story": [
      "If the annual Jingle Ball at New York's Madison Square Garden is the Super Bowl of holiday concerts, then Elvis Duran is in the role of head coach. From introducing acts like Olivia Rodrigo, to mingling with pop princesses (\"Sabrina Carpenter, everyone!\"), and interviewing rock royalty like Cher, on this day, this Elvis is king.",
      "But he says being interviewed for TV is different for him: \"I'm not a camera guy, I'm a radio guy,\" he said.",
      "If you don't recognize his face, you may know his voice. Since 1996 the 60-year-old disc jockey has been host of \"Elvis Duran and the Morning Show,\" the country's most popular Top 40 morning program. \"I can't believe it's been 30 years, because it's been nothing but fun,\" he said.",
      "Every day, millions of listeners nationwide wake up to Duran and his crew dishing about music, pop culture \u2026 pretty much whatever's on their minds. \"I've been working with some of the same people for 25-30 years,\" he said. \"The energy with each other is what makes it work. I don't need to be the center of attention.\"",
      "With 70 markets across the country listening, Duran's a rarity these days \u2013 a nationally-known radio DJ.",
      "I asked, \"Growing up, I remember big-name radio DJs. Now it's kind of you and Ryan Seacrest. What happened?\"",
      "\"Radio isn't what radio used to be,\" Duran replied. \"A lot of radio companies gave up on personalities; they just wanted to play music, it's cheaper. That's not good for our business. So, I've done everything I can to keep personality on a radio show in the mornings.\"",
      "And it's Duran's personality that over the years has won him loyal fans, including some of the biggest names in pop music. \"Lady Gaga grew up dreaming of hearing her song on our show,\" he said. \"And when she walked into the room, she was sort of nervous. And I was thinking, 'Well, shouldn't it be the opposite way? It is Lady Gaga!'\"",
      "But it's everyday listeners with whom Duran feels a special bond. He said, \"We are in the friendship business. I think about you when you hop in your car in the morning. You're either leaving a house that may be full of turmoil, or going to a job with a boss you don't like. But I have you for 20-30 minutes, and I can be your friend.\"",
      "Duran fell in love with radio as a kid: \"I'd spend the night at my grandmother's house when mom and dad were out late, and I listened to the radio. And I became friends with this voice in the dark.\"",
      "He was just seven and growing up in McKinney, Texas. \"I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. I was a loner. And so, I found friendship through the radio.\"",
      "And so began his quest to become one of those voices. He even built his own transmitter, with a studio located in his bedroom closet. \"My only listener was the lady next door.\"",
      "Duran's first real radio job came at age 14. After dropping out of college, he spent a decade bouncing between markets across the country. \"Back in the old days in radio, you never unpacked, you never took dishes out of boxes, because you were always moving,\" he said. \"But you know what, I've been very lucky. I've been at Z100 since 1989. So, I'm doing okay.\"",
      "While his show is based in the Big Apple, Duran's heart belongs in New Mexico. As a kid, he visited the \"Land of Enchantment\" frequently. He says the quiet of Santa Fe is the polar opposite of New York City. \"Of course, I need that. Santa Fe is a magical place. And I think, in some ways, this city has kind of saved my life a little bit. It's good to be in a situation where you're forced to relax.\"",
      "Duran and his husband, Alex Carr, share a home here, not far from where they were married in 2019. But decades before their first date, they had a chance encounter \u2013 where else? \u2013 on the radio, back in 1998. \"I had him on as a contest winner once,\" Duran said.\u00a0 \"Jingle Ball tickets. How old were you?\"",
      "\"Eighteen,\" said Carr.",
      "\"Ooh, God!\"",
      "Duran often hosts his show from Santa Fe. Thanks to a home studio, his commute is short. \"Every morning at 2:30 a.m. Santa Fe time, I slither up this staircase, and here you go.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is the Elvis in New Mexico a different Elvis than the Elvis in the New York studio?\"",
      "\"Oh, absolutely,\" he replied. \"And everyone back in New York has said to me at one time or another, 'You're so relaxed out there. We really like the New Mexico Elvis.'\"",
      "Duran can't say how long he'll keep broadcasting (\"To be able to do this this long, with this family, it's a miracle, it really is\"), but he isn't ready to mute his microphone just yet. He's still got a lot of friends to keep company.",
      "Asked how much this goes back to the seven-year-old Elvis listening to that voice on the radio, Duran replied, \"All of it. You know, I'm not lonely anymore. I never, ever want to go back to being a lonely person ever again. And I don't want anyone listening to our show to be lonely. That's the legacy we're all trying to leave. I don't want them to remember my name; I just want them to remember how we made them feel every day. That's it.\"",

    "story": [
      "When you find yourself at the farmer's market next to a guy with strong opinions about fennel and scallions, you listen. That's especially true if the guy is Tom Colicchio, who for more than 20 seasons has been a judge on one of America's biggest food shows, \"Top Chef,\" while also working as one of America's most successful restaurateurs.",
      "Many of his celebrated dishes have started at a local greenmarket in New York City's Union Square, but lately the meals he enjoys the most are even more local than these ingredients. \"I cook very simply at home,\" he said. \"It's not the food part of it. I enjoy the half an hour, 45 minutes that we're sitting together as a family.\"",
      "Now 62, married and a father of three, Colicchio is sharing the story of his many lives in the kitchen in a new book, \"Why I Cook\" (Artisan).",
      "So, why does he cook? \"Partly it was something that I found at a very young age that I was good at,\" he said. \"It came very easy.\"",
      "Thomas Patrick Colicchio grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, sharing a bedroom with two brothers, and big boisterous family meals in a working-class Italian neighborhood. While mom ran the family kitchen, it was dad, a gambler-turned-corrections officer, who helped turn Tom into a chef. \"Having ADHD, I struggled with recipes; I'd get frustrated by recipes,\" Colicchio said. \"But I loved cooking. And my dad wasn't the kind of dad who sat down and had these long conversations with you about your future. But he came home with these books \u2013 I had no idea what 'La Technique' was doing in a county jail library, but there it was!\"",
      "Yes, Jacques Pepin's \"La Technique\" is what helped Colicchio understand the fundamentals of cooking. \"Once I understood that, I could look at a recipe and go, 'Oh, they want me to roast something here. I know how to roast something. So, I don't need a recipe anymore,'\" he said. \"Or I can braise something. But now when I braise it, well, I can change the flavor profile by adding different things into that braise.\"",
      "The kitchen, however, was where Colicchio learned how to be himself, a place where in the chaos of orders and ingredients, he found a calling.",
      "His career took off fast, from flipping burgers at a local snack bar, to building whole menus at a North New Jersey hot spot, and ultimately to New York City, where \u2013 not yet 30 \u2013 he earned his first three-star review from The New York Times, at Mondrian.",
      "Colicchio doesn't credit his family for his entrepreneurial spirit: \"I think it came from the fact that I worked in kitchens and worked in restaurants that I didn't like. And I didn't want to have a boss.\"",
      "But even as he soared professionally \u2013 becoming executive chef at New York's celebrated Gramercy Tavern - Colicchio's private life was cruising toward rock-bottom. \"I was doing drugs when I was cooking the whole time,\" he said. \"Had a bad night and ended up in Harlem somewhere, you know, with another cook getting a bunch of drugs and, you know, getting high all night. I woke up in my bed \u2026 my shirt was covered in blood. I don't remember getting home, which kind of scared me, 'cause I was driving a motorcycle. So, somehow I made it home. But that was it. I woke up and said, 'That's it. No more.'\"",
      "He quit the drugs, but his working-class roots still led to some awkward moments in the Frenchified, fancy world of fine dining. \"I knew I could hold my own, but I just still felt like I was a fish out of water here,\" he said. \"Now I'm in New York. You know, you get three stars, now all of a sudden you're getting pulled in a lot of different directions. Was there a certain amount of impostor syndrome? Absolutely.\"",
      "He said he tried saying no to \"Top Chef\" (\"Didn't really love food TV\"), but then he had the experience of attending a food festival: \"Come time to sign books, and I'm sitting next to Bobby Flay, and he's signing 300 and I'm signing 20. I didn't think it was because he had a better book. He was on TV. It was like, 'All right, let me do this TV thing.'\"",
      "Looking back now, in his new book, Colicchio traces the arc of a changing industry, where sexism and even abuse has been replaced by something a little kinder, and a lot more welcoming. \"There's still voices being raised,\" he said. \"It's a little different than it used to be, but there's still, you know, in the middle of service there were times you got to be forceful. But you can be sure it's not personal. What's really missing is a lot of the misogyny that I saw.\"",
      "But for Tom Colicchio, after all these years, the one thing that hasn't changed is the one thing that also keeps him in the kitchen: \"Looking back on it, food has the power to bring people around a table. And to this day, I love doing dinner parties, love having people over. That's another reason why I cook.\"",

The on-duty commander that night guaranteed the child Santa would have a safe journey from the North Pole and a tradition was established. The annual tracking carried over when the precursor agency became NORAD in 1959. Since 1997, the tracker has been available online.",

      "Preparing to follow Santa's journey",
      "While the agency spends fewer than 24 hours tracking Santa, it takes months of preparations to get everything in place. The operation is supported by the efforts of more than a thousand volunteers,\u00a0CBS News previously reported.",
      "Organizers first review the previous year's tracking and reconnect with the dozens of corporate contributors who fund the program annually. In the fall, they start coordinating with service members at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs to transform the building into the NORAD Tracks Santa Operations Center.",

      "The collector's item chronicles Swift's wildly successful concert tour, which concludes in December and which last year became the first music tour to gross over $1 billion.",
      "A movie version of the concert she performed on her Eras Tour also shattered box office records. It earned an estimated $96 million domestically over its opening weekend, making it the most successful concert film of all time, according to Comscore.",
      "Where can I buy the book?",
      "The new keepsake, titled \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,\" is available exclusively at Target. It hit the retailer's stores on Friday, while it will become available for sale on Target's website\u00a0on Saturday. Swift self-published the book under Taylor Swift Publications.",
      "Some Target stores opened as early as 6 a.m. in anticipation of Black Friday shopping crowds and Taylor Swift fans.",
      "Target first teased the book launch in an Instagram\u00a0post on Oct. 15. Swift herself also promoted the book in an Instagram\u00a0post that garnered more than 3.6 million likes.",

The recording feature 35 tracks, including four acoustic versions of the following songs: \"Fortnight,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him\" and \"Guilty as Sin?\"",
      "Two million copies of the book have been printed, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Assuming the initial print run sells out, it would generate nearly $80 million in sales. Forbes puts Swift's net at worth $1. 6 billion, including $600 million from music royalties and touring, a music catalog valued at an estimated $600 million, and $125 million in real estate.",

The retailer's latest sales and profit figures fell short of analysts' expectations, while Target lowered its earnings forecast for the current quarter. Analysts say that inflation-weary consumers are after deeper discounts than the retailer can offer, or simply aren't making as many discretionary purchases.",

      "Harris was a broadcast associate at \"CBS This Morning,\" and she later worked as an associate producer for Rose's PBS show. McNeal was Rose's executive assistant. Wei was a news associate and later an anchor assistant for Rose at \"CBS This Morning.\"",
      "The women, all in their early 20s when they were hired, accused the much older Rose of subjecting them to repeated physical and verbal sexual harassment while working, including inquires about their sex lives and boasts about his own. Harris and McNeal alleged that Rose said \"they were hired because he likes 'tall women,' i.e., he was attracted to them,\" and Wei alleged that Rose referred to her \"as China doll.\"\u00a0 The three women also accused CBS of knowingly failing to prevent Rose's harassment.",
      "CBS settled in December 2018 for an undisclosed sum. The network said at the time that the women had requested the terms be kept confidential.",

    "story": [
      "Federal investigators found nearly a dozen children to be working dangerous, overnight shifts at Seaboard Triumph Foods' pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, Iowa, the Department of Labor announced.",
      "Employed by Guymon, Oklahoma-based sanitation contractor Qvest, 11 kids allegedly used corrosive cleaners to sanitize head splitters, jaw pullers, bandsaws, neck clippers and other equipment at the Seaboard Triumph Foods facility from at least September 2019 through September 2023, the DOL stated in a news release\u00a0on Friday.",
      "Federal law\u00a0prohibits\u00a0minors from working in meat processing due to an increased risk of injury.",
      "Seaboard Foods is among the nation's biggest pork producers. In addition to Iowa, Seaboard Foods, a division of Seaboard Corporation, has operations in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah, and in Mexico, according to the company's website.",
      "\"These findings illustrate Seaboard Triumph Foods' history of children working illegally in their Sioux City facility since at least September 2019. Despite changing sanitation contractors, children continued to work in dangerous occupations at this facility,\" Michael Lazzeri, the Midwest regional administrator with the DOL's Wage and Hour division, stated in the release.",
      "Qvest must pay $171,919 in child labor civil monetary penalties and take steps to prevent it from illegally hiring minors again.",
      "Qvest and Seaboard did not return requests for comment.",
      "Still, children under 18 illegally employed in dangerous jobs in meat and poultry slaughtering and processing operations is not unique in the industry or to the Seaboard Foods plant in Sioux Falls.",
      "Seaboard in September 2023 contracted Fayette Janitorial Services for sanitation work at its facility. After taking over the plant's sanitation services contract, Fayette allegedly rehired some of the children previously employed by Qvest, with the Somerville, Tennessee-based contractor earlier this year found to be employing nine minors at the Sioux Falls plant, the DOL alleged.",
      "Fayette also allegedly hired 15 children as young as 13 at a Perdue Farms processing plant in Accomac, Virginia, where a 14-year-old was severely injured. Perdue terminated its contract with Fayette before the DOL's court filing, the company said.",
      "Are migrant kids cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses?",
      "The development is part of an ongoing probe into whether migrant kids are cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses. It also comes less than a year after the government fined another sanitation services provider $1.5 million for employing more than 100 kids \u2014 \u00a0ages 13 to 17\u00a0\u2014 at 13 meat processing plants in eight states.",
      "The DOL launched its investigation after a published report detailed migrant kids working overnight for contractors in poultry processing facilities on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. A New York Times Magazine\u00a0story\u00a0last December detailed children cleaning blood, grease and feathers from equipment with acid and pressure hoses.",
      "The Times'\u00a0account\u00a0included details of a 14-year-old boy who was maimed while cleaning a conveyor belt in a deboning area at a Perdue slaughterhouse in rural Virginia. The eighth grader was among thousands of Mexican and Central American children who have crossed the border on their own to work in dangerous jobs.",
      "But it's not only migrant children tasked with illegal and dangerous work. A 16-year-old high school student, Michael Schuls, died last summer after getting\u00a0trapped in a machine at a Wisconsin sawmill.",
      "From an elevated waterslide at a Jacksonville, Florida, beach park to a sawmill in Clarkrange, Tennessee, federal investigators are finding children across the country working illegal hours and performing risky, unlawful tasks. In May, federal investigators found a 13-year-old girl allegedly working up to 60 hours a week on an assembly line in Luverne, Alabama.",
      "More recently, the DOL found a Grand Rapids, Michigan, window cleaning company had illegally hired three kids to clean residential windows and gutters, and to install Christmas lights, with one requiring surgery after suffering serious injuries after falling from a roof. Another DOL case resolved last month involved children operating and cleaning a meat grinder and driving motor vehicles to deliver orders for a pizza restaurant in Iron River, Wisconsin.",

    "summary": "An Illinois mom got stuck with a big bill after taking her 3-year-old to the ER but never seeing a doctor. \"It's mind-blowing,\" she said.",
    "story": [
      "Ryan Wettstein Nauman was inconsolable one evening last December. After being put down for bed, the 3-year-old from Peoria, Illinois, just kept crying and crying and crying, and nothing would calm her down.",
      "Her mother, Maggi Wettstein, remembered fearing it could be a yeast or urinary tract infection, something they had been dealing with during potty training. The urgent care centers around them were closed for the night, so around 10:30 p.m. she decided to take Ryan to the emergency room at Carle Health.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "The ER wasn't very busy when they arrived at 10:48 p.m., Wettstein recalled. Medical records indicate they checked in and she explained Ryan's symptoms, including an intermittent fever. The toddler was triaged and given a nasal swab test to check for Covid-19 and influenza A and B.",
      "Wettstein said they sat down and waited to be called. And they waited.",
      "As Wettstein watched Ryan in the waiting room's play area, she noticed her daughter had stopped crying.",
      "In fact, she seemed fine.",
      "So Wettstein decided to drive them home. Ryan had preschool the next day, and she figured there was no point keeping her awake for who knew how much longer and getting stuck with a big ER bill.",
      "There was no one at the check-in desk to inform that they were leaving, Wettstein said, so they just headed home to go to bed.",
      "Ryan went to her preschool the next day, and Wettstein said they forgot all about the ER trip for eight months.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The final bill",
      "$445 for the combined Covid and flu test \u2014 from an ER visit in which the patient never made it beyond the waiting room.",
      "The billing problem: A healthy hospital markup and standard insurance rules",
      "Even though Ryan and her mother left without seeing a doctor, the family ended up owing $298.15 after an insurance discount.",
      "At first, Wettstein said, she couldn't recall Ryan being tested at all. It wasn't until she received the bill and requested her daughter's medical records that she learned the results. (Ryan tested negative for Covid and both types of flu.)",
      "While Wettstein said the bill isn't going to break the bank, it seemed high to her, considering Walgreens sells an at-home Covid and flu combination test for $30 and can do higher-quality PCR testing for $145.",
      "Under the public health emergency declared in 2020 for the Covid pandemic, insurance companies were required to pay for Covid tests without copayments or cost sharing for patients.",
      "That requirement ended when the emergency declaration expired in May 2023. Now, it is often patients who foot the bill \u2014 and ER bills are notoriously high.",
      "\"That's a pretty healthy markup the hospital is making on it,\" Loren Adler, associate director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy, told KFF Health News when contacted about Ryan's case.",
      "The rates the insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for various procedures are often based on multipliers of what Medicare pays, Adler said.",
      "Lab tests are one of the few areas in which insurance companies can often pay less than Medicare, he said \u2014 the exception being when the test is performed by the hospital laboratory, which is often what happens during ER visits.",
      "Medicare pays $142.63 for the joint test that Ryan received, but the family is on the hook for more than twice that amount, and the initial hospital charge was over three times as much.",
      "The hospital is \"utilizing their market power to make as much money as possible, and the insurance companies are not all that good at pushing back,\" Adler said. A markup of a few hundred dollars is a drop in the bucket for big insurers. But for the patients who get unexpected bills, it can be a big burden.",
      "Brittany Simon, a public relations manager for Carle Health, did not respond to specific questions but said in a statement, \"We follow policies that support the safety and wellbeing of our patients, which includes the initial triage of symptomatic patients to the Emergency Department.\"",
      "While Ryan's family would not have had to pay for a Covid test during the public health emergency, it was the family's insurer, Cigna, that did not have to pay this time, since the family had not yet met a $3,000 yearly deductible.",
      "A Cigna representative did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The resolution",
      "Wettstein said she knew she could just pay the bill and be done with it, \"but the fact that I never saw a provider, and the fact that it was just for a Covid test, is mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "She contacted the hospital's billing department to make sure the bill was correct. She explained what happened and said the hospital representative was also surprised by the size of the bill and sent it up for further review.",
      "\"'Don't pay this until you hear from me,'\" Wettstein remembered being told.",
      "Soon, though, she received a letter from the hospital explaining that the charge was correct and supported by documentation.",
      "Wettstein thought she was avoiding any charges by taking Ryan home without being seen. Instead, she got a bill \"that they have verified that I have to pay.\"",
      "\"Like I said, it's mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "The takeaway",
      "ERs are among the most expensive options for care in the nation's health system, and the meter can start running as soon as you check in \u2014 even if you check out before receiving care.",
      "If your issue isn't life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility, which is often cheaper (and look for posted notices to confirm whether it's actually an urgent care clinic). The urgent care centers near Ryan's home were closed that evening, but some facilities stay open late or around the clock.",
      "In some ways, Wettstein was lucky. KFF Health News' \"Bill of the Month\" has received tips from other patients who left an ER after a long wait without seeing a doctor \u2014 and got slapped with a facility fee of over $1,000.",
      "Making the decision about where to go is tough, especially in a stressful situation \u2014 such as when the patient is too young to communicate what's wrong. Trying to figure out what's going on physically with a 3-year-old can feel impossible.",
      "If you decide to leave an ER without treatment, don't just walk out. Tell the triage nurse you're leaving. You might get lucky and avoid some charges.",
      "Wettstein won't think twice about taking Ryan to the pediatrician or an urgent care center the next time she's ailing. But, Wettstein said, after getting this bill, \"I'm not going to create a habit out of going to the emergency room.\"",
      "Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills.

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 05:00:17 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal panel has been meeting for months to draft recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "A monthslong process to decide the federal government's food recommendations for the next five years is now set to stretch well into 2025. That timing means Biden officials will miss their opportunity to lock in new guidelines before the Trump administration takes over.",
      "Switching terms in the middle of an update is unprecedented in recent history, though previous versions have come close: an update in 2005 was finished days before the inauguration and the 2020 revision came a month before Biden took office.",
      "The guidelines are hotly contested in Washington because they influence a broad array of federal programs, ranging from rules on nutrition labels to standards for school lunches. They are traditionally based around a scientific report from outside experts.",
      "That committee has been meeting since last year, wrestling with an array of controversial questions, and is not expected to issue its recommendations until mid-December. It usually takes several months after their report is done for officials to publish their guidelines.",
      "This timeline was decided long before Election Day, one person familiar with the process told CBS News.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not comment on the timing of the report, except to confirm that it is expected \"later in the year.\"",
      "\"HHS and USDA continue to demonstrate their commitment to transparency, equity, and scientific integrity throughout the entire process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "It is virtually impossible for the Biden administration to finish an update before leaving office, former officials said. Too many tasks remain, like vetting the findings and developing and testing updated messaging through tools like MyPlate, which replaced the food pyramid.",
      "\"This is a very heavy lift, given the complexity and given the points of view of the different departments,\" said Dr. Brett Giroir, who served as assistant secretary for health in HHS under the Trump administration's last revision.",
      "Input from the public and agencies also must be worked into the guidelines, before the agriculture and health departments can come to an agreement.",
      "\"My belief is that when Congress tells two agencies to collaborate on something, that is an intended tension, hopefully to move the final product in the right direction. And I think certainly folks would agree that HHS and USDA often come from different constituencies, different perspectives,\" said Brandon Lipps, who was the USDA's deputy under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services under Trump.",
      "One expected fight will be over proposals floated last month by members of the committee \"to emphasize plant sources\" of protein, as part of a broader recommendation to \"shift\" to more \"nutrient dense, plant-based meals.\"",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump had accused his rival of wanting to \"stop people from eating red meat.\" In a statement last month, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association denounced the recommendations as \"unhinged\" and \"impractical.\"",
      "Under the drafts, beans, peas and lentils could be listed as protein sources too, not just vegetables. Red meat would be moved down the ranking of protein foods, over health concerns like cardiovascular disease.",
      "Red meats often needed to be substituted the most in American diets, analyses by the committee concluded, to cut health risks and still meet nutritional goals.",
      "\"Red meats, whether they were processed or not, were the ones to reduce more than the poultry or the eggs. So I would've put them very last,\" said Christopher Gardner, a member of the committee.",
      "How Trump administration officials could change the guidelines",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made changes to the committee a central part of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform.",
      "\"What we need to do is change the panel, so they're making good recommendations and they're telling people don't eat these foods,\" Kennedy said in September.",
      "They could also offer Kennedy a vehicle to accomplish his goals, like curbing ultra-processed foods in school lunches. If confirmed as secretary, Kennedy and his counterpart at USDA would have the ultimate authority over what goes into the guidelines.",
      "\"If Congress wanted a group of scientists to write the dietary guidelines, they would have put that in statute. So the committee makes recommendations, and the secretaries take the input from that report,\" said Lipps.",
      "Completely ignoring the committee's work would be unprecedented, though departments in the past \u2013 often driven by career civil servants \u2013 have sometimes disagreed with some recommendations.",
      "\"The process is not perfect, there's bureaucracy in there. But I do believe having transparent scientific committees that everybody knows where it's coming from is the best way to go,\" said Giroir.",

    "summary": "Contracted truckers hauling packages between Amazon facilities are more likely to engage in dangerous behavior on the roads than other carriers, according to federal data analyzed by CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The death of a 19-year-old college student on a Texas highway is raising questions about the fleet of drivers Amazon uses to move packages between its facilities. College freshman Iliana Velez's life was cut short in a crash with a contractor who was driving to pick up an Amazon load.",
      "A University of Texas freshman, Velez was working nights sorting packages part time at an Amazon fulfillment center.",
      "In the early morning hours of Jan. 3, 2022, Velez was on a break when she was forced off the road by a box truck driven by Jordan Sannicola, a contractor on his way to pick up an Amazon shipment. Velez's car rolled multiple times. She died at the scene.",
      "Her mother, Trula Velez, received the news from police that same evening.",
      "\"The officer knocked on my door and he said that she was involved in an accident, and she didn't make it,\" she said. \"I was such in a state of shock.\"",
      "When Sannicola was arrested four weeks later, investigators learned he had a history of traffic violations, a suspended driver's license and outstanding felony warrants, including one count of evading arrest with a vehicle. He told police he was using a hand-held mobile device when he collided with Iliana Velez's car.",
      "\"Someone with multiple warrants should not have been hired,\" Trula Velez said.",
      "A lawsuit filed by Trula Velez alleges Amazon had previously rejected Sannicola's application to deliver packages for the company's \"flex\" home delivery service after he failed a background check. Still, he was able to drive for an Amazon-contracted company. Despite his criminal history and driving record, Take Flight with B, a North Carolina motor carrier company, hired Sannicola to move Amazon freight.",
      "Missed warning signs?",
      "The Velez family attorney, Alex Hilliard, claims that because of the background check, Amazon was \"fully aware\" of Sannicola's poor driving record and criminal background when he started driving for Take Flight, which transported goods between Amazon facilities on a segment of the delivery network known as the \"middle mile.\"",
      "The lawsuit also alleges tracking technology provided by the Relay phone application Amazon uses to monitor driver location and performance had informed the company of Sannicola's unsafe driving behavior, but it failed to act.",
      "\"Mr. Sannicola had 70 different speeding violations [while working for Take Flight] that Amazon had been notified of,\" said Hilliard. \"They did nothing about that.\"",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal safety data revealed Amazon contractors primarily in the company's \"middle-mile\" delivery network had monthly violation rates \u2014 such as speeding and texting while driving \u2014 that were usually double those of carriers who didn't transport for Amazon. The analysis examined six years of monthly Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) unsafe driving rates and found the average rates of carriers who shipped for Amazon were at least 89% higher in every month.",
      "\"I was stunned,\" said Jason Miller, a professor at Michigan State University who is an expert in supply chain management. \"I've published many articles using these data. You do not see effects like this normally, where you have a set of carriers that is almost twice as unsafe as a different set of carriers.\"",
      "CBS News used roadside inspection reports in federal data to identify Amazon contractors. The reports, which are produced by law enforcement, indicate who a carrier said they were shipping for at the time of inspection. The analysis included carriers who shipped at least once for Amazon in the two years leading up to each month examined.",
      "Miller said the large patchwork of contractors Amazon uses for \"middle-mile\" transport poses challenges to ensuring a uniform culture of safety.",
      "\"The more you are essentially having your freight hauled by hundreds, if not thousands of small young firms, that makes it much more difficult to ensure those firms are operating safely versus a more - what we call strategic procurement model, where you may have a few very large carriers that you work with that handle a lot of freight,\" said Miller.",
      "In the past two years, at least 57 people have died in more than four dozen crashes involving federally regulated carriers shipping for Amazon, according to FMCSA data, though the data does not indicate who was at fault in these incidents. The FMCSA produces a crash involvement score for carriers, but it is not public.",
      "Amazon's response",
      "\"Any fatality is heartbreaking,\" said Tim Goodman, Amazon's global legal director for road safety. \"Any families that have been affected by this all have our condolences and our hearts go out to them.\"",
      "While Amazon mandates background checks for contracted drivers who deliver directly to customers' homes, Goodman said the company looks to the FMCSA to oversee \"middle-mile\" contractors who move freight between facilities in larger vehicles.",
      "A spokeswoman for FMCSA confirmed it requires contractors who dispatch commercial motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds to conduct background checks into drivers' safety performance history as a condition of employment.",
      "Amazon said when the company learns a contracted carrier has violated FMCSA guidelines, the carrier can face consequences, including permanent suspension.",
      "\"We have taken disciplinary action against around 19,000 motor carriers for failing to meet FMCSA safety requirements,\" Goodman said.",
      "Among those carriers is Take Flight with B, the contractor that hired Jordan Sannicola. Amazon confirmed it suspended Take Flight with B permanently from its contracted fleet.\u00a0 The motor carrier has since gone out of business.",
      "Goodman defended Amazon's continuing reliance on third-party trucking contractors to move its freight and deliver packages.",
      "\"In the United States, transportation with motor carriers is driven by independent businesses, small businesses,\" said Goodman. \"It has been that way since at least the Carter administration.\"",
      "\"We are unique at Amazon in terms of our scale,\" Goodman said. \"But it's a business model that has worked, and worked well, and we're committed to having it be a catalyst to be able to improve safety for the roads for all of us.\"",
      "Amazon disputes CBS News' data findings. In a statement sent after the interview, a spokesperson said: \"We've worked closely with CBS throughout this story, and are disappointed that they continue to use data based on a flawed methodology. We take safety incredibly seriously and the truth is that overall crash rates across third party carriers that we work with have improved. Our standards are stricter than FMCSA requirements, and we'll continue working to ensure our partners are the safest carriers on the road.\"",
      "Among other complaints, the company took issue with how CBS News identified Amazon contractors\u2014it said inspection reports sometimes list the wrong shipper\u2014and how CBS News measured a carrier's safety.",
      "Amazon measures safety using the FMCSA's \"unsafe driving score,\" which is a number that applies different standards depending on the size of the carrier. This score is not made public by the government, but the underlying data is. Rather than ranking the carriers by size, CBS News looked directly at the underlying rates of unsafe driving violations like texting and speeding.",
      "CBS News consulted with multiple leading supply chain researchers, who all use FMCSA measures in peer-reviewed studies. Alex Scott, a University of Tennessee professor and expert in supply chain management, said he does not use the FMCSA's scores in part because they make smaller carriers appear safer than they are.",
      "\"I don't think that makes any sense,\" Scott said. \"If they're less safe, then they're less safe.\"",
      "What the court system says",
      "On Oct. 11, a judge sentenced Jordan Sannicola to a 40-year prison term for the charge of \"failing to stop and render aid -- accident involving death\" in the crash that killed Iliana Velez.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 18:06:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk was seeking to reinstate a massive 2018 Tesla pay package after shareholders had reapproved it, but a judge denied his request.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's efforts to get his massive $56 billion 2018 Tesla pay package reinstated was rejected by a Delaware judge on Monday.",
      "The decision, issued by Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick, comes after a majority of Tesla shareholders in August reauthorized the compensation package during the electric vehicle maker's annual meeting.",
      "After it was initially approved in 2018, the pay package sparked a lawsuit from some Tesla shareholders who accused Musk and Tesla's board of directors of breaching their duties and unjustly enriching the billionaire. In January 2024, McCormick had ruled that Musk and his company failed to prove that the huge payout was legally warranted, prompting Musk to take the issue back to his shareholders in August.",
      "In her Dec. 2 decision, McCormick said that Musk had asked the court \"to flip its decision and enter judgment in their favor.\"",
      "She added, \"The motion to revise is denied,\" citing what the judge described as \"at least four fatal flaws\" in arguments from Musk's attorneys.",
      "\"The large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,\" McCormick noted.",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Shares of Tesla fell slightly in after-hours trading, dipping $4.74, or 1.3%, to $352.35. The stock has gained 47% in the last month, buoyed by investor optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's victory at the polls will help boost Tesla's prospects, given Musk's support for his campaign.",
      "The stock options Tesla granted to Musk were initially worth $2.6 billion but had soared to $56 billion when McCormick blocked the package in January, according to\u00a0Bloomberg News.",
      "\"No basis in the common law\"",
      "Musk's attorneys had argued that the second vote made clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick had earlier pointed out, were adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package. They asked the judge to vacate her order directing Tesla to rescind the pay package.",
      "Among the issues in their latest arguments, McCormick wrote, was a lack of procedural grounds for \"flipping the outcome of an adverse post-trial decision based on evidence they created after trial.\"",
      "She also objected to Musk's attempt to recertify the pay package through another shareholder vote, which she wrote his attorneys had argued served as \"common law ratification.\"",
      "\"What the defendants call 'common law ratification' has no basis in the common law \u2014 a stockholder vote standing alone cannot ratify a conflicted-controller transaction,\" she noted. \"[E]ven if a stockholder vote could have a ratifying effect, it could not do so here due to multiple, material misstatements in the proxy statement.\"",
      "McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argue they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.",
      "Despite the setback, Musk remains the world's wealthiest person, with a net worth of $343 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 16:11:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Feds find 11 kids illegally employed for at least 4 years at Seaboard Triumph Foods facility in Sioux Falls, Iowa.",
    "story": [
      "Federal investigators found nearly a dozen children to be working dangerous, overnight shifts at Seaboard Triumph Foods' pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, Iowa, the Department of Labor announced.",
      "Employed by Guymon, Oklahoma-based sanitation contractor Qvest, 11 kids allegedly used corrosive cleaners to sanitize head splitters, jaw pullers, bandsaws, neck clippers and other equipment at the Seaboard Triumph Foods facility from at least September 2019 through September 2023, the DOL stated in a news release\u00a0on Friday.",
      "Federal law\u00a0prohibits\u00a0minors from working in meat processing due to an increased risk of injury.",
      "Seaboard Foods is among the nation's biggest pork producers. In addition to Iowa, Seaboard Foods, a division of Seaboard Corporation, has operations in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah, and in Mexico, according to the company's website.",
      "\"These findings illustrate Seaboard Triumph Foods' history of children working illegally in their Sioux City facility since at least September 2019. Despite changing sanitation contractors, children continued to work in dangerous occupations at this facility,\" Michael Lazzeri, the Midwest regional administrator with the DOL's Wage and Hour division, stated in the release.",
      "Qvest must pay $171,919 in child labor civil monetary penalties and take steps to prevent it from illegally hiring minors again.",
      "Qvest and Seaboard did not return requests for comment.",
      "Still, children under 18 illegally employed in dangerous jobs in meat and poultry slaughtering and processing operations is not unique in the industry or to the Seaboard Foods plant in Sioux Falls.",
      "Seaboard in September 2023 contracted Fayette Janitorial Services for sanitation work at its facility. After taking over the plant's sanitation services contract, Fayette allegedly rehired some of the children previously employed by Qvest, with the Somerville, Tennessee-based contractor earlier this year found to be employing nine minors at the Sioux Falls plant, the DOL alleged.",
      "Fayette also allegedly hired 15 children as young as 13 at a Perdue Farms processing plant in Accomac, Virginia, where a 14-year-old was severely injured. Perdue terminated its contract with Fayette before the DOL's court filing, the company said.",
      "Are migrant kids cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses?",
      "The development is part of an ongoing probe into whether migrant kids are cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses. It also comes less than a year after the government fined another sanitation services provider $1.5 million for employing more than 100 kids \u2014 \u00a0ages 13 to 17\u00a0\u2014 at 13 meat processing plants in eight states.",
      "The DOL launched its investigation after a published report detailed migrant kids working overnight for contractors in poultry processing facilities on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. A New York Times Magazine\u00a0story\u00a0last December detailed children cleaning blood, grease and feathers from equipment with acid and pressure hoses.",
      "The Times'\u00a0account\u00a0included details of a 14-year-old boy who was maimed while cleaning a conveyor belt in a deboning area at a Perdue slaughterhouse in rural Virginia. The eighth grader was among thousands of Mexican and Central American children who have crossed the border on their own to work in dangerous jobs.",
      "But it's not only migrant children tasked with illegal and dangerous work. A 16-year-old high school student, Michael Schuls, died last summer after getting\u00a0trapped in a machine at a Wisconsin sawmill.",
      "From an elevated waterslide at a Jacksonville, Florida, beach park to a sawmill in Clarkrange, Tennessee, federal investigators are finding children across the country working illegal hours and performing risky, unlawful tasks. In May, federal investigators found a 13-year-old girl allegedly working up to 60 hours a week on an assembly line in Luverne, Alabama.",
      "More recently, the DOL found a Grand Rapids, Michigan, window cleaning company had illegally hired three kids to clean residential windows and gutters, and to install Christmas lights, with one requiring surgery after suffering serious injuries after falling from a roof. Another DOL case resolved last month involved children operating and cleaning a meat grinder and driving motor vehicles to deliver orders for a pizza restaurant in Iron River, Wisconsin.",
      "The DOL's Wage and Hour division oversaw 736 investigations uncovering child labor violations affecting 4,030 children in fiscal 2024, the agency stated.",
      "In addition to the federal government, the state of Massachusetts recently took aim at companies violating child labor laws, citing an operator of dozens of Burger King franchise locations across the state for allegedly scheduling minors to work more than the legally allowed hours. Separately, Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell reached a settlement with a New Jersey-based owner of Popeyes franchises across Massachusetts to resolve similar allegations, her office stated last week.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:41:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create your own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have the type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said. \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa, according to trade data.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 10:10:33 -0500",
    "summary": "A CBS News investigation tracked plastic cups from Starbucks recycling bins to landfills and incinerators across the country.",
    "story": [
      "Many consumers trust that when they toss a plastic cup into a recycling bin at a restaurant or coffee shop, it will be recycled and turned into something new. However, a CBS News investigation uncovered that this isn't always true.",
      "CBS News investigated what happens at one of the largest users of plastic cups that advertises its recycling practices: Starbucks. Reporters placed plastic cold drink cups, embedded with trackers, into 57 labeled recycling bins at Starbucks locations across the country to see where the cups went. Only 36 provided reliable data.",
      "The trackers were superglued between two Starbucks cold drink plastic cups and CBS News monitored each tracker's location multiple times a day until the trackers stopped moving.",
      "Of the 36 cups CBS News dropped, 32 did not go to a recycling facility. Fourteen cups were traced to landfills, five to incinerators, and thirteen to waste transfer stations, where trash is compacted before being sent to landfills or incinerators. Only four cups were traced to Material Recovery Facilities, where recyclables are sorted and prepared for reuse.",
      "While attaching a metal Bluetooth tracker to plastic and placing it in a recycling bin could contaminate the item and prevent it from being recycled, only four of the cups tagged by CBS News went to facilities that sort and remove this type of contamination, whereas the rest were immediately diverted for the landfill or incineration.",
      "Two of the trackers revealed a surprising journey: one dropped at a Starbucks in New Jersey and another in Boston both traveled thousands of miles before ultimately ending up in the same landfill in Alabama.",
      "\"When it comes to recycling, companies across the country and the world are lying about all these single-use plastics, saying they're recyclable,\" said Jan Dell, a former chemical engineer and founder of The Last Beach Cleanup, a nonprofit dedicated to combating plastic pollution. \"They're not telling the truth.\"",
      "The challenge of plastic waste",
      "Americans produce more plastic waste each year than any other country \u2013 almost 500 pounds per person. Most of that plastic ends up as trash, according to a 2022 Greenpeace USA report, which revealed that the U.S. recycling rate for plastics is less than 6%.",
      "Companies such as Starbucks, which sells beverages to more than 6 billion customers a year globally, are a major generator of plastic waste. More than 75% of Starbucks' U.S. beverage sales are cold drinks, often served in plastic cups, but the company aims to reduce its overall waste by 50% by 2030.",
      "\"Our goal for cups is that 100% of our customer-facing cups will be reusable, recyclable or compostable,\" says Amelia Landers, vice president of innovation and solutions at Starbucks. Landers was part of the team that redesigned its cold plastic cups in April to be made with up to 20% less plastic, which she says will help divert more than 13 million pounds of plastic from landfills each year.",
      "\"There's a guilt factor associated with using the single-use plastic, for maybe 20 minutes, and then having it exist in the landfill forever, or get incinerated and cause carbon emissions,\" said Dell, which is one of the reasons she believes Starbucks encourages recycling in-store.",
      "But making sure that Starbucks cup is recycled is harder than you might think. Unlike other recyclable materials such as glass, paper or aluminum, plastics are not uniform. Thousands of different types exist, each with unique characteristics, chemicals and additives, making sorting and recycling nearly impossible. For instance, certain beverage bottles cannot be recycled with food containers because they are made from different types of plastic, are different shapes and may be different colors.",
      "Can Starbucks cups be recycled?",
      "Consumers assume items like Starbucks cups can be recycled because of the arrows on the cup or blue bins in the store, but only 9% of Material Recovery Facilities sort the specific plastic that makes a Starbucks cup to be sold as recycled content and very few places actually buy that plastic to recycle it into new content.",
      "Starbucks cups are made out of polypropylene, or No. 5 plastic, and Landers told CBS News that these cups are designed to be recyclable and there are facilities that do this in the U.S. CBS News asked Starbucks to send a list of companies that recycle No. 5 plastic beverage cups. They sent a list of four facilities: three that collected and sorted No. 5 plastics, but only one company, KW Plastics in Alabama, recycles No. 5 cups into new plastic items.",
      "KW Plastics is one of a handful of facilities in America that recycles No. 5 plastics into new material, but of the 160,000 tons of plastic waste made up of No. 5 cups and plates generated in the U.S. each year, less than 1% is recycled, according to the latest EPA report on plastic recycling.",
      "A reusable solution",
      "Starbucks officials say they can only control what happens inside the company's stores, and work with outside partners to ensure its waste ends up in the right place.",
      "\"We're working to increase the recycle capture of the plastic cups so that the recyclability has higher potential,\" says Landers. Her team is currently testing new cup materials and models to encourage reusable cups both in the store, and for customers to take away.",
      "\"The more we can offer customers to sit and stay, that takes a tremendous amount of single-use cups out of the landfill entirely,\" she says.",

    "summary": "As the holiday shopping season kicks off, here are five ways retailers try to get consumers to spend.",
    "story": [
      "As shoppers gear up for Black Friday and the holiday shopping season, it can be easy for people to rack up debt that will weigh them down well into the new year. So it pays for consumers to be aware of some of the tactics retailers employ to get them to spend.",
      "For example, most offers that dangle savings in the form of free shipping or a free gift if you spend over a certain amount don't save you money. The practice, called \"spaving,\" or spending more in order to save, rarely benefits consumers, according to personal finance experts.",
      "\"I understand the appeal of getting to checkout and a notification pops up saying spend $10 more to get some perk,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But 90% of the time when you break it down, it doesn't make sense. You're not actually saving money if you are spending more of it.\"",
      "Here are five tactics retailers use to get you to spend more, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), a consumer advocacy group.",
      "Creating a false sense of urgency",
      "The fear of missing out on a good deal can nudge consumers into making impulse buys. Although some offers really are only valid for a limited time, U.S. PIRG identified a number of sellers on Etsy, an e-commerce site for independent craftspeople, who used fake countdown clocks for deals that never expire.",
      "Of 20 top-selling products on the site with countdown timers on deals, 80% of them simply reset when their tickers tickers hit \"0,\" according to a PIRG study.",
      "\"The 'limited' time window may not be as limited as it sounds and the deals not as good as they seem,\" U.S. PIRG's R.J. Cross told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Make your list, comparison shop on those items, and don't get distracted by offers you haven't had the time to think through.\"",
      "Implying scarcity",
      "Online retailers may label products as \"selling fast!\" or, as a consumer is considering a purchase, display how many other consumers are browsing the same item.",
      "\"Retailers and advertisers are always trying to get you to buy more than you need and spend more than you want,\" Cross said in a statement.\u00a0\"Once you know what to look for, you end up chuckling when you see these tactics instead of falling for them.\"",
      "Pricing tricks",
      "Ever wonder why a price reads $4.99 and not simply $5? When sellers round an item's price down, it suggests to a shopper that it is cheaper, PIRG notes. Although $4.99 is only a penny less than $5, a shopper is more likely to fixate on the dollar figure \u2014 $4 \u2014 versus the cents.",
      "Even removing a comma from a high sticker price like $1,200 and displaying it as $1200 can entice someone to pull the trigger, according to PIRG. Meanwhile, breaking the cost of an item down into monthly installments can also make the price seem smaller than it really is, the organization noted.",
      "\"You're still going to have to pay the full cost, and sometimes\u00a0even more in late fees, if you're not careful,\" Cross pointed out.",
      "Dubious testimonials",
      "Many retailers feature online testimonials ostensibly from customers raving about a \"life-changing\" vacuum cleaner or pair of sweatpants. Some of these account are from real customers, while other reviews cannot be trusted because they have been generated by a bot or the company itself, PIRG said.",
      "At bottom, it's a form of peer pressure \u2014 shoppers are subtly induced to think that buying the product will make them as happy as the satisfied customers depicted in the testimonial. In reality, many online reviews are fake, especially as AI bots proliferate.",
      "\"When you look at reviews on a product, don't necessarily take the star ratings for granted. Better to look through the comments and find those that seem real \u2014 that either include a picture of the product or that make a point specific to the product instead of a generic note like 'great product!'\" Cross recommends.",
      "Appeals based on fear",
      "Many marketing pitches and ads suggest that your life will somehow be worse if you don't make a purchase, from being at risk of a home invasion to hair loss. With e-commerce, of course, such messages are tailored to your individual interests and tastes given that website cookies track and share your browsing patterns with retailers.",
      "Messages \"about how to fix our perceived flaws only become more capable of finding us at all hours of the day whenever we go online,\" Cross said.",

    "summary": "Some companies are weaving Trump's tariffs into their marketing efforts, telling consumers to buy now in case prices rise.",
    "story": [
      "Some retailers are using President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs to urge consumers to shop now, suggesting if the import duties go into effect next year, a\u00a0range of goods could cost Americans a lot more money.",
      "It's yet another sales tactic some companies are implementing, in addition to the traditional Black Friday discounts, to get consumers to spend as much as possible ahead of the holidays.",
      "On Monday, Trump pledged to add a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. The proposed taxes are in addition to earlier campaign promises to impose a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, once he takes office.",
      "While\u00a0prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise if Trump moves forward with his tariff proposals, some retail experts say that retailers may be seeking to tap into people's universal fear of missing out on a limited-time offer or experience. But the tactic could also rub some shoppers the wrong way, experts caution.",
      "\"It's a double-edged sword. I think it it might get people interested in buying things, but it could also split consumers if they think everyone's going to bring their prices up,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. \"The other problem is it's slightly political as well, so some retailers would want to steer clear of it.\"",
      "While Trump has said he plans to move forward with tariffs, some economists have pointed out that the next administration may simply use the duties as a bargaining chip, which could enable the White House to strike new trade deals, for instance. Even though the tariffs are far from certain, a number of companies have explicitly said the levies floated by Trump would inevitably force them to raise prices for consumers.",
      "\"Lock in our current prices\"",
      "For example, filtered shower head maker Jolie recently said it would have pass along some of the anticipated costs from the tariffs to consumers. In a recent email to customers, the company said that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",
      "Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy CEO Corie Barry similarly said on its latest earnings call that the goods it sells could become more expensive under Trump's proposed tariffs.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors on Nov. 26, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "\"Pre-tariff\" sales",
      "And on Facebook, a Dallas, Texas-based furniture store called Finally Home Furnishings, announced a \"pre-tariff sale\" that runs until January, earlier this month.",
      "\"Get a deal while you still can,\" the retailer said.",
      "Finally Home Furnishings did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment, or indicate how much it expects it may need to hike prices if new tariffs go into effect.",
      "Etsy seller Buzzy Park, who sells handmade bamboo picture frames, also advertised a \"pre-tariff \" sale on his entire inventory, starting this month and lasting until any new tariffs go into effect. \"Hurry and get them at their current prices,\" Park wrote in a social media post.",
      "While prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise, some marketing and retail experts say that even sellers who don't expect to face added costs could be using potential tariffs as an excuse to charge customers more.",
      "\"If consumers panic about things getting more expensive, they are playing right into the hands of companies around the country to use it as an excuse to raise prices, even when it's not necessary,\" said Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group. \"",
      "He added, It's a pretty handy excuse when you are in a constant battle with consumers on price.\"",

      "Where can I buy the book?",
      "The new keepsake, titled \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,\" is available exclusively at Target. It hit the retailer's stores on Friday, while it will become available for sale on Target's website\u00a0on Saturday. Swift self-published the book under Taylor Swift Publications.",
      "Some Target stores opened as early as 6 a.m. in anticipation of Black Friday shopping crowds and Taylor Swift fans.",
      "Target first teased the book launch in an Instagram\u00a0post on Oct. 15. Swift herself also promoted the book in an Instagram\u00a0post that garnered more than 3.6 million likes.",
      "What's in The Eras Tour book?",
      "The 256-page hardcover title, which costs $39.99, includes unreleased photographs of Swift in concert from every period of her career, according to Target.",
      "The book also documents the production of Swift's epic Eras Tour, which kicked off in August 2023, including \"personal reflections\" written by the artist herself.",
      "In tandem with the book release, Target is also exclusively launching \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\" album as both a vinyl record and CD. The recording feature 35 tracks, including four acoustic versions of the following songs: \"Fortnight,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him\" and \"Guilty as Sin?\"",
      "Two million copies of the book have been printed, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Assuming the initial print run sells out, it would generate nearly $80 million in sales. Forbes puts Swift's net at worth $1. 6 billion, including $600 million from music royalties and touring, a music catalog valued at an estimated $600 million, and $125 million in real estate.",
      "Swift alone could be a forceful enough economic engine to boost Target. The retailer's latest sales and profit figures fell short of analysts' expectations, while Target lowered its earnings forecast for the current quarter. Analysts say that inflation-weary consumers are after deeper discounts than the retailer can offer, or simply aren't making as many discretionary purchases.",
      "\"Consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched, and they are shopping carefully,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a Nov. 20 earnings call.",
      "That restraint seems unlikely to deter the Swifties, the singer's rabid fans, as she prepares to wind up the Eras Tour in Vancouver on Dec. 8.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 23:09:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Canada's Competition Bureau says that an investigation found the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",
      "Mehta also found that Google in 2021 Google paid about $26 billion to Apple and other partners to ensure its search engine would be the default one on internet browsers.",
      "His ruling stemmed from a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit first filed against Google in October 2020 during the first Trump administration.",
      "Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling, but the tech giant must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so. The appeals process could take as long as five years, predicts George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s.",

    "summary": "Experts warn of fabricated websites posing as retailers to scam shoppers looking for Black Friday deals.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are warning that fraudsters are exploiting Black Friday sales to target U.S. shoppers with fake websites and ads for major brands like IKEA, Wayfair and The North Face, after online scams hit record highs in 2023.",
      "A new report released by threat intelligence company EclecticIQ identified a campaign that operates a sprawling network of fabricated websites using \"Trusted Store\" badges to lure shoppers with fake products.",
      "When consumers attempt to make a purchase, scammers steal their personal and payment information. The consumers are often unaware they were scammed until they fail to receive the product.",
      "Reports of online fraud in 2023 exceeded $12.5 billion in potential losses \u2014   a 22% jump from 2022, according to FBI data. Officials say increasingly sophisticated scams are using tools including AI to power their campaigns.",
      "\"With the way it now seems like everyone is shopping online, reliance on digital platforms has handed these groups a wider attack surface than ever,\" EclecticIQ CEO Cody Barrow told CBS News. \"Unfortunately, it's likely we'll see its impact stretch into next week.\"",
      "The scams",
      "EclecticIQ says it identified at least 8,000 fabricated sites that lure shoppers by offering steep \"deals\" on popular brands. The websites are not affiliated with the brands they appear to represent, but are designed to look like official sites and use URLs that appear authentic.",
      "In one example, a site posing as Wayfair used the URL wayfairtoday.com. Another site used the URL wayfairblackfriday.com. The website was registered in early November and offered fake \"deals\" including an $800 mattress reduced to $39.",
      "CBS News also found an ad appropriating Wayfair's logo that directed users to another counterfeit site posing as the retailer. It was removed from Meta's ad library as of Friday. Wayfair told CBS News that it is actively monitoring scams to ensure customers are protected.",
      "Analysts discovered Mandarin coding and Chinese IP addresses on the sites, indicating that the phishing campaign was operated by a China-based group. IKEA told CBS News it was investigating one of the scam websites using its name that EclecticIQ identified.",
      "Separately, an ad on Facebook and Instagram using The North Face logo routed users to a fabricated site. The ad was removed for policy violations, and The North Face told CBS News it was working with Meta and \"other partners\" to combat scam sites.",
      "\"Scammers use every online platform available to them and constantly evolve their tactics in order to evade enforcement,\" said Meta spokesperson Erin Logan. \"In this instance, our systems proactively detected and removed a number of these ads before they were reported to us.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission released data in February that shows online shopping fraud was the second most common type of fraud reported in 2023.",
      "Experts say fraudulent sites and ads remain a pervasive issue. \"Many of the scam sites are short-lived campaigns, so it's an ongoing effort to identify new sites,\" Ilya Volovik, director of Recorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence, told CBS News. \"Some of the longer living scam sites change their 'sales' advertisement based on a holiday.\"",
      "Tips to protect yourself",
      "Cliff Steinhauer, director of Information Security and Engagement at the National Cybersecurity Alliance, said consumers should take precautions, stay alert when online shopping and act quickly if they believe they have been scammed.",
      "Secure your accounts. Experts recommend setting up multifactor authentication as well as strong and unique passwords for all accounts, including shopping and bank sites.",
      "Avoid unfamiliar links: Be wary of links from unsolicited emails and text messages. Instead, use a search engine to navigate to the retailer's website.",
      "Look for red flags. Be wary of deals that appear too good to be true, as well as websites that use excessive pop-ups and urgent language. If in doubt, leave the site.",
      "Research the website. Look up reviews from other shoppers who have used the site. Visit the Better Business Bureau's website, which maintains a database with ratings for millions of businesses.",
      "If you think you have been the victim of fraud, immediately notify your bank to reverse the charges. You should also change the passwords to your online accounts. File a police report if you experience harassment or repeated attempts to steal more of your information.",
      "Experts also recommend freezing your credit on the three major credit reporting bureaus if your personal information has been compromised through a data breach. This will ensure your identity can't be stolen in the event that scammers obtain your social security number.",

      "Experts say a volley of tariffs between the U.S. and Canada could tip both countries into a recession and severely disrupt cross-border commerce between the key trading partners.",
      "A Canadian government official said Wednesday it is exploring potential retaliatory levies on certain U.S. imports after President-elect Donald Trump on Monday threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office. The official, who stressed no final decision has been taken, spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.",

      "Trump tariffs on Canada imports could lead to sharply higher gas prices, experts warn",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum earlier this week also hinted that the country could retaliate against the U.S. with its own tariffs on American products. Trump said the stepped-up duties are necessary to curb the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs from Mexico and Canada.",
      "\"Blanket 25% tariffs on Canada threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump earlier this week would push Canada into a recession in 2025, cause a sharp spike in inflation and force the Bank of Canada to hold rates higher next year,\" economist Michael Davenport of Oxford Economics said in a report Thursday.",
      "Inflation in Canada would top 7% by mid-2025, while unemployment would approach 8% by year-end, according to the investment research firm. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would take the biggest hit, he added, noting that the sectors also depend on components from American suppliers.",
      "Canada fired back with duties of its own when Trump slapped tariffs on the country's steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. during his first stint in the White House. Canada targeted U.S. products including whiskey and yogurt, most of which came from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security and work with the Trump administration to lower the numbers from Canada. The Canadians are also worried about an influx of migrants if Trump follows through with his plan for mass deportations.",
      "U.S. also would feel the pain",
      "Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0have said\u00a0tariffs deployed during his first term advanced U.S. economic aims, including boosting federal revenue, and didn't boost inflation.",
      "But the U.S. likely wouldn't go unscathed in a full-blown trade war with Canada. Across-the-board tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S. and fracture political relations between the allies, according to Oxford.",
      "Although the U.S. is the world's leading oil producer, Canada supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied the tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With so much on the line, the incoming Trump administration is more likely to impose limited tariffs on Canadian products, such as steel, lumber and farm products like dairy.",
      "\"Despite Trump's latest threat of blanket tariffs, we still think it's unlikely that the Trump administration will put tariffs on Canadian autos and energy exports, which make up about 40% of total Canadian exports to the U.S.,\" Davenport said. \"The North American energy sector and auto supply chains are highly integrated across the U.S.-Canada border and any tariffs on these goods would also have a significant negative effect on the US economy.\"",

      "To be sure, it remains uncertain if Trump will follow through on his trade threats.

    "story": [
      "Prices could rise\u00a0on a variety of goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas under tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose as soon as he takes office next year, according to experts.",
      "Trump on Monday pledged to put a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. The tariffs are not certain to go into effect, and if they are implemented, their impact would depend on how they are structured and if certain categories are exempted.",
      "Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0have argued that his first-term tariffs didn't boost inflation, and that import taxes can provide valuable benefits to American workers and businesses. Among them, Trump has said, are protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs and boosting federal revenue, although tariffs are paid by importers and often passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "For their part, experts and business groups are clear that tariffs would lift prices. A barrage of new duties on foreign imports would likely boost consumer costs on everything from vacuum cleaners to tiki torches, which are largely imported from China and are already subject to tariffs, according to Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group.",
      "\"A lot of vacuum cleaners are made in China, so that's one I could be sort of confident you're going to see some price effects on,\" he said.",
      "Consumer electronics",

      "The trade group \u2014 which modeled the impact of a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, coupled with a 60% levy on goods from the country that Trump previously floated \u2014 estimated that laptops and tablets would see the steepest price hikes, with costs surging as much as 45%. Video game consoles and smartphones could also see double-digit gains.",
      "Researchers assumed retailers would pass all added costs related to tariffs along to consumers. In the smartphone category, the average increase in price would be $213 per device, according to CTA.",
      "\"The likelihood of retailers or any importer absorbing the tariff cost is very low, so the pass through to consumers will be quick,\" said Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at CTA. \"On all the products we looked at, there are going to be price increases.\"",
      "Best Buy CEO Cory Barrie on Tuesday also said on the company's earnings call that Trump's proposed tariffs would force the retailer to raise costs on a\u00a0range of consumer electronics, noting that \"there's very little in consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "Footwear",
      "Footwear is another goods category that experts are watching. According to Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA), 99% of footwear sold in the U.S. is imported from other countries, with 56% of footwear by volume coming from China.",
      "\"We know that if they apply tariffs on Chines goods and Chinese footwear, it will hit working families the hardest,\" FDRA CEO Matt Priest told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some retailers could also decide to hike prices whether or not they face added costs related to potential tariffs. \"It's a pretty handy excuse when you're in a constant battle with consumers on price,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Home goods",
      "A number of retailers have already suggested that the proposed tariffs could force them to raise prices. In an email to customers, filtered shower head maker Jolie said this week that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",

      "\"Tariffs make it more difficult for us to maintain the low prices and be affordable for many people, which in the end is our goal,\" Jesper Brodin, Ingka Group CEO, told CNN. \"But it's beyond our control. We will need to understand and adapt.\"",
      "Gasoline",
      "Adding a 25% tariff to Canadian imports would affect crude oil, which is imported from Western Canada and refined at U.S. facilities, according to Patrick De Haan, an analyst at Gas Buddy.",
      "\"Canada and Mexico are huge U.S. trading partners, so it's a shot across the bow of longtime U.S. allies,\" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "So should consumers be thinking about buying certain products now ahead of possible tariffs next year? Brzytwa thinks so.",
      "\"People should be thinking about buying now. From all indications we have, the Trump administration wants to move as fast as possible to impose much higher tariffs on imports from China, including products not yet subject to tariffs,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:51:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what a noted housing expert thinks will happen to mortgage rates next year as Donald Trump outlines his priorities.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has promised to lower prices for Americans, but his economic policies may not help one embattled part of the economy: the housing market.",
      "Mortgage rates continue to hover near a 20-year high, while house hunters face near record high\u00a0home prices. The Federal Reserve's two rate cuts, in September and November, haven't trickled through to mortgages, which instead have climbed during the past month and are again hovering close to 7%.",
      "That's because mortgage rates are based on several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond. The latter surged after Trump's November 5 electoral victory on concerns that his policies, including stiff tariffs on U.S. imports, big tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants could drive up inflation.",
      "A key question for housing",
      "Housing affordability is viewed as a top problem within the U.S. by Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, according to a May\u00a0poll from the Bipartisan Policy Center. The difficulty of affording a home, as well as the impact of rising rents, are issues that colored how voters viewed the economy leading into the election, with the high cost of living top of mind for many.",
      "\"Going forward, the key question is: Are some of the Trump proposals inflationary or non-inflationary?\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One alarming part is tariffs \u2014 that means imported products will be more expensive, and it could take time for domestic production to ramp up.\"",
      "Trump on Monday pledged to put a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods. Those costs could boost the U.S. inflation rate by almost 1 percentage point, according to a new Goldman Sachs estimate. Higher inflation in turn could lead the Fed to slow or even pause its rate cuts \u2013 another blow to Americans hoping for lower borrowing costs.",
      "Where will mortgage rates go in 2025?",
      "To be sure, forecasting mortgage rates is difficult, given the number of factors that influence them. Yet based on Trump's stated economic plans, Yun said he thinks the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate will bounce around between 6% and 7% for the next year, and could stick around 6.5% for much of 2025.",
      "But, he added, there's a risk mortgage rates could inch even higher if Trump's policies prove more inflationary than expected. Higher mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars in monthly costs for borrowers.",
      "Another issue is whether Trump's policies could widen the federal deficit, which impacts borrowing as well as the yield on the 10-year Treasury. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget forecasts that Trump's proposals would increase the federal budget deficit by $7.75 trillion over the next decade.",
      "To pay interest on that debt, the government would likely have to issue more bonds, like 10-year Treasurys. That could lead investors to demand higher yields, or the return they receive for investing in the bonds. As those yields rise, that would push mortgage rates higher.",
      "\"In the first Trump presidency, the average mortgage rate was about 4% to 5%,\" Yun said, adding, \"We won't get back to that 4% to 5% of that first Trump presidency.\"",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Most Americans report that housing in their communities has become less affordable during the past year, a trend they don't see improving, the Bipartisan Policy Center found.",
      "The median sale price of U.S. homes has dropped slightly during the past year, dipping to about $420,000 in the third quarter from $435,000 a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But that's also considerably higher than the median sale price of $329,000 at the start of 2020, just prior to the pandemic.",
      "The double whammy of high home costs and mortgage rates is pricing many buyers out of the market. The share of first-time home buyers dropped to 24% in 2024, the lowest since 1981, when the National Association of Realtors started tracking the metric. Prior to 2008, the share of first-time buyers had historically been 40%.",
      "That's a problem for would-be homebuyers \u2014 as well as the nation's overall economic health \u2014 because homeownership is a key to building personal wealth. People who delay buying a home have fewer years to grow their assets, which can in turn crimp their ability to build a nest egg for their later years.",
      "The difference in wealth between homeowners and renters is stark: Homeowners had a median net worth of $396,200 in 2022, compared with $10,400 for renters and other non-homeowners, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "While mortgage rates might not see much relief in 2025, home prices are likely to remain stable, Yun predicted.",
      "\"The American way is to buy a home,\" he said. \"Maybe it's a little smaller, or not perfectly ideal, but then trade up to the next home \u2014 in terms of buying rather than delaying, the data shows that homeowners build wealth, while renters are spinning their wheels.\"",

      "As Wettstein watched Ryan in the waiting room's play area, she noticed her daughter had stopped crying.",
      "In fact, she seemed fine.",
      "So Wettstein decided to drive them home. Ryan had preschool the next day, and she figured there was no point keeping her awake for who knew how much longer and getting stuck with a big ER bill.",
      "There was no one at the check-in desk to inform that they were leaving, Wettstein said, so they just headed home to go to bed.",
      "Ryan went to her preschool the next day, and Wettstein said they forgot all about the ER trip for eight months.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The final bill",
      "$445 for the combined Covid and flu test \u2014 from an ER visit in which the patient never made it beyond the waiting room.",
      "The billing problem: A healthy hospital markup and standard insurance rules",
      "Even though Ryan and her mother left without seeing a doctor, the family ended up owing $298.15 after an insurance discount.",
      "At first, Wettstein said, she couldn't recall Ryan being tested at all. It wasn't until she received the bill and requested her daughter's medical records that she learned the results. (Ryan tested negative for Covid and both types of flu.)",
      "While Wettstein said the bill isn't going to break the bank, it seemed high to her, considering Walgreens sells an at-home Covid and flu combination test for $30 and can do higher-quality PCR testing for $145.",
      "Under the public health emergency declared in 2020 for the Covid pandemic, insurance companies were required to pay for Covid tests without copayments or cost sharing for patients.",
      "That requirement ended when the emergency declaration expired in May 2023. Now, it is often patients who foot the bill \u2014 and ER bills are notoriously high.",
      "\"That's a pretty healthy markup the hospital is making on it,\" Loren Adler, associate director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy, told KFF Health News when contacted about Ryan's case.",
      "The rates the insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for various procedures are often based on multipliers of what Medicare pays, Adler said.",
      "Lab tests are one of the few areas in which insurance companies can often pay less than Medicare, he said \u2014 the exception being when the test is performed by the hospital laboratory, which is often what happens during ER visits.",
      "Medicare pays $142.63 for the joint test that Ryan received, but the family is on the hook for more than twice that amount, and the initial hospital charge was over three times as much.",
      "The hospital is \"utilizing their market power to make as much money as possible, and the insurance companies are not all that good at pushing back,\" Adler said. A markup of a few hundred dollars is a drop in the bucket for big insurers. But for the patients who get unexpected bills, it can be a big burden.",
      "Brittany Simon, a public relations manager for Carle Health, did not respond to specific questions but said in a statement, \"We follow policies that support the safety and wellbeing of our patients, which includes the initial triage of symptomatic patients to the Emergency Department.\"",
      "While Ryan's family would not have had to pay for a Covid test during the public health emergency, it was the family's insurer, Cigna, that did not have to pay this time, since the family had not yet met a $3,000 yearly deductible.",
      "A Cigna representative did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The resolution",
      "Wettstein said she knew she could just pay the bill and be done with it, \"but the fact that I never saw a provider, and the fact that it was just for a Covid test, is mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "She contacted the hospital's billing department to make sure the bill was correct. She explained what happened and said the hospital representative was also surprised by the size of the bill and sent it up for further review.",
      "\"'Don't pay this until you hear from me,'\" Wettstein remembered being told.",
      "Soon, though, she received a letter from the hospital explaining that the charge was correct and supported by documentation.",
      "Wettstein thought she was avoiding any charges by taking Ryan home without being seen. Instead, she got a bill \"that they have verified that I have to pay.\"",
      "\"Like I said, it's mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "The takeaway",
      "ERs are among the most expensive options for care in the nation's health system, and the meter can start running as soon as you check in \u2014 even if you check out before receiving care.",
      "If your issue isn't life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility, which is often cheaper (and look for posted notices to confirm whether it's actually an urgent care clinic). The urgent care centers near Ryan's home were closed that evening, but some facilities stay open late or around the clock.",
      "In some ways, Wettstein was lucky. KFF Health News' \"Bill of the Month\" has received tips from other patients who left an ER after a long wait without seeing a doctor \u2014 and got slapped with a facility fee of over $1,000.",
      "Making the decision about where to go is tough, especially in a stressful situation \u2014 such as when the patient is too young to communicate what's wrong. Trying to figure out what's going on physically with a 3-year-old can feel impossible.",
      "If you decide to leave an ER without treatment, don't just walk out. Tell the triage nurse you're leaving. You might get lucky and avoid some charges.",
      "Wettstein won't think twice about taking Ryan to the pediatrician or an urgent care center the next time she's ailing. But, Wettstein said, after getting this bill, \"I'm not going to create a habit out of going to the emergency room.\"",
      "Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills. Since 2018, this series has helped many patients and readers get their medical bills reduced, and it has been cited in statehouses, at the U.S. Capitol, and at the White House.

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 08:57:06 -0500",
    "summary": "23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki talks to \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King about the company's recent struggles, welcoming employee feedback and her vision for the future of the genetic-testing and ancestry-tracing company.",
    "story": [
      "23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki knows the genetic-testing and ancestry-tracing company has been in \"the eye of the storm\" recently, but she said she's confident that the company is still viable and believes it will be \"growing and thriving\" a year from now.",
      "\"I believe in the company. I believe in the long-term mission. But I believe it's essential for us to restructure,\" Wojcicki told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King in an exclusive interview.",
      "Wojcicki acknowledged recent headlines about the California-based company's struggles, including a data security incident in late 2023, a full board resignation in September, and laying off 40% of the company's workforce in November. In a public letter, the seven board members said it was \"clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward.\"",
      "The announcement came as a surprise to Wojcicki, saying that she doesn't have \"great insights into what the strategic differences were\" and that \"there was not an overt disagreement.\" Wojcicki has recently said she intends to take the company private and isn't open to considering third-party takeover proposals.",
      "\"I will make [mistakes], and I will learn from them\"",
      "Former 23andMe employees were critical of Wojcicki's management style in an October interview with Fortune Magazine \u2013 with one calling her \"outwardly charming, but stubborn and controlling behind the scenes.\"",
      "\"I love getting feedback. Like, one of my favorite things\u2026\" Wojcicki said.",
      "Wojcicki said she encourages everyone to voice their opinions and share suggestions.",
      "\"At the heart of what 23andMe does\u2026we're about consumer empowerment and research. Okay.\u00a0 So help me navigate because this has never been done before. So I love getting feedback for all those reasons because it has never been done before,\" Wojcicki explained. \"We're doing all kinds of things for the first time. So we will make mistakes. 100% admit all of that. But\u2026my commitment to the world has always been I will always learn from my mistakes. I will make them, and I will learn from them, and we will be better going forward.\"",
      "Wojcicki sent \"CBS Mornings\" emails she says the company received in support of 23andMe, including one from 70-year-old Rebecca Jones who thanked the company for helping her learn about her increased risk for Alzheimer's. Wojcicki said stories like these show the company provides real value.",
      "When asked by \"CBS Mornings\" if she was concerned about her data following the 2023 security incident at the company, Jones said, \"I have to have some level of confidence in the integrity of 23andMe, like I trust my physician. I have to trust that they are going to safeguard it. Of course I'm concerned and am watching it and will see if there are any steps I should take. I downloaded my data and all of that.\"",
      "Wojcicki's future plans for 23andMe",
      "23andMe's stock has dropped around 98% since 2021, when it went public. The company, which was once valued at $6 billion, now has a market cap of around $80 million. In its most recent quarter, the company reported a net loss of $59.1 million.",
      "King asked, \"How does a company survive when it's lost 98% of its value though?\"",
      "\"I think market cap and reality of a company are always two different realities,\" Wojcicki said. \"We absolutely are in a situation where we're figuring out cash burn and we're looking at all the ways that we're gonna drive revenue growth.\"",
      "To help boost revenue, Wojcicki said the company is focusing on its subscription service, where members can get more insights into their health. With a premium membership, customers get health and ancestry kits, discover things like their historical matches, receive new research reports on health findings - such as new breast cancer variants - and more.",
      "\"People did 23andMe, and they loved it. And we see over 50% of our customers coming back on a quarterly basis, so they're engaged,\" said Wojcicki, adding that it shows \"they want more.\"",
      "Wojcicki said the recent layoffs, which affected more than 200 employees, were also an attempt to help slash costs.",
      "\"The focus right now is 100% on making 23andMe sustainable. And I will not be taking on research initiatives at our own cost anymore. So we will be focusing on \u2013 you know, the consumer business, the subscription, and research partnerships. And I absolutely think, like, 23andMe will, you know, turn a point at some point of being profitable,\" Wojcicki said.",
      "Wojcicki said she's confident that in 2025, the company will be \"growing and thriving.\" In five years, it \"will transform health care,\" she told King.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 22:01:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A Trump loyalist is at the center of new allegations facing Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary.",
    "story": [
      "Monterey, California \u2014 The battle over President-elect Trump's pick for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, may become a test of loyalty for Republican stalwarts \u2014   some of whom stood at the center of a bid 10 years ago to remove Hegseth as the head of a veterans' charity over allegations of financial mismanagement, repeated intoxication and sexual misconduct.",
      "One of those who led the effort to oust Hegseth as head of the Concerned Veterans of America in 2016 was Jessie Jane Duff, a Marine veteran who served as one of President-elect Donald Trump's 2024 campaign executive directors, according to multiple Republican insiders familiar with the events, all of whom spoke on the condition they not be named over fear of reprisals from those within the party. Duff sought Hegseth's removal from leadership roles in the veterans' group, CBS News has learned.",
      "While she worked at Concerned Veterans for America as a senior military adviser, Duff allegedly complained about Hegseth's frequent public intoxication, poor leadership and the toxic work climate he fostered within the organization, according to Republican insiders with knowledge of the matter. She also allegedly slighted Hegseth for his service in the National Guard, underscoring that he had only been a \"part-time\" soldier and not a full-time active-duty servicemember, according to Republican insiders who spoke to CBS News.",
      "Tax filings show Hegseth became a director at Veterans for Freedom in 2006 and executive director in 2007. In 2008, filings show the organization raised over $8.7 million in revenue \u2014 but spent over $9 million, including significant sums on media buys and events and initiatives.",
      "By 2010,\u00a0tax filings show revenue had dropped to just under $265,000. In the nonprofit's 2011 filing, Hegseth was listed as an \"officer,\" rather than its executive director.",
      "Hegseth started leading Concerned Veterans for America in\u00a02011. By 2016, the year Hegseth resigned as executive director, filings show the organization raised $15.9 million and listed $16.4 million in expenses.",
      "The following year \u2014 after Hegseth stepped down \u2014 the nonprofit reduced its expenses after \"major programs developed in the last fiscal year were paused,\" the tax filings said.",
      "The filings also showed Concerned Veterans for America had hired Hegseth's brother, Philip Hegseth, while he was still in college.",
      "The New Yorker late Sunday night published new information gleaned from internal records and interviews with former employees of the group.",
      "The magazine revealed that a previously undisclosed \"whistle-blower report\" detailed allegations of sexual misconduct by Hegseth and other men at CVA, and repeated incidents of public intoxication while he was still married and serving in the Army National Guard.",
      "CBS News has learned the allegations contained in the seven-page-report originated with Duff and were privately circulated to broader Republican circles outside Concerned Veterans for America in 2018, when Hegseth's name was floated for secretary of veterans affairs.",
      "A source close to Hegseth told CBS News that the report had been anonymously sent to Fox News years ago, allegedly \"to try and get him fired,\" asserting that Fox had looked into it but determined it was \"baseless.\"",
      "\"Fox News does not have any record of receiving this report,\" said a network spokesperson.",
      "The source called Duff \"a disgruntled former employee\" at CVA who pushed \"false claims\" about Hegseth to try to hurt his television career. \"She was jealous, because she wanted to get into TV,\" said the source. Hegseth had fired Duff from Concerned Veterans for America, according to two sources.",
      "In 2016, after staffers complained about Hegseth's leadership of Concerned Veterans of America, the billionaire Republican donors who funded the group, Charles and David Koch, forced Hegseth to step down, sources told CBS News. He resigned in January 2016 in a move described by both Hegseth and the organization as a mutual decision, dismissing rumors of a rift, according to\u00a0Military Times.",
      "Hegseth's attorney, Tim Parlatore, denied all the allegations against his client.",
      "As Hegseth walked through the Capitol, visiting the senators who will weigh in on his expected nomination to be defense chief, CBS News questioned him Monday about why he had resigned from CVA. He kept walking silently and did not respond. Hegseth also did not comment when asked if he was concerned the latest allegations could derail his nomination as defense secretary.",
      "Duff was his most outspoken critic in private circles until Hegseth was announced as Trump's pick for defense secretary, according to the Republican sources who spoke with CBS News.",
      "But now, Duff publicly supports his impending nomination to lead the Defense Department and has\u00a0defended his controversial opposition to women serving in combat.",
      "Contacted by CBS News multiple times on Monday, Duff did not respond.",
      "Duff, a Newsmax analyst, served as an adviser for Concerned Veterans for America while Hegseth helmed the organization from 2013 until 2016. The organization was formed in 2011 as a Koch-funded non-profit group called \"Vets for Economic Freedom Trust.\"",
      "The group primarily promotes conservative views in the arenas of both the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, particularly advocating for the latter to move towards a privatized healthcare system.",
      "Hegseth, the 44-year-old former co-host of \"Fox & Friends Weekends\" has faced a barrage of scrutiny involving his personal life and whether he has the experience to manage the Defense Department, the largest U.S. government agency, with a budget of $842 billion, almost 3 million employees and 750 military installations around the world.",
      "Margaret Hoover, host of PBS' \"Firing Line\" and a former adviser to Vets for Freedom, said in an\u00a0interview on CNN that Hegseth had managed the organization \"very poorly.\" Hoover expressed doubt about his ability to run the sprawling Defense Department when he had struggled with a staff of less than 10 people, and a budget of under $10 million.",
      "\"I don't know how he's going to run an organization with an $857 billion budget, and 3 million individuals, based on what I saw in those years,\" she said.",
      "In response to CBS News questions about the finances at Veterans for Freedom under his leadership, Hegseth merely said, \"I love working for the best in the military, and I'm privileged that the president of the United States would give me the opportunity to represent the best in the military.\"",
      "The whistleblower report received by The New Yorker also detailed multiple incidents where Hegseth was allegedly intoxicated on the job \"to the point of needing to be carried out of the organization's events.\"",
      "When pressed by CBS News on Capitol Hill about whether he was ever drunk while traveling on the job, Hegseth replied, \"Not gonna dignify that with a response.\"",
      "A source close to Hegseth acknowledged that people did \"occasionally\" have too much to drink at these events but maintained that the report's claims about Hegseth are false.",
      "\"The idea that a veterans organization of combat veterans who'd recently transitioned out of the military would drink or have too much to drink, that's not news,\" they said. \"That's the entire business model of the VFW [Veterans of Foreign Wars].\"",
      "The source said Hegseth has publicly acknowledged that he \"drank too much\" in the past, adding: \"That's not the kind of life that Pete lives right now. He certainly has matured a lot in the past decade.\"",
      "Last month, it was\u00a0revealed that Hegseth had secretly paid a financial settlement to a woman who had accused him of raping her in 2017 at a Republican women's banquet at the Hyatt Regency in Monterey, Calif. The city of Monterey released its 2017 investigation into Hegseth.",
      "The accuser, who has not been publicly named, reported she felt as though she had been drugged and recalled repeatedly saying \"no\" while in a hotel room with Hegseth. She alleged that he prevented her from leaving and was on top of her. CBS News does not publicly name individuals who have reported an alleged sexual assault unless that person chooses to publicly identify themselves.",
      "Timothy Parlatore, Hegseth's attorney, told CBS News previously: \"This allegation was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it.\"",
      "The Monterey Police Department forwarded its report about the alleged assault to the Monterey County District Attorney's Office for review back in 2017. Monterey County District Attorney Jeannine M. Pacioni said last month her office \"declined to file charges\" in January 2018 as none were \"supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"",
      "Hegseth denies the allegations and claims the encounter was consensual.",
      "James LaPorta is a verification producer with CBS News Confirmed. He is a former U.S. Marine infantryman and veteran of the Afghanistan war."

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 20:02:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Hunter Biden was convicted of three separate felony charges related to his purchase of a gun and pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges in a separate case.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0President Biden announced late Sunday that he issued a pardon for his son Hunter Biden, in a major reversal in the final weeks of his presidency.",
      "Mr. Biden repeatedly pledged not to pardon his son, who was\u00a0convicted in June of three separate felony charges\u00a0related to his purchase of a revolver in 2018 when he was battling an addiction to illegal drugs, which he lied about on paperwork to obtain the gun. He also pleaded guilty to nine tax evasion charges in a separate case in September.",
      "\"Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement Sunday night.",
      "The president argued that \"Hunter was treated differently\" than others under similar circumstances, claiming that the charges were brought after \"several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.\"",
      "\"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2014  and that is wrong,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "The \"Full and Unconditional Pardon\" applies to any crimes Hunter Biden may have committed from Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "Mr. Biden did not address the pardon with reporters before boarding Air Force One for his trip to Angola.",
      "Hunter Biden charges and allegations",
      "Hunter Biden was investigated and prosecuted by special counsel David Weiss, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware who was kept on by Mr. Biden's administration in 2021, when other Trump-era prosecutors were asked to resign, in order to continue the probes into Hunter's conduct. Attorney General Merrick Garland later elevated Weiss to special counsel status after whistleblowers and congressional Republicans alleged irregularities in the probe.",
      "Weiss' office declined to comment on the pardon.",
      "Joseph Ziegler and Gary Shapley, two IRS whistleblowers who came forward to raise concerns about what they said were the Justice Department's efforts to shield Hunter Biden, said in a statement that it was \"a sad day for law abiding taxpayers to witness this special privilege for the powerful.\"",
      "Before dropping out of the race for president, Mr. Biden had committed not to pardon his son,\u00a0saying in an interview with ABC News in June that he had ruled it out. After opting to\u00a0leave the race\u00a0the next month, the White House maintained that Mr. Biden had no plans to pardon his son, though the possible political consequences of the decision had decreased. The White House\u00a0said\u00a0as recently as last month that the president still had no plans to issue a pardon.",
      "\"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction \u2014 mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport. Despite all of this, I have maintained my sobriety for more than five years because of my deep faith and the unwavering love and support of my family and friends,\" Hunter Biden said in a statement Sunday night.",
      "\"I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering,\" the president's son said.",
      "Hunter Biden was set to be sentenced for the gun convictions on Dec. 12 and on Dec. 16 for the tax evasion charges.",
      "Following the White House announcement of the pardon, Hunter Biden's legal team informed the federal judges overseeing his cases in Delaware and California about the pardon so the cases can be formally dismissed and the sentencing hearings set for later this month be canceled.",
      "Hunter Biden was\u00a0indicted on three felony gun charges\u00a0in September after a proposed plea deal with federal prosecutors\u00a0fell apart. The deal would have had him plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and enter a diversion program instead of pleading guilty to a felony gun possession count.",
      "During the court hearing in which the plea deal was set to be finalized, the judge overseeing the case raised concerns over the terms while Hunter Biden's legal team pushed back against prosecutors over whether the agreement was to protect the president's son from any future criminal charges.",
      "Hunter Biden was accused of lying on paperwork and illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while he was addicted to crack cocaine. Federal law prohibits users of illegal drugs from owning firearms.",
      "Prosecutors said the president's son lied about his drug use on a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives form when he bought a revolver and several other items from a Wilmington, Delaware, gun store on Oct. 12, 2018.",
      "In the separate case in California, a federal grand jury last December\u00a0charged Hunter Biden\u00a0with three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor offenses. The president's son was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes while living an \"extravagant lifestyle.\"",
      "According to the indictment, Hunter Biden made some $7 million in income from his foreign business dealings from 2016 through 2019. He was accused of spending nearly $5 million during that same time period on \"everything but his taxes,\" including on drugs, escorts, luxury hotels, cars and clothing. Hunter Biden was accused of falsely listing those purchases as business expenses.",
      "After unsuccessfully attempting to enter an \"Alford\" plea, wherein a defendant accepts a guilty verdict while maintaining their innocence, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to the tax evasion charges on Sept. 5.",
      "\"Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form,\" Mr. Biden said Sunday night. \"Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.\"",
      "Special counsel response",
      "Weiss argued in a court filing on Monday that Hunter Biden's cases should not be dismissed, but rather closed by the judge overseeing them. The Justice Department said Monday they have not yet seen the order of clemency signed by Mr. Biden for his son.",
      "Weiss argued the cases against Hunter Biden were not defective and as a result, should not be dismissed. He says the judges should follow precedent form other cases in which defendants received pardons and simply close the case and docket the notice of clemency on the public docket.",
      "\"If media reports are accurate, the Government does not challenge that the defendant has been the recipient of an act of mercy,\" Weiss said in the filing. \"But that does not mean the grand jury's decision to charge him, based on a finding of probable cause, should be wiped away as if it never occurred. It also does not mean that his charges should be wiped away because the defendant falsely claimed that the charges were the result of some improper motive. No court has agreed with the defendant on these baseless claims, and his request to dismiss the indictment finds no support in the law or the practice of this district.\"",
      "Without specifically calling out Mr. Biden by name, Weiss also pushed back on criticism of the probe, writing, \"there was none and never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case.\"",
      "White House response",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dodged questions about the president's reversal on Monday, reiterating portions of the president's statement while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One. She outlined that Mr. Biden made the decision over the weekend, saying that he \"agonized\" over it.",
      "While insisting Mr. Biden believes in the Justice Department, Jean-Pierre said that \"politics infected the process,\" arguing that \"both things could be true.\" She said the president is not seeking the resignation of the attorney general, and said Mr. Biden does not agree with President-elect Donald Trump that the DOJ has been weaponized for political purposes or needs reform.",
      "Jean-Pierre suggested that the decision came in part because the president didn't think his political opponents would let up.",
      "\"One of the reasons the president did the pardon is because it didn't seem like his political opponents would let go of it,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"It didn't seem like they would move on.\"",
      "Biden family reaction",
      "First lady Jill Biden told reporters on Monday \"of course I support the pardon of my son.\"",
      "The first lady and daughter Ashley were often present during Hunter Biden's trial to show their support for him. Hunter Biden, his wife Melissa and son Beau Jr. all spent Thanksgiving weekend on Nantucket with Mr. Biden, Jill Biden and Ashley.",
      "Reaction to the pardon",
      "On social media, Trump called the Biden pardon \"an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\"",
      "Other Republicans on Sunday and Monday decried the pardon. House Speaker Mike Johnson posted X that \"trust in our justice system has been almost irreparably damaged by the Bidens and their use and abuse of it.\"",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley wrote that is he is \"shocked\" about the pardon because Mr. Biden \"said many many times he wouldn't & I believed him[.] Shame on me.\"",
      "Colorado's Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, meanwhile, wrote on Sunday that as a father, he understands Mr. Biden's desire to pardon his son, but said he was \"disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country. This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.\"",
      "But former Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder said on Sunday night \"pardon warranted,\" posting on social media that had Hunter Biden's \"name been Joe Smith the resolution would have been - fundamentally and more fairly - a declination.\"",
      "Holder also mentioned Trump's announcement over the weekend that he wanted Kash Patel to lead the FBI, saying \"ask yourself a vastly more important question. Do you really think Kash Patel is qualified to lead the world's preeminent law enforcement investigative organization? Obvious answer: hell no.\"",
      "Presidential pardons",
      "Hunter Biden is the 26th person to receive a pardon during Mr. Biden's presidency. Most of the others received pardons for drug offenses. Trump granted\u00a029 pardons\u00a0at this point in his first term, but issued a total of 143 pardons by the time he left office in 2020.",
      "This is not the first time a president has pardoned a family member. President Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother, Roger Clinton, before leaving office. Trump pardoned his son-in-law's father, Charles Kushner, during his first term. Trump announced that he intends to\u00a0nominate Kushner\u00a0as U.S. ambassador to France on Saturday.",
      "The two federal cases against Hunter Biden came amid a backdrop of Republican-led congressional inquiries into his business dealings and whether they involved Mr. Biden. The president has maintained he had nothing to do with his son's businesses and the investigative committees produced no evidence showing the president engaged in wrongdoing.",

    "summary": "Presidents are granted the authority to issue pardons under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden on Sunday issued a sweeping pardon of his son Hunter, who was convicted earlier this year on federal gun and drug charges, and pleaded guilty to tax charges in California.",
      "The presidential pardoning process is one that has long courted controversy, especially since many presidents issue pardons when they are leaving the White House.",
      "One of the most famous \u2014and controversial\u2014 pardons in history happened less than one month into President Gerald Ford's term. On Sept. 8, 1974, Ford announced from the Oval Office that he would \"grant a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed.\" Ford's own press secretary resigned over the pardon, and Ford's approval rating dropped 20 points over the following days. His approval rating never recovered and he went on to lose the 1976 presidential election.",
      "What is a presidential pardon?",
      "Presidents are granted the authority to issue pardons under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. The Constitution's framers were heavily influenced by the English legal tradition of pardon, which dates back to the 7th century, and Alexander Hamilton introduced the concept of the presidential pardon at the Constitutional Convention.",
      "Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution declares: \"The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\"",
      "There are four different types of clemency that fall under the president's pardoning power: pardon, amnesty, commutation and reprieve.\u00a0 As outlined by the White House, a pardon releases a person from punishment and restores all civil liberties; amnesty is the same as the pardon but is extended to an entire class of individuals; commutation reduces the sentence imposed by a federal court, and a reprieve delays the imposition of a sentence or punishment.",
      "Pardons, however, may not be issued in cases of impeachment or if it is an \"offense against the United States,\" such as treason.",
      "The Office of the Pardon Attorney at the Department of Justice issues guidelines for the application of clemency, but presidents do not need to follow them.",
      "To be pardoned, a person must have been convicted in a United States District Court, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, or a military court-martial \u2014 so a president cannot issue a pardon for a state conviction.",
      "What does a pardon mean for the pardoned person?",
      "A pardon can help eliminate some of the consequences of conviction and restore a person's civil rights.",
      "According to the Justice Department, the offense is not removed from a person's criminal record when they are pardoned but instead the conviction and the pardon both appear on the record. But the pardon can be helpful in obtaining licenses, bonding or employment.",
      "Who has Biden pardoned while in office?",
      "Hunter Biden is the 26th person Mr. Biden has pardoned so far. Most pardons relate to drug offenses, a practice started by former President Barack Obama. In September 2023, Mr. Biden granted clemency for three Iranians who were accused of moving $6 billion in a restricted Iranian account as part of a prisoner swap.",
      "At this point in President-elect Donald Trump's first term, he had pardoned 29 people.",
      "Who did Trump pardon during his first term?",
      "Trump issued a slew of pardons on Jan. 19, 2021, shortly before he left office. Trump pardoned 74 people and commuted the sentences of another 70.",
      "Among those pardoned were Steve Bannon, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy, Albert J. Pirro and rapper Lil Wayne.",
      "Prior to those pardons, Trump pardoned more than 30 people in December 2020, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, who had been convicted of witness tampering, tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions in 2005. Ahead of his second term, Trump has nominated Charles Kushner to be the ambassador to France.",
      "Earlier in his term, Trump pardoned Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio,\u00a0Dinesh D'Souza, his first national security adviser Michael Flynn, former George W. Bush aide I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby and Oregon ranchers Dwight L. Hammond and Steve D. Hammond.",
      "In 2020, Trump issued a full pardon for Alice Marie Johnson, whose sentence he had commuted in 2018 after lobbying from Kim Kardashian. Johnson is a great-grandmother who had served 22 years in federal prison for what was a first-time criminal offense, which had come to Kardashian's attention.",
      "In total over four years in office, Trump issued 237 acts of clemency, including 143 pardons and 94 commutations. The only presidents since 1900 who issued fewer acts of clemency were George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, according to the\u00a0Pew Research Center.",
      "Who did Obama pardon while in office?",
      "Obama issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations while in office, including for 568 people who were serving life sentences. In 2014, Obama launched the Clemency Initiative, which allowed federal prisoners to apply for leniency, especially those serving for nonviolent drug offenses. In the\u00a0Obama White House archives, his administration touts that those whose sentences were commuted were \"incarcerated under outdated and unduly harsh sentencing laws.\"",
      "Although Obama encouraged prisoners to apply for leniency under the Clemency Initiative, a report by the Justice Department Inspector General in 2018 found that initiative was poorly planned and not implemented properly, while also suffering from poor communication and bureaucratic feuds.",
      "\"We found that the Department did not effectively plan, implement, or manage the Initiative at the outset,\" Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote in the report.",
      "Which president has pardoned the most people in history?",
      "President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who served 13 years in office, issued the most pardons: 3,687.",
      "Have past presidents pardoned family members?",
      "Although Mr. Biden is the first president to pardon his son, he is not the first to pardon a family member. Former President Bill Clinton pardoned his brother Roger Clinton and Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, his son-in-law's father.",
      "Abraham Lincoln, meanwhile, pardoned his sister-in-law, Emilie Todd Helm, who was the widow of a Confederate general, under the Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction.",
      "Can a president issue a preemptive pardon?",
      "Ford's infamous pardon of Nixon was a preemptive pardon, since Nixon had not been charged with a crime. Former President Jimmy Carter also issued preemptive pardons for Vietnam draft evaders, as did Lincoln in the Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction, which allowed for former Confederates to be pardoned if they took an oath to the U.S.",
      "President George H.W. Bush also pardoned his secretary of defense, Caspar Weinberger, along with five others, for his alleged role in the Iran-Contra scandal after he was indicted but before his trial.",
      "Mr. Biden's pardon of Hunter covers any crimes Hunter Biden may have committed from Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 1, 2024, even if he has not yet been charged. Hunter Biden's first plea agreement in Delaware fell apart because his lawyers sought full immunity from future prosecution.",
      "Can another president undo a previous presidential pardon?",
      "The pardon language in Article II of the Constitution does not include any language about revoking pardons, although only a few presidents have exercised that power.",
      "On President Andrew Johnson's last day in office, he issued several pardons \u2014 three of which President Ulysses S. Grant reversed on his first day by calling back the U.S. Marshal so they were never delivered. A fourth was allowed to stand since it had been delivered.",
      "According to Washington Monthly, an 1868 textbook by Supreme Court Associate Justice Joseph Story on the Constitution says a presidential pardon can be revoked if the president was impeached. In recent history, both Clinton and Trump have been impeached \u2014 although their pardons did stand after their terms.",
      "Former President George W. Bush, meanwhile, revoked one of his own pardons. In December 2008, shortly before leaving office, Bush pardoned 19 people, including\u00a0 Isaac Robert Toussie of Brooklyn, N.Y., who had been convicted of making false statements to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and of mail fraud.",
      "One day later, Bush reversed the decision, with White House press secretary Dana Perino citing \"information that has subsequently come to light,\" including on the extent and nature of Toussie's prior criminal offenses. She also said that neither the White House counsel's office nor the president had been aware of a political contribution by Toussie's father that \"might create an appearance of impropriety.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump's selection of a number of House Republicans to fill top posts in his administration is pulling from an already shallow bench.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans have celebrated holding onto their narrow majority in the House, adding to their flip of the Senate and the White House for a trifecta in Washington next year. But President-elect Donald Trump's selection of a number of House Republicans to fill top posts in his administration is pulling from an already shallow bench, temporarily whittling the GOP majority down further as Trump takes office in January.",
      "Just one House race remains to be decided nearly four weeks after Election Day, with 99% of the vote counted in California's 13th Congressional District, where Democrat Adam Gray is leading GOP Rep. John Duarte. Last week, victories in another California district, along with one in Iowa brought the balance of power in the chamber to 220-214.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has tapped a handful of House Republicans for top positions in his administration. In the week following the election, the president-elect made two selections from the House, with GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik of New York as ambassador to the U.N., and Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida as national security adviser.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, while outlining the GOP agenda following the picks last month, said the president-elect \"fully understands and appreciates the math here,\" noting that he didn't expect the conference would lose any more members to Trump's administration.",
      "\"Every single vote will count because if someone gets ill or has a car accident or a late flight on their plane then it affects the votes on the floor,\" Johnson said.",
      "Then came Trump's pick of former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, setting up three vacancies early in the new Congress. Gaetz resigned his seat immediately, hours after Trump announced his intent to nominate him.",
      "\"I told President Trump, 'enough already, you've got to give me some relief,'\" Johnson said on Fox News after Trump selected Gaetz for the role. \"I've got to maintain this majority.\"",
      "Though Gaetz has since withdrawn from consideration for the post, facing intense scrutiny over a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, he's said he does not intend to serve in the 119th Congress, giving Johnson another unwelcome vacancy.",
      "Johnson expressed optimism at the time of Gaetz' selection that with his immediate resignation from the chamber, his seat could be filled by the start of the new Congress, citing Florida state law's process. But Gov. Ron DeSantis\u00a0set the primary for Jan. 28, and the general election for April 1, which he said was the earliest date the special election could take place. Florida's secretary of state said the election was being conducted \"as quickly as statutorily possible.\"",
      "Waltz' seat is also set for an April 1 general election in Florida. And the special election for Stefanik's seat could take up to 90 days after she resigns. The dynamic could mean for months in the early days of the president-elect's second term, Republicans could have a majority that is as low as one or two seats, meaning that if all House members are present, Johnson could need the support of every single Republican. If he has a three-seat majority, he could afford to lose one Republican on some votes.",
      "The outcome may spell trouble for the GOP's ability to act on the mandate that Republicans have claimed since Trump's victory in the presidential election. (Although Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in both the electoral and popular votes, he did not win a majority of American voters.) House Republican leadership has struggled in recent years to keep the conference united on key priorities, with a reliable group of detractors on its right flank. While the conservatives, many of whom are Trump loyalists, may be more inclined to stay in line under a Trump administration than during President Biden's time in office, Johnson could face opposition from moderates in his party.",
      "House Republicans like Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska, David Valadao of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington have previously been critical of Trump and could break with the party on some issues, imperiling some early legislative action. Bacon refused to back the president-elect during the primary, while Valadao and Newhouse are the two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021. After the election, Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told USA Today that he would be willing to speak out against Trump amid GOP control of Washington to work in the best interest of his constituents.",
      "\"When I agree with the president, I'll say it. If I disagree on something, I will say that, too,\" Lawler said.",
      "Still, the exceedingly narrow majority created by Trump's appointments is expected to be short-lived, since all three seats are in safely Republican districts. Johnson expressed confidence that Republicans would be able to work with a smaller majority for as long is necessary, while pledging to \"be very aggressive\" and move forward with Trump's agenda beginning on Day One.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

    "title": "Why is Trump threatening a 100% tariff on the BRICS nations?",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:41:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create your own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have the type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said. \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California said there's \"a lot of reason for concern\" for the second Trump administration \"if the first administration is any indicator.\"",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California said on Sunday that President-elect Donald Trump \"has made it no secret that he has it in for California\" as Gov. Gavin Newsom has convened a special legislative session this week to prepare for legal fights in Trump's upcoming term.",
      "Padilla said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that there's \"a lot of reason for concern\" for the second Trump administration \"if the first administration is any indicator.\"",
      "The California Democrat cited reports that Trump initially withheld disaster funds for the state during his first term, saying the president-elect tried to keep federal dollars from California families \"simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election.\" In September, Trump threatened to block federal wildfire aid for California if elected again.",
      "\"We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats,\" Padilla continued.",
      "California Democrats billed the state as the \"resistance\" state during the first Trump administration. And after Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election, Newsom announced that he would convene an emergency session of the California state legislature to \"safeguard California values and fundamental rights in the face of an incoming Trump administration.\" In addition to bolstering legal resources, the governor pointed to protections for civil and reproductive rights, climate action, and immigrant families.",
      "On immigration, Padilla said \"we're hearing a lot of bombast from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history.\" He said while \"nobody disagrees\" with a focus on violent criminals, that's \"very different than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately.\" Padilla said that providing legal support for communities that could be impacted by Trump's plans is \"just the California way.\"",
      "\"We embrace our diversity,\" Padilla said. \"Our diversity is what has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration.\"",
      "Meanwhile, as a \"sanctuary state,\" California state law instructs local law enforcement not to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on deportations, teeing up what could be a clash with the Trump administration. Padilla, citing California's status as the most populous state in the nation with more immigrants than any other state, argued that the issue concerns the ability for people to be able to come forward to report a crime, saying \"the last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes.\"",
      "\"Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials' job,\" Padilla continued. \"There doesn't have to be a conflict unless that's what Trump wants.\"",
      "More broadly, Padilla said \"there's also a lot of good that can be finalized\" before President Biden leaves office, pointing to climate-related work and additional flexibility for public health care programs to target mental health issues. And the California Democrat noted that there's \"a lot of good work to be done\" beyond the current administration if the federal government will continue to support California.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns this week from a Thanksgiving recess with a number of priorities to get through before the end of the year, while a deadline to fund the government looms over lawmakers.",
      "With the new Congress set to be sworn in on Jan. 3, lawmakers are pushing through a list of to-dos in the coming weeks in the lame-duck session, while Republicans gear up for leadership in Washington next year.",
      "But first, Congress must address government funding, since lawmakers only have until Dec. 20 to approve new spending. And although a shutdown remains unlikely, leaders will need to reach an agreement on a short-term funding measure in the weeks ahead.",
      "Funding the government",
      "In September, lawmakers approved a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through Dec. 20, setting a pre-holiday deadline to prevent a shutdown that has become commonplace for Congress. With frustration among some conservatives over the practice, House Speaker Mike Johnson made clear at the time that he opposed an omnibus package to fund the government, suggesting that the House would work to approve the 12 full-year spending bills individually after the election. But the favorable results for Republicans in the 2024 elections appeared to change the calculus.",
      "Republicans appear likely to push to punt the deadline into the early days of President-elect Donald Trump's administration, though the exact timeline for the stopgap measure remains a key question. The deadline will tee up a larger fight over government spending, with Republicans set to control the House, Senate and the White House \u2014 and looking to make significant spending cuts while juggling the extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Lawmakers also have disaster aid to consider after the Biden administration requested $98 billion in aid to address the aftermath of Hurricanes Milton and Helene in the southeast.",
      "The funding fight comes as Johnson is looking to hold onto his gavel in the new year, with a narrow House majority that's proven problematic for Republicans seeking the speakership in recent years. Republicans have already selected Johnson to be their nominee for speaker in January, and the full House will elect a speaker when lawmakers are sworn in next month.",
      "Senate Republicans meet with Trump's administration picks",
      "Senate Republicans are expected to continue meeting with Trump's picks for top posts in his administration this week, looking to secure support in the upper chamber, which has the role of confirming the intended nominees.",
      "Ahead of their recess, Senate Republicans met with Trump picks including Pete Hegseth and former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who then opted to withdraw his name from consideration for Attorney General following intense scrutiny over a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. On Monday, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa is set to meet with former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who Trump tapped for Attorney General after Gaetz withdrew.",
      "Trump has continued to announce his picks for the top posts, including Kash Patel, a 44-year-old who served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term and has a reputation as a controversial figure, for FBI director. The announcement came as Trump-nominated Christopher Wray's term isn't set to expire until 2027.",
      "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump tapped to lead the newly coined Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, will also be on Capitol Hill this week, meeting Thursday with Senate and House Republicans.",
      "House Ethics Committee meets to consider Gaetz report",
      "The House Ethics Committee is set to meet Thursday to further consider whether to release the report about its investigation into Gaetz, after the evenly split bipartisan panel failed to reach an agreement in an hourslong meeting last month.",
      "A day later, Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration, further complicating the ethics committee's decision about whether to release the report. Gaetz' resignation from the House after his selection for attorney general had ended the committee's jurisdiction over him, making the release of the report all the more controversial. The Republican committee chairmen said he voted against the release of the report over the jurisdiction issue.",
      "Still, some view the report's release as essential if Gaetz is eyeing other offices, like another post within Trump's administration or running for Florida governor down the road.",
      "The Ethics Committee's investigation first began in 2021, but was put on pause as the Justice Department conducted a sex trafficking and obstruction probe of Gaetz. Last year, the Ethics Committee resumed its work, after prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz, who has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "Senate Democrats hold leadership elections",
      "Senate Democrats, who will be in the minority in the new Congress, are expected to meet Tuesday to elect their leadership for the next two years, after Republicans flipped the chamber in the 2024 elections.",
      "Though the top posts in Democratic leadership are expected to remain unchanged, with Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and whip Dick Durbin seeking to remain in their roles, the no. 3 post is up for grabs as Sen. Debbie Stabenow set to retire.",
      "Stabenow, who is leaving the Senate after more than two decades, chairs the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. The post has been eyed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.",
      "The leadership races come as Senate Democrats are making a final push on their agenda, with a focus on confirming President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts. Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's 234 judicial confirmations from his first term during the lame-duck session, but have run into resistance from Republicans looking to hold up and drag out the process.",

      "President Biden's full statement",
      "Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.",
      "The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room \u2013 with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter's cases.",
      "No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2013 and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter \u2013 who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they've tried to break me \u2013 and there's no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.",
      "For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They'll be fair-minded. Here's the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice \u2013 and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's announcement\u00a0Saturday that he intends to nominate Kash Patel as FBI director sent shockwaves through Washington over the weekend, prompting outrage from Democrats and even some former Trump officials, while some loyalists insisted they believed Patel would be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Patel, a 44-year-old who served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, is a controversial figure even within Trump's world, and a former U.S. official described him as \"by far the most dangerous pick\" Trump has made.",
      "\"There is no 'there' to him,\" the official told CBS News. \"He'll literally do anything.\"",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term and was Patel's boss, compared the nomination to Joseph Stalin's secret police chief.",
      "\"Fortunately, the FBI is not\" Stalin's secret police, Bolton said. \"The Senate should reject this nomination 100-0.\"",
      "In response to Bolton's comments, Vice President-elect JD Vance posted on social media that \"John Bolton has been wrong about everything so I guess Kash must be pretty awesome.\"",
      "In addition to objections about Patel at the helm of the FBI, current FBI director Christopher Wray's 10-year term is not due to end until 2027. For Patel to become FBI director, Wray would have to resign or be fired by Trump and Patel would need to be confirmed by the Senate. Republicans are set to hold a 53-47 majority come January, giving incoming Majority Leader John Thune only a few votes to lose.",
      "Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People\" in a post on social media Saturday. And some of his supporters echoed the sentiment, like Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, who said Patel is a \"very strong nominee\" whom he thinks will be approved by the Senate.",
      "\"I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI,\" Cruz said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he \"encouraged President Trump to bring Kash Patel to the table,\" saying Patel \"represents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI.\"",
      "Other Republicans, like Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, took a more cautious approach. Rounds expressed support for Wray, who was nominated by Trump in his first term in 2017.",
      "\"I think the president picked a very good man to be the director of the FBI when he did that in his first term,\" Rounds said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I don't have any complaints about the way that he's done his job right now.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats were highly critical of the pick. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on NBC that he will vote no, expressing concern that Patel \"is going to only care about protecting Republicans.\" And Murphy pledged to help his colleagues and the American public \"understand what's happening here.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump told the American public during the campaign that he was going to turn the Department of Justice into a political operation, an arm of the White House, to destroy his political opponents,\" Murphy said. \"Kash Patel's only qualification is because he agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should serve to punish, lock up, and intimidate Donald Trump's political opponents. And so the cost to the American public is pretty simple\"",
      "In recent weeks, Trump's most controversial selections for top posts in his administration have faced intense scrutiny as they prepare for the Senate confirmation process. And one pick, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, already withdrew his name from consideration facing headwinds in the Senate.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the current majority whip in the upper chamber, urged his Senate colleagues in a statement to reject Trump's pick of Patel, noting that \"we already have a FBI director\" and accusing the president-elect of wanting to \"replace his own appointee with an unqualified loyalist.\"",

      "Trump also announced he has selected son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, to serve as the next U.S. ambassador to France. Kushner was pardoned by Trump in 2020 after serving time in prison as part of a two-year sentence on federal criminal charges.",
      "As Trump fills his administration, he's also meeting with world leaders.",
      "JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): It was \u2013 it was an excellent conversation.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, then posted: \"I look forward to the work we can do together again.\"",
      "But Trump's threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on Canada and Mexico remains, unless, he says, the countries take action to stop migrants and drugs from entering the U.S. border.",
      "(End VT)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Both North American allies say they are preparing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports.",
      "Now Trump has issued a new threat against a group of nine countries, including Brazil, Russia and China. He says, if they try to shy away from the U.S. dollar on international trade, he would impose a 100 percent tariff on their goods \u2013 Major.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Weijia Jiang in Palm Beach, Florida, thank you.",
      "We turn now to Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who joins us this morning from Houston.",
      "Senator, it's good to see you. Good morning to you.",
      "Let's pick up this thread on tariffs. I remember covering your presidential campaign in 2016, and you were a skeptic of tariffs then. I know the politics around tariffs have changed. President-elect Trump has done that. But have the economics changed?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas): Well, I will tell you, what hasn't changed is \u2013 is the importance of leverage.",
      "And I got to say, you look at the threat of tariffs against Mexico and Canada immediately has produced action. We've seen the president of Mexico stand up and promise that she is going to work hand in hand with the president of the United States, President Trump, to secure the border.",
      "I will tell you, representing Texas, we've seen four years of an invasion at our southern border. Let me ask you, Major, why hasn't Joe Biden done this? Why hasn't Joe Biden actually stood up and used leverage to secure the border?",
      "And the reason is, Joe Biden and the Democrats wanted this invasion to happen. And I got to say, this is a promise that I believe President Trump is going to deliver on and deliver quickly. We are going to secure the border. This is about using leverage to get Mexico and Canada to cooperate.",
      "And I will tell you, Major, I think one of the very first bills we're going to take up in the Senate, vote on, and I hope pass, is my legislation the Justice for Jocelyn Act that is a response to the horrific rape and murder of Jocelyn Nungaray, 12-year-old girl in Houston, Texas, killed by violent criminal illegal aliens released by Joe Biden and the Democrats.",
      "This is a promise the president needs to deliver on, and I think he's going to.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, when you think about tariffs and president-elect Trump, you don't take them seriously as an economic matter; you take them seriously only as a diplomatic lever?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, look, I think the president was explicit with Mexico and Canada. He said he will impose these tariffs unless they secure the border.",
      "It was explicitly leverage. And, by the way, that is the same way that President Trump negotiated the remain-in-Mexico agreement. If you remember, during his first term, President Trump threatened tariffs against Mexico. And AMLO, then the president of Mexico, he was incredibly scared and concerned. He was scared of Trump, and he ended up signing the remain-in- Mexico agreement, which produced the lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years.",
      "It was incredibly successful. What did Joe Biden the Democrats do when they came in? The very first week in office, they ripped up that incredibly successful international agreement. I expect we will once again enter into remain-in-Mexico.",
      "And we are going to see \u2013 I'm going to make a prediction right now. We will see the numbers plummet of illegal immigration coming into this country, not in a year, not in six months, but in January and February, because we will have a president who will vigorously enforce the law.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: On that point. Senator Cruz, you would concede, in the last three or four months, numbers have gone down already, have they not?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: They have ticked down slightly. We have still seen over these four years the highest rate of illegal immigration in our nation's history. Twelve million illegal immigrants have come into this country.",
      "And I got to say, in a state like Texas, you want to see the consequences, this last election was an incredible landslide for President Trump. He won all seven of the swing states. And, in Texas, President Trump won Hispanic voters in Texas. I won Hispanic voters in Texas. I won statewide by a million votes, nine points.",
      "And South Texas, the Rio Grande Valley, has literally spent over 100 years as a bright blue Democrat bastion. This cycle, South Texas flipped Republican. And it is amazing what having 12 million people invade your home can do to change people's voting behavior. I think the president has a mandate to deliver on securing the border, and I look forward to working hand in hand with him to deliver on that promise.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Kash Patel suggested by President Trump as the new leader of the FBI, how enthusiastic are you about that?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Listen, I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee. I think the entire slate of Cabinet nominees President Trump has put forward is very strong.",
      "I believe every one of these Cabinet nominees is going to be confirmed by the Senate. I think Kash Patel is going to be confirmed by the Senate. You look at his background, he has a serious professional background. He was a prosecutor. He was a public defender. He was a senior intelligence staffer on Capitol Hill. He was a senior intelligence staffer in the White House. He was the chief of staff of the Department of Defense.",
      "He was the deputy director of national intelligence. And I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI.",
      "The FBI and the Department of Justice are two institutions incredibly important to the rule of law in the United States. I revere both. And one of the most tragic consequences of four years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is, both the DOJ and the FBI have been politicized and weaponized, and I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption in the FBI.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: As you know, Senator, there isn't a vacancy at the top of the FBI. What should become of Christopher Wray, appointed by President Trump?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, I think he'll make a choice. I think either he will resign or President Trump will fire him. But it's no secret to anybody, including Chris Wray, that he is not going to continue to serve as the head of the FBI under Donald Trump.",
      "Listen, if you look at James Comey and Chris Wray, there has never been a period in our nation's history where the FBI has suffered a greater loss of respect, where more Americans doubt the fundamental integrity of the FBI.",
      "And it's because James Comey and Chris Wray presided over allowing the FBI to become a partisan cudgel to be used to target parents at school board meetings, to be used to target people who chose not to take the COVID vaccine, to be used to target President Trump and to target the political opponents of Joe Biden and the White House.",
      "It is tragic. That is not what the FBI is for. That is not what the DOJ is for. And I got to say, Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, I think, together are a very strong slate of nominees to go and restore integrity to both institutions.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How do you place that up against the prosecutions of Bob Menendez, a congressman, a Democrat from Texas, Hunter Biden? Are those political prosecutions as well or not?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, first of all, let's be clear. Bob Menendez was \u2013 was literally caught with gold bars and a stack of cash with his fingerprints taking bribes, and it's why Bob Menendez is not my colleague anymore. At that point, the evidence was overwhelming.",
      "Look, Major, I wrote an entire book entitled \"Justice Corrupted: How the Left Has Weaponized the Legal System.\" And it broke down \u2013 it started, sadly, under Barack Obama, where he began using the federal government to target his political opponents.",
      "The book details how many of those partisans then burrowed in to senior career positions during the Trump administration. They waged war against President Trump during his first term. And now, under Joe Biden, they have been open and brazen, and I think it has done unbelievable damage to the integrity of the Department of Justice and the FBI.",
      "I think Merrick Garland will go down in history as the most partisan attorney general our nation has ever seen. And I got to say, I hear regularly from \u2013 from prosecutors, from FBI agents who are deeply dismayed about the institution they have devoted a lifetime working for, because, listen, I don't want a Republican Department of Justice.",
      "I don't want a Democrat Department of Justice. I want a Department of Justice and an FBI that enforces the law regardless of party. And, sadly, we haven't seen that these last four years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What can you tell us about the three Americans released by China who are in San Antonio? Have you been in touch with them? And do you have any concerns about the contours of that swap?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, at this stage, we don't know all of the details of the contours of the swap, but I will tell you, I am celebrating the return of three Americans, especially Mark Swidan.",
      "Mark Swidan is a Texan from Houston. His mom, Katherine, is from Luling, Texas. I have talked with Katherine many times. I authored and passed a resolution in the Senate that passed unanimously calling for Mark Swidan's return to America. He spent 12 years unjustly imprisoned in communist China.",
      "I will tell you, I have raised it directly with the foreign minister of China. I have raised it with President Biden. I have raised it with Secretary of State Tony Blinken.",
      "And I will give them credit on this. Tony Blinken, just two weeks ago was the most recent time I spoke with him about Mark Swidan, and the administration has pressed the Chinese government. And Mark Swidan is back home with his mother, who has prayed for him, who has loved \u2013 loved him.",
      "I want to say, Mark, welcome home. Katherine, congratulations. I told you this day would come. This is a time where all Texans and all Americans should be celebrating.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, Senator Cruz, because I also know you care about the case of Austin Tice.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you have any sense that the rebel gains in Syria of the recent vintage will have any chance of unlocking Austin Tice's freedom?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: I don't know. I certainly hope and pray. Austin Tice needs to come home. And I hope and pray.",
      "Listen, there's a combination of two things working. One, as Joe Biden is in the process of transitioning out, any \u2013 any outgoing president is looking to try to get some final wins. I would encourage him and I'm sure he is doing everything he can to bring Austin Tice home, to bring the hostages in Gaza home, both the Israelis and the Americans, bring them home in this window.",
      "I also think President Trump coming into office on January 20, the enemies of America, I think, are afraid of President Trump. That is a moment. I hope we have a moment right now that is very much like the end of the Jimmy Carter administration\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: \u2026 right before Ronald Reagan came in. And we saw, on January 20, our hostages in Iran released, I think in significant part because the ayatollah was afraid of Reagan.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, sir.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: I hope a similar dynamic is playing out. And if we can see more hostages come home, that would be cause for enormous celebration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, thank you. Good morning.",
      "We'll be back with Face the Nation in just one moment. Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "We go now to California Democratic Senator Alex Padilla. He joins us this morning from Porter Ranch, California.",
      "Senator, good to see you.",
      "Let's start with Kash Patel. Your reaction to that nomination or that suggested nomination from president-elect Trump?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA (D-California): Well, good morning. Great to be with you.",
      "And, look, the \u2013 this announcement that Kash Patel is going to be nominated for a high-ranking position at the FBI, very key to the Department of Justice, raises a lot of the same questions that other announcements and other nominations raise.",
      "Are they going to go in there and do the job of \u2013 that the Department of Justice calls for to truly, truly be independent of the president of the United States, or is he going in there to do Trump's bidding? That's the big question here. Is it a genuine, legitimate appointment or a political appointment to politicize the bureau and the Department in Trump's \u2013 in Trump's favor?",
      "That's just the beginning of the questions that we expect to raise in the con \u2013 in the confirmation hearings that will begin in January.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you expect that the current FBI director, who has three years remaining, will just have to resign?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well, that's going to be a personal decision for Director Wray who, look, the public should remember, was a Trump appointee to begin with.",
      "And so he's got three years left. It's up to him to resign or not. Your prior guest suggested that Trump may very well fire him, which is just par for the course. Anybody who recalls the first Trump administration recalls a whole lot of Cabinet officials being named, being confirmed, and being sold as the greatest thing since sliced bread.",
      "And, as soon as they lose favor with Trump, as soon as they don't do 100 percent of what he's demanding, all of a sudden, you know, they're fired, a lot of times by social media posts. And so who knows what Donald Trump is going to decide to do, whether it's with Director Wray, Kash Patel or any of his other nominees this coming term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: During the first Trump administration, California fashioned itself the resistance state. Some Democrats in the legislature have already begun to describe that as a cliche and say they don't even know what that means anymore.",
      "What does it mean?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Look, I think there's a lot of reason for concern of the second Trump administration, if the first administration is any indicator.",
      "I think, as the governor, as other legislative leaders and even the congressional delegation have said, if \u2013 if, you know, the federal government will continue to support California in its leadership in so many policy areas, there's a lot of good work to be done there.",
      "But Donald Trump has made it no secret that he has it in for California, whether it's the withholding of disaster funds, I mean, a lot of FEMA dollars that Donald Trump tried to keep from, not the state government of California, but from California families, simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election. We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats.",
      "There's also a lot of good that \u2013 that can be finalized before the end of the Biden administration, whether it's Environmental Protection Agency waivers that will allow California to continue to grow our economy while tackling climate change aggressively, waivers at Health and Human Services that would give California a little bit of flexibility with our Medicare dollars to be able to also treat behavioral health issues, mental health issues of Californians, because when \u2013 we know that treating the whole body is good for both physical and mental health.",
      "We're trying to make sure those waivers\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do those \u2013 where \u2013 where\u2026",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 are locked in before the end of the Biden administration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do you stand with the Biden administration on that, Senator? Are they going to be responsive?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: They've been very encouraging that the technical work can and should be done before the end of the term.",
      "But we'll know it when there's signatures on the documents that we need. But, again, these are just examples that we want to lock into place before President Trump comes into office, and then can use it either as a threat, as a punishment, or, as Senator Cruz mentioned in the prior segment, simply leverage to get other things he would want out of California.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You know President elect Trump has promised mass deportations. You also know, in California, there is a state law that tells local law enforcement not to participate and cooperate with ICE agents in deportation or identification processes.",
      "The incoming Trump administration border czar, Tom Homan, has said any law enforcement who don't cooperate will be prosecuted under federal law. How is this going to be resolved?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes. Well, I think there's an important distinction here.",
      "No state government, not Texas, not California, not any state in the nation, has a constitutional authority to impose federal immigration law. That is the responsibility of the federal government. Some states like Texas want to push the envelope and try to find a way to assist, but there's no obligation to do so.",
      "And that's what California leaders and municipal leaders throughout the state are saying. You know, we're not going to utilize state and local resources to do the federal government's job for them, number one. I think there's a long history of this being smart public safety policy as well.",
      "California is the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation. And the last thing you want to do is have immigrants who are victims of crime afraid to come forward to report that crime. The last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes.",
      "That's what we're talking about here. Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials' job. There doesn't have to be a conflict, unless that's what Trump wants.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The governor has called a special session that will convene this week to set aside money to battle the Trump administration.",
      "Will some of that money also be set aside to protect migrants and undocumented immigrants in California as they seek either legal advice or continued legal financial backing to support their efforts to stay within California and the United States?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, again, if the first Trump administration is any indicator, we know that there will continue to be a lot of fear in communities and communities that deserve to know what their rights are and what their rights are \u2013 are not.",
      "And so, if it's legal assistance, legal advice, legal support, that's just the California way. We embrace our diversity. Our diversity is what has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration.",
      "If we wanted to sort of cut to the chase, you know, we're hearing a lot of bombast from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history, on the one hand, versus a \u2013 maybe a focus on violent criminals on the other.",
      "Nobody \u2013 nobody disagrees with a focus on violent criminals.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Democrats, Republicans agree. But that's very different\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately, not just tearing families apart, tearing communities apart\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, Senator.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 but tremendous damage to our economy that that would create.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat from California, we thank you for your time this morning.",
      "And we'll be back right away with a lot more Face the Nation. I invite you to please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Be sure to tune in to CBS News on January 20 for full coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration here in Washington, D.C. You can watch live on CBS, on Paramount+, or on our CBS News app.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, and author H.W. Brands.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're joined now by CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger. She's in Southampton, New York, this morning.",
      "Jill, Senator Ted Cruz described tariffs and the threat thereof as leverage. But what I'm curious about economically is, do retailers view it as only leverage, do consumers view it only as leverage, or are they beginning to change their behavior in anticipation?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, let's just talk about whether or not they're going to change their behavior. We know that t here were some retailers who were sort of dangling this out around this holiday weekend, saying, oh, buy now because tariffs could make prices go up. I don't know what the motivation of most people is when they shop, but I'm not sure it's tariffs.",
      "What we do know about tariffs is, remember, this is a fee that is imposed on an imported good. The importing company, the U.S. company that takes that good in has to make a decision in that moment. And that company has to decide, are we going to eat it and maybe make less money this year, or are we going to pass it along to consumers. So, that is why consumers are a little unnerved by this, and businesses are as well, because they're not really sure whether they can pass that along and have consumers pay that additional price.",
      "What we know is, over the long term, in history, tariffs tend to increase the price of certain goods. It's not necessarily across the board. But, you know, it is hard coming off of what we've just come through in the last few years with this inflationary spike to imagine that consumers are just going to take it in stride. It is a real hard thing to imagine that any company or consumer is going to feel like they want to absorb higher prices at this point.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, there was a tariff story in the first Trump administration. Do you foresee a deeper and different tariff story potentially in Trump 2.0?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think there's two parts of that question, which is, we don't know what these tariffs are. And as Senator Cruz said, this is a negotiation. So, we don't know whether we're going to land in that negotiation. But a big difference between where we are today and where we were back in 2017 and 2018 is, during the early Trump administration, what we had was incredibly low inflation. That was after the financial crisis. For all those years, inflation or prices only grew by about less than 2 percent a year.",
      "Now, compare that with where we are now. We had inflation spike at a 40- year high of 9 percent in the summer of 2022. Yes, that inflation rate has come down, but prices are still about 22 percent, 23 percent higher than they were just four or five years ago. So, the big difference between the first Trump administration and the second Trump administration is prices are already high, and there are many Americans who are struggling.",
      "So, I think that that is the real fear among economists that I speak to. They're worried that this is going to cause a real anxiety among consumers, and that consumers might pull back at a time where they - actually, the economy's doing pretty well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Talking about the economy doing well. You crunch a lot of numbers, Jill, and always break them down so easily for our audience. When you look at the data, what's the best news you see and what's the most worrisome sign?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, the best news as - is that the labor market has grown really substantially and has kept up. So, I think that the labor market has been the driver of this economy. And it's been pretty consistent.",
      "The other part of the good news story is that the United States economy, more than any other developed nation, has come out of the Covid era and that post-Covid inflationary spike much stronger in a growth mode. So, we are seeing really good things from the labor market. We're seeing things in the economy. We're seeing that AI and technology is really in a boom period. These are all wonderful things.",
      "So, what's the downside here? I hate to be a kill joy, but why not, I play one on Sunday mornings. And what I can see is that these tariffs could cause a problem for a lot of consumers who are already struggling, and also this idea that we are going to see the extension of the tax cuts from the first Trump administration in the individual tax code. There is a fear among some investors that while we may not have a crisis right now when it comes to the debt and the deficit, that the extension of those tax cuts could start to really unnerve financial markets. Not happened yet, but those are the two worrisome things, the tariffs and the debt and deficit. I think those are the two looming things. And, of course, all the things we can't contemplate right now.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The three stock indexes have gone up pretty regularly since Election Day. Is that a methodical and well thought out reaction to an election or a kind of exuberance that may soon run its course?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Time will tell. I think that the initial investor reaction was a second Trump presidency would mean a drop in the tax rates - or the extension of the tax cuts and those tax rates would basically be in place for another four years. So, we'd have low taxes, which is good for especially the wealthier people out there. They love low taxes. And corporate taxes were already enshrined in the code. OK, so we have taxes staying low. That's a big factor when you come - when it comes to investing.",
      "The second part is the idea that a Trump administration would have a light regulatory touch. So, when you saw that first few trading - those first few trading days after the election, what went up a lot? The most highly regulated industries. So, that could be energy, that could be banking, that could be other areas where you could really need an industrial companies where you need a lot of regulatory prominence in the working of your business. Lighter regulatory touch will mean that those businesses will do well.",
      "OK, so is it exuberance or not? Who knows? I can only tell you that as someone who watches markets all the time, when everybody tells me that the sky is clear and the sun is shining and it's rainbows and unicorns, the only thing I can remember is what my father used to say is, well, no one ever rings a bell at the top or at the bottom. So, if you're an individual investor, don't count on everything being great. There's going to be a market slide. There is going to be a sell-off at some point. Don't count on everything being great all the time. Stick to your game plan and only change that game plan, not when the administration changes, but when your own life changes. That's it.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Breaking it down for us, as always, and beautifully so. Jill Schlesinger, thanks so very much.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We' are joined now by President Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. He is in New Castle, New Hampshire, this morning.",
      "Jake, good morning. It's good to see you.",
      "The Hamas video release of Edan Alexander, I know the administration regards it as a cruel propagandistic maneuver, but do you detect anything tactical at all in the timing of the release of this video, Jake?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN (President Biden's National Security Adviser): Well, Major, first, thanks for having me.",
      "And as far as this video, it is a cruel reminder of the barbarity and the brutality of Hamas, holding so many innocent people hostage, including Americans, including Edan. We were in touch with Edan's family yesterday. I'll be talking to the families of all of the American hostages, including Edan's family, this week.",
      "And I do think that Hamas is feeling the pressure. They're feeling the pressure because one of their main partners in crime here, Hezbollah, has now cut a ceasefire deal and they thought that Hezbollah would be with them until the end. They're feeling the pressure, of course, because their top leader, Sinwar, has been killed. So, they may be looking anew at the possibility of getting a ceasefire and hostage deal, and we are working actively with all of the key players in the region, including Israel and Turkey and Qatar and Egypt to try to bring that about.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The fate of the hostages, of course, on the administration's mind, on the minds of all Americans and all in the region. But also, Jake, I'm sure you saw over the last couple of days the video from Gaza of Palestinians surging to try to get a loaf of bread, in some cases crushing one another unintentionally. All suggestions are that the humanitarian situation there is - if it already isn't past crisis stage, near famine crisis stage.",
      "How much does that intensify the need to get this thing across, as you just said, the finish line?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: The humanitarian situation in Gaza is a crisis. You have too many people who are suffering from shortages of food, water, medicine, access to sanitation. Innocent people who deserve a measure of peace and deserve access to all of those life-saving supplies in abundance. The United States has been working, week in, week out, month in, month out, to open crossings, to move trucks, to insure that humanitarian aid gets in. And at critical moments, we have been able to intervene in ways that have staved off the worst case scenarios of famine. But it's constantly stocking (ph) Gaza. And so more needs to be done to get aid in.",
      "Now, part of the problem, as we've seen just in the last 24 hours, is not actually moving aid from outside Gaza into Gaza, but moving it around Gaza once it's inside. The U.N., in fact, said it was suspending movement from certain areas of Gaza because of concerns about looting. These are all things that would be helped if there were a ceasefire in place.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, is the probability of a ceasefire enhanced or undercut when someone such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham says, President- elect Trump wants a ceasefire before inauguration deal. Does that help you or hurt you?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I think the key actor right now holding the decision on the ceasefire is Hamas. And the key thing motivating Hamas is not American politics or the American presidential transition, it's their determination about whether or not it makes sense for them at this point, after Hezbollah has abandoned them, after their leader has been killed, after their military formations have been degraded to finally say yes to a ceasefire and hostage deal. That's going to be the telling thing more than anything that's said back here.",
      "But I will say this, there has been very good coordination between our team and the incoming team on all of the aspects of the crisis in the Middle East. We felt it was important that we be in touch with them, to keep them up to speed on what's happening, because this handoff has got to be smooth. And they, in turn, have reciprocated by being open and transparent and working with us. This is how it should be in a transition. This is what we're going to keep driving for, for every day that we have left in office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to have a conversation with you about leverage as regards to the Israeli government. I want to play for you something that Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said on this program a week ago.",
      "Let's listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Your response?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: First of all, I respect Senator Van Hollen. He knows these issues as well as any person in Washington, and he is passionate about them.",
      "But, of course, we have a different perspective. We have, at various points over the course of this conflict, made asks of the Israelis consistent with our values and our interests. Have we gotten everything we've asked for? No. Have we seen a change in Israeli behavior with respect to the movement of humanitarian assistance, with respect to how they conducted certain military operations, including in places like Rafah? Yes, we have.",
      "And so, we do believe that we've had a constructive engagement with the Israeli government and also been able to make a difference on the ground with respect to the flow of humanitarian aid.",
      "In addition, we worked closely with the Israeli government to bring about a ceasefire in Lebanon. A ceasefire people said wasn't possible until a new administration took office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to take - turn your attention to Ukraine, where the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to indicate in a recent interview that he could possibly be open to a peace settlement in which Russia retains the territory it has. Ukraine, meaning Kyiv, keeps all the rest, if that is swiftly brought under the umbrella of NATO. Is that the outline or the contours of something you believe the administration believes could be workable?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Major, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I can't negotiate in public on your program, and I certainly can't negotiate on behalf of President Zelenskyy, who really should speak for himself when it comes to the destiny of his country. The future of Ukraine should be determined at the negotiating table by decisions of the Ukrainians, not imposed from the outside by the United States or anybody else.",
      "I will say, though, that we have been engaging with the Ukrainians over the course of this year on how you marry the support we provided them for use on the battlefield with a diplomatic strategy for the negotiating table.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And some recent decisions in the administration have been criticized by Republicans as setting the situation on fire, meaning ATACMS and anti-personnel mines. Those advocates for Ukraine say those decisions are way too late to change the battle space in any strategically important way. Where do you come down?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Anti-personnel land mines, which are nonpersistent mines that shut off after two weeks so they don't represent a long term threat to civilians, these could be helpful against the particular type of tactics that the Russian infantry is using right now in eastern Ukraine. So, he's sending them.",
      "The ATACMS permission into Russian territory, that was a decision he took after Russia escalated by introducing North Korean troops into this war, a foreign army into this war. So that was a responsible, coordinated step that we took with other allies to respond to that provocation, to that escalation by Russia.",
      "The president has been clear all along, we are going to give Ukraine the tools it needs. We are also going to do what we can to put them in the best possible position on the battlefield so they'll be in the best possible position at the negotiating table, and then this war will ultimately end in diplomacy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, thanks so much for your time.",
      "And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.",
      "Please, stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back.",
      "We turn now to author and historian H.W. Brands. He is the Jack S. Blanton senior chair at the University of Texas in Austin. And his latest book is \"America First: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War.\"",
      "He joins us this morning from Austin, Texas.",
      "H.W., it's great to see you.",
      "First of all, what does this America first clash then tell us if anything about today and references to America first?",
      "H.W. BRANDS (Author, \"America Frist: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War\"): The debate that I describe in the book is whether the United States should enter World War II. Between the time Germany started the war in September of 1939 and the United States entered the war in December of 1941, that was the narrow focus of the debate. The larger question and the one that persists today is, what do Americans think their country's role in the world ought to be? Should the United States, must the United States take a leading role in the world? Should the United States concern itself in conflicts among other nations that perhaps don't directly address American interests? This - this was the question then. It's a question we're dealing with again today.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: If you could, sketch out briefly Charles Lindbergh's stature at the time this debate with Franklin Delano Roosevelt was engaged.",
      "H.W. BRANDS: Lindbergh came to the attention of the American public, indeed to the world public, in 1927 when he flew a solo flight for the first time across the Atlantic Ocean. He became this national hero. He became a world celebrity for accomplishing this great technical feat, but it was also a feat of personal daring.",
      "He was a darling of the United States, a darling in other countries. He was decorated by foreign governments. He became an early celebrity in an age when celebrity was first starting to take form. So, that was his position as of 1927.",
      "His celebrity took a different turn in the early 1930s when his and his wife's infant son was kidnapped and murdered in what then was called the crime of the century, which gave rise to the trial of the century. And so, this golden boy, all of a sudden had a dark shadow cast across his life. And so he was, in some ways, this star-crossed hero at that point.",
      "He continued to be influential in aeronautical engineering circles. He knew a lot about aircraft. But in the American mind he was this - he was this great celebrity. And many people were surprised actually that he did take a leading role in the debate over American policy because he was not a political figure, he eschewed politics.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that debate with Roosevelt, did Roosevelt and his administration regard Charles Lindbergh as a potential political threat? And if so, how did they deal with it?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: It's a little bit hard to say. Franklin Roosevelt at some point decided that he wanted to run for a third term. This broke a long- standing, informal rule of American politics. And he knew that Republicans were constantly going up to Charles Lindbergh and saying, you could be president. You'd be a great candidate.",
      "Lindbergh's father had been a congressman, but Lindbergh took from his father's experience, which turned out badly because of his opposition to American policy during World War I, that he didn't want to have anything to do with politics or politicians. He considered politicians a bunch of liars, people who could not be trusted and he considered politics this low and sort of mean occupation that he wanted to have nothing to do with.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When this debate began in 1931, Lindbergh was in one place. When it ended in 1941, he was in a different place in the public mind. Some accused him of being a Nazi sympathizer. Some editorialist described him as an anti-Semite. Where do you come down?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The one thing I should say is that everybody who calls him an anti-Semite or a Nazi sympathizer, had political reasons for doing so because Lindbergh became the face of opposition to American intervention in the war. And it served his opponents' purposes to paint him in this negative category.",
      "In terms of his Nazi sympathy, he - there were American Nazis. There was an American Nazi party. They were clearly Nazi sympathizers. Lindbergh was not a member of the party. In fact, the America first committee, of which Lindbergh was a part, took pains to keep its distance from those. Lindbergh did not want Germany to win the war. His position was that the United States should not place its frontier of security in the middle of Europe the way Franklin Roosevelt and the interventionists appears to be doing.",
      "But because he took that position - and it was a position the Germans supported. The Germans didn't want the United States to enter the war. There was this objective sense in which one could say that when Lindbergh gave a speech, it served the purposes of the German government.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How about his appraisal of American Jews wanted to push America into the war and then exercising outsized influence culturally in our country?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: So, the charges of anti-Semitism against Lindbergh really are associated with a single speech he gave in the autumn of 1941, in which he identified three groups that in his opinion were most influential in pushing the United States toward war. One was the British government. Britain was already at war, and he explained it was natural that they would try to get the United States involved in the war. The second group he said was American Jews. And he said, it's perfectly understandable that they should want the United States to get into the war given what Hitler and the Nazis have done to their relatives, friends, co-religionists in Europe. And the third group was the Roosevelt administration. He was most critical of the Roosevelt administration because Lindbergh claimed that Roosevelt was using the excuse of the war to further his own political ambitions.",
      "Now, merely for mentioning American Jews in the context of war policy, the sky fell down upon Lindbergh. Everybody who wanted to make sure that they weren't accused of anti-Semitism, everybody who opposed Lindbergh's policy came down and pointed the finger of anti-Semitism at Lindbergh.",
      "To what extent was Lindbergh actually an anti-Semite? Well, I would - I would - I would - I would put him in the category of the sort of not in my country club kind of anti-Semite, which was extremely common in the United States at the time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, H.W., there's a clash over information and disinformation. Both sides warn each other and the American public about that. Unspool that for us, if you could, real quick.",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The British government and the germane government, the two antagonists in the war at that point, were both engaged in propaganda campaigns in the United States. And so, when the British government would plant editorials, features in American newspapers, often unknown to the reading public, then Lindbergh and his side would say, well, look what the British government is doing. When the German government would do something similar, then the Roosevelt administration would say, look at what the German government is doing. So, each side then, the governments of the two sides, they were doing their best to sway American public opinion because they realized that in the end it was American public opinion that had to be persuaded.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: H.W. - foreign interference in American public opinion then and now.",
      "H.W. Brands, it's been a pleasure. Thank you so much.",
      "And we'll be right back.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who joins us this morning from Houston. Senator, it's good to see you. Good morning to you. Let's pick up this thread on tariffs. I remember covering your presidential campaign in 2016 and you were a skeptic of tariffs. Then I know the politics around tariffs have changed, President-elect Trump has done that, but have the economics changed?",
      "SEN. TED CRUZ: Well, I'll tell you, what hasn't changed is, is the importance of leverage. And I got to say, you look at the threat of tariffs against Mexico and Canada, immediately has produced action. We've seen the President of Mexico stand up and promise that she is going to work hand in hand with the President of the United States, President Trump, to secure the border. I'll tell you, representing Texas, we've seen four years of an invasion at our southern border. Let me ask you, Major. Why hasn't Joe Biden done this? Why hasn't Joe Biden actually stood up and used leverage to secure the border? And the reason is, Joe Biden and the Democrats wanted this invasion to happen. And I got to say, this is a promise that I believe President Trump is going to deliver on and deliver quickly. We are going to secure the border. This is about using leverage to get Mexico and Canada to cooperate. And I'll tell you Major I think one of the very first bills we're going to take up in the Senate, vote on, and I hope pass, is my legislation, the Justice for Jocelyn Act, that is a response to the horrific rape and murder of Jocelyn Nungaray, 12-year-old girl in Houston, Texas, killed by violent criminal illegal aliens released by Joe Biden and the Democrats. This is a promise the President needs to deliver on and I think he's going to.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So when you think about tariffs and President-elect Trump, you don't take them seriously as an economic matter. You take them seriously only as a diplomatic lever.",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Well, look, I think the President was explicit with Mexico and Canada. He said he will impose these tariffs unless they secure the border. It was explicitly leveraged. And by the way, that is the same way that President Trump negotiated the Remain in Mexico agreement. If you remember, during his first term, President Trump threatened tariffs against Mexico and AMLO, then the President of Mexico. He was incredibly scared and concerned. He was scared of Trump, and he ended up signing the remain in Mexico agreement, which produced the lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years. It was incredibly successful. What did Joe Biden the Democrats do when they came in? The very first week in office, they ripped up that incredibly successful international agreement. I expect we will once again enter into remain in Mexico, and we are going to see, I make a prediction right now, we will see the numbers plummet of illegal immigration coming into this country, not in a year, not in six months, but in January and February, because we will have a president who will vigorously enforce the law.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: On that point. Senator Cruz, you would concede, in the last three or four months, numbers have gone down already, have they not?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: They have ticked down slightly. We have still seen over these four years the highest rate of illegal immigration in our nation's history. 12 million illegal immigrants have come into this country. And I got to say, in a state like Texas, you want to see the consequences. This last election was an incredible landslide for President Trump. He won all seven of the swing states. And in Texas, President Trump won Hispanic voters in Texas, I won Hispanic voters in Texas, I won statewide by a million votes, nine points. And South Texas, the Rio Grande Valley, has literally spent over 100 years as a bright blue Democrat Bastion. This cycle, South Texas flipped Republican. And it is amazing what having 12 million people invade your home can do to change people's voting behavior. I think the President has a mandate to deliver on securing the border, and I look forward to working hand in hand with him to deliver on that promise.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Kash Patel suggested by President Trump as the new leader of the FBI. How enthusiastic are you about that?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Listen, I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee. I think the entire slate of Cabinet nominees President Trump has put forward is very strong. I believe every one of these Cabinet nominees is going to be confirmed by the Senate. I think Kash Patel is going to be confirmed by the Senate. You look at his background, he has a serious professional background. He was a prosecutor, he was a public defender. He was a senior intelligence staffer on Capitol Hill. He was a senior intelligence staffer in the White House. He was the Chief of Staff of the Department of Defense. He was the deputy director of national intelligence. And I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI. The FBI and the Department of Justice are two institutions incredibly important to the rule of law in the United States. I revere both. And one of the most tragic consequences of four years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is both the DOJ and the FBI have been politicized and weaponized, and I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption in the FBI.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: As you know, Senator, there isn't a vacancy at the top of the FBI. What should become of Christopher Wray, appointed by President Trump?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Well, I think he'll make a choice. I think either he will resign or President Trump will fire him. But it's no secret to anybody, including Chris Wray, that he is not going to continue to serve as the head of the FBI under Donald Trump. Listen, if you look at James Comey and Chris Wray, there has never been a period in our nation's history where the FBI has suffered a greater loss of respect, where more Americans doubt the fundamental integrity of the FBI, and it's because James Comey and Chris Wray presided over allowing the FBI to become a partisan cudgel to be used to target parents at school board meetings, to be used to target people who chose not to take the COVID vaccine, to be used to target President Trump and to target the political opponents of Joe Biden the White House. It is tragic. That is not what the FBI is for. That is not what the DOJ is for. And I got to say Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, I think together, are a very strong slate of nominees to go and restore integrity to both institutions.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How do you place that up against the prosecutions of Bob Menendez, a congressman, a Democrat from Texas, Hunter Biden. Are those political prosecutions as well or not?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Well, first of all, let's be clear, Bob Menendez was- was literally caught with gold bars and a stack of cash with his fingerprints taking bribes, and it's why Bob Menendez is not my colleague anymore. At that point, the evidence was overwhelming. Look Major, I wrote an entire book entitled \"Justice Corrupted: How the Left Has Weaponized the Legal System\", and it broke down- it started sadly under Barack Obama, where he began using the federal government to target his political opponents. The book details how many of those partisans then burrowed in to senior career positions during the Trump administration. They waged war against President Trump during his first term, and now under Joe Biden, they have been open and brazen, and I think it has done unbelievable damage to the integrity of the Department of Justice and the FBI. I think Merrick Garland will go down in history as the most partisan Attorney General our nation has ever seen. And I got to say, I hear regularly from- from prosecutors, from FBI agents, who are deeply dismayed about the institution they devoted a lifetime working for because- listen, I don't want a Republican Department of Justice. I don't want a Democrat Department of Justice. I want a Department of Justice and an FBI that enforces the law regardless of party. And sadly, we haven't seen that these last four years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What can you tell us about the three Americans released by China who are in San Antonio. Have you been in touch with them? And do you have any concerns about the contours of that swap?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Well, at this stage, we don't know all of the details of the contours of the swap, but I'll tell you, I am celebrating the return of three Americans, especially Mark Swidan. Mark Swidan is a Texan from Houston. His mom, Katherine, is from Luling, Texas. I've talked with Katherine many times. I authored and passed a resolution in the Senate that passed unanimously calling for Mark Swidan's return to America. He spent 12 years unjustly imprisoned in communist China. I'll tell you, I have raised it directly with the foreign minister of China. I've raised it with President Biden. I've raised it with Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, and I will give them credit on this. Tony Blinken, just two weeks ago was the most recent time I spoke with him about Mark Swidan, and the administration has pressed the Chinese government and Mark Sweden is back home with his mother, who has prayed for him, who has loved- loved him. I want to say, Mark, welcome home. Katherine, congratulations. I told you this day would come. This is a time where all Texans and all Americans should be celebrating.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, Senator Cruz. Because I also know you care about the case of Austin Tice. Do you have any sense that the rebel gains in Syria of the recent vintage will have any chance of unlocking Austin Tice's freedom?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: I don't know. I certainly hope and pray Austin Tice needs to come home, and I hope and pray. Listen, there's a combination of two things working. One, as Joe Biden is in the process of transitioning out any- any outgoing President is looking to try to get some final wins, I would encourage him, and I'm sure he is doing everything he can to bring Austin Tice home, to bring the hostages in Gaza home, both the Israelis and the Americans bring them home in this window. I also think President Trump coming into office on January 20, the enemies of America, I think, are afraid of President Trump. That is a moment- I hope we have a moment right now that is very much like the end of the Jimmy Carter Administration right before Ronald Reagan came in. And we saw on January 20, our hostages in Iran released, I think, in significant part because the Ayatollah was afraid of Reagan. I hope a similar dynamic is playing out, and if we can see more hostages come home, that would be cause for enormous celebration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, thank you. Good morning. We'll be back with Face the Nation in just one moment. Please stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We are joined now by President Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. He is in Newcastle, New Hampshire this morning. Jake, good morning. It's good to see you. The Hamas video release of Edan Alexander, I know the administration regards it as a cruel propagandistic maneuver, but do you detect anything tactical at all in the timing of the release of this video, Jake?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well Major, first, thanks for having me. And as far as this video, it is a cruel reminder of the barbarity and the brutality of Hamas holding so many innocent people hostage, including Americans, including Edan. We were in touch with Edan's family yesterday. I'll be talking to the families of all of the American hostages, including Edan's family this week. And I do think that Hamas is feeling the pressure. They're feeling the pressure because one of their main partners in crime here, Hezbollah, has now cut a ceasefire deal, and they thought that Hezbollah would be with them till the end. They're feeling the pressure, of course, because their top leader, Sinwar, has been killed. So, they may be looking anew at the possibility of getting a ceasefire and hostage deal. And we are working actively with all of the key players in the region, including Israel and Turkey and Qatar and Egypt, to try to bring that about. In the coming days, conversations will be happening, even this very day, to try to make that happen as soon as possible.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, it has been reported that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a conversation with Edan's family, said, quote, conditions are ripe, unquote, for a hostage deal. How do you assess that?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, we have been working closely with the Israelis since President Biden went out into the Rose Garden and announced the ceasefire with- across the border between Israel and Lebanon, and what President Biden said was this opens a real opportunity to get that ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. He also spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu that day, and Prime Minister Netanyahu told him he agreed, the time is right. The moment is now. Let's drive to get it done. And now, if the world can come together to increase the pressure on Hamas, we can finally break through, get a deal in place, get a ceasefire, get a surge of humanitarian assistance, and crucially, get those hostages, including those Americans, home safely to their families.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And what have the weekend talks in Egypt told you about the prospects for that?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look you can never really tell about whether you're going to get across the finish line until you do, even if you get down to the 5,4,3,2,1, yard line. Punching it in, getting the deal, finally getting it done, that requires the ultimate breakthrough. So I can't predict whether it's going to happen. What I can say is, there has been progress. There have been steps forward. There is a renewed sense that this is possible, but we've been here before Major where we thought we were close, it didn't pan out. And so I'm not going to get ahead of myself or make any predictions or provide false hope. What I will say is, we're driving at this with everything we've got. We think we have a chance, but we won't rest until we get it done.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The fate of the hostages, of course, on the administration's mind, on the minds of all Americans and all in the region, but also Jake, I'm sure you saw over the last couple of days the video from Gaza of Palestinians surging to try to get a loaf of bread, in some cases, crushing one another unintentionally. All suggestions are that the humanitarian situation there is- \u00a0if it already isn't past crisis stage, near famine crisis stage. How much does that intensify the need to get this thing across, as you just said, the finish line?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: The humanitarian situation in Gaza is a crisis. You have too many people who are suffering from shortages of food, water, medicine, access to sanitation. Innocent people who deserve a measure of peace and deserve access to all of those life saving supplies in abundance. The United States has been working week in, week out, month in, month out, to open crossings, to move trucks, to ensure that humanitarian aid gets in. And at critical moments, we have been able to intervene in ways that have staved off the worst case scenarios of famine. But it's constantly stalking Gaza, and so more needs to be done to get aid in. Now, part of the problem, as we've seen just in the last 24 hours, is not actually moving aid from outside Gaza into Gaza, but moving it around Gaza once it's inside. The UN, in fact, said it was suspending movement from certain areas of Gaza because of concerns about looting. These are all things that would be helped if there were a ceasefire in place. Because with a ceasefire, with calm in Gaza, it becomes that much more straightforward to move the aid around the strip so that it can get to people, including to people who are currently in areas that are experiencing very heavy conflict. So one of the key things that we would like to achieve in this cease fire deal is the surge of humanitarian aid to go along with the release of the hostages.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake is the probability of a ceasefire enhanced or undercut when someone such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham says, President elect Trump wants a cease fire before inauguration deal. Does that help you or hurt you?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I think the key actor right now holding the decision on the cease fire is Hamas. And the key thing motivating Hamas is not American politics or the American presidential transition, it's their determination about whether or not it makes sense for them at this point, after Hezbollah has abandoned them, after their leader has been killed, after their military formations have been degraded, to finally say yes to a ceasefire and hostage deal. That's going to be the telling thing, more than anything that's said back here. But I will say this, there has been very good coordination between our team and the incoming team on all of the aspects of the crisis in the Middle East. We felt it was important that we be in touch with them, to keep them up to speed on what's happening, because this handoff has got to be smooth, and they, in turn, have reciprocated by being open and transparent and working with us. This is how it should be in a transition. This is what we're going to keep driving for for every day that we have left in office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to have a conversation with you about leverage as regards the Israeli government. I want to play for you something that Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said on this program a week ago. Let's listen.",

      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Your response?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: First of all, I respect Senator Van Hollen. He knows these issues as well as any person in Washington, and he is passionate about them. But of course, we have a different perspective. We have, at various points over the course of this conflict, made asks of the Israelis consistent with our values and our interests. Have we gotten everything we asked for? No. Have we seen a change in Israeli behavior, with respect to the movement of humanitarian assistance, with respect to how they conducted certain military operations, including in places like Rafah? Yes, we have. And so we do believe that we've had a constructive engagement with the Israeli government and also been able to make a difference on the ground with respect to the flow of humanitarian aid. In addition, we worked closely with the Israeli government to bring about a ceasefire in Lebanon, a ceasefire people said wasn't possible until a new administration took office. And in fact, the fact that we were able to do that says a lot about our ability to work with the Israeli government to generate an outcome, including one that has many political detractors inside the Israeli system. So we'll keep at it every single day. I respect voices like Senator Van Hollen. I look forward to continuing to work with him. But of course, we see things a different way.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to turn your attention to Ukraine, where the Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy appeared to indicate in a recent interview that he could possibly be open to a peace settlement in which Russia retains the territory it has. Ukraine, meaning Kyiv keeps all the rest, if that is swiftly brought under the umbrella of NATO. Is that the outline or the contours of something you believe- the administration believes could be workable?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Major, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I can't negotiate in public on your program, and I certainly can't negotiate on behalf of President Zelensky, who really should speak for himself when it comes to the destiny of his country. The future of Ukraine should be determined at the negotiating table by decisions of the Ukrainians not imposed from the outside by the United States or anybody else. I will say though, that we have been engaging with Ukrainians over the course of this year on how you marry the support we provided them for use on the battlefield with a diplomatic strategy for the negotiating table. And we've been driving towards that before the election, we continue to drive at it, and ultimately, the new team will have to work with President Zelensky to determine the diplomatic way forward.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And some recent decisions in the administration have been criticized by Republicans as setting the situation on fire, meaning ATACMS and anti-personnel mines. Those advocates for Ukraine say those decisions are way too late to change the battle space in any strategically important way. Where do you come down?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look what President Biden has done at critical moments in the conflict, is try to provide Ukraine with the tools that it needs to succeed. Anti-personnel land mines, which are non persistent mines that shut off after two weeks, so they don't represent a long term threat to civilians. These could be helpful against the particular type of tactics that the Russian infantry is using right now in eastern Ukraine. So he's sending them. The ATACMS permission into Russian territory. That was a decision he took after Russia escalated by introducing North Korean troops into this war, a foreign army into this war. So that was a responsible, coordinated step that we took with other allies to respond to that provocation, to that escalation by Russia. The President has been clear all along. We are going to give Ukraine the tools it needs. We are also going to do what we can to put them in the best possible position on the battlefield, so they'll be in the best possible position at the negotiating table, and then that this war will ultimately end in diplomacy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. Thanks so much for your time.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Thank you.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And we'll be right back with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\" Please stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Alex Padilla, Democrat of California, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to California Democratic Senator Alex Padilla. He joins us this morning from Porter Ranch, California. Senator, good to see you. Let's start with Kash Patel. Your reaction to that nomination, or that suggested nomination from President-elect Trump?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Well, good morning. Great to be with you. And look the this announcement that Kash Patel is going to be nominated for a high ranking position at the FBI, very key to the Department of Justice. Raises a lot of the same questions that other announcements and other nominations raise, are they going to go in there and do the job of- that the Department of Justice calls for to truly, truly be independent of the President of the United States? Or is he going either to do Trump's bidding? That's the big question here. Is it a genuine, legitimate appointment? Or a political appointment to politicize the Bureau and the Department in Trump's in- Trump's favor? That's just the beginning of the questions that we expect to raise in the car in the confirmation hearings that will begin in January.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you expect that the current FBI director who has three years remaining will just have to resign?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Well that's going to be a personal decision for Director Wray who, like the public should remember, both a Trump appointee to begin with. And so he's got three years left. It's up to him to resign or not. Your prior guest suggested that Trump may very well fire him, which is just par for the course. Anybody who recalls the first Trump administration recalls a whole lot of cabinet officials being named, being confirmed, and being sold as the greatest thing since sliced bread. And as soon as they lose favor with Trump, as soon as they don't do 100% of what he's demanding all of a sudden, you know, they're fired a lot of times by social media posts. And so who knows what Donald Trump is going to decide to do, whether it's with Director Wray, Kash Patel or any of his other nominees this coming term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: During the first Trump administration, California fashioned itself the resistance state. Some Democrats in the legislature have already begun to describe that as a cliche and say they don't even know what that means anymore. What does it mean?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Look, I think there's a lot of reason for concern of the second Trump administration, if the first administration is any indicator. I think as the governor, as other legislative leaders and even the congressional delegation have said, if- if you know, the federal government will continue to support California in its leadership in so many policy areas, there's a lot of good work to be done there. But Donald Trump has made it no secret that he has it in for California, whether it's the withholding of disaster funds. I mean, a lot of FEMA dollars that Donald Trump tried to keep from not the state government of California, but from California families, simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election. We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats. There's also a lot of good that can be finalized before the end of the Biden administration, whether it's Environmental Protection Agency waivers that will allow California to continue to grow our economy while tackling climate change aggressively. Waivers at Health and Human Services that would give California a little bit of flexibility with our Medicare dollars to be able to also treat behavioral health issues, mental health issues of Californians, because when we know that treating the whole body is good for both physical and mental health. we're trying to make sure those waivers\u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2013Where do those waivers\u2013",
      "SEN. PADILLA: \u2013are locked in before the end of the Biden administration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do you stand with the Biden administration on that, Senator? Are they going to be responsive?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: They've been very encouraging that the technical work can and should be done before the end of the term, but we'll note when there's signatures on the documents that we need. But again, these are just examples we want to lock into place before President Trump comes into office, and then can use it, either as a threat, as a punishment, or, as Senator Cruz mentioned in the prior segment, simply leverage to get other things he would want out of California.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You know, President elect Trump has promised mass deportations. You also know, in California, there is a state law that tells local law enforcement not to participate and cooperate with ICE agents in deportation or identification processes. The incoming Trump administration border czar, Tom Homan, has said any law enforcement who don't cooperate will be prosecuted under federal law. How is this going to be resolved?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Yeah, well, I think there's an important distinction here. No state government, not Texas, not California, not any state in the nation has a constitutional authority to impose federal immigration law that is the responsibility of the Federal Government. Some states like Texas want to push the envelope and try to find a way to assist, but there's no obligation to do so, and that's what California leaders and municipal leaders throughout the state are saying. You know, we're not going to utilize state and local resources to do the federal government's job for them. Number one, I think there's a long history of this being smart public safety policy as well. California is the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation, and the last thing you want to do is have immigrants who are victims of crime afraid to come forward to report that crime. The last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes. That's what we're talking about here. Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials job. There doesn't have to be a conflict unless that's what Trump wants.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The governor has called a special session that will convene this week to set aside money to battle the Trump administration. Will some of that money also be set aside to protect migrants and undocumented immigrants in California as they seek either legal advice or continued legal financial backing to support their efforts to stay within California and the United States?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Again, if the first Trump administration is any indicator, we know that there will continue to be a lot of fear in communities and communities that deserve to know what their rights are and what their rights are not. And so if it's legal assistance, legal advice, legal support, that's just the California way. We embrace our diversity, our diversity has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration, if we wanted to sort of cut to the chase. You know, we're hearing a lot of bombas- from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history, on the one hand, versus a- maybe a focus on violent criminals on the other. Nobody- nobody disagrees with a focus on violent criminals. Democrats, Republicans agree, but that's very different than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately, not just tearing families apart, tearing communities apart, but tremendous damage to our economy that that would create.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat from California, we thank you for your time this morning, and we'll be back right away a lot more Face the Nation. I invite you to please stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with H.W. Brands, Jack S. Blanton Sr. Chair in History at the University of Texas at Austin and author of \"America First: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War,\" on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back. We turn now to author and historian H.W. Brands. He is the Jack S. Blanton Sr. Chair at the University of Texas at Austin, and his latest book is \"America First: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War.\" He joins us this morning from Austin, Texas. H.W., it's great to see you. First of all, what does this \"America First\" clash then tell us, if anything, about today and references to \"America first\"?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The debate that I describe in the book is whether the United States should enter World War II between the time Germany started the war in September of 1939 and the United States entered the war in December of 1941. That was the narrow focus of the debate. The larger question, and the one that persists today, is, what do Americans think their country's role in the world ought to be? Should the United States, must the United States, take a leading role in the world? Should the United States concern itself in conflicts among other nations that perhaps don't directly address American interests? This- this was the question then, it's a question we're dealing with again today.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: If you could, sketch out briefly Charles Lindbergh's stature at the time this debate with Franklin Delano Roosevelt was engaged.",
      "BRANDS: Lindbergh came to the attention of the American public, indeed, to the world public, in 1927 when he flew a solo flight for the first time across the Atlantic Ocean. He became this national hero. He became a world celebrity for accomplishing this great technical feat, but it was also a feat of personal daring. He was a darling of the United States, a darling in other countries. He was decorated by foreign governments. He became an early celebrity in an age when celebrity was first starting to take form. So that was his position as of 1927. His celebrity took a different turn in the early 1930s when his and his wife's infant son was kidnapped and murdered in what then was called the \"crime of the century,\" which gave raise- which gave rise to the \"trial of the century.\" And so this golden boy, all of a sudden, had a dark shadow cast across his life. And so he was, in some ways, this star crossed hero, at that point. He continued to be influential in aeronautical engineering circles. He knew a lot about aircraft, but in the American mind, he was this- he was this great celebrity. And many people were surprised, actually, that he did take a leading role in the debate over American policy, because he was not a political figure. He eschewed politics.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that debate with Roosevelt, did Roosevelt and his administration regard Charles Lindbergh as a potential political threat? And if so, how did they deal with him?",
      "BRANDS: It's a little bit hard to say. Franklin Roosevelt, at some point, decided that he wanted to run for a third term. This broke a long standing informal rule of American politics. And he knew that Republicans were constantly going up to Charles Lindbergh and saying, you could be president, you'd be a great candidate. Lindbergh's father had been a congressman, but Lindbergh took from his father's experience, which- which turned out badly because of his opposition to American policy during World War I, that he didn't want to have anything to do with politics or politicians. He considered politicians a bunch of liars, people who could not be trusted, and he considered politics this low and sort of mean occupation that he wanted to have nothing to do with.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When this debate began in 1931, Lindbergh was in one place. When it ended in 1941, he was in a different place in the public mind. Some accused him of being a Nazi sympathizer. Some editorialists described him as an antisemite. Where do you come down?",
      "BRANDS: The one thing I should say is that everybody who called him an antisemite or a Nazi sympathizer had political reasons for doing so, because Lindbergh became the face of opposition to American intervention in the war. And it served his opponents' purposes to paint him in this negative category. In terms of his Nazi sympathy, he- there were American Nazis. There was an American Nazi Party. They were clearly Nazi sympathizers. Lindbergh was not a member of the party. In fact, the America First Committee, of which Lindbergh was a part, took pains to keep its distance from those. Lindbergh did not want Germany to win the war. His position was that the United States should not place its frontier of security in the middle of Europe,the way Franklin Roosevelt and the interventions appeared to be doing. But because he took that position, and it was a position that the Germans supported, the Germans didn't want the United States to enter the war. There was this objective sense in which one could say that when Lindbergh gave a speech, it served the purposes of the German government.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How about his appraisal of American Jews wanting to push America into the war and then exercising outsized influence culturally in our country?",
      "BRANDS: So, the charges of antisemitism against Lindbergh really are associated with a single speech he gave in the autumn of 1941, in which he identified three groups that, in his opinion, were most influential in pushing the United States toward war. One was the British government. Britain was already at war, and he explained it was natural that they would try to get the United States involved in the war. The second group, he said, was American Jews, and he said it's perfectly understandable that they should want the United States to get into the war, given what Hitler and the Nazis have done to their relatives, friends, co-religionists in Europe. And the third group was the Roosevelt administration. He was most critical of the Roosevelt administration because Lindbergh claimed that Roosevelt was using the excuse of the war to further his own political ambitions. Now, merely for mentioning American Jews in the context of war policy, the sky fell down upon Lindbergh. Everybody who wanted to make sure that they weren't accused of antisemitism, everybody who opposed Lindbergh's policy, came down and pointed the finger of antisemitism at Lindbergh. To what extent was Lindbergh actually an antisemite? Well, I would say- I would- I put him in the category of the sort of, not in my country club, kind of antisemite, which was extremely common in the United States at the time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, H.W., there's a clash over information and disinformation, both sides warn each other and the American public about that. Unspool that for us, if you could, real quick.",
      "BRANDS: The British government and the German government, the two antagonists that were at that point, were both engaged in propaganda campaigns in the United States. And so when the British government would plant editorials, features, in American newspapers, often unknown to the reading public, then Lindbergh and his side would say, well, look what the British government is doing. When the German government would do something similar, then the Roosevelt administration would say, look at what the German government is doing. So each side then, the governments of the two sides, they were doing their best to sway American public opinion, because they realized that, in the end, it was American public opinion that had to be persuaded.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Foreign interference in American public opinion, then and now. H.W. Brands, it's been a pleasure. Thank you so much. And we'll be right back"

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We're joined now by CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger. She's in Southampton, New York this morning. Jill, Senator Ted Cruz described tariffs and the threat thereof as leverage, but what I'm curious about economically is do retailers view it as only leverage? Do consumers view it only as leverage? Are they beginning to change their behavior in anticipation?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, let's just talk about whether or not they're going to change their behavior. We know that there were some retailers who were sort of dangling this out around this holiday weekend, saying, Oh, buy now because tariffs could make prices go up. I don't know what the motivation of most people is when they shop, but I'm not sure it's tariffs. What we do know about tariffs is, remember, this is a fee that is imposed on an imported good. The importing company, the U.S. company that takes that good in, has to make a decision in that moment, and that company has to decide, are we going to eat it and maybe make less money this year, or are we going to pass it along to consumers? So that is why consumers are a little unnerved by this and businesses are as well, because they're not really sure whether they can pass that along and have consumers pay that additional price. What we know is over the long term in history, tariffs tend to increase the price of certain goods. It's not necessarily across the board, but, you know, it is hard coming off of what we've just come through in the last few years with this inflationary spike to imagine that consumers are just going to take it in stride. It is a real hard thing to imagine that any company or consumer is going to feel like they want to absorb higher prices at this point.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, there was a tariff story in the first Trump administration. Do you foresee a deeper and different tariff story potentially in Trump 2.0?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think there's two parts of that question, which is, we don't know what these tariffs are. And as Senator Cruz said, this is a negotiation, so we don't know where we're going to land in that negotiation. But a big difference between where we are today and where we were back in 2017 and 2018 is during the- the early Trump administration, what we had was incredibly low inflation. That was after the financial crisis. For all those years, inflation or prices, only grew by about less than 2% a year. Now, compare that with where we are now. We had inflation spike at a 40-year-high of 9% in the summer of 2022. Yes, that inflation rate has come down, but prices are still about 22, 23% higher than they were just four or five years ago. So the big difference between the first Trump administration and the second Trump administration is prices are already high and there are many Americans who are struggling. So, I think that that is the real fear among economists that I speak to. They're worried that this is going to cause a real anxiety among consumers, and that consumers might pull back at a time where they- actually, the economy is doing pretty well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Talking about the economy doing well, you crunch a lot of numbers for us, Jill, and always break them down so easily for our audience, when you look at the data, what's the best news you see and what's the most worrisome sign?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, the best news as- is that the labor market has grown really substantially and has kept up. So I think that the labor market has been the driver of this economy, and it's been pretty consistent. The other part of the good news story is that the United States economy, more than any other developed nation, has come out of the COVID era, and that post-COVID inflationary spike much stronger, in a growth mode. So we are seeing really good things from the labor market. We're seeing things in the economy. We're seeing that AI and technology is really in a boom period. These are all wonderful things. So what's the downside here? I hate to be a killjoy, but why not? I play one on Sunday mornings, and what I can see is that these tariffs could cause a problem for a lot of consumers who are already struggling, and also this idea that we are going to see the extension of the tax cuts from the first Trump administration in the individual tax code, there is a fear among some investors that, while we may not have a crisis right now when it comes to the debt and the deficit, that the extension of those tax cuts could start to really unnerve financial markets. Not happened yet, but those are the two worrisome thing:, the tariffs and the debt and the deficit. I think those are the two looming things and of course, all the things we can't contemplate right now.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The three stock indexes have gone up pretty regularly since Election Day. Is that a methodical and well thought out reaction to an election or a kind of exuberance that may soon run its course?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Time will tell. I think that the initial investor reaction was a second Trump presidency would mean a drop in the tax rates or the extension of the tax cuts, and those tax rates would basically be in- in place for another four years. So we'd have low taxes, which is good for especially the wealthier people out there. They love low taxes, and corporate taxes were already enshrined in the code. Okay, so we have taxes staying low. That's a big factor when you come- when it comes to investing. The second part is the idea that a Trump administration would have a light regulatory touch so when you saw that first few trading- those first few trading days after the election, what went up a lot? The most highly regulated industries. So that could be energy, that could be banking, that could be other areas where you could really need- industrial companies, where you need a lot of regulatory prominence in the working of your business. Lighter regulatory touch will mean that those businesses will do well. Okay, so is it exuberance or not? Who knows? I can only tell you that as someone who watches markets all the time, when everybody tells me that the sky is clear and the sun is shining and it's rainbows and unicorns, the only thing I can remember is what my father used to say is, well, no one ever rings a bell at the top or at the bottom. So if you're an individual investor, don't count on everything being great. There's going to be a market slide. There is going to be a sell-off at some point. Don't count it- on everything being great all the time. Stick to your game plan and only change that game plan, not when the administration changes, but when your own life changes. That's it.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Breaking it down for us as always and beautifully so. Jill Schlesinger, thanks so very much. And we'll be right back."

      "The president, who departs for the trip on Sunday night, had pledged to visit the African continent in 2023 before earlier this year saying he would visit after he was reelected. But the visit was thrown into question when he dropped out of the presidential race, before a trip in October was announced. Mr. Biden then\u00a0postponed that trip\u00a0to oversee the domestic response to Hurricanes Milton and Helene.",
      "This week, the president is set to meet with Angola President Joao Lourenco and deliver remarks. Mr. Biden is expected to discuss infrastructure and economic opportunities with leaders, while highlighting the investments in Angola and Africa more broadly, according to senior administration officials previewing the trip.",
      "The president is expected to announce among a number of things that the U.S. government will have closed 12 deals in Angola by the time he departs the White House, with a combined value of $6.9 billion. He'll also outline a new global health security partnership aimed at responding to infectious diseases, while touting U.S. investments aimed at increasing food access and storage. And the president is expected to support the nomination of Angola's Kwanza Corridor as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the officials said.",
      "During the three-day visit, the president will also tout an infrastructure and rail project with heavy U.S. investment known as the Lobito Corridor, which aims to increase the speed of transport of critical minerals used for electric vehicles and AI data centers, along with drastically speeding up shipment times for food deliveries and helping to alleviate food insecurity in Africa.",
      "The visit comes as China and Russia have made inroads in the region with infrastructure investments, adding to U.S.' urgency surrounding making investments on the continent.",
      "Mr. Biden's trip also comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, spurring questions about the longevity of Mr. Biden's achievements. But the Biden administration officials noted that U.S.-Africa policy has enjoyed bipartisan support in recent administrations, and said they expect the next administration to continue building on the policy.",
      "The president also pledged when he took office to mend relationships around the world, after Trump's first term. The White House has touted a deepening relationship with African leaders, including Lourenco, who met with Mr. Biden in the Oval Office last year. In 2022, Mr. Biden hosted the Africa Leaders Summit, and since then, the administration officials said more than 20 Cabinet and other senior leaders have also traveled to the continent.",

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:53:47 -0500",
    "summary": "To do so, current FBI Director Chris Wray would have to voluntarily vacate the position or be fired by President-elect Trump.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he plans to name Kash Patel as FBI director, who would replace the current FBI chief Chris Wray.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People.\"",
      "For Patel to take the post, Wray would have to voluntarily vacate the position or be fired by Trump if he is to be replaced before his term ends in 2027. One source previously told CBS News the Trump team was aware of the complexities involved in ousting Wray.",
      "Patel will also have to be confirmed by the Senate. In his social media post, Trump did not call on Wray to resign. Trump nominated Wray in 2017 for the 10-year term after firing James Comey.",
      "An FBI spokesperson told CBS News in a statement Saturday evening that, \"Every day, the men and women of the FBI continue to work to protect Americans from a growing array of threats. Director Wray's focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for.\"",
      "The 44-year-old Patel\u00a0served\u00a0in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, including chief of staff to the secretary of defense. He was also designated by Trump to be a representative to the National Archives and Records Administration and fought a subpoena to testify before a federal grand jury in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case.",
      "He is an attorney and staunch Trump loyalist who rose to prominence as an aide to former Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California, fighting the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
      "He served on Trump's National Security Council, then as a senior adviser to acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell, and later as chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.",
      "Patel published a 2023 book titled \"Government Gangsters,\" which received praise from Trump and in which Patel writes that the \"FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken.\"",
      "\"This is the roadmap to end the Deep State's reign,\" Trump said on Truth Social about the book in September 2023.",
      "Patel, who was born in Long Island, New York, did his undergraduate work at Richmond University and earned his law degree from Pace University, as well as a certificate of international law from University of College London. He served as a county and federal public defender in Florida from 2005 to 2013 before joining the Justice Department as a trial attorney.",
      "Speaking on Steve Bannon's podcast in December 2023, Patel said that he and other Trump loyalists \"will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media.\"",
      "\"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\" Patel said to Bannon, the former White House chief strategist in Trump's first term, repeating false claims often stated, without evidence, by many Republican leaders of voter fraud in the 2020 election. \"We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly. We'll figure that out. But yeah, we're putting you all on notice\u2026We're actually going to use the Constitution to prosecute them for crimes they said we have always been guilty of but never have.\"",
      "Wray and the FBI's leadership became targets of Trump's enduring ire in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office.",
      "Special counsel Jack Smith, appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, ultimately charged Trump with dozens of counts, including the illegal retention of national defense information and obstruction, as a result of the investigation. All the charges were dismissed by a federal judge earlier this year. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "Earlier this week, a federal appeals court granted Smith's bid to end the case, with Smith citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and would take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. While Wray's departure from the job was largely expected, Trump's announcement about replacing Wray before his 10-year term was to end is sure to reverberate throughout the bureau's rank-and-file. Presidents, however, have the power to force them out of the role and many previous directors have not served their full terms.",
      "Patel would report directly to the attorney general of the United States \u2014\u00a0 Trump's current pick for the post is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. The president-elect announced her nomination after former Congressman Matt Gaetz withdrew his nomination because his confirmation prospects looked dim as a bipartisan group of senators raised concerns about his past conduct and a Congressional ethics report. Gaetz \u2014 a staunch critic of the Justice Department and FBI \u2014 has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Trump's pick for Attorney General and FBI Director are likely to be tasked with potential reforms and mass policy overhauls of the agencies that have long been targets of the president-elect.",
      "Wray \u2014 a former federal prosecutor and counterterrorism official \u2014 was nominated by then-President Trump in 2017. President Biden retained him as FBI director throughout his administration.",
      "While deep distrust of the FBI has been the focal point of Trump and his supporters, Wray spent much of his tenure on countering China's espionage campaigns. He sounded the alarm on foreign efforts to target American infrastructure and warned of aggressive posturing by Iran and Russia. The FBI employs about 35,000 people \u2014 including thousands of field agents \u2014 tasked with enforcing federal law and investigating crimes across the country, including terrorism, espionage, and child exploitation.",
      "The last FBI director to serve a full 10-year appointment was Robert Mueller, who was later named special counsel during the first Trump administration to investigate Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election and allegations of collusion with the Trump campaign. Mueller, and by extension the entire Justice Department and FBI, quickly became a target for Trump and Republicans in Congress.",
      "Trump's decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey in 2017 because of the investigation into the 2016 election contributed to Mueller's appointment as special counsel. Comey, who has since become an outspoken critic of the president-elect, found himself at odds with Democrats and Republicans upon his departure from the FBI's top job. A Justice Department Inspector General Report released in the years after his firing revealed Comey \"violated Department and FBI policies\" when he shared with a friend memos he made about his interactions with Trump.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he is tapping Republican Florida sheriff Chad Chronister to serve as administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, Trump said Chronister will work with former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Justice, \"to secure the Border, stop the flow of Fentanyl, and other Illegal Drugs, across the Southern Border.\"",
      "Bondi\u00a0was chosen by Trump\u00a0after his previous selection, former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, withdrew his nomination amid a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations against him of sexual misconduct.",
      "Chronister has been sheriff of Florida's Hillsborough County since being appointed to the role by then-Gov. Rick Scott 2017, and has since won reelection twice. He has been with the department for 32 years. Hillsborough County includes much of the Tampa Bay metro area.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, he would replace outgoing DEA Administrator Anne Milgram, who has held the role for nearly the entirety of President Biden's term.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS affiliate\u00a0WTSP, Chronister called it \"the honor of a lifetime to be nominated,\" adding that he was \"deeply humbled by this opportunity to serve our nation.\"",
      "The DEA, which is part of the Justice Department, has approximately 10,000 employees and is tasked with enforcing America's drug laws. Among its major edicts has been addressing the opioid crisis.",
      "In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" in September, Milgram said the U.S. is \"losing a generation\" to fentanyl.",
      "\"As complex and as massive a problem as this is, it's also not a whodunit. We know who's responsible,\" Milgram said. \"It's the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco Cartel that are based in Mexico. They dominate and control the entire global fentanyl supply chain, starting in China, going to Mexico, coming into the United States.\"",
      "During his campaign, Trump pledged to crack down on illegal immigration and drug trafficking, and this week, Trump followed through by threatening to impose sweeping 25% tariffs on both Mexico and Canada until those issues are properly addressed to his liking.",
      "In response, Trump held a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Wednesday, which she described as an \"excellent conversation.\"   On Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made a surprise trip to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where the two men had dinner. Trump described their meeting as \"very productive.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:46:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists now have a clearer picture of Camp Century, an abandoned U.S. military base long hidden under the ice in Greenland, thanks to a NASA research team's good luck.",
    "story": [
      "As NASA scientist Chad Greene flew over northern Greenland with a team of engineers in April, they never expected their radar to find something manmade buried deep within the ice. Greene and his team were flying above the Greenland Ice Sheet on a NASA Gulfstream III plane, scanning the barren expanse of ice that's more than a mile deep in some areas, when their radar instrument picked up something unusual.",
      "\"We didn't know what it was at first,\" Greene said in a statement released by NASA's Earth Observatory this week, along with new images of the discovery. \"We were looking for the bed of the ice and out pops Camp Century.\"",
      "It turns out the team had stumbled upon an abandoned Cold War-era military base built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1959. Nicknamed the \"city under the ice,\" the compound consists of a network of tunnels carved into the ice sheet. It was abandoned in 1967 and, over time, became buried about 100 feet below the surface as snow and ice accumulated.",
      "The base was built as part of Project Iceworm, a then-secret plan to experiment with building a missile launch site under the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Cold War, when tension soared between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union. Camp Century, a remote, nuclear-powered installation, was built to study the feasibility of such a project, but it was never realized and the base was decommissioned under the assumption it would be buried forever under the ice.",
      "While the \"city under the ice\" had been picked up by previous radar scans, the instruments used on the NASA flight in April provided a more detailed, if unexpected, survey.",
      "\"In the new data, individual structures in the secret city are visible in a way that they've never been seen before,\" said Greene, who works with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
      "Past scans had used a type of radar that points straight down at the ground and produces a two-dimensional scan of structures buried beneath the ice. Greene's flight used NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar, which is able to produce maps with \"more dimensionality,\" according to the agency.",
      "A photo released by NASA on Monday showed the features of the base hidden deep under the ice, appearing as anomalies near the base of the ice sheet.",
      "\"Scientists have used maps acquired with conventional radar to corroborate estimates of Camp Century's depth \u2014 part of an\u00a0effort to estimate\u00a0when melting and thinning of the ice sheet could\u00a0re-expose the camp\u00a0and any remaining biological, chemical, and radioactive waste that was buried along with it,\" NASA's Earth Observatory said in its article this week. \"The scientific utility of the new UAVSAR image of Camp Century remains to be seen; for now, it remains a novel curiosity acquired by chance.\"",
      "A 2016 study of the abandoned base suggested that the facility could no longer be considered \"preserved for eternity,\" due to climate change increasing the rate at which Arctic ice is melting.",
      "CBS News' Walter Cronkite visited Camp Century for a tour of the still-under-construction facility for a program that aired in 1961. The camp's commander, Captain Tom Evans, explained to him that the goals of the program were three-fold: \"The first one is to test out the number of promising new concepts of polar construction. And the second one is to provide a really practical field test of this new nuclear plant. And, finally, we're building Camp Century to provide a good base, here, in the interior of Greenland, where the scientists can carry on their R&D activities.\"",
      "The exact nature of that research and development work wasn't discussed in Cronkite's report for the CBS documentary show \"The Twentieth Century.\" \u00a0(An abridged version of that report can be viewed at the link above.)",
      "Speaking with 60 Minutes in 2016, as that show revisited Cronkite's decades-old trip to Camp Century, producer Daniel Ruetenik said the trip was fascinating, and he marveled at the evolution of human interest in the vast, frozen expanse of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",
      "\"At the time [of Camp Century], the Cold War was considered to be the greatest threat to humanity,\" Ruetenik said. \"And now, the area has become a destination for climate scientists trying to study changes in the environment. So, it has a second purpose now.\"",

    "summary": "Forensic pathologists hope advanced DNA testing technology will enable them to attach names to all the unidentified people at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office.",
    "story": [
      "Some may have been lost hikers, runaway children, or wanderers.",
      "One thing connects the 58 or so remains at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office found with no identification card and no next of kin to claim them: They remain nameless.",
      "Forensic pathologists hope advanced DNA testing technology will enable them to attach names to all of the agency's unidentified people. But for now, five cases - all children and teens - have been sent for additional testing thanks to a $50,000 grant from Texas-based cold case resolution company Othram.",
      "They include the partial skeleton of a teenager found in Keehi Lagoon near the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in 2002; parts of the body of a 7- to 10-year-old boy discovered in Waianae in 2000; six fingers of a girl under the age of 4 who was found in Honolulu in 2012; and the skeletal remains of an adolescent found mixed with animal bones inside of a vase purchased in Honolulu in 2015.",
      "The medical examiner's office wouldn't provide additional details about the cases, but medicolegal investigator Charlotte Carter said each represents a person whose family deserves closure.",
      "The five cases sent to Othram for testing were chosen in part because they are juveniles who DNA experts felt had a good chance of being identified through advanced technology.",
      "One case is connected to a 2014 homicide, so the medical examiners office declined to provide information while the investigation continues.",
      "For the case involving the severed fingers, it's unclear whether they belong to a child who died or only suffered trauma to their hands. The other cases could be missing children, a possibility that can't be ruled out until DNA testing is complete.",
      "Carter said she's committed to resolving the other unidentified cases in Honolulu's morgue, especially if DNA testing becomes more accessible and affordable.",
      "\"Anybody who's unidentified deserves to have a chance at being found and identified,\" she said, \"and given their name back.\"",
      "The Honolulu City Council in June accepted the grant from Houston-based Othram, which performs forensic genetic genealogy testing, which combines DNA analysis with genealogy research.",
      "So far, Carter said, none of the samples have been identified.",
      "Sparse information about each case is available publicly through the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs, an organization funded by the National Institute of Justice, which runs a national database of unidentified, missing and unclaimed persons. Representatives with NamUs didn't respond to interview requests.",
      "For some cases, very little is known.",
      "For the skeletal remains found inside the vase in Honolulu, for example, forensic pathologists could not identify an age range, gender, height, weight or year of death - only that the person was still an adolescent.",
      "Other cases include more clues. The young boy found in Waianae in 2000 was suspected to have died that same year. He was recovered without a torso and was missing one or more of his limbs and one or both of his hands.",
      "A forensic artist reconstructed his face, which is included on his NamUs profile, showing what he may have looked like in life. He's listed in the missing children's database as \"John Waianae Doe 2000.\"",
      "Carter said it can take a year or more for DNA testing results to come back.",
      "Thus far, her agency has worked on one successful identification with Othram.",
      "Skeletal remains unearthed by a construction crew in Manoa in 2010 were tested and later identified as belonging to William Hans Holling Jr., a Washington man last seen by friends and family in January 1985. Othram identified Holling's remains and the Honolulu Police Department confirmed his identity in July. No arrests have been made, and the investigation remains open.",
      "Serial killer-rapist identified with the technology",
      "Forensic genetic genealogy testing enables investigators to search for an unidentified person's relatives as a starting point and, with the help of public records, to build a family tree they hope will get them closer to an identification.",
      "The method became popular in criminal investigations in the 2010s after companies like 23andMe and Ancestry came onto the market. Those companies block law enforcement agencies like the FBI from their databases, but investigators can use others, like GEDMatch, which is public-facing, and FamilyTreeDNA, which allows limited access by law enforcement, according to Stephen Kramer, a former FBI in-house counsel and founder of Indago Solutions, a DNA identification company.",
      "While still working with the FBI in 2018, Kramer helped identify the Golden State Killer using forensic genetic genealogy testing. Joseph James DeAngelo Jr., pleaded guilty to 13 murder and rape charges for crimes committed in the 1970s and '80s and has admitted overall to 161 crimes involving 48 victims, including dozens of rapes.",
      "Kramer's company recently identified Albert Lauro as the murder suspect in the 1991 killing of Dana Ireland on the Big Island.",
      "During a presentation to University of Hawaii law students this month, Kramer said genetic analysis of the DNA found on Ireland's body connected him to ancestry information about the suspect. He discovered the man was 83% Filipino, meaning he had three Filipino grandparents. He was also 5% European and Scandinavian, with the rest a mix of Hawaiian, Maori and South Pacific Islander.",
      "That told Kramer the suspect's fourth grandparent was about 30% European and 25% Pacific Islander, he said. Kramer focused on that grandparent because it's generally easier to find public records for people of European descent.",
      "He used records to identify people with this ancestry who had moved to Hawaii and married into Filipino families, leaving very few potential matches. He traced a family tree with three Filipino grandparents and one grandparent descending from Europeans, Scandinavians and Pacific Islanders.",
      "There, he found his suspect.",
      "Investigators followed Lauro by picking up a fork he discarded, which was tested against a DNA sample from Ireland's body.",
      "Detectives later reconfirmed Lauro's identity with a swab when they brought him in for questioning on July 19. Hawaii County Police Chief Ben Moszkowicz later said police didn't have enough probable cause to arrest Lauro for Ireland's murder, and they let him go.",
      "He killed himself four days later.",
      "Factors hindering use of the technology",
      "Lack of funds is the main obstacle to more intensive screening and forensic genetic genealogy on cold cases, Carter said. Each case costs about $10,000, and NamUs pays for Honolulu to send around five cases per year for testing.",
      "The 58 unidentified cases at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office date back to about 1966 and include people found under a variety of circumstances.",
      "Many are skeletal remains uncovered at construction sites, Carter said. Others are remains discovered by hikers that likely belonged to people who were homeless and living in encampments in remote parts of the island.",
      "If remains are found on tribal lands, are more than 50 years old or otherwise suspected to be Native Hawaiian, medical examiners contact the Department of Land and Natural Resources' State Historic Preservation Division for confirmation. If the remains are confirmed to be Native Hawaiian, the agency takes custody of them for repatriation.",
      "But some unidentified cases involve people who died fairly recently and, although they were physically recognizable when they were found, still haven't been claimed by family members or matched through any national database.",
      "Forensic pathologists haven't been able to identify a woman fatally struck by a car while trying to cross a road on May 21, 2016, Carter said. She was between 50 and 75 years old, of Asian or mixed Asian ancestry and appeared to be homeless, according to her NamUs profile. Her DNA was run through the national database and Honolulu police collected her fingerprints and sent them to the FBI but received no matches.",
      "A few people have come forward thinking they knew her, but her identity wasn't able to be confirmed, Carter said.",
      "\"That is a person who was a victim of a crime,\" she said. \"But, unfortunately, we're not able to figure out who she is.\"",
      "The most recent case was discovered on Oct. 9 when military personnel doing a training exercise found two femurs inside a camping tent off a hiking trail in Haleiwa.",
      "Carter said her office doesn't track statistics on identifications but said usually one or two unidentified remains are ID'd each year through DNA testing. If a person is identified but their next of kin can't be found, their case is moved to NamUs's unclaimed persons database.",
      "If family members are found, they are able to collect their relative's remains for burial or cremation, Carter said.",
      "She hopes that as technology improves, testing will become more accessible so every case can be resolved.",
      "\"I just think everybody deserves a name and their family deserves an answer,\" she said. \"We have a lot of families who are out there wondering what happened to somebody they love. And now that there's new technologies, we're maybe going to get a little step closer to having more closure or more processing to that new normal for those families.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 23:09:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Canada's Competition Bureau says that an investigation found the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",
      "Mehta also found that Google in 2021 Google paid about $26 billion to Apple and other partners to ensure its search engine would be the default one on internet browsers.",
      "His ruling stemmed from a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit first filed against Google in October 2020 during the first Trump administration.",
      "Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling, but the tech giant must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so. The appeals process could take as long as five years, predicts George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s.",
      "And in January 2023, the Justice Department and several states filed a separate lawsuit against Google claiming it has an illegal monopoly over online advertising.",

    "summary": "Australia's full legislature has now passed a bill that will soon ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's Senate passed legislation Wednesday that, once signed by the country's leader who has strongly endorsed it,\u00a0will ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms. The new law will give Australia the tightest restrictions of any democracy in the world on children's use of hugely popular social media apps.",
      "The Senate passed the bill by 34 votes to 19 on Thursday, a day after Australia's House of Representatives\u00a0passed the same bill by a sweeping margin of 102 votes to 13.",
      "Australia's major parties in the House all supported the bill, which will see social media companies such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Tech giant Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has called for the bill to be delayed. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted online Tuesday, Meta said it was \"concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation.\"",
      "\"The Government's approach will likely require each app provider to collect personal identification or biometric data from all Australians in order to prevent under 16s from accessing their services, an inefficient and burdensome process for everyone,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "Meta also pointed to a policy it introduced earlier this year on its Instagram platform, Instagram teen accounts, which limits who can contact teenagers via their accounts and attempts to moderate the content that young users see.",
      "In a post shared last week on the X platform that he owns, tech billionaire Elon Musk also condemned the Australian bill and said it seemed to him \"like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\"",
      "Other independent bodies and non-profit organizations have also taken aim at the bill, voicing concern that young people's human rights could be restricted by it.",
      "The CEO of the Save the Children charity Mat Tinkler said in a statement\u00a0earlier this month that while he welcomes government efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than introducing a blanket ban.",
      "\"We are asking the government to reconsider this legislative approach and instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits,\" Tinkler said.",
      "The Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, expressed its own \"serious reservations\" over the proposed law in an analysis published last week.",
      "\"There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies,\" the analysis said. \"We also need to help children and young people to better navigate online spaces by ensuring the national curriculum includes a specific focus on teaching digital literacy and online safety.\"",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese rejected criticism of the proposed law as he\u00a0addressed the parliament\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"There are common sense exemptions. We want to make sure that young people can continue to access health and education related services \u2014 Headspace, YouTube, Google Classroom \u2014 as well as messaging services and online games,\" he said.",
      "The Australian leader added that there would be \"very strong and strict privacy requirements to protect people's personal information, including an obligation to destroy information provided once age has been verified.\"",
      "Despite the criticism, the legislation remains popular among Australians, according to recent polling data.",
      "A YouGov survey released Tuesday showed 77% of Australians back the ban on under-16s, and 87% of said they supported the introduction of stronger penalties for social media companies that fail to comply with regulations.",

      "Monterey, California \u2014 The battle over President-elect Trump's pick for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, may become a test of loyalty for Republican stalwarts \u2014   some of whom stood at the center of a bid 10 years ago to remove Hegseth as the head of a veterans' charity over allegations of financial mismanagement, repeated intoxication and sexual misconduct.",
      "One of those who led the effort to oust Hegseth as head of the Concerned Veterans of America in 2016 was Jessie Jane Duff, a Marine veteran who served as one of President-elect Donald Trump's 2024 campaign executive directors, according to multiple Republican insiders familiar with the events, all of whom spoke on the condition they not be named over fear of reprisals from those within the party. Duff sought Hegseth's removal from leadership roles in the veterans' group, CBS News has learned.",
      "While she worked at Concerned Veterans for America as a senior military adviser, Duff allegedly complained about Hegseth's frequent public intoxication, poor leadership and the toxic work climate he fostered within the organization, according to Republican insiders with knowledge of the matter. She also allegedly slighted Hegseth for his service in the National Guard, underscoring that he had only been a \"part-time\" soldier and not a full-time active-duty servicemember, according to Republican insiders who spoke to CBS News.",
      "Tax filings show Hegseth became a director at Veterans for Freedom in 2006 and executive director in 2007. In 2008, filings show the organization raised over $8.7 million in revenue \u2014 but spent over $9 million, including significant sums on media buys and events and initiatives.",
      "By 2010,\u00a0tax filings show revenue had dropped to just under $265,000. In the nonprofit's 2011 filing, Hegseth was listed as an \"officer,\" rather than its executive director.",
      "Hegseth started leading Concerned Veterans for America in\u00a02011. By 2016, the year Hegseth resigned as executive director, filings show the organization raised $15.9 million and listed $16.4 million in expenses.",
      "The following year \u2014 after Hegseth stepped down \u2014 the nonprofit reduced its expenses after \"major programs developed in the last fiscal year were paused,\" the tax filings said.",
      "The filings also showed Concerned Veterans for America had hired Hegseth's brother, Philip Hegseth, while he was still in college.",
      "The New Yorker late Sunday night published new information gleaned from internal records and interviews with former employees of the group.",
      "The magazine revealed that a previously undisclosed \"whistle-blower report\" detailed allegations of sexual misconduct by Hegseth and other men at CVA, and repeated incidents of public intoxication while he was still married and serving in the Army National Guard.",
      "CBS News has learned the allegations contained in the seven-page-report originated with Duff and were privately circulated to broader Republican circles outside Concerned Veterans for America in 2018, when Hegseth's name was floated for secretary of veterans affairs.",
      "A source close to Hegseth told CBS News that the report had been anonymously sent to Fox News years ago, allegedly \"to try and get him fired,\" asserting that Fox had looked into it but determined it was \"baseless.\"",
      "\"Fox News does not have any record of receiving this report,\" said a network spokesperson.",
      "The source called Duff \"a disgruntled former employee\" at CVA who pushed \"false claims\" about Hegseth to try to hurt his television career. \"She was jealous, because she wanted to get into TV,\" said the source. Hegseth had fired Duff from Concerned Veterans for America, according to two sources.",
      "In 2016, after staffers complained about Hegseth's leadership of Concerned Veterans of America, the billionaire Republican donors who funded the group, Charles and David Koch, forced Hegseth to step down, sources told CBS News. He resigned in January 2016 in a move described by both Hegseth and the organization as a mutual decision, dismissing rumors of a rift, according to\u00a0Military Times.",
      "Hegseth's attorney, Tim Parlatore, denied all the allegations against his client.",
      "As Hegseth walked through the Capitol, visiting the senators who will weigh in on his expected nomination to be defense chief, CBS News questioned him Monday about why he had resigned from CVA. He kept walking silently and did not respond. Hegseth also did not comment when asked if he was concerned the latest allegations could derail his nomination as defense secretary.",
      "Duff was his most outspoken critic in private circles until Hegseth was announced as Trump's pick for defense secretary, according to the Republican sources who spoke with CBS News.",
      "But now, Duff publicly supports his impending nomination to lead the Defense Department and has\u00a0defended his controversial opposition to women serving in combat.",
      "Contacted by CBS News multiple times on Monday, Duff did not respond.",
      "Duff, a Newsmax analyst, served as an adviser for Concerned Veterans for America while Hegseth helmed the organization from 2013 until 2016. The organization was formed in 2011 as a Koch-funded non-profit group called \"Vets for Economic Freedom Trust.\"",
      "The group primarily promotes conservative views in the arenas of both the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, particularly advocating for the latter to move towards a privatized healthcare system.",
      "Hegseth, the 44-year-old former co-host of \"Fox & Friends Weekends\" has faced a barrage of scrutiny involving his personal life and whether he has the experience to manage the Defense Department, the largest U.S. government agency, with a budget of $842 billion, almost 3 million employees and 750 military installations around the world.",
      "Margaret Hoover, host of PBS' \"Firing Line\" and a former adviser to Vets for Freedom, said in an\u00a0interview on CNN that Hegseth had managed the organization \"very poorly.\" Hoover expressed doubt about his ability to run the sprawling Defense Department when he had struggled with a staff of less than 10 people, and a budget of under $10 million.",
      "\"I don't know how he's going to run an organization with an $857 billion budget, and 3 million individuals, based on what I saw in those years,\" she said.",
      "In response to CBS News questions about the finances at Veterans for Freedom under his leadership, Hegseth merely said, \"I love working for the best in the military, and I'm privileged that the president of the United States would give me the opportunity to represent the best in the military.\"",
      "The whistleblower report received by The New Yorker also detailed multiple incidents where Hegseth was allegedly intoxicated on the job \"to the point of needing to be carried out of the organization's events.\"",
      "When pressed by CBS News on Capitol Hill about whether he was ever drunk while traveling on the job, Hegseth replied, \"Not gonna dignify that with a response.\"",
      "A source close to Hegseth acknowledged that people did \"occasionally\" have too much to drink at these events but maintained that the report's claims about Hegseth are false.",
      "\"The idea that a veterans organization of combat veterans who'd recently transitioned out of the military would drink or have too much to drink, that's not news,\" they said. \"That's the entire business model of the VFW [Veterans of Foreign Wars].\"",
      "The source said Hegseth has publicly acknowledged that he \"drank too much\" in the past, adding: \"That's not the kind of life that Pete lives right now. He certainly has matured a lot in the past decade.\"",
      "Last month, it was\u00a0revealed that Hegseth had secretly paid a financial settlement to a woman who had accused him of raping her in 2017 at a Republican women's banquet at the Hyatt Regency in Monterey, Calif. The city of Monterey released its 2017 investigation into Hegseth.",
      "The accuser, who has not been publicly named, reported she felt as though she had been drugged and recalled repeatedly saying \"no\" while in a hotel room with Hegseth. She alleged that he prevented her from leaving and was on top of her. CBS News does not publicly name individuals who have reported an alleged sexual assault unless that person chooses to publicly identify themselves.",
      "Timothy Parlatore, Hegseth's attorney, told CBS News previously: \"This allegation was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it.\"",
      "The Monterey Police Department forwarded its report about the alleged assault to the Monterey County District Attorney's Office for review back in 2017. Monterey County District Attorney Jeannine M. Pacioni said last month her office \"declined to file charges\" in January 2018 as none were \"supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 20:06:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Contracted truckers hauling packages between Amazon facilities are more likely to engage in dangerous behavior on the roads than other carriers, according to federal data analyzed by CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The death of a 19-year-old college student on a Texas highway is raising questions about the fleet of drivers Amazon uses to move packages between its facilities. College freshman Iliana Velez's life was cut short in a crash with a contractor who was driving to pick up an Amazon load.",
      "A University of Texas freshman, Velez was working nights sorting packages part time at an Amazon fulfillment center.",
      "In the early morning hours of Jan. 3, 2022, Velez was on a break when she was forced off the road by a box truck driven by Jordan Sannicola, a contractor on his way to pick up an Amazon shipment. Velez's car rolled multiple times. She died at the scene.",
      "Her mother, Trula Velez, received the news from police that same evening.",
      "\"The officer knocked on my door and he said that she was involved in an accident, and she didn't make it,\" she said. \"I was such in a state of shock.\"",
      "When Sannicola was arrested four weeks later, investigators learned he had a history of traffic violations, a suspended driver's license and outstanding felony warrants, including one count of evading arrest with a vehicle. He told police he was using a hand-held mobile device when he collided with Iliana Velez's car.",
      "\"Someone with multiple warrants should not have been hired,\" Trula Velez said.",
      "A lawsuit filed by Trula Velez alleges Amazon had previously rejected Sannicola's application to deliver packages for the company's \"flex\" home delivery service after he failed a background check. Still, he was able to drive for an Amazon-contracted company. Despite his criminal history and driving record, Take Flight with B, a North Carolina motor carrier company, hired Sannicola to move Amazon freight.",
      "Missed warning signs?",
      "The Velez family attorney, Alex Hilliard, claims that because of the background check, Amazon was \"fully aware\" of Sannicola's poor driving record and criminal background when he started driving for Take Flight, which transported goods between Amazon facilities on a segment of the delivery network known as the \"middle mile.\"",
      "The lawsuit also alleges tracking technology provided by the Relay phone application Amazon uses to monitor driver location and performance had informed the company of Sannicola's unsafe driving behavior, but it failed to act.",
      "\"Mr. Sannicola had 70 different speeding violations [while working for Take Flight] that Amazon had been notified of,\" said Hilliard. \"They did nothing about that.\"",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal safety data revealed Amazon contractors primarily in the company's \"middle-mile\" delivery network had monthly violation rates \u2014 such as speeding and texting while driving \u2014 that were usually double those of carriers who didn't transport for Amazon. The analysis examined six years of monthly Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) unsafe driving rates and found the average rates of carriers who shipped for Amazon were at least 89% higher in every month.",
      "\"I was stunned,\" said Jason Miller, a professor at Michigan State University who is an expert in supply chain management. \"I've published many articles using these data. You do not see effects like this normally, where you have a set of carriers that is almost twice as unsafe as a different set of carriers.\"",
      "CBS News used roadside inspection reports in federal data to identify Amazon contractors. The reports, which are produced by law enforcement, indicate who a carrier said they were shipping for at the time of inspection. The analysis included carriers who shipped at least once for Amazon in the two years leading up to each month examined.",
      "Miller said the large patchwork of contractors Amazon uses for \"middle-mile\" transport poses challenges to ensuring a uniform culture of safety.",
      "\"The more you are essentially having your freight hauled by hundreds, if not thousands of small young firms, that makes it much more difficult to ensure those firms are operating safely versus a more - what we call strategic procurement model, where you may have a few very large carriers that you work with that handle a lot of freight,\" said Miller.",
      "In the past two years, at least 57 people have died in more than four dozen crashes involving federally regulated carriers shipping for Amazon, according to FMCSA data, though the data does not indicate who was at fault in these incidents. The FMCSA produces a crash involvement score for carriers, but it is not public.",
      "Amazon's response",
      "\"Any fatality is heartbreaking,\" said Tim Goodman, Amazon's global legal director for road safety. \"Any families that have been affected by this all have our condolences and our hearts go out to them.\"",
      "While Amazon mandates background checks for contracted drivers who deliver directly to customers' homes, Goodman said the company looks to the FMCSA to oversee \"middle-mile\" contractors who move freight between facilities in larger vehicles.",
      "A spokeswoman for FMCSA confirmed it requires contractors who dispatch commercial motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds to conduct background checks into drivers' safety performance history as a condition of employment.",
      "Amazon said when the company learns a contracted carrier has violated FMCSA guidelines, the carrier can face consequences, including permanent suspension.",
      "\"We have taken disciplinary action against around 19,000 motor carriers for failing to meet FMCSA safety requirements,\" Goodman said.",
      "Among those carriers is Take Flight with B, the contractor that hired Jordan Sannicola. Amazon confirmed it suspended Take Flight with B permanently from its contracted fleet.\u00a0 The motor carrier has since gone out of business.",
      "Goodman defended Amazon's continuing reliance on third-party trucking contractors to move its freight and deliver packages.",
      "\"In the United States, transportation with motor carriers is driven by independent businesses, small businesses,\" said Goodman. \"It has been that way since at least the Carter administration.\"",
      "\"We are unique at Amazon in terms of our scale,\" Goodman said. \"But it's a business model that has worked, and worked well, and we're committed to having it be a catalyst to be able to improve safety for the roads for all of us.\"",
      "Amazon disputes CBS News' data findings. In a statement sent after the interview, a spokesperson said: \"We've worked closely with CBS throughout this story, and are disappointed that they continue to use data based on a flawed methodology. We take safety incredibly seriously and the truth is that overall crash rates across third party carriers that we work with have improved. Our standards are stricter than FMCSA requirements, and we'll continue working to ensure our partners are the safest carriers on the road.\"",
      "Among other complaints, the company took issue with how CBS News identified Amazon contractors\u2014it said inspection reports sometimes list the wrong shipper\u2014and how CBS News measured a carrier's safety.",
      "Amazon measures safety using the FMCSA's \"unsafe driving score,\" which is a number that applies different standards depending on the size of the carrier. This score is not made public by the government, but the underlying data is. Rather than ranking the carriers by size, CBS News looked directly at the underlying rates of unsafe driving violations like texting and speeding.",
      "CBS News consulted with multiple leading supply chain researchers, who all use FMCSA measures in peer-reviewed studies. Alex Scott, a University of Tennessee professor and expert in supply chain management, said he does not use the FMCSA's scores in part because they make smaller carriers appear safer than they are.",
      "\"I don't think that makes any sense,\" Scott said. \"If they're less safe, then they're less safe.\"",
      "What the court system says",
      "On Oct. 11, a judge sentenced Jordan Sannicola to a 40-year prison term for the charge of \"failing to stop and render aid -- accident involving death\" in the crash that killed Iliana Velez.",
      "\"One mistake cost someone's life, and that was my daughter's, and her life was just getting started,\" Trula Valez said.",
      "A court date for her lawsuit against Amazon is set for early 2025.",

      "A woman accused in a DUI crash that killed a bride on her wedding night in South Carolina and injured three others, including the groom, pleaded guilty to multiple charges Monday afternoon and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.",
      "CBS affiliate WCSC-TV reports that Jamie Lee Komoroski pleaded guilty to a charge of felony DUI resulting in death, two counts of DUI causing great bodily injury or death, and one count of reckless homicide. She was sentenced to 25 years for felony DUI resulting in death, 15 years for the two counts of DUI causing great bodily injury or death, and 10 years for reckless homicide. The sentences will run concurrently.",
      "On the night of April 28, 2023, authorities said Komoroski was behind the wheel of a rental car that rear-ended a golf cart carrying newlyweds\u00a0Samantha Miller\u00a0and\u00a0Aric Hutchinson\u00a0in Folly Beach, a city located on Folly Island southeast of Charleston. They had been married just hours earlier, and Miller was still in her wedding dress.",
      "Miller died in the crash and Hutchinson suffered a brain injury and numerous broken bones. Two other family members riding in the golf cart were also injured.",
      "Authorities said Komoroski was driving 65 mph in a 25 mph zone.",
      "Komoroski told the court Monday she was guilty, was not coerced into entering the guilty pleas and was waiving a jury trial to which she would be entitled, WCSC reported.",
      "In June, a judge approved over $1.3 million in a partial settlement in a wrongful death case after Hutchinson\u00a0sued Komoroski, whose blood alcohol content was \"0.261, more than three times the legal limit,\" according to a\u00a0toxicology report\u00a0released by the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division. Included in the wrongful death lawsuit were Enterprise, the car company that rented her the vehicle, and numerous restaurants and bars that served Komoroski on the night of the accident.",
      "Police investigators said in an affidavit that Komoroski had \"an odor of alcohol coming from her breath and person.\" When the investigator asked her if she had anything to drink that night, Komoroski answered, \"Nope ooh I had two drinks, one beer and a drink.\" Then she said, \"Like a tequila and pineapple.\"",
      "She said she was driving home when \"something hit her,\" the incident report said. Police noted she was driving in the opposite direction of her home.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 18:06:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk was seeking to reinstate a massive 2018 Tesla pay package after shareholders had reapproved it, but a judge denied his request.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's efforts to get his massive $56 billion 2018 Tesla pay package reinstated was rejected by a Delaware judge on Monday.",
      "The decision, issued by Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick, comes after a majority of Tesla shareholders in August reauthorized the compensation package during the electric vehicle maker's annual meeting.",
      "After it was initially approved in 2018, the pay package sparked a lawsuit from some Tesla shareholders who accused Musk and Tesla's board of directors of breaching their duties and unjustly enriching the billionaire. In January 2024, McCormick had ruled that Musk and his company failed to prove that the huge payout was legally warranted, prompting Musk to take the issue back to his shareholders in August.",
      "In her Dec. 2 decision, McCormick said that Musk had asked the court \"to flip its decision and enter judgment in their favor.\"",
      "She added, \"The motion to revise is denied,\" citing what the judge described as \"at least four fatal flaws\" in arguments from Musk's attorneys.",
      "\"The large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,\" McCormick noted.",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Shares of Tesla fell slightly in after-hours trading, dipping $4.74, or 1.3%, to $352.35. The stock has gained 47% in the last month, buoyed by investor optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's victory at the polls will help boost Tesla's prospects, given Musk's support for his campaign.",
      "The stock options Tesla granted to Musk were initially worth $2.6 billion but had soared to $56 billion when McCormick blocked the package in January, according to\u00a0Bloomberg News.",
      "\"No basis in the common law\"",
      "Musk's attorneys had argued that the second vote made clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick had earlier pointed out, were adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package. They asked the judge to vacate her order directing Tesla to rescind the pay package.",
      "Among the issues in their latest arguments, McCormick wrote, was a lack of procedural grounds for \"flipping the outcome of an adverse post-trial decision based on evidence they created after trial.\"",
      "She also objected to Musk's attempt to recertify the pay package through another shareholder vote, which she wrote his attorneys had argued served as \"common law ratification.\"",
      "\"What the defendants call 'common law ratification' has no basis in the common law \u2014 a stockholder vote standing alone cannot ratify a conflicted-controller transaction,\" she noted. \"[E]ven if a stockholder vote could have a ratifying effect, it could not do so here due to multiple, material misstatements in the proxy statement.\"",
      "McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argue they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.",
      "Despite the setback, Musk remains the world's wealthiest person, with a net worth of $343 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump's selection of a number of House Republicans to fill top posts in his administration is pulling from an already shallow bench.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans have celebrated holding onto their narrow majority in the House, adding to their flip of the Senate and the White House for a trifecta in Washington next year. But President-elect Donald Trump's selection of a number of House Republicans to fill top posts in his administration is pulling from an already shallow bench, temporarily whittling the GOP majority down further as Trump takes office in January.",
      "Just one House race remains to be decided nearly four weeks after Election Day, with 99% of the vote counted in California's 13th Congressional District, where Democrat Adam Gray is leading GOP Rep. John Duarte. Last week, victories in another California district, along with one in Iowa brought the balance of power in the chamber to 220-214.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has tapped a handful of House Republicans for top positions in his administration. In the week following the election, the president-elect made two selections from the House, with GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik of New York as ambassador to the U.N., and Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida as national security adviser.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, while outlining the GOP agenda following the picks last month, said the president-elect \"fully understands and appreciates the math here,\" noting that he didn't expect the conference would lose any more members to Trump's administration.",
      "\"Every single vote will count because if someone gets ill or has a car accident or a late flight on their plane then it affects the votes on the floor,\" Johnson said.",
      "Then came Trump's pick of former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, setting up three vacancies early in the new Congress. Gaetz resigned his seat immediately, hours after Trump announced his intent to nominate him.",
      "\"I told President Trump, 'enough already, you've got to give me some relief,'\" Johnson said on Fox News after Trump selected Gaetz for the role. \"I've got to maintain this majority.\"",
      "Though Gaetz has since withdrawn from consideration for the post, facing intense scrutiny over a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, he's said he does not intend to serve in the 119th Congress, giving Johnson another unwelcome vacancy.",
      "Johnson expressed optimism at the time of Gaetz' selection that with his immediate resignation from the chamber, his seat could be filled by the start of the new Congress, citing Florida state law's process. But Gov. Ron DeSantis\u00a0set the primary for Jan. 28, and the general election for April 1, which he said was the earliest date the special election could take place. Florida's secretary of state said the election was being conducted \"as quickly as statutorily possible.\"",
      "Waltz' seat is also set for an April 1 general election in Florida. And the special election for Stefanik's seat could take up to 90 days after she resigns. The dynamic could mean for months in the early days of the president-elect's second term, Republicans could have a majority that is as low as one or two seats, meaning that if all House members are present, Johnson could need the support of every single Republican. If he has a three-seat majority, he could afford to lose one Republican on some votes.",
      "The outcome may spell trouble for the GOP's ability to act on the mandate that Republicans have claimed since Trump's victory in the presidential election. (Although Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in both the electoral and popular votes, he did not win a majority of American voters.) House Republican leadership has struggled in recent years to keep the conference united on key priorities, with a reliable group of detractors on its right flank. While the conservatives, many of whom are Trump loyalists, may be more inclined to stay in line under a Trump administration than during President Biden's time in office, Johnson could face opposition from moderates in his party.",
      "House Republicans like Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska, David Valadao of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington have previously been critical of Trump and could break with the party on some issues, imperiling some early legislative action. Bacon refused to back the president-elect during the primary, while Valadao and Newhouse are the two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021. After the election, Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told USA Today that he would be willing to speak out against Trump amid GOP control of Washington to work in the best interest of his constituents.",
      "\"When I agree with the president, I'll say it. If I disagree on something, I will say that, too,\" Lawler said.",
      "Still, the exceedingly narrow majority created by Trump's appointments is expected to be short-lived, since all three seats are in safely Republican districts. Johnson expressed confidence that Republicans would be able to work with a smaller majority for as long is necessary, while pledging to \"be very aggressive\" and move forward with Trump's agenda beginning on Day One.",

      "Federal investigators found nearly a dozen children to be working dangerous, overnight shifts at Seaboard Triumph Foods' pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, Iowa, the Department of Labor announced.",
      "Employed by Guymon, Oklahoma-based sanitation contractor Qvest, 11 kids allegedly used corrosive cleaners to sanitize head splitters, jaw pullers, bandsaws, neck clippers and other equipment at the Seaboard Triumph Foods facility from at least September 2019 through September 2023, the DOL stated in a news release\u00a0on Friday.",

      "Seaboard in September 2023 contracted Fayette Janitorial Services for sanitation work at its facility. After taking over the plant's sanitation services contract, Fayette allegedly rehired some of the children previously employed by Qvest, with the Somerville, Tennessee-based contractor earlier this year found to be employing nine minors at the Sioux Falls plant, the DOL alleged.",
      "Fayette also allegedly hired 15 children as young as 13 at a Perdue Farms processing plant in Accomac, Virginia, where a 14-year-old was severely injured. Perdue terminated its contract with Fayette before the DOL's court filing, the company said.",
      "Are migrant kids cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses?",
      "The development is part of an ongoing probe into whether migrant kids are cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses. It also comes less than a year after the government fined another sanitation services provider $1.5 million for employing more than 100 kids \u2014 \u00a0ages 13 to 17\u00a0\u2014 at 13 meat processing plants in eight states.",
      "The DOL launched its investigation after a published report detailed migrant kids working overnight for contractors in poultry processing facilities on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. A New York Times Magazine\u00a0story\u00a0last December detailed children cleaning blood, grease and feathers from equipment with acid and pressure hoses.",
      "The Times'\u00a0account\u00a0included details of a 14-year-old boy who was maimed while cleaning a conveyor belt in a deboning area at a Perdue slaughterhouse in rural Virginia. The eighth grader was among thousands of Mexican and Central American children who have crossed the border on their own to work in dangerous jobs.",
      "But it's not only migrant children tasked with illegal and dangerous work. A 16-year-old high school student, Michael Schuls, died last summer after getting\u00a0trapped in a machine at a Wisconsin sawmill.",
      "From an elevated waterslide at a Jacksonville, Florida, beach park to a sawmill in Clarkrange, Tennessee, federal investigators are finding children across the country working illegal hours and performing risky, unlawful tasks. In May, federal investigators found a 13-year-old girl allegedly working up to 60 hours a week on an assembly line in Luverne, Alabama.",
      "More recently, the DOL found a Grand Rapids, Michigan, window cleaning company had illegally hired three kids to clean residential windows and gutters, and to install Christmas lights, with one requiring surgery after suffering serious injuries after falling from a roof. Another DOL case resolved last month involved children operating and cleaning a meat grinder and driving motor vehicles to deliver orders for a pizza restaurant in Iron River, Wisconsin.",
      "The DOL's Wage and Hour division oversaw 736 investigations uncovering child labor violations affecting 4,030 children in fiscal 2024, the agency stated.",
      "In addition to the federal government, the state of Massachusetts recently took aim at companies violating child labor laws, citing an operator of dozens of Burger King franchise locations across the state for allegedly scheduling minors to work more than the legally allowed hours.

      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:41:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create your own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have the type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said. \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa, according to trade data.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Prosecutors say female residents feared that if they crossed paths with Roger Golubski, he'd demand sexual favors and threaten to harm or jail their relatives.",
    "story": [
      "A white ex-Kansas police detective accused of sexually assaulting Black women and girls - and terrorizing those who tried to fight back - died Monday from a gunshot wound as his trial was set to begin, authorities said.",
      "The Kansas Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that \"there are no indications of foul play\" in the death of Roger Golubski. Police in Golubski's hometown of Edwardsville, outside Kansas City, Kansas, found Golubski, 71, dead on his back porch after an area resident reported hearing a gunshot, authorities said. Law enforcement set up a crime scene outside Golubski's home on Monday morning, CBS affiliate\u00a0KCTV reported.",
      "Prosecutors say that, for years, female residents of poor neighborhoods in Kansas City, Kansas, feared that if they crossed paths with Golubski, he'd demand sexual favors and threaten to harm or jail their relatives.",
      "Golubski was facing six felony counts of violating women's civil rights. But he did not appear in court Monday morning for the start of jury selection. Prosecutors later confirmed in court that Golubski had died.",
      "His attorney, Christopher Joseph, said his client \"was despondent about the media coverage.\" He did not elaborate.",
      "U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse dismissed the case against Golubski at prosecutors' request. Joseph called the death \"truly unexpected.\"",
      "\"I don't know the details,\" he told reporters as he walked away from the courtroom where jury selection had been set to begin.",
      "The case has outraged the community and deepened the historical distrust of law enforcement.",
      "The prosecution follows earlier reports of similar abuse allegations across the country where hundreds of officers have lost their badges after allegations of sexual assaults.",
      "Golubski was accused of sexually assaulting one woman starting when she was barely a teenager and another after her sons were arrested.",
      "About 50 people rallied outside the federal courthouse Monday morning in freezing temperatures to show their support for women who've said they were victimized by Golubski. They held signs that said, \"Justice now!\"",
      "The trial is the latest in a string of lawsuits and criminal allegations that has led the county prosecutor's office to begin a $1.7 million effort to reexamine cases Golubski worked on during his 35 years on the force. One double murder case Golubski investigated already has resulted in an exoneration, and an organization run by rapper Jay-Z is suing to obtain police records.",
      "Golubski had pleaded not guilty, and his attorney said that lawsuits over the allegations were an \"inspiration for fabrication\" by his accusers. But prosecutors said that, along with the two women whose accounts are the heart of the criminal case, seven others were going to testify that Golubski abused or harassed them.",
      "\"Every time I turn around, I'm looking,\" said Jermeka Hobbs, who has filed a separate lawsuit against Golubski and was not going to be a witness in the trial. Her lawsuit says she was groomed to be one of \"Golubski's girls\" and submitted to sexual advances fearing that he would bust her for drugs. \"I'm thinking somebody is after me. I have no peace at all.\"",
      "Veteran detective patrolling poor neighborhoods",
      "Fellow officers once revered Golubski for his ability to clear cases, and he rose to the rank of captain in Kansas City before retiring there in 2010 and then working on a suburban police force for six more years. His former partner served a stint as police chief.",
      "Prior to his death, Golubski had been under house arrest and undergoing kidney dialysis treatments three times a week.",
      "Joseph said in a statement that some of the allegations against Golubski are 20 to 30 years old, adding, \"In public filings, the prosecution has acknowledged that the verdict will turn entirely on the accusers' credibility.\"",
      "But Jim McCloskey, founder of Centurion, a New Jersey nonprofit working to free innocent people, described Golubski in a court hearing as the \"dirtiest cop I've ever encountered.\"",
      "Stories about Golubski remained just whispers in the neighborhoods near Kansas City's former cattle stockyards partly because of the extreme poverty of a place where some homes are boarded up. One neighborhood where Golubski worked is part of Kansas' second-poorest zip code.",
      "Crime was abundant there, as were drug dealers and prostitutes, said Max Seifert, a former Kansas City police officer who graduated from the police academy with Golubski in 1975.",
      "Fellow officer: \"A boys will be boys type of thing\"",
      "Seifert said police misconduct was tolerated in the department. He described how informants and Golubski's ex-wife complained that Golubski was soliciting prostitutes. Golubski also was caught having sex with a woman in his office, he said.",
      "\"It's kind of like a boys will be boys type thing,\" said Seifert, who was forced into early retirement for refusing to conceal a motorist's beating by a federal agent in 2003.",
      "McCloskey said in an interview that Golubski had women \"at his mercy.\"",
      "The inquiry into Golubski stems from the case of Lamonte McIntyre, who started writing to McCloskey's nonprofit nearly two decades ago.",
      "McIntyre was just 17 in 1994 when he was arrested and charged in connection with a double homicide, within hours of the crimes. He had an alibi; no physical evidence linked him to the killings; and an eyewitness believed the killer was an underling of a local drug dealer. Golubski and the dealer have since been charged in a separate federal case of running a violent sex trafficking operation.",
      "The eyewitness only testified that McIntyre was the killer after Golubski and a now disbarred attorney threatened to take her children away, she alleged in a lawsuit.",
      "\"I want to spend the rest of my life being happy,\" McIntyre told CBS News in 2018 after being released from prison. \"I don't want to be bitter. That's taking away from me. I don't have any more time to give.\"",
      "McIntyre's mother said in a 2014 affidavit that she wonders whether her refusal to grant regular sexual favors to Golubski prompted him to retaliate against her son.",
      "\"She, like many people in the community, just viewed the police as all-powerful,\" said Cheryl Pilate, an attorney who helped free McIntyre in 2017.",
      "In 2022, the local government agreed to pay $12.5 million to McIntyre and his mother to settle a lawsuit after a deposition in which Golubski invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent 555 times. The state also paid McIntyre $1.5 million.",
      "\"That was the thread that gave people some courage,\" said Lindsay Runnels, who serves on the board of the Midwest Innocence Project.",
      "Women say they were threatened and mocked",
      "Prosecutors say Golubski drove one of the women at the center of their criminal case to a cemetery and told her to find a spot to dig her own grave. He sexually assaulted her repeatedly, starting when she was just in middle school, leading her to suffer a miscarriage, court filings say.",
      "Once, prosecutors say, he forced her to crawl on the ground with a dog leash around her neck in a remote spot near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers. With no one around, he is accused of chanting, \"Down by the river, said a hank a pank; Where they won't find her until she stank.\"",
      "Golubski introduced himself to Ophelia Williams, the other woman at the center of the case, by complimenting her legs and nightgown as police searched her home, prosecutors said.",
      "Williams was terrified at the time because her 14-year-old twins had just been arrested in a double homicide. They ultimately admitted to the crime so police would free their 13-year-old brother, Williams said in a separate lawsuit.",
      "Golubski began sexually assaulting her, alternating between threatening her and claiming he could help her sons, according to court records in the criminal case. The twins are now 40 and remain behind bars. The lawsuit she is part of questions their confessions.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name alleged victims of sexual assault, but Williams has told her story publicly.",
      "Williams said in her lawsuit that she once mentioned making a complaint. She claims Golubski told her: \"Report me to who, the police? I am the police.\"",

She was nude, and the subsequent autopsy that confirmed Whitney's name also determined her cause of death to be asphyxia from strangulation and probable smothering.

      "Whitney was 18 when she died. At the time, Pierce County detectives tried to develop leads as they searched for whomever was responsible in her murder. They interviewed people who knew Whitney, and people who had dated her, as the probe got underway. But despite collecting DNA samples from the body that presumably belonged to the killer, investigators were unable to pinpoint a suspect.",
      "The case remained unsolved for years. In 2005, another effort to find the suspect by running those DNA samples through CODIS \u2014 a national database that law enforcement can use to link forensic profiles to crimes and suspects called the Combined DNA Index System \u2014 ultimately proved unsuccessful as no matches were found, according to the Pierce County sheriff.",
      "Tracy Whitney Cold Case Solved\n\nOn August 28th 1988, Pierce County Deputies responded to a call of a body found in the Puyallup River near Sumner. Some fisherman had located the body of a woman who was nude right where the Puyallup and White Rivers meet. \n\nDetectives were called out to the scene and an autopsy was performed. The autopsy revealed the woman's cause of death was asphyxia caused by strangulation and probable smothering. She had several blunt force injuries and was believed to have been sexually assaulted.

      "It wasn't until 2022, owing to a grant from the Washington State Attorney General's Office, that a Pierce County sheriff's cold case detective submitted the DNA to a genetic genealogy laboratory for repeat testing. Genetic Genealogy is a process where forensic analysts build a family tree from a DNA profile, which in this case allowed law enforcement to identify Whitney's killer by way of a family member.",
      "Findings from the genealogy lab led detectives to the biological son of their suspect in Whitney's death, John Guillot, Jr., and confirmed that the elder Guillot was in fact a match for the DNA, according to the Pierce County sheriff.

      "Funding the government",
      "In September, lawmakers approved a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through Dec. 20, setting a pre-holiday deadline to prevent a shutdown that has become commonplace for Congress. With frustration among some conservatives over the practice, House Speaker Mike Johnson made clear at the time that he opposed an omnibus package to fund the government, suggesting that the House would work to approve the 12 full-year spending bills individually after the election. But the favorable results for Republicans in the 2024 elections appeared to change the calculus.",
      "Republicans appear likely to push to punt the deadline into the early days of President-elect Donald Trump's administration, though the exact timeline for the stopgap measure remains a key question. The deadline will tee up a larger fight over government spending, with Republicans set to control the House, Senate and the White House \u2014 and looking to make significant spending cuts while juggling the extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",

Matt Gaetz, who then opted to withdraw his name from consideration for Attorney General following intense scrutiny over a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. On Monday, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa is set to meet with former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who Trump tapped for Attorney General after Gaetz withdrew.",
      "Trump has continued to announce his picks for the top posts, including Kash Patel, a 44-year-old who served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term and has a reputation as a controversial figure, for FBI director. The announcement came as Trump-nominated Christopher Wray's term isn't set to expire until 2027.",
      "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump tapped to lead the newly coined Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, will also be on Capitol Hill this week, meeting Thursday with Senate and House Republicans.",
      "House Ethics Committee meets to consider Gaetz report",
      "The House Ethics Committee is set to meet Thursday to further consider whether to release the report about its investigation into Gaetz, after the evenly split bipartisan panel failed to reach an agreement in an hourslong meeting last month.",
      "A day later, Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration, further complicating the ethics committee's decision about whether to release the report. Gaetz' resignation from the House after his selection for attorney general had ended the committee's jurisdiction over him, making the release of the report all the more controversial. The Republican committee chairmen said he voted against the release of the report over the jurisdiction issue.",
      "Still, some view the report's release as essential if Gaetz is eyeing other offices, like another post within Trump's administration or running for Florida governor down the road.",
      "The Ethics Committee's investigation first began in 2021, but was put on pause as the Justice Department conducted a sex trafficking and obstruction probe of Gaetz. Last year, the Ethics Committee resumed its work, after prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz, who has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "Senate Democrats hold leadership elections",
      "Senate Democrats, who will be in the minority in the new Congress, are expected to meet Tuesday to elect their leadership for the next two years, after Republicans flipped the chamber in the 2024 elections.",
      "Though the top posts in Democratic leadership are expected to remain unchanged, with Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and whip Dick Durbin seeking to remain in their roles, the no. 3 post is up for grabs as Sen. Debbie Stabenow set to retire.",
      "Stabenow, who is leaving the Senate after more than two decades, chairs the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. The post has been eyed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.",
      "The leadership races come as Senate Democrats are making a final push on their agenda, with a focus on confirming President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts. Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's 234 judicial confirmations from his first term during the lame-duck session, but have run into resistance from Republicans looking to hold up and drag out the process.",

      "Israel unleashed its largest wave of airstrikes across Lebanon since agreeing to a ceasefire with Hezbollah last week, killing at least 11 people on Monday after the Lebanese militant group fired a volley of projectiles as a warning over what it said were Israeli truce violations.",
      "The projectiles were apparently the first time that Hezbollah took aim at Israeli forces after the 60-day ceasefire went into effect last Wednesday. The increasingly fragile truce aimed to end more than a year of war between Hezbollah and Israel - part of a wider regional conflict sparked by the devastating Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "In a possible sign of the ceasefire's frailty \u2014 and a clear warning of the implications for Lebanon of it failing \u2014 Israeli Defense Minister Israeli Katz was cited by the country's Army Radio network on Tuesday as warning that if the truce \"collapses, we will act strongly and stop separating Hezbollah from the state of Lebanon.\"",

The strikes were a response to Hezbollah firing two projectiles toward Mount Dov \u2014 a disputed Israeli-held territory known as Shebaa Farms in Lebanon where the borders of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel meet. Israel said the projectiles fell in open areas and no injuries were reported.",
      "Hezbollah said in a statement that it fired on an Israeli military position in the area as a \"defensive and warning response\" after what it called \"repeated violations\" of the ceasefire deal by Israel. It said complaints to mediators tasked with monitoring the ceasefire \"were futile in stopping these violations.\"",
      "Before the Hezbollah projectiles, Israeli carried out at least four airstrikes and an artillery barrage in southern Lebanon, including a drone strike that killed a person on a motorcycle, according to Lebanese state media. Another strike killed a corporal in the Lebanese security services.",

November saw an increase in the average number of humanitarian trucks it let into Gaza, up to 77 daily from 57 the month before, according to official Israeli figures. But the levels are still nearly the lowest of the entire 15-month war.

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:41:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create your own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have the type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said. \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa, according to trade data.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

It was the scene of fierce battles earlier in the conflict but, until Sunday, the rebels had never managed to totally seize it. Video showed rebels in military fatigues patrolling the streets of Aleppo, with some setting fire to a Syrian flag and others holding up the green, red, black and white flag of the revolution.",
      "While the streets appeared mostly empty, some residents came out to cheer the advancing rebel fighters. HTS is an alliance led by al Qaeda's former Syria branch. It's fighting alongside allied factions, with units taking orders from a joint command.",
      "Aron Lund of the Century International think tank said: \"Aleppo seems to be lost for the regime.\"",
      "He added: \"And a government without Aleppo is not really a functional government of Syria.\"",
      "The United States and its allies France, Germany and Britain called Sunday for \"de-escalation\" in Syria, and for the protection of civilians and infrastructure. The U.S. maintains hundreds of troops in northeast Syria as part of an anti-jihadist coalition, and it has also continued carrying out strikes against Islamist groups in the country.",
      "Russia and Iran vow to help Syria's Assad",
      "Assad's reaction to the surprise offensive was still building on Monday with the joint airstrikes carried out by his air force and his Russian allies, and expanded ground operations aimed at retaking towns and villages north of Aleppo said to be underway.",
      "Syrian-Russian air raids hammered several areas of both Aleppo and the neighboring Idlib provinces, killing at least 49 people, including 17 civilians, according to the Observatory.",
      "\"The strikes targeted... displaced families living on the edge of a displacement camp,\" said Hussein Ahmed Khudur, a 45-year-old teacher who sought refuge at a camp in Idlib after fleeing fighting in Aleppo province. He said one of the five people killed in one strike was a student of his, and the other four were his four sisters.",
      "Russia, which first intervened directly in the Syrian war in 2015, said Monday that it continued to support Assad.",
      "\"We of course continue to support Bashar al-Assad and we continue contacts at the appropriate levels, we are analyzing the situation,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.",
      "Iran's top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, was in Syria on Sunday to deliver a message of support, state media said.",
      "On Monday, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei said the Islamic republic had entered Syria at the official invitation of Assad's government.",
      "\"Our military advisers were present in Syria, and they are still present. The presence of advisers from the Islamic Republic of Iran in Syria is not a new thing,\" he said.",
      "Same Syrian civil war, but very different times",
      "While the fighting is rooted in a war that began more than a decade ago, much has changed since then. Millions of Syrians have become displaced, with around 5.5 million living in neighboring countries.",
      "Most of those involved in the initial anti-Assad protests are either dead, living in exile or in jail.",
      "Russia, meanwhile, is nearing the third year of its incredibly costly full-scale war on Ukraine, and Iran's militant allies Hezbollah and Hamas have been massively weakened by more than a year of conflict with Israel.",
      "On Monday, Iran's foreign ministry said it would maintain its military support for the Syrian government.",
      "But the role of Lebanon's Hezbollah, which played a key role in backing the government particularly around Aleppo, remains in question particularly after it withdrew from several of its positions to focus on fighting Israel.",
      "HTS and its allies began their offensive Wednesday, just as a ceasefire took effect in Lebanon after more than a year of war between Hezbollah and Israel.",
      "The recent violence in Syria has killed some 244 rebels and 141 Syrian regime and allied fighters, along with at least 24 civilians, according to the Observatory, which has a network of sources inside Syria. The Observatory said rebel advances met little resistance.",
      "Aaron Stein, president of the U.S.-based Foreign Policy Research Institute, said \"Russia's presence has thinned out considerably and quick reaction airstrikes have limited utility.\"",
      "He called the rebel advance \"a reminder of how weak the [Assad] regime is.\"",

Police released photos and video of the operation, showing the cabin of the fishing boat loaded with huge packages of the alleged drugs.",
      "The smugglers made two attempts to transport the drugs to Australia by sea from a mothership floating hundreds of miles offshore, Jay said.

    "summary": "After a childhood behind the Iron Curtain, Angela Merkel served as Chancellor of a united Germany for 16 years, becoming the most powerful woman in the world while dealing with its most powerful men. She talks about her new book, \"Freedom: Memoirs 1954-2021.\"",
    "story": [
      "We met former German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a fitting place for her: the museum in Berlin dedicated to the Wall, that great symbol of the Cold War division between East and West. Parts of the wall have been preserved as a reminder of those hard times, especially for someone who lived through them.",
      "She said images of the wall still conjure up highly emotional memories for her.",
      "I asked, \"When you look at the wall, what comes to mind to you immediately?\"",
      "\"Between the ages of seven and 35, I had to live with this wall,\" she replied. \"I was, so to speak, behind the wall, and couldn't come to this side. And of course, that's still very moving.\"",
      "Merkel's new book, \"Freedom: Memoirs 1954-2021\" (published by St. Martin's Press), is filled with moving memories of what it was like growing up in the Communist-controlled police state that was East Germany. Her family had moved there when she was an infant because her father, a Protestant pastor, was assigned to a church there. But it was the fall of the wall that spurred her political awakening, and jump-started a career nobody would have bet on: A woman, from the East, who would not only become Chancellor of Germany, but who would hold the job for 16 years; who would be called the most powerful woman in the world, and who would deal with its most powerful men.",
      "It turns out, life in the East actually had given her one advantage for dealing with all those men in dark suits: Those bright pant suits of hers weren't an accident. \"In my book I write that maybe my love for colorful clothes is due to the fact that in the East, everything was very gray,\" she said.",
      "Merkel's uniform became part of her identity, and helped her break through the American pop-cultural barrier, on \"Saturday Night Live,\" the way few European leaders could.",
      "Merkel left power three years ago this week, and has gone into a kind of self-imposed political radio silence since then, keeping her recollections and opinions to herself.",
      "Not anymore.",
      "Among the more awkward memories: that first shocking, even embarrassing, meeting with President Donald Trump in 2017.",
      "I said, \"I think it's fair to say your most difficult relationship with an American president was with President Trump in his first term. You talk about your first encounter in the Oval Office where he refused to shake your hand, and you say that it occurred to you that he was fascinated with Putin and with politicians with authoritarian and dictatorial traits. Why did you say that?\"",
      "\"Why he didn't want to shake my hand, that, you'd have to ask him,\" Merkel replied. \"I think he often conveyed a message with a handshake. With some men he shook hands for a long time.\"",
      "\"What were you thinking? Should I reach over? Will we shake hands? Won't we shake hands? What's he trying to do?\"",
      "\"I describe it in my book because it was so interesting. I whispered to him, 'I think they want us to shake hands.' And at that moment when I said it, I noticed that he wanted to convey a message. And I was quite na\u00efve, telling him that they want us to shake hands.\"",
      "\"But did you get what he was trying to do?\" I asked. \"Did you think, Oh, he's going to play it that way, that's how we're going to do it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's the way it was. I left being convinced that multilateral cooperation would be difficult with Donald Trump,\" Merkel replied. \"You can make deals with Donald Trump because he always thinks in terms of advantage and disadvantage. But in my experience, win-win situations are not only good for one side, but for both sides. That's not really his way of thinking.\"",
      "Merkel's book, which is being released around the world, went to press before last month's election. In it, she wrote that she wishes \"with all my heart that Kamala Harris defeats her competitor and becomes president.\"",
      "Of the election results, she said, \"I was sad. First of all, I wanted a woman to win. I was also in favor of Hillary Clinton. And secondly, I'm closer to Kamala Harris' political conviction. But the American voters have decided, and it was a democratic election.\"",
      "Merkel has come in for her own share of criticism since she left office. Her decision to allow more than a million refugees and migrants fleeing Syria into Germany is now often cited as a reason for the rise of anti-immigrant, right-wing political parties in Europe. She says those forces were on the rise anyway.",
      "Her decision to allow the German economy to become too dependent on Russian natural gas is seen as another reason for Germany's economic decline since the flow was stopped.",
      "She says staying engaged with Vladimir Putin seemed like the right idea at the time, difficult though it was. And it didn't stop him from invading Ukraine.",
      "I asked, \"You dealt a lot with Vladimir Putin. I take it, reading between the lines of your book, that you found him a very difficult and manipulative character as well, even an intimidating character at times. Famously, you don't like dogs; he'd bring his dog to the meeting. Do you think he did that in an intimidating kind of way? And how would you suggest people deal with him, especially as things are heating up again?\"",
      "\"Without fear,\" she replied. \"Of course, there are attempts to see how people react under a certain amount of pressure. And Putin can do that, too. And with the dog he expressed exactly that. But it all depends on how I manage the situation. I'm used to political pressure since childhood, so that did not shock me.\"",
      "Despite all her experience, Merkel says she now refrains from giving advice. But she does give hints. She says that, in general, she is worried about developments in the world: \"I've always said that fear is not a good advisor. Times have become rougher. We are now sitting in a place where the world was divided in the Cold War, and then there was 1990. We had great hopes that things would become easier after the end of the Cold War. Things have not become easier.\"",

      "Sleep expert Dr. Wendy Troxel, RAND Corporation senior behavioral specialist and a licensed\u00a0clinical psychologist\u00a0in Utah, said the idea that women need significantly more sleep than men is \"often overstated.\"",
      "SLEEPY DURING THE DAY? IT COULD BE AN EARLY WARNING SIGN OF DEMENTIA, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "Research has shown that the difference between men and women is \"rather minimal,\" as women only need about 11 to 13 more minutes of sleep, Troxel told Fox News Digital.",
      "In addition to insomnia, women are more likely to experience other sleep disorders, like restless leg syndrome, which can compromise sleep quality. (iStock)",

      "\"Taking a moment to think about what you're truly grateful for in a quiet moment can set a positive tone for the day,\" Morin told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"It can also increase your happiness, improve your relationships and give you a boost in mental strength that you'll likely need during the day.\"",
      "2. Don\u2019t skip breakfast",
      "It might seem wise to forgo the meal leading up to Thanksgiving, with the idea of \"making room\" for the main food event, but experts say that\u2019s not a good idea.",
      "\"When you skip breakfast or lunch, you tend to be ravenous by the time you do eat, and that sets you up for overeating as you overindulge,\" Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Consumer Health Digest based in Wyoming, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Instead, she recommends eating a balanced breakfast so you feel more satisfied throughout the day.",
      "\"When Thanksgiving dinner rolls around, you'll have more control of what and how much you choose to eat.\"",
      "3. Choose foods wisely",
      "Among the many options on the Thanksgiving table, some choices are better than others.",
      "\"Have a little bit of everything (because that's tradition), but tread lightly around the charcuterie board \u2014 and when you go for seconds, cut down on the butter, cream and fats,\" advised Dr. Michael Schopis, a New York gastroenterologist.",
      "\"Some patients have trouble digesting certain carbohydrates, which can lead to excessive bloating and gas, causing pain related to functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome,\" a doctor cautioned. (iStock)",

      "\"A slower pace of eating will help improve digestion and help you recognize comfortable fullness.\"",
      "Another reason to slow down is that the faster you eat (and the less you chew), the more stomach acids have to work to break down foods, which leads to gas, bloating and reflux, Schopis added.",
      "5. Drink water with dinner",
      "This tip comes from Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and the owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition in Raleigh, North Carolina.",
      "GIVING THANKS CAN MAKE YOU HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"Keeping alcohol to a minimum will help you feel much better while you eat and afterward,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Because alcohol is a toxin, your body (particularly your liver) prioritizes breaking it down and getting it out of your system,\" she went on. \"That means digesting other food gets put on hold while the alcohol is processed.\"",
      "\"If you can, stick to water while you eat, and alternate boozy beverages with non-alcoholic ones,\" a nutritionist recommended. (iStock)",

      "\"Choose to speak about things you have in common and reminisce over good memories,\" Amodio recommended.",
      "Some other ideas include bringing old photo albums, playing board games and taking breaks throughout the day by stepping into another room as needed.",
      "7. Take guilt off the menu",
      "\"Remember that Thanksgiving is just one day and guilt is not a food group,\" said Elizabeth Harris, a registered dietitian in Maryland.",
      "\"Consider how you want to feel after your holiday meal and do your best to walk your choices backwards from there.\"",

      "That Biden\u00a0used his final weeks as a lame duck president\u00a0to protect his only living son from prosecution was met with less shock among legal analysts than was the sheer breadth of the pardon itself, which spans a nearly 11-year period beginning in January 2014, the year Hunter was appointed to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and ending on Sunday, the day that the White House announced the pardon.",
      "While that time frame includes both the federal firearm and tax evasion convictions that Hunter was convicted of this year, experts say the scope of the pardon could go much further by extending to any actions committed for more than a decade, virtually ensuring the president's son cannot be held accountable for any activity conducted during that period.",

      "\"When I was a prosecutor, politics had nothing to do with the job,\" Gowdy said. \"I didn't know the politics of a single one of my co-workers.\" The focus, he said, should be shifted back not to \"targeting people, but targeting fact patterns.\"",
      "\"Prosecuting your political enemies, involving family members, all of this stuff is new, and all of it's really dangerous.\"",

      "Let\u2019s work through the mechanics of each one.",
      "It\u2019s tradition for a president to nominate various persons for his Cabinet, other administration positions and the judiciary. However, the Senate must confirm those figures through a roll call vote on the floor. The confirmation process usually entails formal visits with senators, background checks on nominees by the FBI or the committees of jurisdiction, hearings with the nominee and other witnesses who either support or oppose the nominee, a committee vote to discharge the nomination to the floor, debate on the floor and a final confirmation vote. This is the Senate\u2019s \"Advice and Consent\" exercise. It\u2019s a responsibility most senators take very seriously. Many passionately guard those prerogatives.",

      "For instance, incoming President Trump nominated former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., for attorney general. Gaetz met with several Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee last month. But Gaetz\u2019s selection never got to the vetting phase or even a hearing. It was clear to Gaetz \u2013 and most senators \u2013 that the nominee wasn\u2019t confirmable by the Senate. Confirmation of Gaetz would have represented the \"consent\" provision of the Constitution. However, the abrupt withdrawal of the nominee \u2013 after all of the Senate\u2019s closed-door muttering \u2013 certainly reflected \"advice.\"",
      "After Gaetz, expect lots of consternation in the coming weeks about the viability of Defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard, Health and Human Services secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy and FBI Director pick Kash Patel.",
      "This is where the concept of \"recess appointments\" could come in. If the Senate fails to confirm some of Trump\u2019s nominees, there are suggestions that Trump might try to circumvent the Senate and temporarily install these persons in those roles on an \"acting\" basis.",
      "This is the application of Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. It allows the president to \"fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate.\"",
      "A \"recess appointment\" may only serve in the role until the end of a given, two-year Congress. The Founders crafted the concept of a recess appointment so the government could have a stand-in for a period if a given office suddenly became vacant due to death or resignation. Congress was often out of session for months at a time in the early days of the republic. Transportation was tough. It was a challenge to quickly confirm replacements if the Senate wasn\u2019t meeting. So the Founders created the fail-safe of \"recess appointments.\" That way, the government wasn\u2019t hamstrung waiting on the Senate to eventually reconvene and confirm someone to an important government post.",
      "But how would a recess appointment work in the current environment? And could a president just bypass the Senate and install someone if Congress wasn\u2019t meeting? In theory, yes. And it\u2019s possible that a president could do so if a nomination is stalled or someone is unconfirmed.",
      "THOMAS MASSIE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR VOCALLY OPPOSE TRUMP'S DEA NOMINEE",
      "Trump has yet to say who he prefers to lead the GOP conference. (Reuters)",
      "However, the brutal truth is that recess appointments are becoming rare. Both Trump and President Biden had precisely zero recess appointments. President Obama had 32. The last recess appointment was Richard Griffin Jr. to the National Labor Relations Board on Jan. 4, 2012. He was part of four recess appointments by Obama on that day. Griffin and two others were placed at the NLRB. Obama also slotted Richard Cordray as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "By contrast, President George W. Bush had 171 recess appointments. President Bill Clinton scored 139.",
      "The lynchpin to the entire enterprise is whether there is in fact an appropriate \"recess\" of the Congress. Only under such a recess would the Senate reside in the proper parliamentary posture to allow for the potential of a recess appointment. It\u2019s been years now since both the House and Senate have technically abandoned Washington for more than three days. That\u2019s to guard against the chance of a recess appointment. The House and Senate used to frequently approve what\u2019s called an \"adjournment resolution.\" That granted both the House and Senate leave from Capitol Hill for extended periods \u2013 such as over the holidays, Thanksgiving, Easter and Passover, Independence Day and the \"August recess.\" But those are infrequent.",
      "This fall, both the House and Senate were \"out\" for part of September, all of October and a chunk of November. However, both bodies convened abbreviated sessions every three days. Each one lasted just a few seconds. That\u2019s de rigueur in Washington because the House and Senate can\u2019t approve an adjournment resolution. The House and Senate just don\u2019t snap their fingers and they\u2019re out. Like everything on Capitol Hill, both bodies must vote to adjourn. Democrats control the Senate. So it might not be a problem approving an adjournment resolution there. But the GOP controls the House. House Republicans would never green light an adjournment resolution, presenting the potential for Biden to make a recess appointment. So each body now meets for just a few seconds every three days to forestall recess appointments.",
      "This phenomenon reflects the power of Article I, Section 5, as neither body \"shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days.\"",
      "During his time in office, Obama believed the House and Senate were truly \"in recess\" \u2013 despite convening every three days. Frustrated at the pace of his nominations, the White House concluded that the three-day operation wasn\u2019t sufficient for the House and Senate to conclude they were \"out.\" Hence the appointment of Griffin and others during a 2012 window between sessions.",

      "But in 2014, the Supreme Court found that the Obama administration overstepped its bounds with the recess appointment. In NLRB v. Canning, the high court found that if the Senate says it\u2019s out, it\u2019s out. In other words, the executive branch of government has no authority interpreting actions of the legislative branch of government.",
      "Moreover, Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution allows each body of Congress to \"determine the Rules of its Proceedings.\" That said, for the first time in U.S. history, the Supreme Court established a length of time the House and Senate must be out for there to be a \"recess\" and the possibility of a \"recess appointment.\" In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court decided that recess appointments are permissible if the House and Senate are out for a period of at least 10 days.",
      "So let\u2019s say the Senate is struggling to confirm some of the incoming president\u2019s most-controversial nominees. Could Trump ask the House and Senate to call it quits for 10 days so he could slide a troubled nominee into place? In theory, yes. But parliamentarily, what would it take for the House and Senate to both be out of session in order to strategically create a political crevasse wide enough for a recess appointment?",
      "It\u2019s about the math.",
      "In the new year, Republicans will control the House with perhaps as few as 217 seats. One race in California still doesn\u2019t have a winner. The new Congress starts with one vacancy. The Senate will be 53-47 in favor of the GOP. Republicans really can\u2019t lose any votes toward adopting an adjournment resolution. Senate Republicans can lose up to three of their own \u2013 and have Vice President JD Vance break the tie on an adjournment resolution. But four votes? They\u2019re out of luck.",
      "Here\u2019s the challenging part:",
      "It\u2019s far from certain that both the House and Senate could ever muster the votes to approve an adjournment resolution for the sole purpose of engineering a recess appointment \u2013 or even a batch of them. Some House Republicans might balk. But the bigger issue could be Senate Republicans. Many senators simply won\u2019t forgo their responsibilities to provide advice and consent. They guard those traditions closely. Plus, they worry about establishing what some would view as a terrible precedent to allow a president to install their nominees, no matter how embattled they may be. After all, Senate Republicans would rue the day they vote to adjourn in favor of installing one of Trump\u2019s nominees \u2013 lest \"President Newsom\" or \"President Whitmer\" try the same thing in 2029.",

      "And even if the House and Senate approved an adjournment resolution of more than 10 days, exactly when would the recess fall? Congressional Republicans promise a robust agenda in 2025. When the House and Senate are out, they are out. That means nothing on the floor in both bodies for at least a week-and-a-half. No legislation on tax cuts. Nothing dealing with the debt ceiling or cutting spending. Forget about immigration policy.",
      "So the political postulate of a recess appointment is fascinating. But it\u2019s altogether something different in practice.",
      "This brings us to Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution. This is the \"thermonuclear passage\" I referred to earlier. The Constitution states that \"on extraordinary Occasions\" the President may \"convene both Houses, or either of them, and in the case of Disagreement between them with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper.\"",
      "U.S. presidents have never exercised this authority to \"adjourn\" Congress. No one knows what constitutes \"extraordinary Occasions.\" And, a lay reading of Article II, Section 3 suggests there must be a discrepancy between the House and Senate over adjourning \u2013 for the purposes of a recess appointment. In other words, the House may be able to approve the adjournment resolution \u2013 and the Senate may not or vice versa.",
      "In theory, President-elect Trump could try this gambit to adjourn Congress. But this is new constitutional turf. Yes. A recess appointment like Cordray or Griffin may find themselves in the job. But the Trump administration would inevitably find itself in front of the Supreme Court about the validity of those appointments. Just like the Obama administration.",

The plea agreement unraveled in Delaware court, however, and heightened his legal woes.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reveals how WalkON enhances walking and jogging with sensors and artificial tendons.",
      "Imagine slipping on a pair of shorts that could make walking feel like a breeze, almost as if you've instantly shed 20 pounds. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, get ready to have your mind blown! Scientists at the Technical University of Munich have cooked up something that might just change the game for anyone who's ever wished walking was a little easier.",
      "They call it the WalkON system, a pair of high-tech shorts that's not your average gym wear. These bad boys can cut down the energy you need for a stroll or jog by up to 18%! Whether you're a spring chicken or in your golden years, these shorts could be a game-changer, especially if stairs have become your nemesis or long walks leave you winded.",

      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the robotic shorts work",
      "The WalkON system combines sensors, artificial tendons and smart motors to enhance your natural walking motion. It starts with advanced sensors embedded in the shorts that continuously monitor the stress on your tendons. These sensors are incredibly precise, picking up on subtle changes in your movement, including how fast you\u2019re walking and the angle of your hips.",
      "Connected to these sensors are two thin artificial tendons that extend from your thighs to a specially designed waist belt. These tendons play a crucial role in how the system assists you. When you start to walk, the shorts analyze your gait pattern and can even detect the moment you transition from standing to walking. As each leg enters the \"swing phase,\" the system knows exactly when to kick in.",
      "At just the right moment, small but powerful motors activate and gently pull on the artificial tendons. This action helps lift your thigh, reducing the effort needed by your hip flexor muscles, making it feel much easier to move. What\u2019s really impressive is how adaptable WalkON is; whether you prefer a slow stroll or a brisk jog, the system adjusts its level of assistance based on your speed and leg weight. All of this happens seamlessly, so you experience a natural enhancement to your movement rather than feeling like you\u2019re being pushed or pulled by a machine.",

      "The WalkON system significantly reduces energy expenditure by 18% for young people walking uphill. For older individuals walking on level ground, it decreases energy expenditure by 10%. This reduction in energy expenditure is equivalent to the feeling of instantly losing 22 pounds or 13 pounds, respectively. The system allows you to walk slowly or jog, providing versatility in movement. Participants in tests reported high satisfaction with the device, giving it a mean rating of 6 out of 7 for its ability to assist while maintaining a sense of control.",

Additionally, individuals weakened by illness can find significant advantages in using WalkON to enhance their mobility and independence. Furthermore, the device is designed for those looking to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of users.",

      "WEARABLE EXOSKELETON CAN TURN YOU INTO A SUPERHUMAN ATHLETE",
      "Comparison to other exoskeletons",
      "Unlike traditional rigid exoskeletons, WalkON's soft, flexible design offers several advantages over its more cumbersome counterparts. Conventional exoskeletons often feature rigid frames that can be difficult and time-consuming to put on, limiting their practicality for daily use.",
      "In contrast, WalkON's soft robotic shorts can be put on quickly and easily, similar to regular clothing, and are more than a mechanical device. Professor Lorenzia Masia, the lead researcher, aptly compares WalkON to an electric bike for walking. This analogy highlights the system's ability to enhance natural movement without overpowering it, making mobility more accessible and appealing to a wider range of users. The lightweight, tendon-driven design of WalkON allows for a more natural range of motion, adapting to the user's movements rather than constraining them.",
      "Furthermore, WalkON's compact and unobtrusive nature addresses a common concern with exoskeletons: social acceptance. Its design allows it to be worn discreetly under regular clothing, potentially increasing user comfort in social situations. This feature, combined with its efficiency in reducing metabolic cost, positions WalkON as a more practical solution for everyday use compared to bulkier exoskeleton systems.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Availability and cost",
      "Given the current stage of development and testing, it's likely that WalkON could be available to you within the next three to five years, pending further research and regulatory approvals.",
      "While no exact price point is yet available, we can compare it to other assistive technologies. Current exoskeletons can cost anywhere from $40,000 to $100,000-plus. However, given WalkON's simpler design and intended widespread use, it's possible that it could be priced more affordably, perhaps in the range of $5,000 to $15,000 when it first hits the market. As with many technologies, the price could decrease over time as production scales up.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The WalkON system's potential to enhance mobility for people of all ages, particularly older adults and those with health challenges, is immense. By making movement easier and more efficient, WalkON could encourage more active lifestyles, potentially improving overall health and quality of life for many individuals. While questions about availability and cost remain, the development of WalkON is a promising sign that we're moving towards more accessible and user-friendly mobility assistance solutions.",

These documents mainly consisted of background checks but also included court records, vehicle ownership details such as license plates and VINs, and property ownership reports. The background checks alone revealed highly sensitive personal data, including full names, home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, employment details, information about family members, social media accounts and criminal histories.",
      "The worst part is that the database was left publicly accessible without password protection or encryption, allowing anyone to grab it. Anyone with the link could view and download the files.

The company operates a sprawling network of around 16 websites, including Propertyrec, which advertises real estate ownership data and property records. However, SL Data Services\u2019 business goes far beyond property records, offering services like criminal background checks, DMV records and even birth and death records.",

      "For one, attackers could use this info to run phishing scams or social engineering tricks. If they know details like your job, family or even criminal history, they can send super convincing messages to trick you into sharing even more sensitive details, like your financial info. That\u2019s not all. Criminals could also use this leaked data to impersonate someone and apply for loans, credit cards or other services in their name.",
      "What really gets me, though, is that most people whose info got leaked probably won\u2019t even find out about it unless they\u2019re using a service to remove their data. A lot of them might not have even known they were being background-checked in the first place.

      "1) Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can promise to completely erase your data from the internet, using a data removal service is one of the best steps you can take. They do the heavy lifting by actively scanning and removing your personal information from hundreds of websites. This helps protect you from scammers who may cross-reference data from breaches with other information they find on the dark web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With your address exposed, bad actors could try to scam you through physical mail. They may impersonate companies or people you trust and send fake urgent letters about things like missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Be skeptical of unexpected communications and verify any claims before taking action.",
      "3) Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: The leaked data could lead to phishing attacks via email, phone calls or messages from unknown sources. Be on high alert for any requests for personal information, especially if they seem urgent or ask you to click on suspicious links. Always verify the legitimacy of any request before responding.",
      "To protect your devices from malicious links, make sure you have strong antivirus protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, it\u2019s crucial to start regularly reviewing your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts. Keep an eye out for any unauthorized transactions and report them immediately to your bank or credit card company to prevent further damage.",
      "5) Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex passwords for each of your online accounts and consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them securely.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement this extra layer of security on all accounts that offer it to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "7) Regularly update your software: Keep your operating system, apps and security tools\u00a0up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s alarming how many companies profit from collecting personal data, yet fail to protect it adequately. Recent breaches, including one exposing the sensitive information of 600,000 Americans, highlight this negligence. With unprotected databases containing everything from criminal records to addresses, cybercriminals have a treasure trove of information to exploit. This situation underscores the urgent need for you to take proactive steps to safeguard your privacy and demand better security practices from these data aggregators.",

    "story": [
      "Scammers are preying on society's most vulnerable members.",
      "Scammers have various methods when it comes to getting their hands on your phone number. You might think, \"Well, what's the big deal? Isn't it easy to find someone's number these days, no matter what?\" Yes. And if you've already had your fair share of telemarketers call you, maybe you feel like you've got it under control.",
      "The problem is that scammers with the right knowledge and the wrong intentions can wreak havoc just by having your phone number in their possession.",
      "Once they do, they can use it to trick you in all sorts of ways.",
      "The good news is that by familiarizing yourself with their tactics, you can be one step closer to preventing yourself from falling victim to them. Here's what you need to know.",

      "9 ways you can get scammed if your phone number falls into the wrong hands",
      "In today\u2019s digital age, your phone number is more than just a way for friends and family to reach you. It can be a gateway for scammers to access your personal information and wreak havoc on your life. From\u00a0phishing attempts to extortion, the risks are numerous and varied. Here are nine ways scammers can exploit your phone number if it falls into the wrong hands:",
      "Scammers can also use your phone number to launch rather easy\u00a0phishing attacks. They might send text messages or make calls posing as your bank or a popular online service that you subscribe to. The goal is to call you and trick you into providing login credentials, credit card details or other personal information, which they can then use for fraudulent activities. And once they have all your other information, they can do a lot more damage just by having your phone number as that initial segue.",
      "In some cases, scammers use your phone number for extortion or blackmail. They may claim to have compromising information about you and demand payment to keep it private. By contacting you directly, they can apply continuous pressure, making their threats seem more real and immediate.",
      "One unique way they do this to target elderly people is by pretending to be your grandchild or another relative in distress. The scammer often claims that your grandchild is in an emergency situation \u2014 such as needing bail money or medical assistance \u2014 and urgently requests financial help. With AI voice cloning technology, they may even be able to use your grandchild's voice. This emotional manipulation usually gets the victim to pay up.",
      "This one may not be as dramatic, but your phone number can be sold to\u00a0robocall and spam message services. These automated systems bombard you with unwanted calls and texts, often promoting scams or fraudulent products. While these may seem like minor annoyances, they can lead to bigger scams if you engage with the messages or follow their instructions. Hang up on them.",
      "HOW TO STOP ANNOYING ROBOCALLS",
      "Illustration of a scammer with cash in his hand\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone number spoofing is a common tactic where scammers disguise their caller ID to appear as a trusted contact by calling from what appears to be a familiar number as it may have the same area code where you live, an area code where your friends or family live or even the actual phone number of someone close which you can recognize.",
      "This makes it more likely that you'll answer the call, giving them the opportunity to deceive you into revealing personal information or transferring money. This is, of course, the case when phone spoofing is used against you. But in situations where they use YOUR phone number, they can be scamming those close to you without you even knowing!",
      "With these phone spoofing tactics, scammers can use your phone number to\u00a0impersonate government officials, such as IRS agents or Social Security administrators. They may call you claiming there\u2019s an urgent issue, like unpaid taxes or suspicious activity involving your Social Security number. This ploy often involves threats of legal action or arrest to pressure you into providing sensitive information or making immediate payments.",
      "Instead of pretending to be from a government agency, another trick is for scammers to try their luck by posing as a representative from a utility company, like an electric or water company. Scammers will claim that you have an overdue invoice and threaten to cut off your service unless you pay immediately. Using your phone number, they can contact you repeatedly, making the scam seem more legitimate (and pressing).",
      "SIM swapping or a\u00a0port-out scam is when scammers transfer your phone number to a new SIM card in their possession. By convincing your mobile carrier to reroute your number, they can receive all your calls and messages, including those containing two-factor authentication codes. This allows them to bypass security measures and take over your online accounts.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "With SIM swapping techniques/port-out, scammers can also use your phone number as a key to access sensitive data stored in your online accounts. By initiating password resets and intercepting verification codes sent via SMS, they can gain unauthorized access to your email, social media and banking accounts, leading to significant personal and financial damage.",
      "Finally, scammers can use all the tactics above to not only access the accounts you already have but also create fake online accounts in your name. These accounts can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as spreading malware, launching further scams or conducting identity theft. The presence of your phone number makes these accounts appear more legitimate, increasing the chances of deceiving others.",

      "How to protect yourself from these scams",
      "To protect your phone number from falling into the hands of scammers, here\u2019s what you can do:",
      "1. Be cautious about sharing your phone number publicly: Avoid posting your phone number on public forums, websites or social media platforms where it can be easily accessed by scammers.",
      "2. Limit exposure of your phone number on social media and other online platforms:\u00a0Use privacy settings to restrict who can see your contact information. Most social media platforms and online services offer privacy settings that allow you to control who can view your personal information. Make sure to review and adjust these settings regularly. Only share your phone number with trusted contacts.",
      "3. Consider using a secondary number for online registrations and transactions:\u00a0Services like Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts regularly for unusual activity: Check your bank accounts, email and other online accounts for any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious activity.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Use two-factor authentication apps instead of SMS-based verification where possible:\u00a0Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security that is more difficult for scammers to bypass compared to SMS-based verification.",
      "7. Use an identity theft protection service: Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with the information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "An increasing number of companies are using artificial intelligence (AI) for everyday tasks.\u00a0Much of the technology is helping with productivity and keeping the public safer. However, some industries are pushing back against certain aspects of AI. And some industry leaders are working to balance the good and the bad.",
      "\"We are looking at critical infrastructure owners and operators, businesses from water and health care and transportation and communication, some of which are starting to integrate some of these AI capabilities,\" said U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly. \"We want to make sure that they're integrating them in a way where they are not introducing a lot of new risk.\"",
      "US AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY TESTS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: 'A LOT OF POTENTIAL'",
      "Consulting firm Deloitte recently surveyed leaders of business organizations from around the world. The findings showed uncertainty over government regulations was a bigger issue than actually implementing AI technology. When asked about the top barrier to deploying AI tools, 36% ranked regulatory compliance first, 30% said difficulty managing risks, and 29% said lack of a governance model.",
      "Easterly says despite some of the risks AI can pose, she said she is not surprised that the government has not taken more steps to regulate the technology.",
      "\"These are going to be the most powerful technologies of our century, probably more,\" Easterly said. \"Most of these technologies are being built by private companies that are incentivized to provide returns for their shareholders. So we do need to ensure that government has a role in establishing safeguards to ensure that these technologies are being built in a way that prioritizes security. And that's where I think that Congress can have a role in ensuring that these technologies are as safe and secure to be used and implemented by the American people.\"",
      "An increasing number of companies are using AI for everyday tasks. (iStock)",
      "Congress has considered overarching protections for AI, but it has mostly been state governments enacting the rules.",

      "The Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security Act, or ELVIS Act, classifies vocal likeness as a property right. Lee signed the legislation this year, making Tennessee the first state to enact protections for singers. Illinois and California have since passed similar laws. Other states, including Tennessee, have laws that determine names, photographs and likenesses are also considered a property right.",
      "\"Our voices and likenesses are indelible parts of us that have enabled us to showcase our talents and grow our audiences, not mere digital kibble for a machine to duplicate without consent,\" country recording artist Lainey Wilson said during a congressional hearing on AI and intellectual property.",

      "\"For decades, we have taken advantage of technology that, frankly, was not created to be secure. It was created for speed to market or cool features. And frankly, that's why we have cybersecurity,\" Easterly said.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has cracked down on some deceptive AI marketing techniques. It launched \"Operation AI Comply\" in September, which tackles unfair and deceptive business practices using AI, such as fake reviews written by chatbots.",
      "\"I am a technologist at heart, and I am an optimist at heart. And so I am incredibly excited about some of these capabilities. And I am not concerned about some of the Skynet things. I do want to make sure that this technology is designed and developed and tested and delivered in a way to ensure that security is prioritized,\" Easterly said.",

It comes as one study finds, OpenAI\u2019s chatbot outperformed doctors in diagnosing medical conditions. The experiment compared doctors using ChatGPT with those using conventional resources. Both groups scored around 75% accuracy, while the chatbot alone scored above 90%.",
      "AI isn\u2019t just being used for disease detection, it\u2019s also helping emergency crews detect catastrophic events.

This massive thermokarst depression \u2013 a fancy term for a giant permafrost-thaw sinkhole \u2013 is growing at an astonishing rate of 35 million cubic feet each year. To put that into perspective, it's like carving out a small town's worth of earth annually. Currently stretching about 0.6 miles long and 0.5 miles wide at its widest point, this behemoth shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, it's speeding up, driven by a vicious cycle of warming temperatures and melting ice. This study was published in the\u00a0journal Geomorphology.",

When this frozen soil thaws, it can't support the weight above it, leading to collapse and the formation of these massive \"slumps.\" The Batagaika crater is a prime example of this process in overdrive. As the permafrost melts, it exposes more soil to sunlight, which then melts more permafrost. It's a feedback loop that's difficult to break, especially in our warming world.",

The steep walls of this mega-slump reveal permafrost layers estimated to be 650,000 years old. That's older than our species. But with ancient ice comes ancient dangers. Scientists have already revived a 48,500-year-old \"zombie virus\" from Arctic permafrost, and there's concern about what other long-dormant pathogens might be awakening.

As our planet continues to warm, more of these massive permafrost thaw features are likely to appear. While some might see the crater as a tourist attraction \u2013 and indeed it has become one \u2013 it's crucial to recognize it as a warning sign. The \"Gateway to Hell\" is more than just a catchy nickname; it's a portal into a possible future where rapid environmental changes reshape our world in ways we're only beginning to understand. The question remains: Will we heed the warning signs and take action, or will we continue to watch as more gateways open across our warming world?",

      "The most common Amazon impersonation scams",
      "Amazon is the world\u2019s largest e-commerce platform, and it becomes even more relevant during the holiday season. With so many of us hunting for deals, scammers are well aware and ready to take advantage. They often use impersonation scams to trick shoppers into handing over card details or other sensitive information.",
      "\"During the 2023 holiday shopping season (Black Friday through Christmas Day), the most commonly reported impersonation scam by Amazon customers involved fake order or shipping confirmations claiming that payment was required in the U.S. There was nearly a 1.5x increase in reports of this scam from three weeks prior,\" Knapp said.",

I asked Knapp a bunch of questions about how the e-tail giant is staying ahead of the latest online holiday scams, and you can read his responses below.",

      "\"More than 60% of sales in Amazon\u2019s store are from independent sellers\u2014most of which are small and medium-sized businesses\u2014providing a vast selection of amazing products, competitive prices, and convenience for consumers. When customers shop in the Amazon store, they can do so with peace of mind knowing that we stand behind the products sold in our store with the\u00a0A-to-Z Guarantee.",

Amazon will never ask for your password, payment or bank transfer through phone, email or any external website. Scammers might reference a purchase (real or fake), a giveaway, a prize or claim that \"your account is locked,\" urging you to click a link, make a payment or buy a gift card.",
      "2. Verify the email: For any questions related to an order, always check your order history on Amazon.com or via the \"Amazon Shopping\" app. Only legitimate purchases will appear in your order history. If you are ever unsure about the legitimacy of an email, go to Amazon\u2019s website or app to access the Message Center and review authentic communications.",

      "4. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" offers: Scammers often lure victims with irresistible deals, such as huge discounts on popular products or \"exclusive\" offers. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. These offers might be tied to fake websites or phishing attempts designed to steal your personal and financial details. Always double-check the legitimacy of any deal before making a purchase. If you\u2019re unsure, visit the official Amazon site or app to search for the product and compare prices.",
      "5. Use a personal data removal service: Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",

      "6. Report suspicious activity: If you encounter an impersonation scam, your best course of action is to report it to Amazon. Knapp says,\u00a0\"The more consumers report scams to us, the better our tools get at identifying bad actors so that we can take action against them and protect consumers. If consumers suspect that they have encountered a scam, they can report suspicious communications to us at amazon.com/ReportAScam, so that we can protect their accounts and refer bad actors to law enforcement to help keep consumers safe.\"",

      "Many of us use Spotify every day, whether to listen to songs, podcasts or audiobooks. Some of us create playlists of our favorite songs, while others save playlists made by others.",
      "In case you didn\u2019t know, Spotify allows you to create public playlists that anyone can save and listen to. You\u2019d think this is a harmless feature, but spammers have found a way to misuse it.",

      "Image of Spotify app on phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Spotify scam works",
      "As reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer, this scam works by misusing Spotify\u2019s popularity and trustworthiness. Scammers exploit Spotify playlists by injecting targeted keywords, such as \"free download,\" \"crack\" or \"warez,\" into titles and descriptions.",
      "These keywords are designed to align with popular search terms. Since Spotify\u2019s web player pages are indexed by search engines like Google, these spammy results appear in user searches, driving traffic to their links. For example, a Spotify playlist titled \"Sony Vegas Pro 13 Crack\u2026\" was found promoting \"free\" software sites in its title and description, directing users to questionable external links.",
      "The scam isn\u2019t limited to playlists. It extends to podcasts as well. Scammers create podcasts with multiple short episodes, typically under 20 seconds, using synthesized speech to direct listeners to click links in the description for free content. These podcasts often target users searching for pirated ebooks, audiobooks or game cheats. While the content may appear legitimate at first glance, clicking on the links often results in being redirected to unsafe pages that further exploit users.",

      "The end goal",
      "The main goal of this scam is to use Spotify\u2019s trusted reputation and search engine visibility to get people to click on shady links and visit sketchy websites. Scammers make money through fake ad clicks, bogus surveys and affiliate links, while also spreading malware by tricking users into downloading harmful software or extensions.",
      "They also try to steal personal info through fake sign-up forms or phishing pages, which can lead to identity theft or be sold to others. By using Spotify\u2019s indexed pages, they boost the search rankings of their spam sites, reaching more people. Some of these sites even run extra scams like fake crypto giveaways or phishing attempts to grab even more money or data from unsuspecting users.",

      "1. Avoid clicking on suspicious links: Be cautious when you come across playlists or podcasts with titles like \"Sony Vegas Pro 13 Crack\" or other promises of free software, audiobooks or game cheats. These often include links in the description that redirect to unsafe sites hosting malware, adware or phishing pages.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "2. Stick to official sources: Always download software, eBooks or other digital content from trusted official websites or reputable platforms. If you see a Spotify playlist or podcast offering \"free\" versions of paid content, it\u2019s likely a scam. Cross-check the legitimacy of the content through known channels instead of relying on unverified links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex and unique passwords for your Spotify account and avoid using personal information like birthdays or pet names. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Be skeptical of synthesized speech and short episodes: Many scam podcasts feature short episodes (10-20 seconds) with synthesized speech directing you to click on a link in the description. These are a common tactic used to trick users into visiting unsafe pages. If the content feels automated, vague or overly promotional, it\u2019s best to avoid it.",
      "5. Verify curator credentials: Check the credentials of playlist curators. Legitimate curators usually have a verifiable online presence. If you can't find any information about them, it's best to avoid engaging with them.",
      "6. Recognize phishing attempts: Be cautious of emails claiming to be from Spotify that ask you to confirm account details or click on suspicious links. These are often phishing attempts designed to steal your credentials.",
      "7. Report and block suspicious content: If you come across playlists or podcasts that seem fraudulent or inappropriate,\u00a0report them directly to Spotify. Use Spotify\u2019s reporting tools to flag content that violates its platform rules. Blocking suspicious accounts or playlists also ensures you won\u2019t accidentally interact with them in the future, and reporting helps Spotify improve its filtering and moderation systems.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers will use any means possible to trick you. In the past, we\u2019ve seen bad actors weaponize\u00a0Google search results with malicious websites that install malware when links are clicked on. There have also been plenty of\u00a0SEO scams targeting users. Companies like Spotify need to implement measures to prevent their platforms from being misused by scammers. Google also has a responsibility to ensure the quality of its search results. Just because a webpage comes from a well-known organization doesn\u2019t mean it deserves to rank highly on the search results pages.",

      "Kurt Knutsson delves into his top four ways of spotting holiday scams as Americans begin their Christmas and New Year\u2019s shopping.",
      "With the holiday season just around the corner, many of us are gearing up to spread some cheer with gift cards.",
      "However, it\u2019s important to remember that these convenient gifts are also a favorite target for scammers. We're going to break down six sneaky gift card tricks that could leave you out of pocket during this time of year.",
      "Don\u2019t worry, though. We\u2019ve got your back with solid tips on how to outsmart these scammers and keep your hard-earned cash safe.",

      "1. Display rack gift card trick",
      "One of the latest gift card tricks involves tampering with the gift cards on the display racks at retail stores. Scammers will record the activation code on the card or place a custom barcode sticker over the real barcode, which allows them to secretly load the cash onto their own card immediately after you purchase the gift card. This means that when you or your recipient try to use the gift card, it will be empty or invalid.",
      "Check the packaging of the gift card before buying it. Look for signs of tampering, such as the wrapping being torn or resealed or stickers placed over the barcode or card number. Also, choose a card from the back of the rack, as scammers often place their fraudulent cards at the front of the display.",

      "2. Impersonation gift card trick",
      "Another common gift card trick scammers use involves impersonating someone you know or trust, such as a family member, a romantic interest, a company or the government. Scammers will contact you by phone, text, email or social media and create a fake story or emergency that requires you to send them money urgently.",
      "They will ask you to buy a gift card or multiple gift cards and then send them a photo of the card or the numbers on the back of the card. Once they have the gift card information, they will disappear with your money and cut off contact.",
      "Never send money or gift cards to anyone you don\u2019t know personally or haven\u2019t met in person. If someone claims to be someone you know or trust, verify their identity by contacting them directly through a different channel.",
      "Don\u2019t trust caller ID, as scammers can spoof phone numbers. Don\u2019t be pressured by threats or promises, as scammers use emotional manipulation to get you to act quickly and without thinking. And remember, no legitimate company or government agency will ever ask you to pay them with a gift card.",

      "3. Resale gift card trick",
      "Another gift card trick involves buying or selling gift cards on online platforms, such as websites, apps or social media groups. Scammers will offer to sell you gift cards at a discounted price or buy your unwanted gift cards for cash.",
      "However, they will either send you a fake or empty gift card or take your gift card information and money without sending you anything in return. They may also use stolen credit cards or hacked accounts to buy or sell gift cards, which can put you at risk of fraud or identity theft.",
      "Only buy or sell gift cards from reputable sources, such as official retailers, authorized resellers or trusted friends and family. Avoid buying or selling gift cards from strangers online, especially if they offer a deal that sounds too good to be true.",
      "Don\u2019t share your gift card information or personal details with anyone you don\u2019t know or trust. And use a secure payment method that offers protection, such as a credit card or PayPal, instead of a gift card, wire transfer or cash.",

      "4. Phishing gift card trick",
      "A very popular gift card trick this holiday season\u00a0involves phishing, which is a type of online fraud that tries to trick you into revealing your personal or financial information. Scammers will send you an email, text or pop-up message that looks like it comes from a legitimate company, such as a retailer, bank or\u00a0tech support service.",
      "They will claim that there is a problem with your account, your order, your device or your security and that you need to verify your identity, update your information or fix an issue. They will then ask you to click on a link, open an attachment or call a number and then request that you pay them with a gift card or provide them with your gift card information.",
      "Never click on links, open attachments or call numbers from unsolicited messages, as they may lead to fake or malicious websites or software. Don\u2019t provide any personal or financial information, such as your passwords, PINs, account numbers or gift card numbers, to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.",
      "Don\u2019t trust messages that create a sense of urgency, pressure or fear, as they are designed to make you act without thinking. If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a message, contact the company directly using a verified website, phone number or email address.",
      "Using antivirus protection will help to protect you against scammers and hackers who try to steal your money and personal information using gift card tricks, especially\u00a0through phishing. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on any malicious links, fake websites, phishing emails and text messages is to have strong\u00a0antivirus protection installed and actively running on all your devices. It\u2019s the best to help stop and alert you of any malware in your system and ultimately protect you from being hacked.",

      "A person purchasing a gift card online (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5. Loyalty program gift card trick",
      "This gift card trick involves loyalty programs, which are rewards programs that offer you points, discounts or freebies for being a loyal customer. Scammers will pretend to be representatives of a loyalty program that you are a member of or that you are eligible to join.",
      "They will tell you that you have won a prize, sweepstakes or a promotion and that you need to pay a fee, a tax or a shipping cost to claim it. They will then ask you to pay them with a gift card or provide them with your gift card information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Be wary of any unsolicited offers or notifications that claim that you have won something, especially if you don\u2019t remember entering or signing up for anything. Don\u2019t pay any money or fees to receive a prize, as legitimate loyalty programs will never ask you to do that. Don\u2019t provide any personal or financial information, such as your passwords, account numbers or gift card numbers, to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.",
      "Don\u2019t trust messages that create a sense of excitement, curiosity or greed, as they are designed to make you act impulsively. If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a message, contact the loyalty program directly using a verified website, phone number or email address.",
      "A person purchasing a gift card online (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6. Fake balance checker scam",
      "In this scam, fraudsters set up fake websites or phone services that claim to check the balance of your gift cards. Victims are lured into providing their gift card numbers and PINs under the guise of verifying their balance. Once the information is entered, scammers can drain the funds from the card almost immediately.",
      "To avoid this scam, always use official websites or apps from reputable retailers to check your gift card balance. Be wary of unsolicited calls or messages asking for your gift card information, especially if they claim to be from a legitimate company. It is important never to enter your gift card details on unfamiliar websites.",

      "Saying Penny didn't see the humanity in Neely unfairly invoked race, according to his defense, and combined with the other language, it would make it impossible to get a fair trial. The judge denied that earlier motion to declare a mistrial.",

      "\"What Danny did was not textbook,\" he said. \"He applied what he learned as a Marine in a less aggressive manner \u2026 because the softer side of Danny informed him to apply something less than a textbook Marine blood choke, by choosing not to squeeze Neely to unconsciousness.\"",

Neely had schizophrenia and a severe case of paranoia and psychosis, he said. The former Michael Jackson impersonator hallucinated conversations with the late rapper Tupac Shakur and thought he heard the devil's voice.

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 14:30:56 -0500",
    "summary": "In southern Lebanon, Israeli forces confront entrenched Hezbollah positions and question UNIFIL\u2019s ability to enforce its mandate even before the cease-fire agreement was drawn up.",
    "story": [
      "Israel says Hezbollah terrorists are firing rockets into the country close to UN peacekeeping forces. (Video: IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "As Israel and Hezbollah implemented a fragile cease-fire deal, questions are resurfacing about United Nations (U.N.) peacekeepers' failure to enforce U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 and whether its continued presence will continue to favor the Iran-backed terror group.",
      "The cease-fire, brokered by the U.S. and France, took effect on Nov. 27 and aims to halt over a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Under its terms, Hezbollah is required to withdraw north of the Litani River, and Israeli forces will pull back from southern Lebanon within 60 days. The agreement marks a significant step but faces immediate challenges, with both sides accusing the other of violations. Against this backdrop, the role of the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) is facing renewed scrutiny.",
      "On Monday, Hezbollah launched two projectiles at Mount Dov, alleging Israeli cease-fire violations. Responding to the launches, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in Hebrew on X: \"Hezbollah\u2019s fire toward Mount Dov constitutes a serious violation of the cease-fire, and Israel will respond forcefully. We are determined to continue enforcing the cease-fire and to respond to any violation by Hezbollah-whether minor or severe.\"",
      "The cease-fire agreement is being implemented under a five-nation monitoring committee led by the U.S. to oversee the de-escalation process - an arrangement that U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein has referred to as a \"game-changer\" in addressing longstanding limitations.",

      "Javed Ali, a former U.S. counterterrorism official and an associate professor at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, highlighted UNIFIL\u2019s challenges in enforcing U.N. Security Council resolution 1701. \"The same issues are likely to manifest again under the revised UNSCR 1701, although in this current iteration, both the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL will be charged with overseeing the implementation of the resolution and ensuring that Hezbollah is unable to violate its terms or rebuild an operational infrastructure south of the Litani River that could once again threaten Israel.\"",
      "Ali also pointed to historical U.N. peacekeeping failures, such as those in Somalia, Rwanda and the Balkans, as cautionary examples. \"In decades past, there are other examples of the limitations of U.N. peacekeeping elements to prevent either the outbreak or dramatic escalation of armed conflict between combatants in similarly small countries with complex ethnic, tribal, or religious divisions.\"",
      "A UNIFIL patrol drives past the wreckage of a car that was targeted in an Israeli strike early on March 2, 2024, near the southern Lebanese town of Naqoura. (AFP via Getty Images)",
      "A documentary filmed in the southern Lebanon village of Houla a few weeks prior to the cease-fire captured Israeli reserve soldiers as they moved cautiously from house to house, clearing each room as they advanced through a Hezbollah stronghold. Gunfire erupted suddenly, forcing the troops to take cover as Hezbollah terrorists fired at them from nearby homes. The exchange intensified, with bullets cutting through the air, when an unexpected sight left the soldiers stunned: a UNIFIL convoy driving directly into the firefight.",
      "The white U.N. vehicle crossed the road separating the Israeli soldiers from Hezbollah fighters, coming to a halt amid the smoke and chaos. A UNIFIL peacekeeper stepped out, seemingly oblivious to the life-threatening battle unfolding around him. \"It was a total surprise. The IDF soldiers were shocked,\" said Itai Anghel, an Israeli journalist embedded with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). \"The timing of the convoy\u2019s arrival, as well as its route, made the soldiers suspect coordination with Hezbollah.\"",

      "Anghel, a veteran war reporter for the Israeli TV program \"Uvda,\" described the bizarre scene. \"This was not my first time in Houla. I documented the battle here during the Second Lebanon War 18 years ago, but this time, it was worse,\" he said. \"Every second or third house in the village was packed with weapons - RPGs, rockets, tunnels - all aimed at storming Israeli villages just a few kilometers away.\"",
      "As the battle raged, Anghel witnessed the soldiers\u2019 frustrations with UNIFIL\u2019s presence. \"They don\u2019t trust them,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"One soldier even told me, \u2018If we leave these villages for UNIFIL to manage, it will all revert to how it was before - nothing will change.\u2019\"",
      "An IDF official told Fox News Digital that during the 14 months of fighting in South Lebanon, \"We\u2019ve seen Hezbollah use U.N. convoys to get close to the border - a Hezbollah car just entered the convoy and tagged along with them to safely gather intelligence. Cameras operated by Hezbollah have even been found on the fences of UNIFIL facilities. In one case, we discovered a massive tunnel just a few meters from a UNIFIL base. Think of the noise and effort required to dig a tunnel in stone - it\u2019s impossible they didn\u2019t know.\"",
      "A former special unit IDF fighter, who asked to stay anonymous, described what he witnessed during his service in southern Lebanon. \"We\u2019d see UNIFIL on one side and Hezbollah just meters away on the other,\" he said. \"Over time, Hezbollah became bolder, setting up tents right on the border. Everyone played the game - they knew Hezbollah was there, walking freely among them. And nothing was done.\"",
      "UNIFIL responded to the criticism by emphasizing its limited mandate. \"The implementation of Resolution 1701 is the responsibility of the parties, Lebanon and Israel,\" Andrea Teneti, a UNIFIL spokesperson, said. \"UNIFIL supports the parties\u2019 implementation, monitors, and reports on violations. We do not have the mandate to enforce the resolution, nor to disarm Hezbollah by force.\"",
      "The spokesperson pointed to the unprecedented period of stability from 2006 to 2023 as evidence of UNIFIL\u2019s contributions, despite both parties failing to implement their obligations. UNIFIL acknowledged that the proliferation of weapons outside state control in southern Lebanon remains a violation of Resolution 1701, adding, \"The removal of unauthorized weapons can only be achieved through the full implementation of Resolution 1701. There is no military solution.\"",

      "\"Since UNSCR 1701\u2019s implementation, Hezbollah has successfully circumvented nearly all its conditions,\" Ali told Fox New Digital, adding \"By doing so, the group was able to create fortified bunkers, weapons caches, command posts for mobile fighting squads, and firing positions for rockets, mortars, and other projectiles used to attack Israeli civilian and military targets - which increased exponentially in the aftermath of October 7, 2023. By all accounts, UNIFIL did little to prevent this operational buildup or prevent the escalation in Hezbollah attacks after October 7.\"",
      "Following Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Hezbollah opened another front in the war along the northern border, launching hundreds of rockets, anti-tank missiles and UAVs into Israeli territory. Alarmingly, many of these attacks originated near UNIFIL bases. \"Over 430 Hezbollah projectiles have landed in and around UNIFIL outposts,\" an IDF military official reported. \"Yet the U.N. has only twice named Hezbollah explicitly as responsible for these attacks.\"",
      "\"The actions of both the IDF and Hezbollah are putting peacekeepers in danger, whether through crossfire or deliberate acts\", said Teneti. \"We name a party only when we are sure about the source of fire impacting the mission and Hezbollah has been mentioned several times as responsible for some of those attacks.\"",
      "The IDF has provided Fox News Digital with further evidence of Hezbollah\u2019s violations, including fortified positions and training centers. In one instance, a Hezbollah facility packed with weapons and attack plans was discovered just 200 meters from a UNIFIL base. \"You had to walk past the facility to even reach the U.N. base,\" an IDF officer noted.",
      "The IDF said its \"soldiers are continuing to conduct limited, localized, targeted raids in southern Lebanon, eliminating Hezbollah terrorists and dismantling terror infrastructure and weapons stockpiles both above and below ground.\" (IDF spokesman's unit)",
      "Michael, a former Danish soldier who served with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, reflected on his time in southern Lebanon. \"Hezbollah controlled all the areas we were supposed to monitor,\" he told the Danish newspaper BT. \"We couldn\u2019t operate at night out of fear, and taking photos was prohibited. Despite daily reports of violations, nothing happened.\"",
      "As more violations of the cease-fire are reported, Israeli officials are concerned that Hezbollah\u2019s continued presence in southern Lebanon will lead to renewed violence, while UNIFIL insists its role is limited to monitoring and reporting.",

      "Experts believe that for now, the ceasefire has provided a momentary reprieve, but whether it can hold remains uncertain. With Hezbollah entrenched and Israel skeptical of UNIFIL\u2019s efficacy, the peacekeeping mission\u2019s role is more critical - and contested - than ever.",

The quantities of materials on the African continent and the potential they represent for the global economy are astounding. This represents [an] unfathomable potential for establishing industries on the continent, not only to counterweight the Chinese economy, but to lock in a future market for all the top brands of EU and U.S. businesses.

      "Here is a breakdown of the plan's key elements as laid out in the report and how they are supposedly connected.",
      "Sowing doubt about Brazil\u2019s voting system",
      "Police allege that efforts to disseminate fake news about Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system began in 2019, Bolsonaro\u2019s first year in office, but were conducted more strategically and intensively as his 2022 reelection bid drew near.",
      "Police say so-called \"digital militias\" comprised of thousands of social media accounts linked to pro-Bolsonaro propaganda, as well as other prominent right-wing influencers and politicians, spread propaganda claiming the voting system could be tampered with. Bolsonaro also openly expressed admiration for Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship (1964-1985), which he claimed saved the country from communism.",
      "The narrative of an impending illegitimate election defeat helped Bolsonaro rally tens of thousands of supporters to multiple street demonstrations and also muster many to set up camp outside military barracks and headquarters to pressure leaders.",
      "Three months before the election, Bolsonaro invited dozens of diplomats to the presidential palace for a nationally televised meeting in which he presented supposed vulnerabilities of the voting system, without providing any evidence.",
      "Following Bolsonaro\u2019s loss in 2022 to leftist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro's Liberal Party questioned results at the country's top electoral court, arguing voting devices made in specific years could have permitted fraud. The electoral court swiftly dismissed the claims.",
      "\"They spread false studies on the vulnerabilities of the electronic voting machines through the Liberal Party, in an attempt to create a factual basis for a presidential decree\" that would set the coup in motion, the report says.",
      "A draft decree to set the coup in motion",
      "In January 2023, Brazilian police found a draft decree in the home of Bolsonaro\u2019s former justice minister Anderson Torres. It was one of many versions drafted either at the far-right leader's behest or with his knowledge, police say. The former president presented the document, unsigned, to the commanders of the three divisions of the armed forces on Dec. 7, seeking their support.",
      "Investigators say the draft decree shows Bolsonaro and his allies sought to create a committee to probe alleged fraud and crimes in the October 2022 vote, so they could later suspend the powers of the nation\u2019s top electoral court and possibly convene a new election.",
      "The navy\u2019s commander was ready to comply with the decree, but army and air force leaders objected to any plan that would prevent Lula's inauguration, the report said. Those refusals are why the plan did not go ahead, according to witnesses who spoke to investigators.",
      "Many legal experts including say evidence that former president presented the draft to military leaders and supported for different versions of the document are very damaging.",
      "\"(The goal) was to unduly intervene in elections,\" said Luiz Henrique Machado, a law professor at the IDP university in the capital Brasilia. \"In Brazil, it is the electoral prosecutors' office and the top electoral court that have the final word about electoral legislation.\"",
      "In an interview with website UOL published Thursday, Bolsonaro said he discussed with military leaders moves including decreeing a state of emergency and other exceptional measures that would have suspended the rule of law for the public good. He said such measures are provided for by the constitution, so there is nothing unseemly about evaluating those options.",
      "\"What is being said is absurd. For my part, there has never been any discussion of a coup,\" Bolsonaro told journalists in Brasilia on Monday.",
      "Plan to assassinate the president-elect",
      "On Nov. 19, Brazil's Federal Police arrested four army special operations officers and a federal police officer accused of plotting in 2022 to assassinate Lula, vice-president-elect Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The arrested men were all mentioned in a police report that was unsealed later.",
      "The assassination plan sought to leave Bolsonaro's ticket as the only remaining valid one in the 2022 runoff, police say. As for de Moraes, he led a five-year probe into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led some far-right allies and supporters being barred from social media and even imprisoned. In early 2023, he presided over the nation\u2019s top electoral court when it declared Bolsonaro ineligible for office until 2030 over abuse of power related to a meeting he convened with foreign ambassadors to spread lies about the voting system.",
      "Gen. Walter Braga Netto, Bolsonaro\u2019s 2022 running mate and former defense minister, greenlit the assassination plan at a meeting with the plotters inside his home, investigators added. Federal Police portray the retired general as one of the plot's leaders, also involved in pressuring military leaders to sign onto the coup.",
      "Braga Netto said in a statement on Tuesday that he never plotted a coup. He added that several of the documents seized from one of his aides, including \"writings, drafts and media reports\" were \"preparatory material to answer media requests and to prepare for testimony in congressional hearings.\"",
      "The police report contains no indication that any attempt to assassinate Lula or Alckmin was put into motion. However, investigators found messages and documents indicating that the plotters were monitoring and following de Moraes at the time.",
      "Police said they found evidence that retired Brig. Gen. M\u00e1rio Fernandes, one of the officers arrested who had been serving as interim general secretary of the presidency, also visited the protest camps outside military installations, including at the army headquarters in Brasilia. Investigators said they have evidence that he gave instructions and financial support to the protesters.",
      "Jan. 8 uprising",
      "Federal Police linked Bolsonaro and some of his top ministers to the Jan. 8, 2023 riot in which supporters of the former president, many of whom had been camped outside army headquarters for months, ransacked the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace in Brasilia.",
      "The protesters had pleaded for the armed forces to keep the leftist leader out of office and their uprising \u2014 which came after Lula was sworn in \u2014 was an attempt to force military intervention and oust the new president, police say.",
      "The riot appears in the report as one of several \"other actions to pressure the army commander to join the coup d\u2019etat.\" Police also say that Brig. Gen. Fernandes sent a message in November 2022 to Gen. Marco Ant\u00f4nio Freire Gomes, then the Army's commander, discussing the need for a \"triggering event\" for a coup.",
      "Defendants, including Bolsonaro, have argued that the riot was an isolated event, and many legal experts have noted that the report's evidence of a connection between it and a broader plot is tenuous.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"It is clear that the alleged coup plotters had contacts with people camped outside military barracks, people who were there on Jan. 8. But how much of that contact was transformed into planning, coordination, stimulus for those people to take public buildings that day? That is to be debated, it is going to be discussed in the process and the collection of more evidence,\" said Jo\u00e3o Pedro P\u00e1dua, a professor of criminal law proceedings at the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Bolsonaro left for the United States days before Lula\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2023 and stayed there three months, keeping a low profile. The police report alleges he was avoiding possible imprisonment related to the coup plot and awaiting the fallout from the uprising."

      "Ireland is voting Friday in a parliamentary election that will decide the next government \u2014 and will show whether Ireland bucks the global trend of incumbents being ousted by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures.",
      "Polls opened at 7 a.m.. (0700GMT), and Ireland\u2019s 3.8 million voters are selecting 174 lawmakers to sit in the Dail, the lower house of parliament.",
      "2,000-YEAR-OLD FIG UNEARTHED IN IRELAND MARKS \u2018OLDEST EXAMPLE OF AN EXOTIC FRUIT\u2019 DISCOVERED IN THE AREA",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the parties, the issues and the likely outcome.",
      "Who\u2019s running?",
      "The outgoing government was led by the two parties who have dominated Irish politics for the past century: Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. They have similar center-right policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland\u2019s 1920s civil war.",
      "After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat they formed a coalition, agreeing to share Cabinet posts and take turns as taoiseach, or prime minister. Fianna Fail leader Miche\u00e1l Martin served as premier for the first half of the term and was replaced by Fine Gael\u2019s Leo Varadkar in December 2022. Varadkar unexpectedly stepped down in March, passing the job to current Taoiseach Simon Harris.",
      "Opposition party Sinn Fein achieved a stunning breakthrough in the 2020 election, topping the popular vote, but was shut out of government because Fianna Fail and Fine Gael refused to work with it, citing its leftist policies and historic ties with militant group the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland.",
      "Under Ireland\u2019s system of proportional representation, each of the 43 constituencies elects multiple lawmakers, with voters ranking their preferences. That makes it relatively easy for smaller parties and independent candidates with a strong local following to gain seats.",
      "Presiding officer Caroline Sharkey and Garda Ronan Steede look after a ballot box that is taken by boat to the Island of Gola as voters go to polls the for the 2024 General Election in Ireland, Friday, Nov. 29, 2024. (AP Photo/Peter Morrison)",
      "This election includes a large crop of independent candidates, ranging from local campaigners to far-right activists and reputed crime boss Gerry \"the Monk\" Hutch.",
      "What are the main issues?",
      "As in many other countries, the cost of living \u2014 especially housing \u2014 has dominated the campaign. Ireland has an acute housing shortage, the legacy of failing to build enough new homes during the country\u2019s \"Celtic Tiger\" boom years and the economic slump that followed the 2008 global financial crisis.",
      "\"There was not building during the crisis, and when the crisis receded, offices and hotels were built first,\" said John-Mark McCafferty, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Threshold.",
      "The result is soaring house prices, rising rents and growing homelessness.",
      "After a decade of economic growth, McCafferty said \"Ireland has resources\" \u2014 not least 13 billion euros ($13.6 billion) in back taxes the European Union has ordered Apple to pay it \u2014 \"but it is trying to address big historic infrastructural deficits.\"",
      "Tangled up with the housing issue is immigration, a fairly recent challenge to a country long defined by emigration. Recent arrivals include more than 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by war and thousands of people fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East and Africa.",
      "This country of 5.4 million has struggled to house all the asylum-seekers, leading to tent camps and makeshift accommodation centers that have attracted tension and protests. A stabbing attack on children outside a Dublin school a year ago, in which an Algerian man has been charged, sparked the worst rioting Ireland had seen in decades.",
      "Unlike many European countries, Ireland does not have a significant far-right party, but far-right voices on social media seek to drum up hostility to migrants, and anti-immigrant independent candidates are hoping for election in several districts. The issue appears to be hitting support for Sinn Fein, as working-class supporters bristled at its pro-immigration policies.",
      "What\u2019s the likely outcome?",
      "Opinion polls suggest voters\u2019 support is split into five roughly even chunks \u2014 for Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Sinn Fein, several smaller parties and an assortment of independents.",
      "Fine Gael has run a gaffe-prone campaign, Fianna Fail has remained steady in the polls and Sinn Fein says it has momentum, but is unlikely to win power unless the other parties drop their opposition to working with it.",
      "Analysts say the most likely outcome is another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition, possibly with a smaller party or a clutch of independents as kingmakers.",
      "\"It\u2019s just a question of which minor group is going to be the group that supports the government this time,\" said Eoin O\u2019Malley, a political scientist at Dublin City University. \"Coalition-forming is about putting a hue on what is essentially the same middle-of-the-road government every time.\"",
      "When will we know the results?",
      "Polls close Friday at 10 p.m. (2200GMT), when an exit poll will give the first hints about the result. Counting ballots begins on Saturday morning. Full results could take several days, and forming a government days or weeks after that.",

      "Four teens boarded one of the double-decker buses and went to the second level, where they began to swear at students and give them the middle finger. One 12-year-old student, who professed he was \"scared\" by the attack, described how the teens \"were swearing at us, saying \u2018F--- Israel, nobody likes you. F--- off, you bitches. They were filming us like they were enjoying it. There were lots of people in the street and nobody tried to stop them,\" the student told The Jewish Chronicle.",

      "After the four teens got off the bus, they began to throw heavy rocks at the buses. An 11-year-old student recalled, \"I don\u2019t know where they got the rocks from \u2013 maybe they had them in their bags. None of us knew what to do.\" She reported that some students ran off the bus, but she remained aboard. \"They were swearing at us and filming us,\" she explained. \"We don\u2019t know what they are going to do with that video or why they did what they did.\"",
      "\"This incident did not take place in a vacuum,\" a spokesperson from the British organization Campaign Against Antisemitism told Fox News Digital. \"Over the past year, we have repeatedly warned of the dangerous consequences of Jew-hate going unchecked.\"",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As Congress returns this week for one last burst of activity before it wraps up the session, it faces a key deadline of Dec. 20 to avert a government shutdown.",
      "Democrats and Republicans appear resigned to passing a continuing resolution, or CR, that would temporarily fund the government into early 2025 \u2014 most likely March \u2014 as they run out of time to strike a full funding deal this year. The two parties haven't even agreed on an overall spending level for the new fiscal year, let alone how to allocate the money across parts of the government.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., alluded to the inevitability of a short-term bill Monday, saying, \u201cWe need to keep divisive and unnecessary provisions out of any government funding extension, or else it will get harder to pass a CR in time.\u201d",
      "For Republicans, that is a double-edged sword.",
      "The upside for Republicans in punting the deadline is that they would have more leverage to shape government funding in the new year, with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House and the GOP taking control of the Senate and maintaining a narrow House majority.",
      "The big downside is it would create a critical deadline early in the Trump presidency, potentially taking valuable time away from confirming his nominees through the Senate and from the big party-line bill that Republicans are looking at to extend his tax cuts and advance his immigration and border security agenda.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a lot of things at the same time,\u201d House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said of the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s second term. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be walking and chewing gum.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans would have preferred not to get bogged down with a funding deadline early in the new Trump presidency.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of things I would prefer. But realistically, we\u2019re not going to put together a budget between now and Christmas. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told NBC News. \u201cI expect us to have a CR probably through the middle of March. I expect that CR to be pretty thin.\"",
      "Kennedy added that Congress is likely to attach \"$30 [billion] to $40 billion of disaster relief\" to the CR, including funding for states hit by hurricanes this year. \"It won\u2019t be enough, but it\u2019ll be enough to get a start,\" he said.",
      "Funding the government is usually a messy process that requires bipartisan support, as the bills are subject to the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold. Democrats have significant power to shape the legislation regardless of the deadline; they hold the majority now, and beginning next year, Republicans will have 53 senators, far short of the 60 needed to control the process themselves.",
      "Another dynamic is that passing another massive Christmastime funding package would be a nonstarter for many House Republicans, and it could imperil House Speaker Mike Johnson's bid to get re-elected to the position on Jan. 3, particularly with the already slim GOP majority shrinking further.",
      "Another drawn-out speaker fight could also complicate Trump's presidency, albeit in different ways.",
      "Johnson's office had no comment on the length of a CR, saying it hasn't been settled yet.",
      "Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, which writes funding bills, said there's little time.",
      "\u201cOnce they decide what they\u2019re going to do \u2014 if they\u2019re going to try to get any of these appropriation bills done before or whether they\u2019re going to do a CR for all of them until March \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s the real debate. We can\u2019t get all of them done,\" he said. \"We could probably negotiate if we got a top-line number. We could probably negotiate several, maybe seven or eight, of the bills and get them done by the 20th, but would have to get that number fairly soon.",
      "\u201cSo my guess is \u2014 and it\u2019s just strictly my guess \u2014 is that we\u2019ll do a CR for everybody until end of March,\" he said."

      "This underestimation of Trump\u2019s support ran through\u00a0the polls in\u00a0states across the political spectrum, from solid Democratic states (New York, 4.6\u00a0points\u00a0too low), to states supposedly trending \u201cpurple\u201d in Democrats\u2019 dreams (Texas, 4.4\u00a0points\u00a0too low), to solid Republican states (Wyoming, 5.8\u00a0points\u00a0too low), to swing states (Nevada, 2.9 percent too low).\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0despite pollsters\u2019 attempts to account for the difficulty of getting Trump supporters to respond to their surveys.",
      "Whether the polls suggested the correct \u201cvibe\u201d about the race depends on where you look. Many polls in the critical swing states \u2014 Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 suggested either a tied race or a race with a 1-point margin.\u00a0Given the margins of sampling error and other sources of error in polling, those results left ample room for the final results to swing one way or the other.\u00a0But the closely split polls caused surprise among some when Trump ended up sweeping all seven states.",
      "Most polls correctly pointed to Trump winning Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, but did not show him leading in Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.\u00a0And even when swing state polls correctly identified Trump as leading, a sizable number\u00a0of surveys\u00a0under-predicted his support by more than the margin of error.",
      "Trump led in 85% of the Arizona state polls, for example, but 36% of the\u00a0surveys\u00a0in Arizona understated his lead by more than the margin of error.",
      "Reasons for the divergence",
      "So, what happened? Two culprits seem likely.",
      "First, it\u2019s possible that the polls \u2014 once again \u2014 failed to capture enough new voters or voters who changed their votes\u00a0from\u00a0backing\u00a0Biden\u00a0in 2020\u00a0to\u00a0backing\u00a0Trump\u00a0in 2024. Trump\u00a0may have once again mobilized voters who were willing to cast ballots but\u00a0unlikely to\u00a0talk to pollsters, just as we saw in 2020.",
      "If the people who respond to polls differ in their views from people who do not,\u00a0especially in\u00a0ways\u00a0or to a degree\u00a0that pollsters do not anticipate, then it is difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to measure public opinion. Voters who feel disrespected or misunderstood when they share their views with journalists or pollsters may choose to simply avoid them altogether.",
      "Second, pollsters trying to estimate what they thought the 2024 electorate would look like may have just\u00a0made\u00a0wrong\u00a0assumptions, and that easily could have caused a polling error like the one we just saw.\u00a0This illustrates\u00a0a difficulty unique to pre-election polling: the need for pollsters to adjust their data to match what they\u00a0think\u00a0the electorate will be, without knowing whether those adjustments are correct.",
      "But if the 2024 electorate changed in ways that were not accounted for pollsters\u2019 assumptions \u2014 the adjustments would have been inadequate.",
      "In 2024, for example, many pollsters started weighting to make the self-reported past vote of respondents\u00a0(that is, whether people said they voted for Trump or Biden in the last election)\u00a0match the 2020 outcome. This is a statistical correction that pollster used this cycle to\u00a0address\u00a0the previous undercount of Trump voters.\u00a0In weighing polls to match the popular vote from four years ago, pollsters were assuming that 2020 Biden voters and Trump voters would vote at the same rate in 2024 \u2014 but if Trump voters were slightly more likely to vote and Biden voters were slightly less likely to vote, that could easily produce a 2-point understatement in Trump\u2019s support.",
      "Where do we go from here?",
      "Nate Silver recently opined that\u00a0\u201cPolling Is Not the Problem.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0We agree. The problem is not polling, but how polls are presented and interpreted.\u00a0In fact, it is remarkable that a pollster can talk to the 800 people who agree to take a poll and get to\u00a0a result\u00a0within a few points of the outcome of an election in which nearly 150 million votes were cast.",
      "Problems occur because people want polls to do more than they actually can \u2014 such as deciphering\u00a0who is leading a tight race or identifying\u00a0small changes in a candidate\u2019s support.\u00a0The reason people think polls can do this\u00a0is\u00a0because polling results are often presented and discussed in ways that suggest that they are more precise than\u00a0what\u00a0is\u00a0actually\u00a0possible, often in graphics showing candidates separated by mere decimal points.\u00a0Those averages and to-the-tenth-of-a-point graphics paint a false picture of precision.",
      "While journalism about polls was better in 2024 than the past \u2014 more coverage mentioned the margin of error alongside the results\u00a0of polls\u00a0\u2014 much of the media discourse still gave the impression of\u00a0polling as\u00a0a surgically precise instrument for dissecting political events and campaigns.\u00a0In fact, polling is more akin to a butter knife than a scalpel \u2014 you can get close, but even with skill you need some luck to get it right.",
      "Another problem making it difficult to interpret pre-election polling is that most pollsters avoid disclosing how they collect and adjust the data. Without knowing where the data comes from \u2014 and\u00a0especially\u00a0how pollsters have adjusted\u00a0and weighted their data\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0hope of trying to\u00a0predict what\u00a0the electorate\u00a0will look like \u2014\u00a0it becomes very hard to evaluate or compare the results. When reasonable decisions\u00a0about weighting\u00a0can move the margin of a poll by as much as 8 points, it is impossible to know\u00a0how much\u00a0the results reflect the decisions of voters, pollsters, or both.",
      "Given these concerns and the polling errors we once again saw in 2024, should we dump pre-election polling (as Gallup and Pew Research Center have done)?\u00a0While tempting, this isn\u2019t the right course. Properly understood, pre-election polls can play an important role in democracy by providing a sense of what outcomes seem possible. The fact that most polls showed a tight race in 2024 highlighted the possibility that either candidate could win and perhaps helped increase public acceptance of the results.",
      "But things do need to change.\u00a0In addition to pushing for more transparency \u2014 as industry organizations such as the American Association of Public Opinion Researchers have\u00a0pushed\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s important to take a more humble perspective on what we can learn from a poll. Polls can help identify which issues are more or less important to voters, but they will always struggle to identify winners in 1 to 2-point races. And in a highly polarized nation, those are often the kinds of races we have.",
      "It\u2019s also important for pollsters to be more transparent about their choices affecting the reported results. Even if pollsters want to focus attention on what they think the best estimate is, based on their knowledge and skill, it seems prudent to show how other reasonable choices matter. Given the impossibility of knowing which decisions are best until after the fact, it is important to know if different, reasonable, decisions produce dramatically different estimates.\u00a0\u00a0Seeing how the results change under various plausible possibilities\u00a0\u2014 e.g., high Republican and low Democratic\u00a0turnout, or vice versa \u2014 could help better convey a range of outcomes that could happen.",
      "Pre-election polling is hard.\u00a0That\u2019s not an excuse \u2014 it\u2019s a reality. Treating pre-election polls as revealing deep, knowable truths\u00a0without\u00a0acknowledging the uncertainty\u00a0inherent in those polls\u00a0risks mistaken interpretations, media cycles driven by specious numbers,\u00a0and the loss of\u00a0public faith in the judgement and expertise of those involved\u00a0in polling and analysis.",
      "While the polls did better in 2024 than 2020, and pollsters can credibly say that their surveys were in the same ballpark as the\u00a0outcome, we are still asking too\u00a0much from too blunt a tool. Instead, we should consider how we can use pre-election polls in ways that convey the electoral possibilities at play and better describe the uncertainties involved."

    "story": [
      "Republican senators who met Monday with Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary, brushed aside sexual assault and other allegations against him.",
      "Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., called the allegations a \u201cside issue\u201d while lauding Hegseth\u2019s ability to lead the Defense Department.",
      "\u201cAgain, they\u2019re throwing disparaging remarks at someone who has earned a great deal of credibility. Are soldiers sometimes wild childs? Yeah, that can happen,\u201d Lummis said when she was asked whether the allegations concern her, \u201cbut it is very clear that this guy is the guy who, at a time when Americans are losing confidence in their own military, in our ability to project strength around the world, that Pete Hegseth is the answer to that concern.\u201d",
      "Around 10 to 12 senators on the Republican Steering Committee, a group of conservative senators led by Mike Lee, of Utah, met with Hegseth behind closed doors in the Capitol for less than an hour Monday.",
      "Hegseth, an Army National Guard veteran and former Fox News host, has faced several misconduct allegations since he was named as Trump's pick to lead the Defense Department (he has denied any wrongdoing). Most recently, a New Yorker article published Sunday revealed the contents of a previously undisclosed 2015 whistleblower report from a veterans' organization Hegseth ran, which claimed he was repeatedly intoxicated on the job.",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the report. Hegseth\u2019s attorney declined to comment. In a statement to The New Yorker, an adviser said that the claims were \u201coutlandish\u201d and that they came from a \u201cpetty and jealous disgruntled former associate.\u201d",
      "The Trump transition team referred NBC News to a previous statement in support of Hegseth. Hegseth did not respond to shouted questions from NBC News about the New Yorker article and other allegations.",
      "Senators offered their full-throated support to Hegseth after the meeting, downplaying the accusations.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known Pete for a while, so in my experience with him has always been positive. I think he\u2019s clearly committed to making sure we have a lethal military that scares the crap out of our enemies, is respected by our allies and is somebody that our allies can rely on,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla.",
      "Lee did not say whether the senators had discussed any of the allegations with Hegseth, saying they discussed his vision for the Pentagon.",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said the media was \u201cobsessed\u201d with personal allegations against Hegseth and told reporters that each Cabinet nominee will be subject to a background check but potentially not from the FBI \u2014 a new point of contention among lawmakers, as some Republicans say the FBI should not be in charge of carrying out the background checks, breaking with the usual practice.",
      "A woman told police that Hegseth sexually assaulted her in 2017 after a Republican women\u2019s convention in California, according to official\u00a0records of a police investigation\u00a0released last month. Hegseth has denied the accusations and was not charged. He acknowledged having paid his accuser an undisclosed amount as part of a settlement.",
      "Last week, The New York Times reported that Hegseth\u2019s mother sent him an email calling him an \u201cabuser of women\u201d amid his contentious divorce in 2018. She told the Times later that she regretted the email, which NBC News has not obtained.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s lawyer declined to provide a statement but passed along a statement from the Trump transition team that said: \u201cIt is shameful but not surprising that the NYT is publishing a story about one out of context snippet from an illegally obtained private conversation between a mother and her son. The entire purpose of this exercise is to malign Mr.\u00a0Hegseth.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters Monday after the meeting with Hegseth, Cruz referred to the New York Times story as \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "Senators also cited Hegseth\u2019s ability to raise retention and recruitment levels in the military among young men and women, despite his having previously suggested that women should not serve. Asked about those comments, Lummis said they do not concern her.",
      "\u201cI think when he gets some fighter pilots that are women, that are, you know, the best of the best, he might, he might think twice about that,\u201d she said.",
      "In a podcast interview last month, Hegseth said women should not be allowed to fight on the front lines, claiming their presence has made fighting \u201cmore complicated.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m straight up just saying that we should not have women in combat roles,\u201d Hegseth said on \u201cThe Shawn Ryan Show\u201d podcast last month. His remarks drew swift backlash from female veterans and service members.",
      "The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Republican senators' remarks."

      "When the Pittsburgh Steelers made the midseason decision to switch starting quarterbacks, the move wasn\u2019t exactly celebrated.",
      "Pittsburgh went 4-2 in its first six games with Justin Fields at the helm, leading practically everyone to question why head coach Mike Tomlin would start offseason signee Russell Wilson for the team\u2019s Oct. 20 game against the New York Jets.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure out what could motivate Tomlin to make this change,\" ESPN\u2019s Mina Kimes said a couple of days before the Jets game. \"It\u2019s one that I don\u2019t quite understand.\"",
      "Kimes\u2019 colleague Ryan Clark, a former Steelers safety, said right after: \u201cI\u2019m with her. I really don\u2019t know what made the decision to go back to Russell Wilson.\u201d",
      "Former Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marcus Spears questioned after Kimes and Clark: \u201cI want to push it forward into thinking what happens if Russ has a bad first or second quarter? Do you go back to Justin Fields immediately?\"",
      "All three panelists were more than justified in their confusion.",
      "Wilson missed the start of the season with a calf injury, and he was also coming off his two worst seasons as a professional, having posted an 11-19 record in the precious two years.",
      "In fact, Wilson struggled so much in his two seasons with the Denver Broncos that the team incurred a historic cap penalty to get rid of him. Releasing Wilson cost the Broncos $85 million combined against their salary cap this season and next \u2014 the biggest cap penalty ever.",

The Broncos still had to pay Wilson $39 million this year after they cut him, minus whatever salary he made if he signed with another team. That allowed Pittsburgh to scoop him for a bargain one-year, $1.21 million contract, with Wilson getting $37.79 million more from the Broncos.",
      "So why would the Steelers bench Fields \u2014 a former first-round draft pick seemingly realizing his potential \u2014 for a quarterback signed off the scrap heap whose last team paid him a fortune to go away?",
      "Because of what Pittsburgh has done in its last six games.",
      "Since he took over in October, Wilson has gone 5-1, taking the Steelers\u2019 offense to new heights while posting some of his best numbers in years.",
      "After having averaged 20.7 points per game with Fields, Pittsburgh is scoring 28.7 with Wilson. And the passing game has been much more dynamic. Fields threw for 184.3 yards per game in his six starts. Wilson, meanwhile, has thrown for 271 yards per game, which is not only a career high but also second-best in the NFL this season.",
      "Though Wilson isn\u2019t the scrambler he was during his heyday with the Seattle Seahawks \u2014 a 10-year stint when he led the team to a Super Bowl and made nine Pro Bowls \u2014 he has helped make up for it by pushing the ball down the field efficiently. He\u2019s averaging a career best in yards per attempt, his highest success rate since 2020 and his lowest sack percentage since 2021.",
      "In Week 13, Wilson threw for 414 yards and led the Steelers to 44 points in a win over the Cincinnati Bengals, the type of shootout it would have been difficult to envision Fields, who threw for under 200 yards in four of his six starts, winning.",
      "There are big tests awaiting Wilson in the final few weeks of the season, however.",
      "While his only loss came against the Cleveland Browns in a snow-filled quagmire on a Thursday night, Wilson will have to show he can take on the league\u2019s best in December.",
      "Pittsburgh will face the 10-2 Philadelphia Eagles and the division rival Baltimore Ravens on the road before they go home to play the AFC-leading Kansas City Chiefs in a three-game stretch from Dec. 15 to Christmas. Each of those games could be a potential playoff preview, and the latter two could have massive implications on postseason seeding.",
      "For now, the Steelers are at 9-3 headed into the final five weeks of the regular season, and Wilson has helped them go up a level. Though it may have been fair to question why Pittsburgh would turn the team over to a veteran seemingly in the downswing of his career, Wilson has proven he was the right man for the job."

      "A week after the premiere of a Netflix docuseries on the unsolved death of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, police maintained their dedication to finding the little girl\u2019s killer but refused to say whether they have any promising leads at this time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the Boulder Police Department wants to solve this case and the only reason is to bring justice to the victim,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Boulder, Colorado, police department said in an email Monday.",
      "Six-year-old JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her family\u2019s stately Boulder home nearly three decades ago. \u201cCold Case: Who Killed JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey,\u201d a three-part Netflix documentary, has renewed interest in the death of the young beauty pageant queen whose 1996 killing mesmerized the public, prompting relentless cable news coverage and making headlines around the world.",
      "The Boulder police spokeswoman declined to answer questions from NBC News about tips authorities were investigating in the case and instead referred to a video statement from last week from Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn in which he said he and everyone else who has worked on JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s case \u201cwould love nothing more than to bring justice to her memory.\u201d",
      "His statement came a day after the release of the Netflix series, which takes viewers back to the morning after Christmas 28 years ago, when JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s mother called 911 to report finding a rambling ransom note and her daughter missing. It was JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s father who discovered the girl\u2019s body that afternoon and who then carried her upstairs himself, destroying the integrity of the crime scene and leading to widespread criticism of the Boulder police department\u2019s handling of the case from the start.",
      "\u201cThere are a number of things that people have pointed to throughout the years that could have been done better, and we acknowledge that is true,\u201d Redfearn said in the video released by the Boulder police department on X last Tuesday. \u201cHowever, it is important to emphasize that while we cannot go back to that horrible day in 1996, our goal is to find JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u2019s killer. Our commitment to that has never wavered.\u201d",
      "Finding JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s killer has been elusive thus far. While her family lived under a cloud of suspicion for years, in 2008 prosecutors apologized to her parents and brother and formally cleared them of any involvement in the homicide.",
      "The Netflix docuseries does not point the finger at any single suspect but does highlight her father\u2019s hope that new DNA testing might solve the case. (JonBen\u00e9t\u2019s mother, Patsy, died of cancer at age 49 in 2006.)",
      "\u201cI believe it can be solved if the police accept help from outside their system,\u201d John Ramsey told the \u201cTODAY\u201d show last month before the docuseries premiered. \u201cThat\u2019s been the flaw for 25 years.\u201d",
      "The Boulder police department said it has followed up on all tips and has not worked in a silo.",
      "\u201cThe assertion that there is viable evidence and leads we are not pursuing \u2014 to include DNA testing \u2014 is completely false,\u201d it said on X last week.",
      "\u201cAdditionally, it was the Boulder Police Department \u2014 not the Colorado Bureau of Investigation \u2014 who convened the Cold Case Review Panel in December 2023 as part of its investigation efforts,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The department said that it typically releases an annual update on the case in December but chose to release one earlier than usual this year \u201cdue to the increased attention on this investigation.\"",
      "In his video message, Redfearn said he welcomed news coverage that will \u201callow us to finally bring the killer or killers to justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cJonBen\u00e9t would have been 34 years old this year,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, those who loved and knew JonBen\u00e9t continued to grieve. This crime also haunts the Boulder community, especially every officer and detective who\u2019s ever been a part of this investigation. Every single one of them thinks about her and would love nothing more than to bring justice to her memory.\u201d"

      "It wasn't clear whether Velez, who amassed 360,000 followers on TikTok with content based on her life raising two children, has legal counsel for either case. The public defender's office for Florida's 20th Judicial Circuit didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.",
      "Lee County Sheriff's Office inmate records say that Velez's latest booking happened Saturday afternoon and that she posted $500 bond for her release on Sunday afternoon. The records list the same court date scheduled for her last arrest: Dec. 10.The initial arrest happened after police tracked down Velez through tips and social media sleuthing, Cape Coral police said.",
      "Target loss-reduction employees called officers to report a theft had happened on Oct. 30 and showed officers video of a woman they accused of stealing, police said. Police said Velez paid a lower amount for household goods and clothing collectively priced at $500.32.",
      "Police said they found Velez wearing the same clothing in a post on TikTok from the day of the theft. They also said she showed off some of the ill-gotten items on the platform.",
      "Police said that while she was in jail after that arrest, Velez was recorded on security cameras saying, \"Lesson learned.\" Police said Velez told officers she didn\u2019t recall committing theft at the store but admitted the person on security video was her.",
      "On Monday, the police department reported Velez's second arrest, the result of Target loss-prevention workers\u2019 alleging the same woman did the same thing on Nov. 20.",
      "In both cases, police allege, Velez chose items from the store but when she got to a self-checkout terminal she scanned bar codes with lower prices.",
      "The latest alleged theft involved 16 items described as miscellaneous household goods and clothing worth $225, police said.",
      "Officers said that in the most recent case, they were also able to identify the suspect though security images of her in the store with her phone \u2014 with her family wallpaper on the device the same as a photo posted on her Instagram account, police said.",
      "Furthermore, they said, a man who was with her had a distinctive tattoo that matched imagery of a tattoo seen on Velez's TikTok account.",
      "Taken alone, the charge of petty theft in Florida could result in a maximum of 60 days behind bars if prosecutors move forward and are successful. But if Velez is charged and convicted sequentially for both cases, she could face a maximum sentence of one year behind bars, according to Florida law."

      "A Florida woman was sentenced Monday to life in prison for zipping her boyfriend into a suitcase and leaving him to die of suffocation amid a history of domestic and alcohol abuse.",
      "Circuit Judge Michael Kraynick imposed the sentence in Orlando on Sarah Boone, 47, for the 2020 killing of 42-year-old Jorge Torres.",
      "A jury deliberated only 90 minutes Oct. 25 before\u00a0convicting Boone\u00a0of the second-degree murder of Jorge Torres after a 10-day trial. Boone had insisted she was herself a victim of domestic violence at the hands of Torres and had rejected a plea deal offer of a 15-year sentence.",
      "Torres\u2019 family members testified at the hearing that his death has torn them apart.",
      "\u201cSarah deserves to rot in jail,\u201d said a sister, Victoria Torres. \u201cSarah has caused a lifetime of pain.\u201d",
      "In her own statement, Boone went through a litany of abuse by Torres she said occurred over many years, decried the way her trial was handled and covered by the media, yet asked forgiveness for her actions.",
      "\u201cI forgive myself for falling in love with a monster. I tried breaking the spell ... I never stopped loving him,\u201d said Boone, who has been in jail for 58 months. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for this to happen. Forgive me Jorge. Forgive me Torres family.\u201d",
      "At first, Boone told Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office investigators that she and Torres had been drinking heavily and playing hide-and-seek on Feb. 23, 2020, in their Winter Park, Florida, residence when they thought it would be amusing for the 103-pound Torres to climb into the suitcase.",
      "They had been drinking  and she decided to go to sleep, figuring that Torres could get out of the suitcase on his own,\u00a0she told detectives in an arrest report.",
      "When she woke up the next morning, she didn\u2019t find Torres but then remembered he was in the suitcase. She unzipped the suitcase and found him unresponsive, the arrest report said.",
      "Boone was charged with second-degree murder after investigators found videos on her cellphone in which\u00a0Torres is heard yelling from inside the suitcase\u00a0that he couldn\u2019t breathe and repeatedly calling out Boone\u2019s name, according to the arrest report.",
      "\u201cShe decided to keep (Torres) in the suitcase when he said he could not breathe in it to terrorize him,\u201d prosecutor William Jay said in a court filing. \u201cShe then struck him with a baseball bat.\u201d",
      "Boone rejected a plea offer from prosecutors that would have imposed a 15-year prison sentence in exchange for her guilty plea to a reduced manslaughter charge.",
      "During her trial, Boone testified that past violent incidents between her and Torres caused her to perceive a threat of imminent harm and that she acted in self-defense by keeping him in the suitcase.",
      "\u201cYeah that\u2019s what you do when you choke me,\u201d Boone said in one of the cellphone videos from that night, according to the arrest report. \u201cOh, that\u2019s what I feel like when you cheat on me.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A white former Kansas City, Kansas,\u00a0police detective was found dead Monday of an apparent suicide on the day his federal civil rights trial was set to begin for allegedly sexually abusing Black women over decades, authorities said.",
      "An arrest warrant had been issued when Roger\u00a0Golubski, 71, failed to appear at a federal courthouse in Topeka on the first day of jury selection. Law enforcement received a 911 call and responded to Golubski's home in the Kansas City suburb of Edwardsville, where police reported he suffered a fatal gunshot wound with no indications of foul play, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation said.",
      "State authorities declined to comment on the manner of his death before an autopsy is complete. Federal law enforcement officials told NBC News that he appeared to have died by suicide.",
      "Top Justice Department officials also confirmed his death in a statement.",
      "\"This matter involved extremely serious charges, and it\u00a0is always difficult when a case is unable to be fully and fairly heard in a public trial and weighed and determined by a jury,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke and Kate Brubacher, the U.S. attorney for Kansas. \"The proceedings in this case may be over, but its lasting impact on all the individuals and families involved remains. We wish them peace and the opportunity for healing as they come to terms with this development and ask that they all be treated with respect and their privacy respected.\"",
      "The officials did not comment on his manner of death. His attorney and local law enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Golubski was charged in 2022 with federal civil rights crimes after he was accused of exploiting Black women for sex and framing people for crimes they say they did not commit.",
      "Golubski, who\u00a0retired in 2010 after 35 years with the Kansas City Police Department, pleaded not guilty to six counts of\u00a0deprivation of civil rights. Federal investigators said the case was related to the rape of a woman from 1998 to 2001 and another woman from 1999 to 2002 while he was employed by the department. He was also charged with three others in a separate case for allegedly running a sex trafficking ring from 1996 to 1998 that held women captive.",
      "Golubski had been on house arrest as he was receiving regular dialysis treatments and faced up to life in prison if he were convicted.",
      "Christopher Joseph, Golubski's lawyer, told a judge when his client failed to show up in court Monday morning that he had been \"despondent\" over the media attention on his case.",
      "The Kansas City Police Department has come under scrutiny over allegations of corruption and civil rights violations in recent years. Activists have\u00a0called for a broader federal investigation, particularly in light of the alleged abuses\u00a0for decades under Golubski.",
      "Outside the courthouse, before it was known that Golubski had died, demonstrators gathered demanding justice.",
      "After learning of his death, Cheryl Pilate, a lawyer for a man who was wrongfully convicted in a 1994 double murder case linked to Golubski, told reporters that a full investigation is warranted into what happened Monday. In February, federal prosecutors had asked a judge to revoke his pretrial house arrest privilege after he was accused of violating the terms by going out to lunch without approval. The judge, however, declined to do so.",
      "Jay Z's\u00a0Team Roc, the social justice arm\u00a0of his Roc Nation entertainment company, filed a lawsuit last month accusing Kansas City of violating public records laws by failing to produce law enforcement records related to claims of police abuse and misconduct.",
      "Team ROC managing director Dania Diaz said the trial would have been meaningful accountability, and Golubski's accusers and the community must continue to be heard.",
      "\"The truth was always going to be revealed in court, but today's development is certainly a tragic ending to a devastating story for a local community that still deserves answers and healing,\" Diaz said.",

    "story": [
      "An 88-year-old doctor accused of sexually assaulting Indiana University basketball players back in the 1990s has been ordered to appear before a judge Tuesday to determine whether he is competent to be questioned about the alleged abuse.",
      "Dr. Bradford Bomba Sr.\u2019s appearance before Magistrate Judge Mario Garcia at the federal courthouse in Indianapolis will be to assess the doctor\u2019s \u201cability to testify at a deposition,\u201d according to an order issued Monday.",
      "Garcia issued the ruling after Bomba\u2019s guardian, Joseph Bomba, asked for the deposition to be delayed arguing that the former IU team doctor \u201cdoes not know the difference between a truth and a lie, making him incompetent to testify,\u201d according to court papers dated Nov. 27.",
      "Dr. George Parker, a psychiatrist at IU Health, has examined Bomba, the doctor\u2019s guardian said.",
      "The development came two months after Haris Mujezinovic and Charlie Miller, who played for the Hoosiers in the 1990s under legendary coach\u00a0Bob Knight, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for Southern Indiana, alleging that their coaches and trainers were aware that Bomba was subjecting basketball players to unnecessary prostate examinations and did nothing to stop him.",
      "Kathleen Delaney, who represents Mujezinovic and Miller, said in the lawsuit that there could be \u201cat least one hundred\u201d alleged victims.",
      "Delaney named the Trustees of Indiana University as defendants in the lawsuit, alleging Title IX violations by the school for failing to protect the students.\u00a0Under that federal law, universities that receive federal funding are required to have safety measures to protect students from predators.",
      "In response, Indiana University retained the Jones Day law firm to launch an independent investigation into the Bomba allegations.",
      "Bomba is not listed as a defendant. Knight died last year\u00a0at age 83.",
      "Delaney declined to comment on the latest development in a case that has put an unwelcome spotlight on Bomba, who was the men\u2019s basketball team physician for two decades, and on the university's vaunted hoops program.",
      "William J. Beggs, the Bloomington, Indiana, lawyer who, according to the court papers, has been representing Bomba, did not immediately respond to an NBC News request for comment.",
      "Indiana University hired Bomba to provide medical care to all its sports teams from 1962 to 1970, and from 1979 until the late 1990s he was the basketball team\u2019s doctor, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Mujezinovic and Miller said in their lawsuit that they \u201cwere routinely and repeatedly subjected to medically unnecessary, invasive, and abusive digital rectal examinations\u201d by Bomba. The doctor had played football for Indiana University and was nicknamed \u201cFrankenstein\u201d by coaches and players \u201cdue to the large size of his hands and fingers,\u201d the lawsuit added.",
      "\u201cDr. Bomba, Sr.\u2019s routine sexual assaults were openly discussed by the Hoosier men\u2019s basketball players in the locker room in the presence of IU employees, including assistant coaches, athletic trainers, and other Hoosier men\u2019s basketball staff,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "Mujezinovic, who spent two seasons at Indiana from 1995 to 1997, and Miller, who played for the Hoosiers from 1994 through 1998, are seeking unspecified damages. They have also urged their former teammates to come forward and join the lawsuit.",
      "Prostate exams are generally performed on men over age 40, according to\u00a0American Cancer Society guidelines.",
      "But Bomba performed them on the 20-something-year-old athletes who were sent to either him or his son, Dr. Bradford Bomba Jr., for physical exams, the lawsuit said.",
      "The lawsuit does not accuse Bomba\u2019s son of any wrongdoing.",
      "The accusations that IU turned a blind eye to allegations of a team doctor sexually abusing student-athletes echo another major scandal involving a team doctor. In 2018, former Ohio State University wrestlers said\u00a0their coaches knew that Dr. Richard Strauss\u00a0was preying on them but also failed to act. Strauss died in 2005."

      "TOKYO \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that he would block a Japanese company\u2019s $15 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel, a contentious deal that faces widespread political opposition.",
      "Nippon Steel, Japan\u2019s largest steelmaker, announced the deal last December and has said it is determined to see it through despite concerns about the implications for employees, supply chains and U.S. national security.",
      "\u201cI am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,\u201d Trump said in a late-night post on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\u201cAs President, I will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!\u201d",
      "Trump had expressed opposition to the deal during the presidential election campaign, along with President Joe Biden and Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who all said the Pittsburgh-based company should remain American-owned. Trump\u2019s comments Monday night are his first on the subject since he won the election last month.",
      "A senior Nippon Steel executive told reporters last month that the company hoped to close the deal before Trump returns to the White House in January.",
      "Nippon Steel said in a statement Tuesday that it was \u201cdetermined to protect and grow U.S. Steel in a manner that reinforces American industry, domestic supply chain resiliency, and U.S. national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at U. S. Steel can manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "U.S. Steel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The deal is also opposed by the powerful United Steelworkers union, though some other U.S. Steel employees support it. U.S. Steel says it remains committed to the transaction as \u201cthe best deal for our employees, shareholders, communities and customers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe strongly believe the deal closes on its merits,\u201d U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt told CNBC in September.\u00a0\u201cIt strengthens national security, it strengthens economic security and it strengthens job security.\u201d",
      "The company has said the collapse of the deal would make the American steel industry less competitive globally and could cost thousands of union jobs at blast furnace facilities that might otherwise have to shut down.",
      "Nippon Steel has argued that the acquisition would benefit both companies and their employees, as well as the U.S. and Japan, a\u00a0key U.S. ally. A Japanese government official declined on Tuesday to comment on matters concerning the management of individual companies.",
      "\u201cThat said, our understanding is that it is essential for both of our nations to further strengthen economic relations, including the expansion of mutual investment in both of our countries, to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the Indo-Pacific region, and to cooperate with each other in the field of economic security,\u201d Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazuhiko Aoki told reporters in Tokyo.",
      "Nippon Steel says U.S. Steel would remain American-run, with Americans serving as three of the board\u2019s independent directors, as well as \u201ccore senior management members.\u201d It says it would prioritize production at U.S. Steel to meet demand in the American market, the company headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, and there would be no layoffs or plant closures as a result of the deal.",
      "Experts say that the deal has been politicized and that its failure could inadvertently help China, which produces more than half of the world\u2019s steel, maintain its dominance of the global market. American and international business groups have also expressed concern that the deal is being politicized.",
      "Biden allowed Nippon Steel this year to resubmit its filing with a government panel that reviews foreign investments for national security risks, giving it more time to allay bipartisan concerns. The deadline for the review, by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, is at the end of this month, though it could also be extended.",
      "Trump said he would find a way to preserve U.S. Steel as it is.",
      "\u201cThrough a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST!\u201d he said.",

      "Tesla\u00a0CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0lost his bid to get his 2018 CEO pay package reinstated on Monday when a Delaware judge upheld her prior ruling that the compensation plan was improperly granted.",
      "The package, worth about $56 billion, was the largest compensation plan in U.S. history for a public company executive. Tesla said in a post on X, that it plans to appeal the ruling, which Musk, in a separate post on his social media site, called \u201cabsolute corruption.\u201d",
      "In January, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick\u00a0voided the pay plan, ruling that Musk had individually \u201ccontrolled Tesla\u201d and dictated the terms of his compensation to a board that didn\u2019t fairly negotiate. She called the process leading to approval of that pay plan \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d",
      "Following the opinion, Tesla conducted a\u00a0shareholder vote\u00a0in June 2024 at its annual meeting in Austin, Texas, asking investors to \u201cratify\u201d Musk\u2019s 2018 CEO pay plan. Musk\u2019s attorneys attempted to sway the judge to reverse her opinion after the trial, leaning on the results of that vote.",
      "McCormick wrote in her opinion on Monday that, \u201cEven if a stockholder vote could have a ratifying effect, it could not do so here.\u201d She added that, \u201cWere the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits would become interminable.\u201d",
      "As part of Monday\u2019s opinion, McCormick approved a $345 million attorney fee award for the lawyers who successfully sued on behalf of Tesla shareholders in order to void Musk\u2019s pay plan.",

      "Following the January decision, Musk had lashed out at the Delaware court posting on X, \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\u201d Tesla then held a shareholder vote to reincorporate in Texas, and officially shifted its state of incorporation there.",
      "Musk has also moved the state of incorporation for his defense contractor company SpaceX to Texas\u00a0from Delaware.",
      "Despite the legal setback, Musk has seen his net worth jump considerably in recent weeks. Excluding all of the options wrapped up in the pay package, Musk is more than $43 billion richer since Donald Trump\u2019s election victory last month. Tesla shares have soared 42% in the four weeks since the election on optimism that Musk\u2019s coziness with the incoming president will lead to policies favorable to his companies.",
      "The Tesla stock Musk still holds is worth close to $150 billion based on Monday\u2019s closing price. That alone, not including his SpaceX stake, would put him among the world\u2019s\u00a0wealthiest\u00a0people. Equilar estimates that at today\u2019s stock price Musk\u2019s 2018 package would have risen to be worth $101.4 billion."

    "story": [
      "Art Cashin, UBS\u2019 director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange and a man The Washington Post called \u201cWall Street\u2019s version of Walter Cronkite,\u201d has died. He was 83 and had been a regular on CNBC for more than 25 years.",
      "In the intensely competitive and often vicious world of stock market commentary, Cashin was that rarest of creatures: a man respected by all, bulls and bears, liberals and conservatives alike. He seemed to have almost no enemies.",
      "He was a great drinker and raconteur, a teller of stories.",
      "For decades, he assembled a group of like-minded friends every day after trading halted, first at the bar at the NYSE luncheon club, then across the street at Bobby Van\u2019s Steakhouse, where the group came to be known as the \u201cFriends of Fermentation.\u201d His drink was Dewar\u2019s, always on the rocks.",
      "Cashin\u2019s success was attributable to a combination of charm, wit, intelligence, and a stubborn insistence on refusing to adopt many of the conveniences of the modern world. He was a link to an NYSE tradition. Every year, on Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Eve, he led the singing of the 1905 song \u201cWait \u2019Till the Sun Shines, Nellie.\u201d",
      "Cashin refused to use credit cards and paid for everything, particularly his voluminous bar bills, with cash, saying he cherished his anonymity. He never learned to use a computer--his notes were hand-written and then sent to his assistant. For years, he used an obsolete flip phone that he rarely answered.",
      "His desk was piled high with papers he had accumulated over the decades. At times, it resembled a recycling facility.",
      "Cashin\u2019s suits were usually rumpled and his ties were always obsolete.",
      "However, neither his appearance nor his attitude was haphazard. It was part of a persona that was carefully constructed over more than 50 years on Wall Street.",
      "Arthur D. Cashin Jr. was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1941. His parents were superintendents of an apartment building. His business career began in 1959 at Thomson McKinnon, a brokerage firm, when he was 17 and still in high school. Cashin had been obliged to join the workforce when his father died unexpectedly that year.",
      "In 1964, at age 23, he became a member of the NYSE and a partner of P.R. Herzig & Co.",
      "At that time, the vast majority of all trading took place on the NYSE floor. Cashin\u2019s early memories revolve around the noise of thousands of brokers shouting at each other. He claimed to be able to tell if the market was moving up or down by the pitch of the screaming, because sellers sounded panicky. \u201cAnd so if the pitch of the noise was high, I would know the sellers were headed my way. Or if it was a rumble, I would know that it was probably buyers coming,\u201d he said in a 2018 interview.",
      "In the mid-1970s, disgusted by the corruption in his hometown of Jersey City, Cashin ran for mayor. \u201cI think I ran 12th in a field of five,\u201d he said. \u201cBut once they discovered I was honest, there wasn\u2019t much chance I was going to get elected.\u201d",
      "He returned to Wall Street. In 1980, he joined PaineWebber and managed its floor operation, continuing to do so after PaineWebber was bought by UBS in 2000.",
      "Then came 2001.",
      "Cashin would often recall what it was like to escape from Ground Zero on Sept. 11, 2001, after terrorists crashed two jetliners into the World Trade Center towers, killing more than 2,600 people in the heart of the nation\u2019s financial center.",
      "\u201cMany of us got out that Tuesday walking through streets onto which ash, smoke and business envelopes fell snow-like, blocking both your view and your breathing,\u201d\u00a0he wrote in a commentary 13 days later.\u00a0\u201cYet when a stranger was met, they were invited to join the convoy and offered a spare wet cloth (carried in pockets) through which to breathe as they walked. When we reached the East River (Brooklyn side of Manhattan), there was a volunteer group of tugboats, fishing boats and mini-ferries that looked like the evacuation of Dunkirk. No charge. No money. Just \u2014 \u201cMay I help you!\u201d No one got anyone\u2019s name. No thank you cards will be sent. But Americans \u2014 even New York Americans \u2014 who freely give to strangers but argue with neighbors were suddenly one group. In the days since, as we wander via new strange ways back to Wall Street, we all internalize the survivor\u2019s quandary. We are lucky to be alive \u2014 but why us.\u201d",
      "After the Sept. 11 attacks, Cashin chaired the NYSE \u201cFallen Heroes Fund,\u201d which provided millions of dollars to the families of first responders killed in the line of duty.",
      "Though he was a respected market historian, he was most renowned as a storyteller for the stock market. He was a meticulous observer of fundamental and technical trading patterns but never let data get in the way of explaining the market in a folksy manner that made it accessible to even casual observers. He often spoke of Wall Street as a community of people with many different opinions. In his world, the bulls and bears would fight it out every day, as if it were all a John Wayne Western: \u201cThe bulls are circling the wagons, trying to defend the highs\u201d was a common refrain.",
      "His daily market commentary, Cashin\u2019s Comments, was distributed to clients continuously for more than 40 years and was widely read on Wall Street. It invariably began with an analysis of an important event that occurred on that date (\u201cOn this date in 1918, the worldwide flu epidemic went into high gear in the U.S.\u201d), and after a brief history lesson tied that event to the day\u2019s market events (\u201cPre-opening Wednesday morning, U.S. stock futures looked like they might be coming down with the flu. Several earnings reports were less than glowing and some of the outlooks were cloudy\u201d).",
      "He was a keen observer of human behavior, a behavioral psychologist long before the word was coined. He had seen his fellow humans panic time after time, and had seen the effects of succumbing to the initial desire to sell immediately without thinking. \u201cIt tells me that people have a tendency to overreact \u2014 and to not think things through carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you break up, again, into two sets of people, those who look with some suspicion at events, and others who say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to react to that.\u2019 Those who react immediately rarely do well. Those who are somewhat suspect, they do much better.\u201d",
      "He had two great loves in his life: his family and the New York Stock Exchange. In the age of computerized trading, the fabled NYSE trading floor still survives, though in greatly diminished form. When it was closed during the Covid pandemic, he said he was \u201cdisappointed ... but it was understandable.\u201d",
      "Cashin was philosophical when asked about the rise of electronic trading, which has slowly but surely eroded the influence of that floor. \u201cI miss those magnificent days when your spirit hung on the fact that you were good for your word or you\u2019re outta here,\u201d he once said at Bobby Van\u2019s, but admitted that electronic trading had improved the speed and accuracy of trading, particularly recordkeeping.",
      "Among his many friends, he will perhaps be best remembered for his modesty. He seemed genuinely puzzled about his popularity. \u201cPeople have an interest in \u2014 in Arthur Cashin. I can\u2019t fully understand why,\u201d he said.",
      "And when The Washington Post ran a long profile of his career in 2019, calling him Wall Street\u2019s version of CBS newsman Cronkite, he quipped: \u201cI think I owe an apology to Walter Cronkite.\u201d",

      "Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Monday he is anticipating an interest rate cut in December but is concerned about recent trends on inflation that could change his mind.",
      "\u201cBased on the economic data in hand today and forecasts that show that inflation will continue on its downward path to 2 percent over the medium term, at present I lean toward supporting a cut to the policy rate at our December meeting,\u201d Waller said in remarks before a monetary policy forum in Washington.",
      "However, he noted that the \u201cdecision will depend on whether data that we will receive before then surprises to the upside and alters my forecast for the path of inflation.\u201d",
      "Waller cited recent data indicating that progress on inflation may be \u201cstalling.\u201d",
      "In October, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation indicator, the\u00a0personal consumption expenditures price index, showed headline inflation moving up to 2.3% annually and core prices, which exclude the cost of food and energy, moving up to 2.8%. The Fed targets a 2% rate.",
      "Though the data was in line with Wall Street expectations, it showed an increase from the prior month and was evidence that despite the progress, the central bank\u2019s goal has proved elusive.",
      "\u201cOverall, I feel like an MMA fighter who keeps getting inflation in a choke hold, waiting for it to tap out yet it keeps slipping out of my grasp at the last minute,\u201d Waller said, referring to mixed martial arts. \u201cBut let me assure you that submission is inevitable \u2014 inflation isn\u2019t getting out of the octagon.\u201d",
      "Markets expect the Fed to lop another quarter percentage point off its benchmark overnight borrowing rate when it meets Dec. 17-18. That would follow a half-point cut in September and a quarter-point reduction in November.",
      "\u201cAs of today, I am leaning toward continuing the work we have started in returning monetary policy to a more neutral setting,\u201d Waller said.",
      "Waller said he will watch incoming employment and inflation data closely. The Bureau of Labor Statistics this week will release reports on job openings and nonfarm payrolls, the latter coming after gains in October came in at a paltry 12,000, due largely to labor strikes and weather issues.",
      "Even with the slowing progress on inflation, Waller said broader economic health has him feeling like it will be appropriate to continue to ease monetary policy.",
      "\u201cAfter we cut by 75 basis points, I believe the evidence is strong that policy continues to be significantly restrictive and that cutting again will only mean that we aren\u2019t pressing on the brake pedal quite as hard,\u201d he said.",

      "Lan, the chairwoman of real estate developer Van Thinh Phat Holdings Group, was\u00a0sentenced to death\u00a0in April for her role in what was Vietnam\u2019s biggest financial fraud case on record.",

      "It took only a few hours for Syrian rebels to recapture territory that President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces had spent years reclaiming in a lightning offensive launched last week with little warning. Now, a country that has been absent from the spotlight amid other ongoing Middle East conflicts is dominating headlines as a long-simmering civil war reignites. Here\u2019s some of what we know.",
      "What has happened: In a little less than a week, rebels led by the militant group Hayat Tahir al-Sham, or HTS, launched an assault that took the country\u2019s second-largest city, Aleppo, as well as other nearby provinces, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Syrian and Russian fighter jets responded by launching airstrikes on the rebel-held areas. Assad\u2019s government claimed to have killed hundreds of \u201cterrorists,\u201d but the Observatory said dozens of civilians were killed as well.",
      "Why now? Russia, Iran and Hezbollah (Iran\u2019s Lebanon-based proxy) helped Assad prevail during the Arab Spring of 2011. Today, all three are either distracted or depleted amid ongoing conflicts, putting Syria \u201cin a much weaker position,\u201d a Russia analyst said.",

      "Congress faces key funding deadline",
      "The pressure is on for Congress to agree on funding by Dec. 20 to avert a government shutdown. It appears that Democrats and Republicans will pass a continuing resolution, or CR, to temporarily fund the government, most likely into March 2025. The two parties haven\u2019t agreed to a spending level for the new fiscal year, let alone how to allocate the money across parts of the government.",
      "For Republicans, several factors are at play. On one hand, punting the funding deadline by a few months would allow them to have more leverage in the new year, after President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House and the GOP takes control of the Senate. However, it would create a critical deadline early in Trump\u2019s term and take valuable time away from confirming his nominees and passing new bills. Another complicating dynamic is the looming vote for House Speaker.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Congress faces a Dec. 20 deadline to avert a government shutdown and is expected to kick the funding fight til early 2025 when President-elect Donald Trump will be in office.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As Congress returns this week for one last burst of activity before it wraps up the session, it faces a key deadline of Dec. 20 to avert a government shutdown.",
      "Democrats and Republicans appear resigned to passing a continuing resolution, or CR, that would temporarily fund the government into early 2025 \u2014 most likely March \u2014 as they run out of time to strike a full funding deal this year. The two parties haven't even agreed on an overall spending level for the new fiscal year, let alone how to allocate the money across parts of the government.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., alluded to the inevitability of a short-term bill Monday, saying, \u201cWe need to keep divisive and unnecessary provisions out of any government funding extension, or else it will get harder to pass a CR in time.\u201d",
      "For Republicans, that is a double-edged sword.",
      "The upside for Republicans in punting the deadline is that they would have more leverage to shape government funding in the new year, with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House and the GOP taking control of the Senate and maintaining a narrow House majority.",
      "The big downside is it would create a critical deadline early in the Trump presidency, potentially taking valuable time away from confirming his nominees through the Senate and from the big party-line bill that Republicans are looking at to extend his tax cuts and advance his immigration and border security agenda.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a lot of things at the same time,\u201d House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said of the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s second term. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be walking and chewing gum.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans would have preferred not to get bogged down with a funding deadline early in the new Trump presidency.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of things I would prefer. But realistically, we\u2019re not going to put together a budget between now and Christmas. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told NBC News. \u201cI expect us to have a CR probably through the middle of March. I expect that CR to be pretty thin.\"",
      "Kennedy added that Congress is likely to attach \"$30 [billion] to $40 billion of disaster relief\" to the CR, including funding for states hit by hurricanes this year. \"It won\u2019t be enough, but it\u2019ll be enough to get a start,\" he said.",
      "Funding the government is usually a messy process that requires bipartisan support, as the bills are subject to the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold. Democrats have significant power to shape the legislation regardless of the deadline; they hold the majority now, and beginning next year, Republicans will have 53 senators, far short of the 60 needed to control the process themselves.",
      "Another dynamic is that passing another massive Christmastime funding package would be a nonstarter for many House Republicans, and it could imperil House Speaker Mike Johnson's bid to get re-elected to the position on Jan. 3, particularly with the already slim GOP majority shrinking further.",
      "Another drawn-out speaker fight could also complicate Trump's presidency, albeit in different ways.",
      "Johnson's office had no comment on the length of a CR, saying it hasn't been settled yet.",
      "Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, which writes funding bills, said there's little time.",
      "\u201cOnce they decide what they\u2019re going to do \u2014 if they\u2019re going to try to get any of these appropriation bills done before or whether they\u2019re going to do a CR for all of them until March \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s the real debate. We can\u2019t get all of them done,\" he said. \"We could probably negotiate if we got a top-line number. We could probably negotiate several, maybe seven or eight, of the bills and get them done by the 20th, but would have to get that number fairly soon.",
      "\u201cSo my guess is \u2014 and it\u2019s just strictly my guess \u2014 is that we\u2019ll do a CR for everybody until end of March,\" he said."

      "A cast member since the show\u2019s first season, Colby Mayfield (Denim Richards) has been a regular ranch hand for the Duttons. We\u2019ve watched him play poker with the guys, develop a romance with one of the few female hands (Teeter, played by Jennifer Landon), get trampled by a horse while skinny-dipping, and overall be a solid, reliable character.

      "After the episode aired, Richards posted on his Instagram with a shot of his on-set director\u2019s chair, complete with folded clothes, boots and hat and the caption, \u201cGrateful.\u201d The show then tagged him on a video from the aftermath of his death with the words, \u201cAbsolutely heartbroken.\u201d",
      "Some fans were left unhappy with the decision. In the comments of \"Yellowstone\" account's post, one Instagram user wrote, \u201cZero reason to kill Colby. Zero\u2026 What\u2019s happened to Yellowstone?\u201d",

His laughter, camaraderie, and bravery brought warmth to the cold, unforgiving world of the ranch, and his departure has left an undeniable void,\" the comment read, and said later, \"Colby\u2019s journey may have come to an end, but the legacy he leaves behind will echo through the valleys of Yellowstone for seasons to come. As we say goodbye to Colby, we carry with us the lessons of loyalty, love, and resilience.\"",
      "Why did the show kill Colby off? 'It's a dangerous job'",
      "As executive producer Christina Voros (who also directed the first four episodes of this second half of the season) told The Hollywood Reporter, Colby\u2019s death was very much a risk inherent in his profession.",
      "\u201cFor anyone who really understands the lifestyle of cowboys and working with animals and the risks of the job \u2014 and Rip says it about himself \u2014 it\u2019s a dangerous job, and this kind of thing happens and it happens in a split-second,\u201d she said. \u201cThis death comes as a shock because it\u2019s so simple, and it\u2019s so grounded in the world in which all these characters work that it\u2019s profoundly tragic \u2026 and the timing of it is just gut-wrenching.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Entertainment Weekly published the day after the episode aired, Richards shared his own take on his character's death, saying the season is \"really emphasizing the realities of cowboy life.\"",
      "\"We have this saying that everyone\u2019s going to fall off a horse at some point in their life. It\u2019s not if, it\u2019s just when and how bad. That is not a phenomenon. These things do happen, so I do think that there\u2019s that element where I think it is about really wanting to emphasize that this is a reality,\" he said.",
      "He called Colby's death \"poetic\" because in Season 3, Colby is trampled by a multiple horses. \"Maybe this was those horses\u2019 ancestors coming back to get retribution,\" he said.",
      "Who else has died on this season of \u2018Yellowstone\u2019?",
      "Colby\u2019s death comes on the heels of the exits of patriarch John Dutton (Kevin Costner) and fixer-turned-Jamie\u2019s-girlfriend Sarah Atwood (Dawn Olivieri).",
      "Dutton\u2019s farewell wasn\u2019t so much of a surprise, as Costner had already stated he wouldn\u2019t be returning to the show via Instagram reel in June. (He said in a Nov. 11 interview with Michael Smerconish for SiriusXM that he didn\u2019t quit the show.)",
      "Atwood\u2019s death was preordained before Costner\u2019s exit, according to The Hollywood Reporter, but \u201cwe had to wrap this all up at lightning speed\u201d once Costner exited, Olivieri told the publication.",
      "All of these losses, from co-workers to family alike, are bound to have huge repercussions for the season\u2019s (and likely series\u2019) final episodes. Are we done with the bloodbath yet? Knowing \u201cYellowstone,\u201d don\u2019t count anyone safe until the very end."

And I looked across, and he had tears in his eyes,\" he said. \"That memory for me still brings up a lot for me just, you know, because it kind of made me reflect on not just the 14 years of the show, but my whole life's journey.",
      "Wahlberg went on to explain that he was a fan of Selleck before he worked with him.",
      "\"To watch this man on TV as a little kid in a family where we didn't know if the lights were going to get turned off tonight, and if I'd ever be able to watch TV again, to suddenly now I'm working with this man, and he's there to support me on my last day of work. It just filled me with tremendous humility,\" he said."

      "This sounds insane. My album title is a little bit insane, but we love the sparklemuffin.",
      "I feel like I probably relate to \"Big Love\" right now the most. It's this big, kind of explosive song about, a search for love, or feeling this like huge, sort of like, biblical love.",
      "I think, you know, just being with my daughter in the last six months, I really feel kind of like, heart explosion. So I would say \"Big Love.\"",

      "I think playing Karen in \"Daisy Jones & The Six\" had such an impact on me. I was playing a character that was so confident, that was part of a band, part of a unit.",
      "I knew I was going to be hanging out at Sound City Studios all the time. So I think acting in that, and putting myself in her shoes, and she's so brave and strong, you take on the character sometimes. I think it helped me get over a lot of my own insecurities, and made me kind of feel like I could go and make my record.",

      "Bode, who portrays the character Nessarose, the younger sister of Cynthia Erivo\u2019s Elphaba, posted a five-minute long video to her TikTok slamming the slew of negative comments she\u2019s received since the film premiered on Nov. 22.",
      "Despite enjoying seeing the outpouring of the love for the movie, Bode said there were reactions that made her feel \u201ca bit uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "In the video, Bode, who uses a wheelchair in real life and on screen, acknowledged that she is biased when it comes to her feelings about her own character. She said it was \"totally fine\" to make jokes about Nessarose\u2019s actions or personality because she is a fictional character.",
      "But, Bode explained, she was not okay with \u201caggressive comments and jokes about Nessa\u2019s disability,\u201d calling the messages \u201cdeeply uncomfortable because disability is not fictional.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, me, Marissa, is the person that is still disabled and in a wheelchair,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so it is simply a low hanging fruit that too many of you are comfortable taking.\u201d",
      "She continued, noting that in addition to her character, she's heard ableist jokes about herself. \u201cBefore even being cast in \u2018Wicked,\u2019 I had received comments just as me, Marissa,\u00a0not Nessa, around the words of \u2018Stand up for yourself,\u2019 \u2018I guess you can\u2019t stand him,\u2019 etc.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen these jokes are being made by non-disabled strangers with a punchline of not being able to walk, it very much feels like laughing at, rather than laughing with,\u201d she added.",
      "Bode said the most frustrating part about acknowledging such comments was how scared she was to voice her opinion.",
      "\u201cThese comments do not exist in a vacuum,\u201d she said. \u201cAggressive comments of wanting to cause harm and push Nessa out of her wheelchair, or that she deserves her disability are two very gross and harmful comments that real disabled people, including myself, have heard before.\u201d",
      "The actor noted that she has seen the repercussions that her peers have experienced when they have called out ableism.",
      "\u201cThese disabled creators\u2019 comments are flooded with ableist comments,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen speaking on ableism, they\u2019re told to just take a joke and that they\u2019re asking for too much, and to stop complaining, to the point where some of my disabled peers have needed to take a break online for their own mental well being.\u201d",
      "Bode then implored those listening not to dismiss the feelings of others, but rather \u201clisten to the people or to the person that it is affecting and how it makes them feel.\u201d",
      "\u201cThankfully, I\u2019m at a place in my life today where I can recognize these jokes about disability are made out of ignorance,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say the same about Marissa 10 years ago, and it would have affected younger me a lot more, and I\u2019m worried that a younger version of myself is somewhere on the internet and is harmed by these comments.\u201d",
      "She concluded her message with a lesson she learned from \u201cWicked,\u201d adding, \u201cLastly, I want to say one of the major themes within \u2018Wicked\u2019 is having the ability to listen and to understand one another, and I truly hope that is something a lot of you can practice more and take with you.\u201d",
      "Bode made her feature film debut in the John M. Chu directed movie. The actor, who hails from Wisconsin, performed in plays in middle school and high school before she attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles in order to study acting.",
      "Before landing the role of Nessarose, she worked as an after-school art teacher and mentor, telling TODAY.com that she felt \u201cbeyond privileged and lucky\u201d to be cast in \u201cWicked\u201d one year after she graduated from college. (Universal Pictures is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re not represented a lot and you don\u2019t see yourself, you still have \u2014 or at least I did have \u2014 a little bit of, \u2018I know what I\u2019m capable of. I know that I can act. I know other disabled talent that can act and can model,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cBut how much of the industry is willing to go for that and is willing to seek out disabled people and willing to listen? That was the one thing that I definitely bumped into.\u201d",
      "Bode is the first-ever physically disabled actor to take on the role of Nessarose, sharing that she was \u201cover the moon\u201d about the casting decision.",
      "She explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I saw a lot of when I was growing up, and if I did, it was like for one special episode and you never saw the character again.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "While the rest of the world was waiting to see if Taylor Swift would make it to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas from her \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Tokyo to watch Travis Kelce, two women were invested in this year\u2019s game for a different reason.",
      "On Super Bowl Sunday, Samantha DiPippo,\u00a0Hallmark\u2019s senior vice president for programming, was at a watch party texting friends and fellow Hallmark executives.",
      "Their eyes were on the Kansas City Chiefs, a centerpiece of the NFL season if not for a star player\u2019s new courtship with the world\u2019s biggest pop performer, then for entering their fourth Super Bowl in five seasons. Those folks at Hallmark, a mainstay for romance lovers, had some ideas. Could another Lombardi Trophy for the Chiefs help bring those ideas to fruition?",
      "They were about to see \u2014 and the game was a nail-biter. The San Francisco 49ers held on to an early lead, 10-3, going into halftime. After Kansas City pulled ahead in the third quarter, the score was tied 19-19 by the fourth, sending the championship game into overtime.",
      "DiPippo\u2019s phone was blowing up with messages from her team. Then, thanks to the \u201cpower of the Chiefs,\u201d and, she says, \u201ca little bit of magic,\u201d Kansas City won 25-22 after a touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Mecole Hardman.",
      "\u201cCandice (DiLavore, senior manager at Hallmark) and I are just texting back and forth thinking, \u2018I hope this happens. I hope this happens,\u2019\u201d DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cAs it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "The answer to that question became a resounding yes. That movie is Hallmark\u2019s \u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,\u201d premiering Saturday, Nov. 30. The movie airs at 8 p.m. ET on Hallmark Channel.",
      "The film was shot over a period of about 15 days on location in Kansas City, including three days at Arrowhead Stadium.",
      "As it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hallmark executive Samantha DiPippo",
      "TODAY visited the set of the film in July to meet the stars and see Jenna Bush Hager make her film debut with a cameo. This was all while witnessing firsthand the hundreds of extras, dozens of Christmas trees and four football fields worth of lights to make, in the words of DiPippo, \u201cthe largest movie that Hallmark Channel\u2019s ever done.\u201d",
      "A match made in Hallmark heaven",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was announced in June as part of Hallmark\u2019s 2024 \u201cCountdown to Christmas\u201d lineup, which included a new partnership between the Chiefs and Hallmark.",
      "You\u2019re forgiven if you thought this movie would follow the true-to-life plot laid out by Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s romance, though.",
      "For the uninitiated, the Swift-Kelce timeline looks like this: In September 2023, Swift attended a Chiefs home game after rumors that Swift and tight end Travis Kelce were an item. Kelce notably had attended her \u201cEras Tour\u201d show in Kansas City just months before, and after the concert, used his podcast to tell the world that he tried (and failed) to give Swift his number.",
      "The rest, as many know, is history.",
      "Though Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s story produced an audience with an appetite for more football romance, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d isn\u2019t about a player and a pop star (Lifetime has that movie, and it's full of references to Swift); this follows a Chiefs employee and an NFL super fan.",
      "The screenwriter of \u201cHoliday Touchdown,\u201d Julie Sherman Wolfe, who\u2019s written more than 20 films for Hallmark, says she\u2019s always wanted to write \u201ca big football movie.\u201d The offer for this project came just a week after the Super Bowl, when her team, the 49ers, experienced that crushing defeat.",
      "When tackling the script, Wolfe says she leaned into her own family\u2019s unique superstitions and traditions.",
      "\u201cIt really was coming from a place in my heart about what we love the most about the game. I guess I would love people to know that you don\u2019t have to be a Chiefs fan to enjoy this movie,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThe Chiefs are in the movie, and it is about them, but it\u2019s about more than that. It\u2019s about things that are bigger than a team. It\u2019s about your team.\u201d",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d first introduces Alana (Hunter King) and her family of Chiefs super fans who run a merch store. In comes Derrick (Tyler Hynes), who\u2019s in charge of fan engagement for the Chiefs and oversees the annual fan of the year contest (which is real, by the way). Alana\u2019s family is, of course, in the running.",
      "Though Wolfe says one doesn\u2019t have to love the Chiefs to appreciate the movie, its cameos will elate those who do: NFL mom Donna Kelce, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis all appear.",
      "The film even took inspiration from a real job in the Chiefs org. Jayne Martin has been the vice president of fan experience for 23 seasons. She says she is \u201cbridging the gap between the team and our fans.\u201d",
      "In March, Wolfe spoke with Martin to go over the premise of the storyline. They touched on Martin\u2019s job responsibilities and walked through potential scenarios that the film\u2019s leading man might encounter.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for (Wolfe) to ensure that the narrative was realistic,\u201d Martin says.",
      "Wolfe also brought aspects of her own football fandom to the plot. Alana\u2019s last name, Higman, came from her friend\u2019s maiden name, in honor of her family of Chiefs fans. Derrick\u2019s last name meanwhile is Young \u2014 a nod to the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl competitors.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s for Steve Young from the 49ers,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cI had to put something in there.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s the Higmans\u2019 lucky Chiefs hat, which drives a subplot. Alana\u2019s family has a superstition: The Chiefs only go to the Super Bowl when that old beanie is worn by a family member on Christmas. Derrick doesn\u2019t believe it though \u2014 so when the hat goes missing, things go awry.",
      "Originally, Wolfe\u2019s draft referenced a vintage Chiefs baseball hat. After they sent a couple pages of the script to the Chiefs, DiPippo recalls one of the team\u2019s executives saying, \u201cI\u2019m reading this, and I\u2019m just thinking of my grandpa. My grandfather had a vintage Chiefs winter hat, and he would wear it all the time while he was shoveling snow, and that\u2019s my memory of him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading it, I\u2019m in my kitchen crying, and I text one of our other execs, and I said, \u2018It\u2019s a winter hat now, it\u2019s a winter hat now!\u2019\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "The Taylor Swift of it all",
      "It\u2019s undeniable that NFL experienced in 2023 season what has been dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift effect,\u201d or the increase in exposure and female audience that follows the famous singer.",
      "\u201cThe magic, the romance of the Taylor Swift and Kelce union really got people in that romance mood \u2014 and romance plus football, right?\u201d Wolfe says.",
      "Exactly. For Hallmark, project ideas really started flowing in December 2023, after a pair of commercials leaned into just that.",
      "The first was a Hallmark ad, which aired Christmas Day on ESPN and stars Wolfe herself. In it, she sits at her computer as if typing a screenplay and lists the many ways the 2023 NFL season played out like a Hallmark movie, from \u201cincredible stories\u201d to \u201cunexpected romance.\u201d",
      "Then in January, the Chiefs released a postseason commercial titled \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which is framed as a spoof trailer for a Hallmark-esque film about a diehard NFL fan who works at a Chiefs gift shop. (Sound familiar?) Hynes plays that fan, and Donna Kelce notably makes a cameo.",
      "DiPippo says the ESPN ad was a \u201cgreat catalyst\u201d to \u201cHoliday Touchdown.\u201d Then \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which she calls a \u201clittle bit of a love letter to Hallmark,\u201d helped inspire the premise of the movie.",
      "Hynes says that when the Chiefs approached him for the \u201cFalling for Football\u201d commercial, it felt a little more \u201ctongue in cheek.\u201d But starring in \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d required him to treat the type of film spoofed in the commercial with integrity.",
      "\u201cThis is a legitimate Hallmark movie that is filled with all the heart, sincerity, warmth and joy that these movies always have,\u201d says Hynes, who has been in more than 15 Hallmark films, including six in the 2024 season.",
      "Martin says Chiefs fan demographics have changed since Swift first appeared at Arrowhead Stadium and is now about 57% female. \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d is an example of an attempt to reach and engage that new audience with the Chiefs and the NFL as a whole, Martin says.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened.\u201d",
      "Screenwriter Julie Sherman Wolfe",
      "Though DiPippo believes Hallmark\u2019s partnership with the Chiefs could have happened without Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s 100% a pure Hallmark movie at heart,\u201d she says \u2014 Wolfe believes\u00a0a little of fate was still at play.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened. It was meant to be,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThey got the right people and the right time and Travis and Taylor, and everything happened the way it was meant to happen for this movie.\u201d",
      "While appearing on TODAY Nov. 27, Hynes said it's \"impossible\" for the Swift-Kelce inspiration \"to not find its way into the movie.\"",
      "\"We're telling a multigenerational family story,\" he said. \"It feels like something quintessentially Hallmark while still servicing the people who want to see a big football movie.\"",
      "Christmas in July",
      "While \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d strays from Kelce and Swift's relationship, being part of the film is surreal for star Hunter King, who identifies as a Swiftie and has her own \u201cinvisible string\u201d connection to it all.",
      "Kelce and Swift\u2019s storybook romance notably started after he attended an \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Kansas City. On July 7, King attended a Kansas City show with her sister, actor Joey King, who appeared in Swift\u2019s \u201cMean\u201d music video in 2011, then in \u201cI Can See You\u201d almost 13 years later. At that July 7 concert, Joey King joined Swift onstage.",
      "\u201cThe day that we started filming I think was almost exactly a year later,\u201d Hunter King says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Wait a second. It really is a full circle moment for me.\u2019\u201d",
      "The production kicked off shrouded in secrecy. Casting was \u201cincredibly difficult,\u201d DiPippo says, because they couldn\u2019t share many details about the project, and \u201ceverything had NDAs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the most secretive we\u2019ve ever had to be on any project,\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "So when production started up around Kansas City in July, it drew a crowd. In addition to Arrowhead Stadium, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was filmed in the suburb of Independence, Missouri. The local pizzeria Square Pizza was transformed into a fictional barbecue restaurant called Norma & Nic\u2019s, managed by Donna Kelce\u2019s character. Inside, garlands with red ornaments bordered the ordering counter. Chiefs memorabilia hung on the walls, and wreaths decorated every door.",
      "The entire production involved about two dozen Christmas trees used in rotation \u2014 including 18 used in one day \u2014 as well as more than 400 yards of lights of \u201cevery color ornament bulb you can imagine,\u201d according to Daniel King, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u2019s\u201d production designer.",
      "Most behind the scenes were met with challenges, like set decorator Christi Whiteley, who was in charge of decorating and re-decorating up to 20 trees over the course of a few days, and property master Hunter Nelson, who made sure edible props like holiday meals and gingerbread houses were preserved at certain temperatures.",
      "And speaking of temperatures \u2014 the July heat was a hurdle for everyone.",
      "At Arrowhead, about 1,000 extras filmed inside the stadium, wearing parkas, scarves and other winter gear as the temperature reached 99 degrees, though felt more like 102, according to the Weather app.",
      "Hunter King filmed the Arrowhead Stadium scenes with an ice pack in her pants, a neck fan and an undershirt fan. On a discomfort scale of 1 to 10, Hunter King says filming in the sun felt like a 9.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mostly the sweaters and then the coat over it, and in this heat and in the humidity, that\u2019s what really, really cranks it up a notch,\u201d she says.",
      "The heat didn\u2019t deter fans, though. At one point, while filming in Independence, there were about 70 people watching and standing in the sun, DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cThey were coming in Chiefs gear. There were kids, there were grandparents. It was just so cute to see how excited they were just because we\u2019re filming in their town,\u201d she says.",
      "TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager, who makes a cameo as a sports journalist, wore a heavy wool coat paired with a sweater-like tank top and white trousers. While rehearsing her scene on the field of Arrowhead, crew members held up umbrellas for the actors. One of the director\u2019s last calls before \u201caction\u201d was the cue to put on jackets. The first thing each actor did after hearing \u201ccut\u201d was rip those coats off.",
      "Chiefs players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis appear in the film during a game scene, so they got to dress in their Chiefs uniforms.",
      "And luckily for Andy Reid, the head coach\u2019s cameo only took about 15 minutes to film.",

      "Earlier this week, Jenna revealed that Hoda, who is hosting her final Thanksgiving parade before she\u00a0leaves TODAY in early 2025, would have a special signal for her during the parade on a Nov. 27 episode of TODAY with Hoda & Jenna.",
      "The signal was inspired by the music video for the song \u201cRockaFellaCenta\u201d\u00a0by Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang, in which Hoda and Jenna make a guest appearance.",
      "In the video, Yang shimmies and shakes his arms in front of him when Rogers calls out Jenna. Meanwhile, Rogers and Hoda stand in front of a TODAY with Hoda & Jenna graphic.",
      "Hoda re-created her version of the move, with a double-fist-pump, for Jenna on their Nov. 27 episode of TODAY.",
      "During the 2024 parade, viewers could see Hoda give the signal to Jenna while 600 cheerleaders performed a routine to Chappell Roan\u2019s \u201cHot To Go\u201d as part of the Spirit of America Cheer show.",
      "Hoda gave the secret signal a second time while Australian singer Kylie Minogue performed \"Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head,\" even getting her co-host Savannah Guthrie to join in.",
      "It isn't the first time Hoda has given a secret signal while on camera during the parade.",
      "For years, Hoda has sent a hidden message to her children, Haley and Hope. \u201cEvery year I do a signal for my kids so that they know that mom is looking at them,\u201d Hoda told Jenna during TODAY With Hoda & Jenna on Nov. 22.",
      "In past years, Hoda has pulled on her ear on camera to give a signal to her daughters at home watching the parade. \u201cTold Haley I would give her a secret signal from parade to say I love you!\u201d tug on my ear a la @carolburnett),\u201d Hoda wrote on Instagram in 2020.",
      "Last year, before the 2023 Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade, Hoda revealed her daughters had asked her to blow a kiss to them. Hoda also shared she had another special signal to give out that year, but this time for her TODAY co-host Jenna Bush Hager.",
      "Hoda and Jenna came up with the\u00a0secret signal together, but, unlike this year, told no one what the signal was. During the parade, while her co-host Savannah Guthrie was speaking, Hoda quickly rubbed her teeth with her finger, as if to wipe off lipstick, while on camera.",
      "\u201cWhat I usually do for Jenna, and she does for me too, is on the air and before we go on, usually there\u2019s lipstick right here,\u201d Hoda said, pointing to her teeth. Jenna said no one knew about the signal, not even Savannah, who was surprised when Hoda made the motion while they were on camera.",
      "Jenna captured the moment and posted a screenshot of her co-host on Instagram, with the caption: \u201cWhat a true one\u00a0@hodakotb! Her secret sign!!!\u201d"

      "Lifetime's \"Christmas in the Spotlight,\" which premiered on the network Nov. 23, is seemingly inspired by the popular couple.",
      "The film focuses on mega pop-star Bowyn Sykes (Jessica Lord), who has blond hair, bright red lips and often sports a cat-eye. Bowyn is at the height of her career, focused on making music her fans love, baking for fun and not looking for a new boyfriend after being tired of only dating \u201cserious actors and indie rockers.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Drew \"Gonzo\" Gonville (Laith Wallschleger) is one of the best wide receivers in the league who, from the outside, seems like a playboy, but he really loves hanging out with his family and niece.",

      "The movie's writer Eirene Tran Donohue told USA Today that after seeing Swift cheering on Kelce during a football game, she thought, \"This could be a rom-com.\"",
      "\"I was like, \u2018Christmas and Taylor Swift?' These are the two great loves of my life,\" she said.",

      "Arrowhead is also notably the name of the Kansas City Chiefs' stadium, and the place where Swift and Kelce went public with their relationship.",

      "In \"Christmas in the Spotlight,\" Bowyn and Drew meet backstage at one of her concerts. Drew then attempts to get Bowyn\u2019s attention after their brief meet up backstage by inviting her to a game over social media.",

      "On their first date, which just so happens to be in Bowyn's private jet, the two have a myriad of song lyric interactions relating to Swift's \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\" Bowyn says, \"I'm a tough kid.\" Then, Drew notes, \"You look like you\u2019re having the time of your life.\"",
      "Newscasters in the film are also given seemingly Swift inspired names: Chad Marcus (\"Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus\") and Aimee Hannah (\"Thank You Aimee\").",

      "The couple breaks up, but the world is still unaware they were ever together. While Bowyn privately mourns the relationship, the media begins speculating when she will release her next \"catchy break up\" song.",
      "Angry at the media and missing Drew, Bowyn decides to show up at his game and surprise him, sitting in his family box. (Swift and Kelce famously went public after she attended the Chiefs-Bears matchup at Arrowhead Stadium Sept. 24, 2023. She's since become a fixture in the box at Chiefs home games.)",
      "In the film, Drew, who initially wasn't having a great game, immediately turns it around after seeing Bowyn. After he scores a touchdown, Drew strikes Kelce's signature archer pose, which Swift has also made on stage during her aptly-titled song, \"The Archer.\"",

      "Things start to look up after Bowyn and Drew make up, and the wide receiver is offered a contract with a football team in Los Angeles, potentially putting them in the same city.",
      "Then, Bowyn's ex leaks an edited recording of a conversation the two of them had in which she sarcastically says she is only with Drew for publicity reasons. He conveniently doesn't release the parts of the conversation where she defended Drew.",
      "While initially heartbroken, Drew finally believes Bowyn after his brother (also a football player) and sister-in-law show him the full video, proving she tried to defend him.",
      "This moment could be a reference to the phone call audio Kim Kardashian leaked in 2016 between Swift and Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, over the rapper using her name in his song \"Famous.\" The footage caused the internet to turn on Swift, beginning the #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty trending hashtag. In 2020, the full, unedited clip was released online.",
      "After the truth is revealed, Drew resigns himself to thinking Bowyn is out of his league.",
      "Before Drew's football game and a Christmas gala he was supposed to host (notably featuring Bowyn as a guest performer), his niece gives him a friendship bracelet for good luck, spelling out an indecipherable mix of letters.",

      "Friendship bracelets have become a staple accessory \u2014 often with acronyms for notable songs and lyrics \u2014 for the \"Eras Tour\" after Swift's song \"You're On Your Own, Kid\" referenced making them.",
      "In the grand finale of the film, Bowyn sings a Christmas love song at the gala and reveals she wrote it about Drew.",
      "(While Swift never confirms the inspiration for her songs, fans speculate that her songs \"The Alchemy\" and \"So High School\" are about Kelce.)",
      "The only snag for Bowyn? She's been told Drew isn't actually at the event and backed out of hosting.",
      "Nevertheless, she gives a speech declaring her love in the hopes he is watching a livestream of her performance. (During each \"Eras Tour\" show, fans can often find a livestream on social media of the show filmed by a concert attendee.)",
      "But surprisingly, Drew is there and catches her declaration of love.",
      "\"I will always be your biggest cheerleader,\" he says, tying back to Swift's \"You Belong With Me\" once more, before asking her, \"Are we doing this?\"",
      "Bowyn responds, \"Let's freaking go\" \u2014 a PG version of a phrase Swift was caught on camera appearing to say after the Chiefs scored a touchdown in September 2023."

      "Williams added that she hopes others with the same condition \u201cbenefit from my story.\u201d",
      "\u201cI continue to need personal space and peace to thrive,\u201d she concluded. \u201cPlease just know that your positivity and encouragement are deeply appreciated.\u201d",
      "There are questions around her cognitive state",
      "Even prior to Williams revealing her FTD diagnosis, many people were speculating that the star was having cognitive issues.",
      "\u201cHer care team is sharing this very personal update with her cherished fans, friends, and supporters to correct inaccurate and hurtful rumors about her health,\u201d the statement explained.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, many individuals diagnosed with aphasia and frontotemporal dementia face stigma and misunderstanding, particularly when they begin to exhibit behavioral changes but have not yet received a diagnosis.\u201d",
      "In the Lifetime documentary, Williams often appears to have cognitive difficulty when she speaks to her loved ones. Her son, Kevin Hunter Jr., and manager Will Selby both suggest at points that these issues are associated with her alcohol use.",
      "Williams currently has a court-appointed legal guardian who oversees her money and her health to avoid the potential for her to be exploited due to her cognitive issues, People reported.",
      "Williams\u2019 sister, Wanda Finnie, also told People in a story published in February 2024, that the star was in a wellness facility that specialized in treating cognitive issues.",
      "\"She\u2019s being treated for some of her mental deficiencies, some of the cognitive issues,\" Williams' niece, Alex Finnie, said in the documentary. \"They\u2019re getting to the root of the problem in terms of what causes maybe some of the drinking and other irrational decisions.\"",
      "Williams revealed she was diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease in 2018",
      "In February 2018, the talk show host announced she\u2019d be taking a three-week break from \"The Wendy Williams Show\" because she had been diagnosed with Graves' disease. About a week before, she'd canceled several shows due to experiencing flu-like symptoms. At the time, a rep for her show told TODAY.com in a statement that she'd had Graves' disease for \"many years.\"",
      "\u201cGraves\u2019 disease is an autoimmune condition that\u00a0stimulates the receptors on the thyroid gland to make more thyroid hormones,\u201d Dr. Deena Gupta-Adimoolam, a specialist in endocrinology and primary care prevention, tells TODAY.com. This overproduction of thyroid hormones, or hyperthyroidism, can lead to an increased heart rate, sweating, weight loss, anxiety, hair loss, difficulty sleeping and bulging eyes, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Williams noted that her fans had pointed out changes in her eyes when she revealed her diagnosis. \u201cGraves\u2019 disease squeezes the muscles behind the eyeballs,\u201d she explained, adding that it\u2019s caused her eyeballs to twitch.",
      "Williams returned to her show, but she had to take time off in 2019 and again in 2020 to cope with her illness.",
      "\u201cIf hyperthyroidism is untreated, it can be life-threatening,\u201d Adimoolam says. While there are treatments, such as medication, surgery and therapy, Graves\u2019 disease looks different for every person, she adds. Even with treatment, it might remain debilitating for some.",
      "Williams fainted on live TV in 2017",
      "In October 2017, Williams passed out during the Halloween episode of her talk show, kicking off the rumors about her health.",
      "Dressed as the Statue of Liberty, she was talking to the camera and then started to shake and struggle to speak before falling on the ground. The show cut to a commercial, and when it returned, she told viewers, \"That was not a stunt. I overheated in my costume. I passed out.\"",
      "The next day, she explained that prior to fainting, she felt \u201chot and a little dizzy.\u201d She said the paramedics later told her she was low on electrolytes.",
      "\u201cIt was scary,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was really scary. It was so scary, all I could think of in the middle of the scare was, \u2018Don\u2019t pull the podium over on you, because that\u2019ll make it worse.\u2019\u201d",
      "Williams has struggled with alcohol and cocaine use",
      "In 2013, Williams told NPR she used to be a \u201creal fiend\u201d when it came to drugs. \u201cI was addicted to cocaine,\u201d she said. \u201cCrack cocaine \u2014 cooking it, getting it up in the Bronx. ... Thank God I never got stopped by the cops to shame my family and myself and lose my job.\"",
      "In 2019, Williams revealed she was living in a sober house. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve had a struggle with cocaine in my past, and I never went to a place to get the treatment,\" Williams said during an episode of her show.",
      "The documentary and a February 2024 People cover story also reference her alcohol use. The documentary's executive producer Mark Ford told People: \u201cShe was already battling so much physically, and then it became clear that there were mental and addiction issues she was also battling.\"",
      "Throughout the documentary, multiple family members and Selby share their efforts to prevent Williams from drinking. Empty glasses and alcohol bottles are often shown around her apartment. In the final episode, Hunter also says that his mother was diagnosed with \u201calcohol-induced dementia.\u201d",
      "She fractured her shoulder in 2018",
      "In 2019, Variety reported that Williams fractured her shoulder in December of 2018, delaying her return to the show following the holidays. Williams was originally scheduled to return to the show on Jan. 7 but had to delay her return by a week to focus on recovery.",
      "She has lymphedema, especially in her feet",
      "In the documentary, Williams' lymphedema in her feet takes center stage at certain points. In one scene, she cries out and says she can't stand anymore. In another, she refuses to do exercises with a personal trainer to improve her stability out of fear of falling down.",
      "Lymphedema is a condition where the limbs \u2014\u00a0in Williams' case, her feet and legs \u2014 swell because the lymphatic system doesn't drain properly. Most often, it develops over a person's lifetime. It's not curable, and can be painful and lead to dangerous complications.",
      "\u201cThis is lymphedema,\u201d Williams says in the documentary as the camera shows her swollen feet. \u201cAnd I can only feel now 2% (of my feet). Do you see what this looks like?\u201d",
      "She first revealed her diagnosis in 2019 on her talk show. She gave a closer look at her condition during a 2022 segment with TMZ Live,",
      "\u201cNormally I would be in a wheelchair,\" she said, a sentiment she later echoed in the documentary.",
      "What is Wendy Williams doing today?",
      "Wendy Williams is \u201ccognitively impaired and permanently incapacitated,\u201d according to the latest update on her health from a filing by her guardian.",
      "One of the last updates came from her sister and niece, when they told People in February 2024 that she was staying in a wellness facility. They said that because of her court-appointed guardian, they cannot contact Williams, but Williams can reach out to them.",
      "\u201cI spoke with her yesterday, and I speak with her very regularly when she reaches out to me. She is, from what I understand, in a wellness, healing type of environment,\u201d Wanda Finnie said.",
      "\"She is in a healing place emotionally,\" she added. \"She\u2019s not the person that you see in (the documentary).\u201d"

      "The first \"Moana\" ended with a post-credits scene featuring Tamatoa, the famously shiny crab. When \u201cMoana 2,\u201d the sequel to the 2016 Disney movie, is finished, is it worth sticking around to catch a similar post-credits scene?",
      "Long story short: Yes. Like many Disney and Marvel movies, including the recent \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d \u201cMoana 2\u201d has a telling scene during the credits that hints at the future of the franchise. The scene also nods to another Disney movie series returning next November.",

      "Motufetu is cursed by Nalo (voiced by Tofiga Fepulea\u2019i), a lightning god famous for hating humanity. The curse will be broken if a human reaches the land \u2014 and Moana manages to, becoming a demi-God in the process.",
      "Nalo returns in the mid-credits scene. Previously seen only as a thunderous cloud, this time he's in human form with purple eyes and a lightening aura. He sits in his throne room, frustrated over Moana and Maui breaking his curse. He summons his servant Matangi (Awhimai Fraser), then confronts her about not stopping Moana. Unbeknownst to Nalo, Matangi had helped Moana find Motufetu.",
      "Matangi tells Nalo that she already paid her debt by laying dormant as a guard to the Motufetu portal for thousands of years. In response, Nalo magically puts Matangi in a lightning handcuffs and tells her, \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d",
      "As he begins scheming up ideas for vengeance, a familiar voice says, \u201cI can help you with that.\u201d",
      "Out of the shadows, and accompanied by an evil laugh, comes Tamatoa, the giant crab monster from the first movie voiced by Jemaine Clement. But after his brush with Moana, Tamatoa isn't looking as \u201cshiny\u201d as he used to.",
      "Tamatoa sketches out a plan for how he and Nalo can work together to bring down Moana and Maui.",
      "Then, he cracks a few jokes about singing a new song. \u201cI got a new one you\u2019re going to like. It\u2019s called 'Funky Crab Legs,'\u201d he pleads to Nalo, who looks on in disgust.",
      "The credits also have a subtle nod to \u201cZootopia 2.\" The character Gary appears in the form of a decorative image in the background of the scene.",
      "Will there be a \u2018Moana 3\u2019?",
      "Moana's two villains potentially team up in the credits, indicating the story could continue. As of right now, however, Disney has not announced a third movie. TODAY.com has reached out to Disney for comment about a potential \"Moana 3.\""

      "\u201cWe firmly support the Syrian army and government,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency, before he set off for Syria\u2019s capital Damascus on Sunday. \u201cThe Syrian army will once again be victorious over these terrorist groups as in the past,\u201d he added.",
      "His comments came after the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based war monitor, reported that insurgents led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham had seized control of Aleppo International Airport.",
      "The Observatory said that fighters from the group posted pictures from the airport that would mean it\u2019s the first international airport to be controlled by insurgents. The rebels now control \u201cthe majority of\u201d Aleppo after forcing the governor, police and security branches to retreat from the city center, it added.",
      "Russian and Syrian jets responded by striking the rebel-held city of Idlib on Sunday, according to the Observatory and the Syrian state-run news network Al-Ikhbariyah, in a second day of intensive bombing aimed at pushing back the insurgents.",
      "At least 347 fatalities, including 40 civilians, have been reported during the clashes, according to the war monitoring group, which relies on a network of on-the-ground information sources. Five children and three women were among the civilians killed by bombardment and airstrikes, it added.",
      "National security adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the U.S. has designated Hayat Tahrir al-Sham a \u201cterrorist enemy, so we have concerns, obviously, about that group.\u201d He also called for \u201cthe full implementation of U.N.

      "The offensive raises questions about the preparedness of Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s armed forces. In his first public comments released by the state news agency Saturday evening, Assad said Syria will continue to \u201cdefend its stability and territorial integrity against terrorists and their supporters.\u201d Syria is able to defeat them no matter how much their attacks intensify, he added.",
      "The Observatory reported Sunday that his forces were sending \u201clarge reinforcements and drawing a defensive line around several cities and villages\u201d in the Hama Governorate, which sits to the south of Aleppo.",
      "Iran\u2019s renewed commitment to Assad underscores the geopolitical stakes in the conflict and exposes a complex web of rivalries, factions and foreign interventions that ensure Syria\u2019s turmoil persists.",
      "While Assad controls roughly 70% of Syrian territory, the remaining areas are held by a mix of opposition groups, Kurdish forces and countries like the U.S. and Turkey.",
      "Tehran sees Syria as a critical part of its regional strategy, providing a land corridor to Hezbollah in Lebanon and a front against Israeli influence.",
      "Iran\u2019s support for Assad mirrors that of Russia, which helped to turn the tide of the war during 2016\u2019s battle for Aleppo between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters. The victory helped Assad to secure his hold on strategic areas of Syria, with opposition factions and their foreign backers controlling areas on the periphery.",
      "Moscow\u2019s intervention also secured its military presence in Syria, including the naval base at Tartus, while bolstering Assad\u2019s grip on power.",
      "A main backer of Syrian opposition groups, Turkey said in recent weeks its diplomatic efforts had failed to stop government attacks on opposition-held areas. These were in violation of a de-escalation agreement it sponsored along with Russia and Iran.",
      "However, its primary focus is undermining Kurdish-backed rebel groups near its borders. Ankara has said Syrian Kurdish fighters are an extension of the separatist Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since the 1980s \u2014 a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people.",
      "The U.S., for its part, opposes Assad, opposes Russia and opposes Iran, but has allied itself with Syrian Kurdish forces despite their fight against the United States\u2019 NATO ally Turkey.",
      "Sullivan said it was \u201cno surprise\u201d that rebels have tried to take advantage of the main players backing the Syrian government, because Iran, Russian and Hezbollah have been distracted by other conflicts.",

    "story": [
      "Australian lawmakers on Thursday approved a landmark ban on social media for children under 16 in some of the world\u2019s toughest such controls.",
      "The ban, which aims to address the impact of excessive social media use on children\u2019s physical and mental health, affects social media platforms including X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and Reddit, but not YouTube.",
      "The platforms, which bear sole responsibility for enforcement, have one year to figure out how to implement the age limit, which is the highest set by any country. If there are systemic failures to keep children from having accounts, the platforms are liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million).",
      "Senators debated the legislation late into the night on the last day of their parliamentary session, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor government had targeted as the deadline for it to pass. The bill, which is also largely supported by the opposition Liberal Party, passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday by a vote of 102 to 13.",
      "Supporters of the ban have cited the effect of harmful depictions of body image on girls and the effect of misogynistic content on boys. Its passage comes after a series of Australian teenagers died by suicide over what their families said was online bullying.",
      "\u201cThe basis for this is that there is a feeling amongst the majority of Australians that social media does more harm than good,\u201d said Rob Nicholls, a senior research associate in media and communication at the University of Sydney.",
      "A YouGov poll released Tuesday found that 77% of Australians support the ban, up from 61% in August.",
      "Other countries have tried to impose limits on social media for children, including the U.S., which requires technology companies to obtain parental consent to collect data from children under 13.\u00a0But the Australian proposal goes further, with no exemptions for parental consent or pre-existing accounts.",
      "Opponents have criticized the Australian ban as too blunt an instrument and said its passage was too rushed.",
      "The bill, which was introduced in Parliament last week, allowed for only one day to submit opinions on it. Sen. Matt Canavan, who opposed the bill, said there had been 15,000 submissions about it during that day and that lawmakers had been able to review only a fraction of them.",
      "\u201cThis is a highly emotional issue and there is an understandable demand for politicians to be seen to be \u2018doing something\u2019 about it,\u201d he said Tuesday in a dissent that was published as part of a Senate committee report. \u201cYet it is also a highly complex area that should be examined carefully not in the hasty fashion that has beset this process.\u201d",
      "Google and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had urged Australia to delay the legislation\u2019s passage Tuesday, saying more time was needed to assess the potential impact of the ban. ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, also said more consultation was needed.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X, blasted the ban last week as \u201ca backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all\u00a0Australians.\u201d",
      "Officials plan to enforce the age cut-off by trialing an age-verification system that could include biometrics or government identification, which no other country has tried, raising privacy concerns.",
      "A Senate committee signed off on the legislation late Tuesday but said social media platforms should find \u201calternative methods for assuring age\u201d rather than forcing users to submit personal information, such as their passports or other digital identification.",

      "Outside the legislature, the ban has come under heavy scrutiny from parents and scholars who say social media can be a crucial source of support for young people, especially those who feel marginalized.",
      "\u201cSocial media provides vital connections for many young Australians, allowing them to access mental health resources, peer support networks, and a sense of community,\u201d Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, said in a statement Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cCutting off this access risks exacerbating feelings of loneliness and isolation.\u201d",
      "The government has said it will ensure that young people have continued access to messaging apps such as WhatsApp, online gaming platforms such as Roblox and essential services related to health and education.",
      "\u201cYoung people, and in particular diverse cohorts, must be at the center of the conversation as an age restriction is implemented to ensure there are constructive pathways for connection,\u201d Sen. Karen Grogan, chair of the Senate committee on environment and communications legislation, said in its report.",

      "He said that while he is beyond the age cut-off, the ban would affect his audience, as well as the ability of some of the journalists on his team to do their work.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 Vanuatu on Monday urged the top United Nations court to recognize the harm caused by climate change in its judgment on the legal obligation of countries to fight it and address the consequences of them contributing to global warming.",
      "Vanuatu, one of the small island states that has spearheaded the effort to get the World Court to give a so-called advisory opinion, was the first of more than 100 states and international organizations to give its views during two weeks of proceedings.",
      "\u201cWe find ourselves on the front lines of a crisis we did not create, a crisis that threatens our very existence,\u201d Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu\u2019s special envoy for climate change and the environment, told the court.",

      "\u201cWe look to the court for recognition that the conduct which has already caused immense harm to my people and so many others is unlawful, that it must cease, and that its consequences must be repaired,\u201d he said.",
      "The hearings began a week after developing nations condemned as woefully inadequate the\u00a0outcome of the COP29 summit, where richer countries agreed to provide $300 billion in annual climate finance by 2035 to help poorer nations cope with climate change.",
      "While advisory opinions from the International Court of Justice or World Court are not binding, they are legally and politically significant. Experts say the court\u2019s eventual opinion on climate change will probably be cited in climate change-driven lawsuits in courts from Europe to Latin America and beyond.",
      "Solomon Islands youth climate activist Cynthia Houniuhi told the judges that the future for the young people in small island states was uncertain and currently determined by a handful of greenhouse gas-emitting countries that cause climate change.",

      "Aside from small island states and numerous Western and developing countries, the court will also hear from the world\u2019s top two emitters of greenhouse gases \u2014 China will speak on Tuesday and the United States is slated to give its views Wednesday. OPEC will not address the court, according to a revised schedule the court issued late on Monday.",

      "TOKYO \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that he would block a Japanese company\u2019s $15 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel, a contentious deal that faces widespread political opposition.",
      "Nippon Steel, Japan\u2019s largest steelmaker, announced the deal last December and has said it is determined to see it through despite concerns about the implications for employees, supply chains and U.S. national security.",
      "\u201cI am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,\u201d Trump said in a late-night post on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\u201cAs President, I will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!\u201d",
      "Trump had expressed opposition to the deal during the presidential election campaign, along with President Joe Biden and Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who all said the Pittsburgh-based company should remain American-owned. Trump\u2019s comments Monday night are his first on the subject since he won the election last month.",
      "A senior Nippon Steel executive told reporters last month that the company hoped to close the deal before Trump returns to the White House in January.",
      "Nippon Steel said in a statement Tuesday that it was \u201cdetermined to protect and grow U.S. Steel in a manner that reinforces American industry, domestic supply chain resiliency, and U.S. national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at U. S. Steel can manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "U.S. Steel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The deal is also opposed by the powerful United Steelworkers union, though some other U.S. Steel employees support it. U.S. Steel says it remains committed to the transaction as \u201cthe best deal for our employees, shareholders, communities and customers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe strongly believe the deal closes on its merits,\u201d U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt told CNBC in September.\u00a0\u201cIt strengthens national security, it strengthens economic security and it strengthens job security.\u201d",
      "The company has said the collapse of the deal would make the American steel industry less competitive globally and could cost thousands of union jobs at blast furnace facilities that might otherwise have to shut down.",
      "Nippon Steel has argued that the acquisition would benefit both companies and their employees, as well as the U.S. and Japan, a\u00a0key U.S. ally. A Japanese government official declined on Tuesday to comment on matters concerning the management of individual companies.",
      "\u201cThat said, our understanding is that it is essential for both of our nations to further strengthen economic relations, including the expansion of mutual investment in both of our countries, to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the Indo-Pacific region, and to cooperate with each other in the field of economic security,\u201d Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazuhiko Aoki told reporters in Tokyo.",
      "Nippon Steel says U.S. Steel would remain American-run, with Americans serving as three of the board\u2019s independent directors, as well as \u201ccore senior management members.\u201d It says it would prioritize production at U.S. Steel to meet demand in the American market, the company headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, and there would be no layoffs or plant closures as a result of the deal.",
      "Experts say that the deal has been politicized and that its failure could inadvertently help China, which produces more than half of the world\u2019s steel, maintain its dominance of the global market. American and international business groups have also expressed concern that the deal is being politicized.",
      "Biden allowed Nippon Steel this year to resubmit its filing with a government panel that reviews foreign investments for national security risks, giving it more time to allay bipartisan concerns. The deadline for the review, by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, is at the end of this month, though it could also be extended.",
      "Trump said he would find a way to preserve U.S. Steel as it is.",
      "\u201cThrough a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST!\u201d he said.",

      "In his first visit to sub-Saharan Africa, which comes at the end of his White House tenure, Biden is set to hold a bilateral meeting with his Angolan counterpart, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, in the capital, Luanda. He will also give a speech at the country\u2019s National Slavery Museum.",
      "Biden will also announce initiatives related to global health and security cooperation, among other things, a senior administration official said Friday.",
      "The president is also scheduled to fly around 300 miles from Luanda to the municipality of Lobito, where a port is the terminus of a railway line that his administration has poured billions of dollars into in an effort to redevelop and extend a precious minerals transit system.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re preparing the ground for eventually reaching all the way to Tanzania, connecting the Atlantic and Indian oceans,\u201d a second administration official said Friday, of the system which also runs through Zambia and Congo.",
      "The project aims to advance American presence in the region, which is rich in critical minerals used in electronic devices, vehicles and clean energy technologies and a key field for U.S competition with China.",
      "The second official also acknowledged that the administration\u2019s efforts have the appearance of playing catch-up with China, which has invested billions across Africa.",
      "Two years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China owned 72% of cobalt and copper mines, according to the China Global South Project, a U.S.-based nonprofit that tracks Chinese efforts in Africa.",
      "Biden, who stopped off en route in the Atlantic Ocean island of Cabo Verde off the west coast of Africa for a meeting with Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva, had to postpone his visits in the wake of Hurricane Milton so that he could oversee the federal response to the disaster.",
      "U.S. investment, the senior administration official said, is spurring economic growth for people in Africa in ways that Chinese spending isn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cIt does so by focusing on attracting investment by high-standards companies committed to high standards of labor, of gender equality, of health and of environmental stewardship,\u201d the official added.",
      "Carlo Angerer reported from Luanda, Angola, and Aaron Gilchrist from Dubai.",
      "CORRECTION (Dec. 2, 2024, 1:46 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated where Angola is located. It is in southern Africa, not West Africa."

    "story": [
      "It is the\u00a0world\u2019s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how extraordinary it is,\u201d said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. \u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Van Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature \u2014 which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July \u2014 is the first ever to take place.",
      "None has ever been seen alive at sea.",
      "The list of what scientists don\u2019t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don\u2019t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they\u2019ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don\u2019t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don\u2019t know how this one died.",
      "Over the next week, researchers studying the 5-meter (16-foot) -long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin hope to find out.",
      "\u201cThere may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,\u201d said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. \u201cWho knows what we\u2019ll discover?\u201d",
      "Only six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification.",
      "New Zealand is a\u00a0whale-stranding hotspot, with\u00a0more than 5,000 episodes recorded\u00a0since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.",
      "DNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species \u2014 and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn\u2019t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before.",
      "On Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks \u2014 normal, they said, and not the cause.",
      "The dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with M\u0101ori, New Zealand\u2019s Indigenous people. To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga \u2014 a precious treasure \u2014 and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.",
      "Members of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -\u2013 a prayer -\u2013 over the creature before the study begins.",
      "\u201cAccording to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,\u201d said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.\u201d",
      "The iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale\u2019s head this week.",
      "\u201cIt all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "It\u2019s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean\u2019s deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery.",
      "The assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery.",
      "\u201cWhat we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,\u201d said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \u201cIn discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.\u201d"

      "BUSAN, South Korea \u2014 Countries negotiating a global treaty to curb plastic pollution failed to reach agreement on Monday, with more than 100 nations wanting to cap production while a handful of oil producers were prepared only to target plastic waste.",
      "The fifth U.N. Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) meeting intended to yield a legally binding global treaty in Busan, South Korea, was meant to be the final one.",
      "However, countries remained far apart on the basic scope of a treaty and could agree only to postpone key decisions and resume talks, dubbed INC 5.2, to a later date.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that there is still persisting divergence,\u201d said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program.",
      "The most divisive issues included capping plastic production, managing plastic products and chemicals of concern, and financing to help developing countries implement the treaty.",
      "An option proposed by Panama, backed by more than 100 countries, would have created a path for a global plastic production reduction target, while another proposal did not include production caps.",
      "The fault lines were apparent in a revised document released on Sunday by the meeting\u2019s chair, Luis Vayas Valdivieso, which may form the basis of a treaty but remained riddled with options on the most sensitive issues.",
      "\u201cA treaty that ... only relies on voluntary measures would not be acceptable,\u201d said Juliet Kabera, director general of Rwanda\u2019s Environment Management Authority.",
      "\u201cIt is time we take it seriously and negotiate a treaty that is fit for purpose and not built to fail.\u201d",
