      "In its vaults, the museum preserves 15,000 artifacts seized or confiscated from the black market over the years by a police unit focused on the protection of cultural heritage. It is the loot of raiders who for decades have targeted sites from classical antiquity in southern Italy, such as Pompeii and Herculaneum. Some even used underwater metal detectors, GPS, sonar and drones to extract treasures from the shipwrecks and archaeological sites submerged in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "From its repository, the museum selected 600 pieces to display for visitors. Among them is a statue that had been in an apartment building's courtyard since the early 20th century until its theft in the 1980s, and which was found in 2009. There are artifacts from Pompeii that a French archaeologist bought from a local farmer in the 1990s for 50,000 lire (about $28 today). There are also ancient ceramics, coins, bronzes, marbles, pottery, furnishings, weapons and armor dating from the Archaic Period (approximately 650 to 480 BC) to the Middle Ages.",

      "In 2023, the latest year for which there are complete records, the police unit recovered over 100,000 artifacts which it estimates are worth a total 264 million euros ($299 million).",

We are all made of stardust and we all come from the stars.\u201d",
      "But the pop superstar was motivated by more than just curiosity. On Monday, she will join Jeff Bezos\u2019 fiancee Lauren Sanchez, journalist Gayle King and three other women on an all-female Blue Origin spaceflight. Perry spoke with The Associated Press at her Southern California rehearsal space on Wednesday, days before she was set to leave for training in Texas.",

      "An all-female spaceflight seems an apt endeavor for the 40-year-old Perry, whose collection of hits include songs about extraterrestrials (\u201cE.T.\u201d) and fireworks shooting across the sky (\u201cFirework\u201d), as well as feminist anthems like her 2013 hit, \u201cRoar,\u201d and \u201cWOMAN\u2019S WORLD,\u201d off her most recent album.",

      "Bezos\u2019 rocket company Blue Origin announced the crew in February. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, picked the women who will join her on a 10-minute spaceflight from West Texas aboard a New Shepard rocket. Perry, Sanchez and King will be joined by Aisha Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist who now heads an engineering firm, research scientist Amanda Nguyen and movie producer Kerianne Flynn.",
      "\u201cI am feeling so grateful and grounded and honored to be invited and included with this incredible group of women,\u201d Perry said. Whenever she gets nervous about the trip, she reminds herself how important it is.",
      "Blue Origin has flown tourists on short hops to space since 2021, after Bezos climbed aboard with his brother for the inaugural trip; the upcoming trip will be the company's 11th human spaceflight. Some passengers have received free rides, while others have paid a hefty sum to experience weightlessness. The company declined to comment on who is footing the bill for Monday's flight.",
      "The news of the upcoming trip has not been without critiques, most recently from actor Olivia Munn, who bemoaned the mission's cost and publicity. But Perry believes an all-women crew \u2014 the first since Valentina Tereshkova\u2019s solo spaceflight in 1963 \u2014 has historic ramifications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around,\u201d she said, citing the fact that only about 11% of the people who have gone to space have been women. \u201cI\u2019m excited for that number to be even more equal after this flight. And I just feel like, \u2018Put us in coach.\u2019\u201d",

      "Efforts to launch SNL in other countries, such as France, Japan and Italy, have typically been short-lived not though a version of the show remains on the air in South Korea.",

But while pursuing one of them who had reportedly been running through a backyard, police came upon Lauren in the front yard of her neighboring residence, holding a handgun.",

      "Lawyers for 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse over a 35-year span say they have been awarded $1.68 billion from a New York jury",
      "A New York jury on Wednesday awarded $1.68 billion in damages to 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse and other crimes over a span of 35 years, according to lawyers representing the plaintiffs.",
      "The decision stems from a lawsuit filed in Manhattan in 2022 after New York state instituted a one-year window for people to file lawsuits over sexual assault claims even if they took place decades ago.",
      "It marks one of the largest jury awards since the advent of the #MeToo movement, as well as in New York state history, said attorney Brad Beckworth, of the law firm Nix Patterson LLP, in an interview. The plaintiffs, he said, believe such a large verdict will send a message to powerful individuals \u201cwho don't treat women appropriately.\u201d",
      "The court had not yet released documentation of the verdict as of Wednesday night. Beckworth said the verdict included $280 million in compensatory damages and $1.4 billion for punitive damages to the plaintiffs.",
      "\u201cThis verdict is about justice,\u201d Beckworth said in a statement. \u201cBut more importantly, It\u2019s about taking power back from the abusers \u2014 and their and enablers \u2014 and returning it to those he tried to control and silence.\u201d",
      "Beckworth said the abuse took place between 1979 and 2014.",
      "Toback was nominated for an Oscar for writing 1991\u2032s \u201cBugsy,\u201d and his career in Hollywood has spanned more than 40 years. Accusations that he engaged in years of sexual abuse surfaced in late 2017 as the #MeToo movement gained attention. They were first reported by the Los Angeles Times.",
      "In 2018, Los Angeles prosecutors said the statutes of limitations had expired in five cases they reviewed, and declined to bring criminal charges against Toback.",
      "The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit in New York a few days after the state's Adult Survivors Act went into effect. The lawyers said they discovered a pattern of Toback attempting to lure young women on the streets of New York into meeting him by falsely promising roles in his films and then subjecting them to sexual acts, threats and psychological coercion.",
      "Mary Monahan, a lead plaintiff in the case, called the jury award \u201cvalidation\u201d for her and the other women.",
      "\u201cFor decades, I carried this trauma in silence, and today, a jury believed me. Believed us. That changes everything,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis verdict is more than a number \u2014 it\u2019s a declaration. We are not disposable. We are not liars. We are not collateral damage in someone else\u2019s power trip. The world knows now what we\u2019ve always known: what he did was real.\u201d",
      "Toback, 80, who most recently had represented himself, denied numerous times in court documents that he \u201ccommitted any sexual offense\u201d and that \u201cany sexual encounter or contact between Plaintiffs and Defendant was consensual.\u201d",
      "He also argued that New York's law extending the statute of limitations on sexual abuse cases violated his constitutional rights.",
      "A message sent to an email address listed for him seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "In January, the judge in the case entered a default judgment against Toback, who had failed to appear in court when ordered to do so. The judge then scheduled a trial for only damages last month to determine how much Toback had to pay the women.",

But at least since 1949\u2019s \u201cSorry, Wrong Number,\u201d phones have also been a reliable conduit for terror capable of reaching into the home, or your pocket. \u201cDrop,\u201d a silly but suspenseful new thriller, carries on the tradition of \u201cWhen a Stranger Calls\" and \u201cPhone Booth\u201d by situating its tension around mysterious, threatening phone messages.",

When they sit down in a fancy restaurant high up a sleek Chicago high-rise, he\u2019s charming and relaxed. But Violet, like countless dates before her, can\u2019t stay off her phone.",
      "In Violet\u2019s case, though, the distraction is legitimate. She keeps getting messages dropped to her phone threatening her son, who\u2019s at home with Violet\u2019s sister (Violett Beane), unless she does what he says, including killing her date. In her home security cameras she can see a man with his face covered brandishing a gun.",
      "\u201cDrop,\u201d directed by Christopher Landon (\u201cHappy Death Day\u201d), doesn\u2019t differ greatly from the large swath of high-concept, low-budget thrillers that regularly flood theaters. But it\u2019s a taut little movie, almost totally set in the restaurant, with a just keen enough sense of plausible and preposterous. It knows to keep the pressure-cooker plot moving while not overstaying its welcome. At a nifty 95 minutes, \u201cDrop\u201d knows when to hang up.",
      "As if adding a digital twist to the old line \u201cThe call is coming from inside the house,\u201d Violet is getting message from an app called DigiDrop that can only be sent from a person within 50 feet. That means everyone in the restaurant \u2014 the bro who bumps into her, the cheesy waiter, the kind bartender \u2014 is a suspect. With her terrorizer watching her every move and prohibiting her from breathing a word to anyone, Violet is stuck rooted to her table when every fiber of her being wants to rescue her son.",
      "A considerable help to the film are the grounded screen presences of Fahy (\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d) and Sklenar (\u201c1923\u201d), both small-screen breakouts who here show movie-star poise. As the plot unspools, there are, naturally, quibbles one could make. Would a mother, with a masked gunman outside her toddler\u2019s door be able to feign interest in a duck salad? Does the highly orchestrated trap laid for her match the motives of the criminal mastermind? And while we're asking questions, could we not someday get a phone-themed thriller titled \u201cButt Dial\u201d?",
      "But if \u201cDrop\u201d is invariably quite a bit less than realistic, it has a whiff of metaphor. Violet isn\u2019t just stepping back into the dating pool as a single mom, she\u2019s trying to shake the past trauma of spousal abuse. Going on a date with Henry, whom she met on an app, is a kind of crap shoot. Will going out with a stranger met online end in love or violence?",
      "You could also read \u201cDrop\u201d as an extreme version of a more ubiquitous scourge. This is a movie where the bad guy, for nearly the duration of the movie, is nothing but text messages. (They are typically flashed large across the screen.) As Violet grows increasingly preoccupied and frantic, she could be just about anyone \u2014 a workaholic after hours, a teenager, a desperate Knicks fan watching the score \u2014 whose attention is held prisoner by her phone. How much of the terror of \u201cDrop\u201d would have existed at all, if she had just put it on silent?",
      "\"Drop,\u201d a Universal Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for strong violent content, suicide, some strong language and sexual references. Running time: 95 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "Marvin Levy, Steven Spielberg\u2019s publicist for over four decades and the only person in his field to be recognized with an Oscar, has died. He was 96.",
      "Levy died Monday in Los Angeles surrounded by loved ones, representatives for Amblin Entertainment said Wednesday. No cause was given.",
      "\u201cMarvin\u2019s passing is a huge loss for me and our industry writ large. There are many talented PR executives, but Marvin was one of a kind,\u201d Spielberg said in a statement. \u201cI am grateful for all our years together. Marvin never failed to make me laugh, he never stopped smiling. We will miss you Marvin. You will always be in our hearts and your memory will always make us smile.\u201d",
      "Levy's long-standing partnership with Spielberg made him one of the most renowned and respected publicists in Hollywood. Over his 70-year career, he worked on campaigns for film classics like \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cKramer vs. Kramer,\u201d \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\" \u201cJurassic Park\" and \"Gladiator.\"",
      "In 2018, Levy, a long-standing member of the film academy's public relations branch, became the first and only publicist to receive an honorary Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. No publicist\u2019s name had even been put forth for the award before Levy's.",
      "\u201cIt was way out of left field for me. I couldn\u2019t have imagined it,\u201d Levy told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I could say \u2018Gee, I\u2019d love to get that one day.\u2019 It was not on my to-do list.\u201d",
      "Born in Manhattan on Nov. 16, 1928, Levy was raised on the east side and attended New York University. Though he never set out to be a publicist specifically, he knew he had a way with words. One of his first jobs was writing questions for a TV quiz show. But he was fired when his \u201cbig ticket\u201d question was answered too early in the season.",
      "His first publicity job was at MGM in New York, where he was so far down on the ladder that he never got to travel to Los Angeles, but where he worked on campaigns for films like \u201cGigi\u201d and \u201cBen-Hur.\u201d By the time the company was remaking \u201cMutiny on the Bounty,\" he knew it was time to move on.",
      "Levy soon found his way to legendary publicists Arthur Canton and Bill Blowitz, and then Columbia Pictures which took him to California. It was during that time that he first started working with Spielberg who was fresh off \u201cJaws.\u201d He was told he was only to concentrate on \u201cClose Encounters.\" By 1982, he went full time with Spielberg and wouldn\u2019t look back.",
      "While he had many highs in the industry, Levy also recalled a big heartbreak when \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d lost the best picture trophy to \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d at the 71st Academy Awards.",
      "\u201cThat was the toughest night of my life in terms of the business,\u201d Levy said. But he put on a brave face at the Governor's Ball following the ceremony.",
      "Tom Hanks presented the honorary Oscar to Levy in 2018, noting that it takes, \u201cSomething of a storyteller to get an audience hooked on the story without giving away the story.\u201d",
      "Levy remained devoted to Spielberg, and Amblin Entertainment, up to his full retirement in 2024. For him, it never got old.",
      "\u201cHow lucky can you be? I mean it,\u201d he said in 2018. \u201cWe work for the best filmmaker around.\u201d",
      "Levy is survived by his wife of 73 years, Carol, their two sons, Don and Doug, and two grandsons, Brian and Daniel.",

      "Springtime sunshine has finally hit New York City, and that means the Met Gala beckons",
      "NEW YORK -- As springtime sunshine finally hits New York City, the Met Gala beckons \u2014 one of the most anticipated and visible parties in the world.",
      "This year, the theme \u2014 \u201cTailored For You\" \u2014 is focused on classic tailoring. As always, the dress code is inspired by the spring exhibit at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Met show to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years to have a menswear theme. The show looks at the evolution of Black style over the centuries through the lens of dandyism.",
      "Here are some key things to know as fashion's biggest night approaches:",
      "The gala happens the first Monday in May \u2014 this year, May 5.",
      "Not everyone knows that the gala is actually a fundraiser for the Costume Institute, the only self-funding department at the Met. Last year the evening brought in a whopping sum of more than $26 million to the museum's coffers.",
      "Definitely not. It started in 1948 as a Manhattan society midnight supper \u2013 held at various places like the Waldorf Astoria and the Rainbow Room. It took many years before it turned into a global event and one of the starriest nights of the year.",
      "Each year brings a new group of celebrity co-chairs. This year they are Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, and A$AP Rocky \u2014 along with Anna Wintour, the influential Vogue editor who always oversees the proceedings. NBA superstar LeBron James is honorary chair.",
      "Word on attendees trickles out slowly in the weeks leading up to the event. But this year there\u2019s also a huge additional host committee with stars from various fields. (They don\u2019t have specific host duties, other than showing up and, it goes without saying, looking fabulous.)",
      "It includes athletes Simone Biles and husband Jonathan Owens, Angel Reese and Sha\u2019Carri Richardson; filmmakers Spike Lee, Tonya Lewis Lee and Regina King; and actors Ayo Edebiri, Audra McDonald and Jeremy Pope, and musicians Doechii, Usher, Tyla, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Andr\u00e9 3000.",
      "Also in the group are author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; artists Jordan Casteel, Rashid Johnson and Kara Walker; playwrights Jeremy O. Harris and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins; and fashion figures Grace Wales Bonner, Edward Enninful, Dapper Dan and Olivier Rousteing.",
      "The code is meant to be a guide, not a hard rule, and loose interpretation is encouraged. Sometimes, that interpretation extends not only to what guests put on, but what they take off. Lady Gaga did a 16-minute striptease on the gala carpet in 2019. Jared Leto spent the evening in 2023 carrying around his huge cat head, a tribute to Karl Lagerfeld's beloved pet.",
      "Guests enter the museum and walk past an enormous flower arrangement in the museum\u2019s grand lobby \u2013 always a talking point. Often there is an an orchestra playing nearby. At the top of the grand staircase, Wintour and her co-hosts form a receiving line. Guests then head either to cocktails or to view the exhibit. Cocktails are followed by dinner. The most hotly anticipated guests sometimes skip cocktails and even dinner, and arrive around dessert time for maximum impact (we're looking at you, Rihanna).",

Officials had earlier rescued Dotel from the debris and transported him to a hospital. Also killed was Dominican baseball player Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera, said Satosky Terrero, league spokesman.",
      "It\u2019s an iconic nightclub in southern Santo Domingo that has operated for nearly five decades. It was known for its \u201cJet Set Mondays\u201d that featured local and international artists.",

      "The self-proclaimed \u201crock & roll survivalist\u201d started playing the drums when he was 14 in his school orchestra but was kicked out for playing too loud, according to Blondie\u2019s website.

      "The band recorded its first album in 1976 and by the following year was touring with such icons as Iggy Pop and David Bowie. It became known as the most commercially successful band to emerge from a fertile New York rock scene that also produced Talking Heads and the Ramones.",

    "story": [
      "The measles outbreak in West Texas didn\u2019t happen just by chance",
      "The measles outbreak in West Texas didn\u2019t happen just by chance.",
      "The easily preventable disease, declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, ripped through communities sprawling across more than 20 Texas counties in part because health departments were starved of the funding needed to run vaccine programs, officials say.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a strong immunization program that can really do a lot of boots-on-the-ground work for years,\u201d said Katherine Wells, the health director in Lubbock, a 90-minute drive from the outbreak's epicenter.",
      "Immunization programs nationwide have been left brittle by years of stagnant funding by federal, state and local governments. In Texas and elsewhere, this helped set the stage for the measles outbreak and fueled its spread. Now cuts to federal funding threaten efforts to prevent more cases and outbreaks.",
      "Health departments got an influx of cash to deal with COVID-19, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make up for years of neglect. On top of that, trust in vaccines has eroded. Health officials warn the situation is primed to get worse.",
      "Recent cuts by the Trump administration have pulled billions of dollars in COVID-19 related funding \u2014 $2 billion of it slated for immunization programs for various diseases. Overseeing the cuts is Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who rose to prominence leading an anti-vaccine movement. While Kennedy has said he wants his agency to prevent future outbreaks, he's also declined to deliver a consistent and forceful message that would help do so \u2014 encouraging people to vaccinate their children against measles while reminding them it is safe.",
      "At the same time, lawmakers in Texas and about two-thirds of states have introduced legislation this year that would make it easier to opt out of vaccines or otherwise put up barriers to ensuring more people get shots, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. That further undercuts efforts to keep infectious diseases at bay, health officials said.",
      "The more than 700 measles cases reported this year in the U.S. have already surpassed last year\u2019s total. The vast majority \u2014 more than 540 \u2014 are in Texas, but cases have popped up in 23 other states. Two Texas children have died. A 6-year-old girl from Gaines County, the center of the outbreak, died in February, the first measles death in the U.S. in a decade. An 8-year-old girl from the same town, Seminole, died earlier this month.",
      "Children in the U.S. are generally required to be vaccinated to go to school, which in the past ensured vaccination rates stayed high enough to prevent infectious diseases like measles from spreading. But a growing number of parents have been skipping the shots for their kids. The share of children exempted from vaccine requirements has reached an all-time high, and just 92.7% of kindergartners got their required shots in 2023. That\u2019s well below the 95% coverage level that keeps diseases at bay.",
      "Keeping vaccination rates high requires vigilance, commitment and money.",
      "Though the outbreak in Texas started in Mennonite communities that have been resistant to vaccines and distrustful of government intervention, it quickly jumped to other places with low vaccination rates. There are similar under-vaccinated pockets across the country that could provide the tinder that sparks another outbreak.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a hurricane over warm water in the Caribbean,\u201d said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in Houston. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s warm water, the hurricane will continue to accelerate. In this case, the warm water is the unvaccinated kids.\u201d",
      "Lubbock receives a $254,000 immunization grant from the state annually that can be used for staff, outreach, advertising, education and other elements of a vaccine program. That hasn\u2019t increased in at least 15 years as the population grew.",
      "It used to be enough for three nurses, an administrative assistant, advertising and even goodies to give out at health fairs, Wells said. \u201cNow it covers a nurse, a quarter of a nurse, a little bit of an admin assistant, and basically nothing else.\u201d",
      "Texas has among the lowest per capita state funding for public health in the nation, just $17 per person in 2023, according to the State Health Access Data Assistance Center.",
      "Vaccines are among the most successful tools in public health\u2019s arsenal, preventing debilitating illnesses and lowering the need for expensive medical care. Childhood vaccines prevent 4 million deaths worldwide each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says the measles vaccine will save some 19 million lives by 2030.",
      "U.S. immunization programs are funded by a variable mix of federal, state and local money. Federal money is sent to every state, which then decides how much to send to local health departments.",
      "The stagnant immunization grant funding in Texas has made it harder for local health departments to keep their programs going. Lubbock\u2019s health department, for example, doesn't have the money to pay for targeted Facebook ads to encourage vaccinations or do robust community outreach to build trust.",
      "In Andrews County, which borders Gaines County, the biggest cost of its immunization program is personnel. But while everything has gotten more expensive, the grant hasn't changed, Health Director Gordon Mattimoe said. That shifts the burden to county governments. Some kick in more money, some don\u2019t. His did.",
      "The problem: keeping people safe from outbreaks requires high vaccination rates across a broad region, and germs don\u2019t stop at county borders.",
      "Andrews County, population 18,000, offers a walk-in vaccine clinic Monday through Friday, but other West Texas communities don\u2019t. More than half the people who come to the clinic travel from other counties, Mattimoe said, including much larger places and Gaines County.",
      "Some had to drive an hour or more. They did so because they had trouble getting shots in their home county due to long waits, lack of providers and other issues, Mattimoe said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re unable to obtain it in the place that they live. ... People are overflowing, over to here,\u201d Mattimoe said. \u201cThere\u2019s an access issue.\u201d",
      "That makes it more likely people won\u2019t get their shots.",
      "In Gaines County just 82% of kindergartners were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella. Even in Andrews County, where, at 97%, the vaccination rate is above the 95% threshold for preventing outbreaks, it has slipped two percentage points since 2020.",
      "The health departments millions of Americans depend on for their shots largely rely on two federal programs: Vaccines for Children and Section 317 of the Public Health Services Act. Vaccines for Children mostly provides the actual vaccines. Section 317 provides grants for vaccines but also to run programs and get shots into arms.",
      "About half of kids qualify for Vaccines for Children, a safety-net program created in response to a 1989-1991 measles epidemic that sickened 55,000 people and killed 123. Section 317 money sent to state and local health departments pays for vaccines as well as nurses, outreach and advertising.",
      "Health departments generally use the programs in tandem, and since the pandemic they\u2019ve often been allowed to supplement it with COVID-19 funds.",
      "The 317 funds have been flat for years, even as costs of everything from salaries to vaccines went up. A 2023 CDC report to Congress estimated $1.6 billion was needed to fully fund a comprehensive 317 vaccine program. Last year, Congress approved less than half that: $682 million.",
      "This, along with insufficient state and local funding, forces hard choices. Dr. Kelly Moore, a preventive medicine specialist, said she faced this dilemma when directing Tennessee's immunization program from 2004 to 2018.",
      "\u201cWhat diseases can we afford to prevent and how many people can we afford to protect? Those decisions have to be made every year by every state,\u201d said Moore, who now runs the advocacy group Immunize.org.",
      "A rural clinic may have to be closed, or evening and weekend hours eliminated, she said. \u201cIt becomes difficult for them to staff the clinics they have and difficult for the people in those communities to access them, especially if they\u2019re the working poor.\u201d",
      "At the same time, health officials say more funding is needed to fight misinformation and mistrust about vaccines. In a 2023 survey by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, 80% of local health departments reported vaccine hesitancy among patients or their parents in the previous year, up from 56% in 2017.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t invest in education, it becomes even more difficult to get these diseases under control,\" Moore said.",
      "Facing these headwinds, things got much worse in March when Kennedy\u2019s health department canceled billions of dollars in state and local funding. After 23 states sued, a judge put a hold on the cuts for now in those states but not in Texas or other states that didn\u2019t join the lawsuit.",
      "But local health departments are not taking chances and are moving to cut services.",
      "HHS said the money, allocated through COVID-19 initiatives, was cut because the pandemic was over. But CDC had allowed the money to be used to shore up public health infrastructure generally, including immunization programs.",
      "Before he was confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy vowed not to take vaccines away. But in Texas, his department\u2019s cuts mean state and local health departments are losing $125 million in immunization-related federal funding as they deal with the measles outbreak. A spokesperson for the federal health department did not respond to an AP request for comment.",
      "Dallas County, 350 miles from where the outbreak began, had to cancel more than 50 immunization clinics, including at schools with low measles vaccination rates, said Dr. Philip Huang, the county\u2019s health director.",
      "Near the center of the outbreak, Lubbock\u2019s health department said seven jobs are on the line because they were paid by those grants. Included in the affected work are immunizations.",
      "Across the border in New Mexico, where the outbreak has spread, the state lost grants that funded vaccine education.",
      "It's still unclear how the recently announced $2 billion in cuts will affect immunization programs across the country, but details are starting to trickle out from some states.",
      "Washington state, for example, would lose about $20 million in vaccination-related funding. Officials were forced to pause mobile vaccine efforts on their \u201cCare-A-Van,\u201d which has administered more than 6,800 COVID-19 vaccines, 3,900 flu vaccines and 5,700 childhood vaccines since July. The state also had to cancel more than 100 vaccine clinics scheduled through June, including more than 35 at schools.",
      "Connecticut health officials estimate if the cuts stand, they will lose $26 million for immunization. Among other reductions, this means canceling 43 contracts with local health departments to increase vaccination rates and raise confidence in vaccines, losing vaccination clinics and mobile outreach in underserved neighborhoods, and stopping the distribution of vaccine-related educational materials.",
      "Several of the 23 states suing the federal government, including Minnesota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, cite losses to vaccine programs.",
      "As the cuts further cripple already struggling health departments, alongside increasingly prominent and powerful anti-vaccine voices, doctors worry that vaccine hesitancy will keep spreading. And measles and other viruses will too.",
      "\u201cMy whole life\u2019s purpose is to keep people from suffering. And vaccines are a tremendous way to do that,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t invest in them to get them in arms, then we don\u2019t see their benefits.\u201d",

      "Shortly before the crash, the pilot had radioed air traffic control at Columbia County Airport to say he had missed the initial approach and requested a new approach plan, officials with the National Transportation Safety Board said at a Sunday briefing. While preparing the new coordinates, air traffic controllers attempted to relay a low altitude alert three times, with no response from the pilot and no distress call, officials said.",

      "Among the victims were Karenna Groff, a former MIT soccer player named the 2022 NCAA woman of the year; her father, a neuroscientist, Dr. Michael Groff; her mother, Dr. Joy Saini, a urogynecologist; her brother, Jared Groff, a 2022 graduate of Swarthmore College who worked as a paralegal; Alexia Couyutas Duarte, Jared Groff's partner who also graduated Swarthmore and planned to attend Harvard Law School this fall; and Karenna Groff's boyfriend, James Santoro, another recent MIT graduate, according to a family statement Sunday.",
      "\u201cThey were a wonderful family,\u201d James' father, John Santoro, told AP. \u201cThe world lost a lot of very good people who were going to do a lot of good for the world if they had the opportunity. We\u2019re all personally devastated.\u201d",
      "Santoro said his son first met Karenna Groff as a freshman studying at MIT. Groff, who grew up in Weston, Massachusetts, was an All-American soccer player studying biomedical engineering. Santoro, a math major from New Jersey, played lacrosse for the school.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Karenna Groff co-founded openPPE, helping to create a new design of masks for essential workers. In 2023, she received the prestigious NCAA woman of the year award for the previous year for her on- and off-field accomplishments.",

      "The pilot was flying under instrument flight rules, rather than visual flight rules, but it was too soon to determine if reduced visibility from weather conditions were a factor, he said.",
      "The plane had been sold a year ago and had an upgraded cockpit with newer technology that was certified to Federal Aviation Administration standards, according to the NTSB.",
      "Investigators expect to be at the crash site for about a week and a full accident report could take between 12 and 24 months to complete, Inman said.",

    "story": [
      "A key program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle chronic disease in Native American and Alaska Native communities has been gutted in the federal health layoffs",
      "CHANDLER, Ariz. -- CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent time in tribal communities in Arizona and New Mexico this week highlighting ways they are trying to prevent chronic disease among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, something he has said is one of his top priorities.",
      "But Kennedy didn't appear to publicly address a Native health program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle disproportionate rates of conditions like diabetes and liver disease. The program, called Healthy Tribes, was gutted in this month's federal health layoffs.",
      "Some Native leaders say they are having trouble grasping the dissonance between Kennedy's words and his actions. With little information, they wonder if Healthy Tribes is part of the Trump administration's push to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. There also is confusion about what and who is left at the 11-year-old program, which was part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under Kennedy's agency, and doled out $32.5 million a year.",
      "Tribal leaders and health officials told The Associated Press that cuts to the Healthy Tribes program are another violation of the federal government\u2019s legal obligation, or trust responsibility, to tribal nations under treaties, law and other acts. That includes funding for health care through the Indian Health Service, as well as education and public safety for citizens of the 574 federally recognized tribes.",
      "But federal funding has long fallen short of meeting those needs, leaving tribal governments to rely on additional grants and programs like Healthy Tribes.",
      "\u201cSo many layers of communications of collaboration and partnerships have just been turned off,\u201d said Onawa Miller, a Quechan Indian Nation citizen and director of tribal public health for United South and Eastern Tribes, which serves 33 tribes in those regions of the U.S. She said her organization already has received its annual $2 million in Healthy Tribes funding.",
      "Several tribal facilities received an email from a CDC employee April 1 notifying them that the positions of many people who staffed the Healthy Tribes program had been eliminated \u201cas part of the reduction in force efforts at CDC.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees union, which represents thousands of workers at the CDC in Atlanta, said more than 30 civil servant jobs were or are being eliminated. That includes 11 positions in the Healthy Tribes program and others in the larger Division of Population Health.",
      "An email sent to the account of Healthy Tribes director Dr. Julianna Reece, an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, was met with an automated reply: \u201cDue to the recent HHS reduction in force, I have been placed on administrative leave and will be separated from the agency on June 2nd.\u201d Reece did not respond to requests for comment sent to her federal and personal email accounts.",
      "Part of the government upheaval in the past several weeks includes top officials at the National Institutes of Health being offered transfers to Indian Health Service offices far from Washington, D.C. The National Indian Health Board also has said the government eliminated key staff and programs at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health\u2019s Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health.",
      "The government is required to consult with tribes on decisions impacting them, like mass layoffs in February at the Indian Health Service that were rescinded hours later, and tribal leaders have warned the Trump administration that such consultations are not happening. In some cases tribes can take legal action against the U.S. for failing to meet its trust responsibilities.",
      "\u201cIt is a violation of trust, without a doubt,\u201d said W. Ron Allen, chairman of the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam Tribe in Washington state.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not answer questions related to the Healthy Tribes cuts but told the AP in an email that the Indian Health Service was not impacted by this month's workforce reductions and there are no plans to consolidate any of its offices.",
      "Kennedy's swing through the Southwest included a visit to a community health center in metro Phoenix that provides physical and mental health care to Native people and a hike with the Navajo Nation president. He also moderated a panel at the Tribal Self-Governance Conference, held on the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona, but didn't take questions from the audience, tribal leaders on stage or journalists.",
      "Allen said he had a constructive conversation with Kennedy, reminding him IHS is already underfunded and understaffed and that tribes rely on additional federal grants and programs.",
      "\u201cYour issue is to reduce the central office, and so we\u2019re OK with that, but move the functions that serve the tribes out to the tribes,\u201d Allen said he told Kennedy. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t have those resources, how are we gonna make our communities healthy? He agrees.\u201d",
      "Research shows Native Americans have shorter life expectancies than other ethnic groups, and the Indian Health Service says they face higher mortality rates from chronic conditions like diabetes and liver disease.",
      "In Seattle, Healthy Tribes money pays for a program called GATHER, which focuses on integrating traditional tribal medicine practices into health care. Providers at the Seattle Indian Health Board can use medicine made from plants grown in a community garden. A traditional Native medicine apprentice or healer is a part of a patient's care team.",
      "Seattle Indian Health Board President Esther Lucero, a descendant of the Navajo Nation, said her staff meets with people from the CDC and other Healthy Tribes grantees bimonthly to discuss project updates and ensure compliance with grants. But after last week's layoffs, they are having trouble contacting anyone.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t actually administer the dollars, how are you going to actually get them out to the programs?\u201d she said. \u201cWith this current administration, it\u2019s almost like every day we receive an unexpected notice, and then we will get a follow-up notice that says ... you need to move forward as usual.\u201d",
      "Lycia Ortega, interim CEO of Los Angeles-based United American Indian Involvement, echoed concerns about the ambiguous and somewhat confusing messages. Her organization uses Healthy Tribes money to foster connections between younger people and elders in Native American and Alaska Native communities.",
      "Native communities have had to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to cut programs that might be considered DEI initiatives, she said, with the help of lawyers, policy experts and watchdogs who point out areas where the government might not be honoring the trust responsibility.",
      "Native people \u201chave a distinct political power,\u201d said Ortega, a citizen of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, but \u201cthere are policymakers who see tribes as a threat rather than a partner.\u201d",
      "Stephen Roe Lewis, governor of the Gila River Indian Community, said he told Kennedy privately that consulting with and engaging in respectful partnerships with tribes is key to fulfilling the federal government\u2019s trust responsibilities.",
      "Since the Trump administration began making massive cuts to the federal workforce, many tribal leaders have had to clarify with newly appointed federal officials that services to tribes are not based on race but rather on the political status of tribal nations.",

      "The mix-up was discovered in February when the clinic in the city of Brisbane found that the birth parents had one too many embryos in storage, said the provider, Monash IVF, in a statement supplied Friday. Staff discovered an embryo from another patient had been mistakenly thawed and transferred to the birth mother, a spokesperson said.",
      "Australia news outlets reported the baby was born in 2024.",
      "The company, one of Australia\u2019s biggest IVF providers, said an initial investigation had not uncovered any other such errors. Its statement didn\u2019t identify the patients involved or divulge details about the child's custody.",
      "\u201cAll of us at Monash IVF are devastated and we apologise to everyone involved,\u201d said CEO Michael Knaap. \u201cWe will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time.\u201d",
      "The \u201chuman error\u201d was made \u201cdespite strict laboratory safety protocols being in place,\u201d the statement said. The company said it had reported the episode to the relevant regulator in the state of Queensland.",
      "Monash IVF opened in 1971 and sees patients in dozens of locations throughout Australia. Last year, the firm settled a class action lawsuit from more than 700 patients, making no admission of liability, after claims its clinics destroyed potentially viable embryos.",
      "The clinic paid a settlement of 56 million Australian dollars ($35 million).",
      "Rare cases of embryo mix-ups have been reported before, including in the United States, Britain, Israel and Europe. A woman in the U.S. state of Georgia in February filed a lawsuit against a fertility clinic after she gave birth to a stranger\u2019s baby.",

      "Public officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia are suing the Trump administration to restore access to federal pandemic relief funding for schools",
      "Public officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration Thursday to restore access to pandemic relief aid for schools, saying the Education Department's abrupt halt of hundreds of millions of dollars of promised funding will force cuts to vital services.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by a coalition of 16 Democratic attorneys general, led by New York\u2019s Letitia James, plus Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, also a Democrat. It claims the administration's refusal to release the aid violates federal law because it reversed a prior decision to allow states to access the money through March 2026.",
      "States were notified late last month that the Education Department would not honor deadline extensions granted by the Biden administration to spend the remainder of COVID relief aid approved by by Congress to help schools and students recover from the lasting impacts of the pandemic. Schools were supposed to spend the last of the relief by January but many sought, and were granted, more time.",
      "In announcing the reversal, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said schools had \u201cample time\u201d to spend the money, but the agency would consider requests for extensions for individual projects. The department did not say how much money is left of the total $189 billion approved.",
      "New York state lost access to $134 million, James' office said in a press release. It said the relief funding has supported repairs and improvements to school buildings and the purchase of library books, playground equipment and wheelchair-accessible buses. Districts also relied on the aid for programs and services for homeless students, as well as tutoring for students who fell behind because of missed classroom time.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s latest attack on our schools will hurt our most vulnerable students and make it harder for them to thrive,\u201d James said. \u201cCutting school systems\u2019 access to vital resources that our students and teachers rely on is outrageous and illegal.\u201d",

      "Outdoor enthusiasts are worried about the loss of their favorite vistas as President Donald Trump's administration considers weakening a 26-year-old rule designed to improve visibility over national parks and wilderness areas",
      "During a hike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1995, Don Barger climbed Chilhowee Mountain hoping to gaze across the valley below. All he saw was a wall of gray haze.",
      "Today, he said, he can see some 50 miles (80 kilometers) across that same valley to the Cumberland Mountains.",
      "A 26-year-old federal regulation known as the regional haze rule has helped cut down on pollution over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations, restoring some of the nation's most spectacular natural vistas for outdoor lovers like Barger. But conservationists fear those gains may be lost after President Donald Trump's administration announced in March the rule is among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that it plans to roll back.",
      "\u201cIt means a promise that was made to the American public is lost,\u201d Barger, 74, said. \u201cMore and more generations of people are going to grow up as ignorant as I was, not realizing what I'm missing and not seeing.\u201d",
      "Haze forms when small particles of air pollution, such as sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides, scatter and absorb sunlight, blurring views and decreasing visibility.",
      "Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1977 to make restoring and maintaining visibility a goal for 156 national parks, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges and tribal reservations across 36 states. That includes places like the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee; Grand Canyon National Park; Glacier National Park; and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.",
      "After years of drafting and litigation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted regulations known as the regional haze rule in 1999 to implement the amendments.",
      "The rule calls for attaining natural visibility conditions by the year 2064 and mandates that states come up with plans that include limitations on emissions, compliance schedules and monitoring strategies. Older facilities that emit pollution, such as coal-fired power plants, must adopt mitigation technology such as scrubbers or shut down periodically to decrease overall annual emissions.",
      "The states' plans have been plagued with delays as the EPA approves parts of them and rejects others. For example, two big oil- and coal-producing states, North Dakota and Wyoming, and industry groups filed petitions in federal court in January seeking review of EPA decisions rejecting their plans, according to the Harvard Law School's Environmental and Energy Law Program.",
      "The rule works in conjunction with other federal antipollution regulations, but it's been crucial in clearing the skies over national parks and wilderness areas.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of data from a nationwide network of monitoring sites from 1999, when the rule was implemented, through 2023 shows 93% of the parks and wilderness areas have seen improved air quality on clear days. No parks or wilderness areas have seen any notable worsening in visibility.",
      "Visibility in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was twice as good on a typical clear day in 2023 as it was in 1999, marking the biggest improvement among the national parks.",
      "The EPA estimates that between 2007 and 2018 the rule has cut 500,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and 300,000 tons of nitrous oxides annually. The average visual range has increased from 90 miles to 120 miles (144 kilometers to 193 kilometers) in some western parks and from 50 to 70 miles (80 kilometers to 112 kilometers) in some eastern parks, according to the Harvard program.",
      "Trump's EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced March 12 that the agency would look to roll back 31 landmark environmental regulations, including the regional haze rule. Zeldin called the announcement the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history\u201d and said in an essay published in the Wall Street Journal that the administration is \u201cdriving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment on the regional haze rule, the EPA said they want to better account for pollution from outside the U.S. and from natural sources and avoid unnecessary burdens for states and industry.",
      "In a cost-benefit analysis of the rule before it took effect, the EPA found it would cost energy producers up to $98 billion by 2025 while providing about $344 billion in benefits such as health care savings.",
      "Producers argue that the haze rule has done its job and it doesn't make sense to continue to impose costs on them.",
      "\u201cThis is a matter of diminishing returns,\u201d said Jonathan Fortner, interim president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council, which advocates for North Dakota's coal industry. \u201cThe air is clean, the data proves it, and the science backs that up. The rule's being misapplied, not because we disagree with clean air goals, but because we're already there.\u201d",
      "Two federal properties in North Dakota are subject to the rule, the Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge and Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The AP analysis found both sites have seen dramatic visibility improvements over the five years from 2019 to 2023.",
      "EPA officials did not respond to an AP request for a list of power plants that have closed due to the regional haze rule. A number of energy industry groups did not return repeated requests for comment, including the U.S. Energy Association and the National Utility Contractors Association.",
      "Advocates of the rule say eliminating it could lead to reduced tourism and the economic boom visitors bring to national park regions. The National Park Service estimates 325 million people visited national parks in 2023, spending $26.4 billion in gateway communities.",
      "Nothing appears likely to change overnight. Conservationists expect the Trump administration to pursue a rollback through language revisions in the rule, a process that would require a public comment period and would likely trigger court challenges that could last years.",
      "\u201cI've watched the Great Smoky Mountains National Park emerge from the chemical haze that once enshrouded it and was getting worse,\u201d Barger said. \u201cIt's just this visceral sense of place. We had lost it entirely. The Clean Air Act is working and it's a work in progress. You have to stay with it or it doesn't work.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reversing course on its requirement for all staffers to report to the office",
      "WASHINGTON -- Weeks after ordering all Food and Drug Administration employees back into the office, the agency is reversing course, allowing some of its most prized staffers to work remotely amid worries that recent layoffs and resignations could jeopardize basic functions, like approving new medicines.",
      "An internal email obtained by The Associated Press states that FDA leadership are \u201callowing review staff and supervisors to resume telework\u201d at least two days a week. The policy shift was confirmed by three FDA staffers who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency matters.",
      "The message was sent Tuesday to some of the FDA\u2019s hundreds of drug reviewers. Staffers said a similar policy was communicated to reviewers who handle vaccines, biotech drugs, medical devices and tobacco products\u2014 although not always in writing.",
      "It\u2019s the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s chaotic approach to overhauling the federal health workforce, which has included firings, a scramble to rehire some employees, and then additional layoffs last week of an estimated 3,400 staffers, or more than 15% of the agency\u2019s workforce. When FDA employees were called back to the agency's Maryland headquarters last month they confronted overflowing parking lots, crowded offices and broken or missing supplies.",
      "A spokeswoman for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the administration is returning to \u201cpre-COVID telework arrangements for reviewers, whose read and write work output is tracked in 15-minute increments to ensure productivity and accountability.\u201d",
      "While many agencies switched to telework during the pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice nearly two decades earlier. The flexibility was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting employees who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "Last week's cuts included entire offices focusing on FDA policy and regulations, most of the agency\u2019s communication staff and teams that support food inspectors and investigators. Senior officials overseeing tobacco, new drugs, vaccines and other products have also been dismissed or forced to resign. Staffers have described rank-and-file employees \u201cpouring\u201d out of the agency.",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler called the cuts \"devastating, haphazard, thoughtless and chaotic\" during a House hearing on Wednesday.",
      "When Kennedy announced plans to eliminate 10,000 staffers across the federal health workforce, he noted that FDA medical reviewers and safety inspectors wouldn't be impacted.",
      "In February, HHS was forced to recall some probationary employees who were fired, including hundreds of medical reviewers at FDA, whose salaries are largely funded by industry fees, not federal dollars.",
      "But last week\u2019s cuts combined with resignations and retirements have raised a new threat: that FDA funding could fall so low that it short circuits a long-standing system in which companies help fund much of the agency's operations.",
      "Nearly half the FDA's nearly $7 billion budget comes from fees collected from drug, device and tobacco companies. The agency uses the money to hire thousands of extra staffers to quickly and efficiently review new products. For example, about 70% of the FDA\u2019s drug program is financed by user-fee agreements, which must be reauthorized by Congress every five years.",
      "But the agreements stipulate that if FDA\u2019s federal funding falls below set levels, companies are no longer required to pay fees and, in some cases, can claw back their money. The threshold requirements are designed to ensure Congress continues funding FDA, rather than relying entirely on the private sector.",
      "FDA and industry groups are supposed to begin negotiations later this year to renew several user-fee agreements, including those for drugs and devices.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the agency nor regulated industry can afford for \u2018user fees\u2019 not to be reauthorized,\u201d said Michael Gaba, an attorney who advises FDA-regulated companies.",
      "Whatever the reasoning behind the telework shift, former government officials say it\u2019s a sign that recently confirmed FDA Commissioner Marty Makary is trying to retain and rebuild staffing and resources. Makary made his first appearance at FDA's headquarters last Wednesday, one day after the mass layoffs. According to the memo obtained by the AP, Makary signed off on the return to telework.",
      "\u201cDr. Makary needs to rebuild teams and restart the engine of productivity lost to weeks of job insecurity, uncertainty and shortages of team members,\u201d said Steven Grossman, a former HHS official. \u201cTurning commuting time back into work time is a great first step in achieving both.\u201d",

      "A day care facility in a Texas county that's part of the measles outbreak has multiple cases, including children too young to be fully vaccinated, public health officials say.",
      "West Texas is in the middle of a still-growing measles outbreak with 481 cases Friday. The state expanded the number of counties in the outbreak area this week to 10. The highly contagious virus began to spread in late January and health officials say it has spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "Three people who were unvaccinated have died from measles-related illnesses this year, including two elementary school-aged children in Texas. The second child died Thursday at a Lubbock hospital, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended the funeral in Seminole, the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "As of Friday, there were seven cases at a day care where one young child who was infectious gave it to two other children before it spread to other classrooms, Lubbock Public Health director Katherine Wells said.",
      "\u201cMeasles is so contagious I won\u2019t be surprised if it enters other facilities,\u201d Wells said.",
      "There are more than 200 children at the day care, Wells said, and most have had least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, which is first recommended between 12 and 15 months old and a second shot between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cWe do have some children that have only received one dose that are now infected,\u201d she said.",
      "The public health department is recommending that any child with only one vaccine get their second dose early, and changed its recommendation for kids in Lubbock County to get the first vaccine dose at 6 months old instead of 1. A child who is unvaccinated and attends the day care must stay home for 21 days since their last exposure, Wells said.",
      "Case count and hospitalization numbers in Texas have climbed steadily since the outbreak began, and spiked by 81 cases from March 28 to April 4, with 16 more people hospitalized in that time.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met with Texas officials Monday to determine how many people it would send to West Texas to assist with the outbreak response, spokesman Jason McDonald said Monday. He expected a small team to arrive later this week, followed by a bigger group on the ground next week.",
      "The CDC said its first team was in the region from early March to April 1, withdrawing on-the-ground support days before a second child died in the outbreak.",

The far-right leader was hospitalized due to problems related to long-term effects of being stabbed in the abdomen in September 2018.",

      "Hungary\u2019s parliament has passed an amendment to the constitution that allows the government to ban public events by LGBTQ+ communities",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungary\u2019s parliament on Monday passed an amendment to the constitution that allows the government to ban public events by LGBTQ+ communities, a decision that legal scholars and critics call another step toward authoritarianism by the populist government.",
      "The amendment, which required a two-thirds vote, passed along party lines with 140 votes for and 21 against. It was proposed by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",
      "Ahead of the vote \u2014 the final step for the amendment \u2014 opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to blockade the entrance to a parliament parking garage. Police physically removed demonstrators, who had used zip ties to bind themselves together.",
      "The amendment declares that children\u2019s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any right other than the right to life, including that to peacefully assemble. Hungary's contentious \u201cchild protection\u201d legislation prohibits the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.",
      "The amendment codifies a law fast-tracked through parliament in March that bans public events held by LGBTQ+ communities, including the popular Pride event in Budapest that draws thousands annually.",
      "That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify people who attend prohibited events \u2014 such as Budapest Pride \u2014 and can come with fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).",
      "D\u00e1vid Bed\u0151, a lawmaker with the opposition Momentum party who participated in the attempted blockade, said before the vote that Orb\u00e1n and Fidesz for the past 15 years \u201chave been dismantling democracy and the rule of law, and in the past two or three months, we see that this process has been sped up.\u201d",
      "He said as elections approach in 2026 and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party lags in the polls behind a popular new challenger from the opposition, \u201cthey will do everything in their power to stay in power.\u201d",
      "Opposition lawmakers used air horns to disrupt the vote, which continued after a few moments.",
      "Hungary\u2019s government has campaigned against LGBTQ+ communities in recent years, and argues its \u201cchild protection\u201d policies, which forbid the availability to minors of any material that mentions homosexuality, are needed to protect children from what it calls \u201cwoke ideology\" and \u201cgender madness.\u201d",
      "Critics say the measures do little to protect children and are being used to distract from more serious problems facing the country and mobilize Orb\u00e1n\u2019s right-wing base ahead of elections.",
      "\u201cThis whole endeavor which we see launched by the government, it has nothing to do with children\u2019s rights,\u201d said D\u00e1nel D\u00f6brentey, a lawyer with the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, calling it \"pure propaganda.\u201d",
      "The new amendment also states that the constitution recognizes two sexes, male and female, an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.",
      "The declaration provides a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals who are born with sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.",
      "In a statement on Monday, government spokesperson Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs wrote that the change is \u201cnot an attack on individual self-expression, but a clarification that legal norms are based on biological reality.\u201d",
      "D\u00f6brentey, the lawyer, said it was \u201ca clear message\u201d for transgender and intersex people: \u201cIt is definitely and purely and strictly about humiliating people and excluding them, not just from the national community, but even from the community of human beings.\"",
      "The amendment is the 15th to Hungary\u2019s constitution since Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party unilaterally authored and approved it in 2011.",
      "\u00c1d\u00e1m Remport, a lawyer with the HCLU, said that while Hungary has used facial recognition tools since 2015 to assist police in criminal investigations and finding missing persons, the recent law banning Pride allows the technology to be used in a much broader and problematic manner. That includes for monitoring and deterring political protests.",
      "\u201cOne of the most fundamental problems is its invasiveness, just the sheer scale of the intrusion that happens when you apply mass surveillance to a crowd,\u201d Remport said.",
      "\u201cMore salient in this case is the effect on the freedom of assembly, specifically the chilling effect that arises when people are scared to go out and show their political or ideological beliefs for fear of being persecuted,\u201d he added.",
      "The amendment passed Monday also allows for Hungarians who hold dual citizenship in a non-European Economic Area country to have their citizenship suspended for up to 10 years if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.",

      "The self-described \u201cilliberal\u201d leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary\u2019s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.",
      "In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orb\u00e1n compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to \u201celiminate the entire shadow army\u201d of foreign-funded \u201cpoliticians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.\u201d",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed a former deputy finance minister as a special envoy to the United States on Monday after the ambassador was expelled last month by the Trump administration.",
      "Ramaphosa said Mcebisi Jonas' appointment would help South Africa rebuild its relationship with the U.S., which has deteriorated swiftly since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "Trump has accused the Black-led South African government of mistreating a white minority at home and also criticized its foreign policy as anti-American. He signed an executive order in February cutting U.S. funding to South Africa over those issues.",
      "Trump continued his criticism in a Truth Social post this weekend, when he said the U.S. did not want to attend the Group of 20 summit this year if it were held in South Africa, as scheduled. South Africa holds the rotational presidency of the G20 group of developed and developing nations and is due to host world leaders and top diplomats for a summit in Johannesburg in November.",
      "\u201cIs this where we want to be for the G20? I don\u2019t think so!\u201d Trump posted on Saturday.",
      "In his post, Trump repeated his claim that South Africa was allowing land to be seized from white farmers \u201cand then killing them and their families.\u201d",
      "The South African government has denied white farmers are having their land seized or are victims of race-based killings, as Trump and his South African-born adviser Elon Musk have claimed. South Africa says those claims are based on misinformation.",
      "South Africa has passed a contentious new land expropriation law that allows land to be taken by the government without compensation if it's in the public interest. That has been criticized by some white minority groups as targeting their land, though no land has yet been taken under the law.",
      "Trump's executive order also criticized South Africa for lodging a case at the International Court of Justice accusing U.S. ally Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The Trump administration said South Africa is pursuing anti-American foreign policies and supporting the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Iran.",
      "South Africa's ambassador to the U.S. was expelled in March over a talk he gave on a webinar organized by a think tank. In the talk, which he defended as an explanation of the new political dynamics in the U.S., Ebrahim Rasool said Trump was launching \u201can assault on incumbency \u2014 those who are in power\u201d and said the Make America Great Again movement was partly a result of a \u201csupremacist instinct.\u201d",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Rasool was a \u201crace-baiting politician\u201d who hates Trump, declared him persona non grata and ordered him to leave the U.S. Rasool returned to South Africa to a hero's welcome from supporters.",

      "LONDON -- China has warned the U.K. government to treat the Chinese owners of British Steel fairly or risk undermining investor confidence in the country, two days after British authorities took control of the company.",
      "China\u2019s Foreign Ministry made the comment on Monday as government-appointed managers raced to prevent British Steel from shutting down the last two blast furnaces in Britain that make so-called virgin steel from raw materials.",
      "Parliament on Saturday passed legislation authorizing the government to take control of the company and its Scunthorpe steelworks from Jingye Group, which has owned British Steel since 2020. Jingye still owns the company but British authorities have taken control of day-to-day operations.",
      "\u201cWe hope the British government treats Chinese enterprises investing and operating in the U.K. fairly and justly, protects their legitimate rights and interests, and avoids politicizing and over-securitizing economic and trade cooperation, so as not to affect the confidence of Chinese enterprises in investing and cooperating in the U.K.,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeperson Lin Jian said during the weekly press conference in Beijing.",
      "The U.K. government on Monday installed a new executive team at British Steel with the aim of ensuring \u201cconsistent and professional leadership\u201d of the Scunthorpe works in northeastern England, British Steel said in a statement.",
      "Two longtime British Steel executives, Allan Bell and Lisa Coulson, were named as the company\u2019s interim chief executive and chief commercial officer. The appointments were approved by Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds.",
      "Bell, who has worked at Scunthorpe for 14 years, said his main goal was to ensure continued steel production at the plant.",
      "\u201cOur immediate priorities are securing the raw materials we need to continue blast furnace operations, ensuring we have the dedicated personnel to run those furnaces, and maintaining the highest levels of health and safety for our workforce,\u201d Bell said in the statement.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday took the dramatic step of recalling Parliament from its spring recess to pass emergency legislation authorizing the government to take control of British Steel. Authorities were concerned about the plant\u2019s future after Jingye stopped ordering the iron ore and coking coal needed to keep the furnaces operating.",
      "Once blast furnaces are shut down, it is difficult and expensive to restart them, raising concerns that Britain might lose the ability to make high-quality virgin steel needed by builders and railroads as the government tries to spur economic growth. Other British steelmakers are already in the process of shifting to electric arc furnaces that make steel from scrap metal.",

      "At the time, the conventional wisdom was that Sunak would call an election in the fall, but he surprised people in May when he set the date for July 4th.

      "BRUSSELS -- European officials condemned Monday Russia's deadly missile attack on Ukraine's Sumy that killed and wounded scores, accusing Moscow of committing war crimes and demonstrating disregard for Washington-led efforts to end the war.",
      "Ukrainian officials said two ballistic missiles on Sunday morning hit the heart of Sumy, a city about 30 kilometers away from Ukraine's border with Russia, as people gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday, killing at least 34 and wounding 117. It is the second large-scale attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week.",
      "Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, whose country holds the European Union\u2019s rotating presidency, said that the recent attacks are \u201cRussia\u2019s mocking answer\u201d to Kyiv\u2019s agreement to a ceasefire proposed by the U.S. administration over a month ago.",
      "\u201cI hope that President Trump, the U.S. administration, see that the leader of Russia is mocking their goodwill, and I hope the right decisions are taken,\u201d Sikorski told reporters Monday in Luxembourg, where EU foreign ministers met.",

      "Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister Kestutis Budrys said the Russian strike used cluster munitions to target civilians in what he called \u201ca war crime by definition.\u201d",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said the attack shows that Putin has no intention of agreeing to a ceasefire. \u201cHe must therefore be forced to do so, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on the European Union to take the toughest sanctions against Russia to suffocate its economy and prevent it from fueling its war effort.\"",

      "Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot denounced the decision, saying it appeared as \"a response to the arrest of three Algerian nationals suspected of serious offenses on French soil.\u201d",
      "French counterterrorism prosecutors said the Algerians were arrested Friday and handed preliminary charges of \u201ckidnapping or arbitrary detention \u2026 in connection with a terrorist undertaking.\u201d They are allegedly involved in the April 2024 kidnapping of an Algerian influencer, Amir Boukhors, or Amir DZ, a known critic of the Algerian government with 1.1 million followers on TikTok.",

      "He said he saw a car in front of his home, with four people he said were acting like false police officers. Some wore police armbands and put him in handcuffs. They brought him to a remote place in the Paris region. \u201cThat's when I felt and confirmed that they were kidnappers. I had fallen into the trap,\u201d he said.",
      "He was told he would be meeting an Algerian official, which never happened, and was later released, the influencer said.",
      "According to French media, Boukhors lives in France since 2016 and was granted the status of political refugee in 2023.",
      "Relations between France and Algeria sharply deteriorated last summer when France shifted its position to support Morocco\u2019s autonomy plan for Western Sahara \u2014 a disputed territory claimed by the pro-independence Polisario Front, which receives support from Algiers and is based in refugee camps in southeastern Algeria.",
      "Tensions further peaked after Algeria arrested French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal, who is an outspoken critic of Islamism and the Algerian regime, in November. He has since been sentenced to five years in prison.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Yoon Suk Yeol's legal saga is far from over.",
      "Ten days after he was ousted from office over his martial law declaration, the former conservative South Korean president appeared for the first time at his criminal trial Monday on high-stakes rebellion charges.",
      "Yoon's baffling decision to declare military rule and send troops to Seoul streets in December made him the country's first president to be indicted while in office. If convicted of rebellion, he could face a life sentence, or theoretically the death penalty.",
      "Here is what to know about the trial, which could take as long as two to three years:",
      "When the Constitutional Court upheld the parliament's impeachment of Yoon and removed him from office, it stated Yoon's violation of the constitution and other laws was too grave to be tolerated and \u201cbetrayed public confidence.\" It said Yoon's martial law enactment \u201ccaused confusion in the society, economy, politics, diplomacy and all other areas.\u201d",
      "Given the ruling, there is \u201ca low possibility\u201d for the criminal court to issue a different verdict so Yoon will likely be convicted on rebellion charges, said Park SungBae, a lawyer who specializes in criminal law.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court is currently reviewing whether Yoon's martial law imposition amounted to an act of masterminding a rebellion, a grave charge whose conviction carries only two sentences \u2014 the capital punishment or life imprisonment.",
      "Yoon has denied the rebellion charges brought by prosecutors in January. Yoon maintained his decree was a desperate yet peaceful attempt to raise public awareness about how the \u201canti-state\u201d liberal opposition was allegedly abusing its legislative majority to obstruct his agenda and complicate state affairs.",
      "\u201cThe fact that they built a rebellion charge over an event that lasted only a few hours and was resolved non-violently after the National Assembly\u2019s demand to lift the measures was immediately accepted \u2026 doesn\u2019t align with proper legal reasoning,\u201d Yoon said Monday at the court, according to Yonhap news agency.",
      "Some observers earlier said Yoon\u2019s rebellion charges were debatable as his decree didn't lead to major violence or cause any serious civilian casualties.",
      "The main issue in Yoon's criminal trial is whether his deployment of hundreds of troops to the National Assembly and election commission offices constituted an illegal attempt to shut down those institutions.",
      "While a president has no constitutional authority to shutter the legislature \u2014 even under martial law \u2014 Yoon\u2019s martial law command did declare a suspension of all political activities at the National Assembly.",
      "Yoon has defended his actions, saying he never attempted to paralyze the National Assembly and had always planned to accept the outcome if lawmakers voted to lift martial law \u2014 which they did just hours after its declaration. His claims contradict the testimonies of some military commanders, who say Yoon ordered them to drag lawmakers out of the chamber to prevent them from voting against his decree.",
      "The Seoul court will focus on \u201cdetermining whether there was an intent to undermine constitutional order, and individually assess a broad range of specific actions, including the circumstances under which the military and police forces were deployed,\u201d said Yang Hong-seok, a lawyer.",
      "Yoon's dismissal prompted a June 3 snap election to choose his successor, who will be given a full five-year term.",
      "Observes say Yoon will likely influence his People Power Party's selection of its presidential candidate, as he would want someone who can stand up for him and pardon him if he's convicted.",
      "In a public message last week, Yoon expressed gratitude to his supporters and stressed that he will \u201ccontinue to do my utmost\u201d to build the \u201cfree and prosperous Republic of Korea that we have dreamed of together.\"",
      "Yoon no longer enjoys presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions. Experts say prosecutors could subsequently charge him with abuse of power and other crimes related to his martial law decree.",
      "Park said Yoon's trial at the Seoul district court is expected to last one-two years as there are too many witnesses to question and too many documents to examine. Yang said he expects a verdict within a year, given how crucial the case is.",
      "Appeals can send Yoon's case to a higher court and then the Supreme Court, but their verdicts won\u2019t likely take more than a year altogether, Park said.",

      "It is the latest in a series of purchases of military equipment from France, with Greece having already bought two dozen Rafale warplanes and three Belharra-class frigates.

      "The intricate motif means the egg will ultimately be a gift from a godparent to their godchild, to bestow diligence and a good work ethic upon the youngster.",
      "The tradition of decorating Easter eggs is part of the culture of the Slavic-speaking Sorbian ethnic minority in Germany. Modern-day Sorbs are descended from Slavic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe who settled in Germany some 1,500 years ago.",
      "About 60,000 Sorbs currently live in Germany, split between the federal states of Saxony and Brandenburg.",
      "Stephanie Bierholdt, an employee at the Sorbian Cultural Center in Schleife, a town just 16 kilometers (10 miles) from the Polish border, said Easter is the biggest holiday of the year for Sorbs and people travel home to celebrate with their loved ones.",

      "Bierholdt, Hanusch and other members of Schleife's Sorbian community gathered at the cultural center April 6, two weeks ahead of the holiday, to celebrate their heritage through the Easter eggs and traditional folk costumes, songs and dances. Sorbian egg-decorating dates back to the Middle Ages.",
      "Hanusch, wearing the red folk costume and bonnet of an unmarried woman (married women wear green), was among more than 30 artisans selling their Easter eggs at the cultural center. Her prices ranged from the cheapest decorated chicken egg for 7 euros ($7.72) up to 90 euros ($99.28) for a painted emu egg.",
      "The decorating can take between 90 minutes and six hours, depending on the techniques used, the motif and size of the egg. The artisans use a needle or the tip of a goose feather quill, cut in different ways, to draw the designs.",
      "The egg artisans said the worldwide bird flu outbreak, and subsequent egg shortage and price hikes, have not yet affected their rituals \u2014 though they added that it\u2019s always best to get eggs directly from a farmer rather than a supermarket.",
      "Hanusch, who is Sorbian on her father's side, is learning to speak the Slavic language. She said she and other Sorbian children start decorating Easter eggs as young as two, from when they can first hold a pencil. Many only do it during the Easter season throughout childhood, but Hanusch continued with the skill and became a teacher to others, including her niece.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a valuable cultural asset that needs to be preserved,\u201d she said. \"It would be a shame if it were to become extinct.\u201d",

Hasina\u2019s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is Bangladesh\u2019s independence leader. The country gained independence in 1971 under his leadership after a nine-month war against Pakistan.",

Hasina accused Bangladesh's interim administration headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus of backing mobs to attack her followers across the country. The home affairs adviser says they are trying to restore order in the country.",
      "The BBC quoted Siddiq\u2019s lawyers saying the charges against Siddiq were \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d",

The investigation alleged that Siddiq\u2019s family was involved in brokering a 2013 deal with Russia for a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh in which large sums of money were said to have been embezzled.",
      "Siddiq quit as minister in January amid controversy. She said she had been cleared of wrongdoing but that the issue was becoming \u201ca distraction from the work of the government.\u201d",
      "Siddiq, 42, is a former local councilor who was elected lawmaker for a north London district in 2015. She was appointed to the government after Prime Minister Keir Starmer's center-left Labor Party won a landslide election victory in July last year.",

      "Since its start nearly a month ago, the intense campaign of U.S. airstrikes under President Donald Trump targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters \u2014 related to the Israel-Hamas war \u2014 has killed over 120 people, according to casualty figures released Monday by the Houthis' Health Ministry.",
      "Footage aired by the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel showed firefighters spraying water on a raging fire they described as being sparked by the airstrikes. Rubble littered a street as rescuers carried one person away from the site, which the rebels claimed was a ceramics factory in the Bani Matar neighborhood of Sanaa, the capital.",
      "The U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, which oversees American military operations, did not acknowledge the strikes. That follows a pattern for the command, which now has authorization from the White House to conduct strikes at will in the campaign that began March 15.",
      "The American military also hasn\u2019t been providing any information on targets hit. The White House has said over 200 strikes have been conducted so far.",
      "The Houthis separately claimed Sunday night they shot down an MQ-9 Reaper drone over Yemen's Hajjah governorate, which sits to the northwest of the country on the Red Sea on the country's border with Saudi Arabia.",
      "Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, described the downing in a prerecorded video message as the fourth in two weeks by the rebels. Saree said the rebels targeted the drone with \u201ca locally manufactured missile.\u201d The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles \u2014 such as the Iranian missile known as the 358 \u2014 capable of downing aircraft.",

      "General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and remain in the air for over 30 hours. They have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA for years over Afghanistan, Iraq and now Yemen.",
      "Central Command said it was aware of \u201creports\u201d of the drone being shot down but did not elaborate.",
      "An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.",
      "The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.",
      "The U.S. campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has also linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.",

      "BEIRUT -- Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa made his first visit Sunday to the United Arab Emirates, whose leaders have been circumspect about the new leadership in Damascus in the four months since the fall of former President Bashar Assad in a lightning rebel offensive.",
      "The state-run Emirates News Agency, or WAM, reported that the UAE's president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met with Sharaa in Abu Dhabi and \u201cwished him success in leading Syria through the coming period and in fulfilling the Syrian people\u2019s hopes for development, security, and stability.\u201d",
      "The statement said the \u201ctwo leaders discussed a number of issues of mutual interest and exchanged views on regional and international developments.\u201d",
      "Like many other Arab countries, the UAE cut off relations with Assad\u2019s government after its brutal crackdown on anti-government protests in 2011 that escalated into a civil war. However, the UAE was one of the first to restore ties, reopening its embassy in Damascus in December 2018. In 2022, Assad visited the UAE in his first visit to an Arab country after the war erupted.",
      "Other Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, were quick to welcome Syria\u2019s new rulers led by al-Sharaa, an Islamist former insurgent who led the charge that unseated Assad. But the UAE, which has historically been anxious about Islamist political movements, has taken a more cautious approach to the new authorities in Damascus.",
      "Syria\u2019s new rulers have sought to bolster their regional ties as they struggle to rebuild the country's economy and infrastructure after nearly 14 years of war, consolidate control over the territory and bring together a patchwork of armed groups with their own leadership into a national army.",
      "They are also facing challenges from Israel, which has launched a campaign of airstrikes and moved ground troops in to seize a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory since the fall of Assad. The zone was set up under a 1974 ceasefire agreement.",
      "Syria\u2019s new authorities and U.N. officials have said Israel is violating the agreement and called for it to withdraw. Israeli officials say they are protecting their borders and plan to stay indefinitely.",
      "The UAE, as one of a handful of Arab countries that has normalized ties with Israel, could play a role in mediating between the two countries.",

      "ISTANBUL -- Turkey has begun a new phase in sweeping restorations of the nearly 1,500-year-old Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, focusing on preserving the monument's historic domes from the threat of earthquakes.",

      "\u201cWe have been carrying out intensive restoration efforts on Hagia Sophia and its surrounding structures for three years,\u201d said Dr. Mehmet Selim Okten, a construction engineer, lecturer at Mimar Sinan University and a member of the scientific council overseeing the renovations. \u201cAt the end of these three years, we have focused on the seismic safety of Hagia Sophia, the minarets, the main dome and the main arches, especially due to the expected Istanbul earthquake.\u201d",
      "In 2023, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Turkey, destroying or damaging hundreds of thousands of buildings and leaving more than 53,000 people dead. While Istanbul was not impacted, the devastation in southern Turkey heightened fears of a similar quake with experts citing the city's proximity to fault lines.",
      "Okten said a \u201cnew phase\u201d of work is about to begin, one that he describes as the most significant intervention in over 150 years and in the totality of the structure's long history.",
      "\u201cA tower crane will be installed on the eastern facade, and then we will cover the top of this unique structure with a protective frame system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat way, we can work more safely and examine the building\u2019s layers academically, including damage it suffered from fires and earthquakes in the 10th and 14th centuries.\u201d",
      "Built by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in 537, Hagia Sophia was turned into a mosque with the 1453 Ottoman conquest of Istanbul. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founding leader of the Turkish republic, converted it into a museum in 1934.",
      "Although an annex to Hagia Sophia, the sultan\u2019s pavilion, has been open to prayers since the 1990s, religious and nationalist groups in Turkey had long yearned for the nearly 1,500-year-old edifice they regard as the legacy of Ottoman Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror to be reverted into a mosque.",
      "Turkey\u2019s highest administrative court overturned the 1934 decree in 2020, allowing it to reopen as a mosque.",
      "\u201cWe have completed our work on the four minarets and the main structure,\u201d Okten said. \u201cBut for this unique cultural heritage (of the domes), we plan to use modern, lightweight materials and keep the building open to the public.\"",
      "Visitors to the site expressed approval of the plan.",
      "\u201cHagia Sophia is amazing, it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most important monuments,\u201d said Cambridge University lecturer Rupert Wegerif. \u201cIt seems really important that they are going to strengthen it in case of earthquakes and preserve it.\u201d",

That\u2019s the first step. The tax deduction is for loss that\u2019s not paid for or reimbursed by your insurance.\u201d",
      "The IRS calls this kind of disaster relief \u201ccasualty loss.\" Claiming casualty loss doesn't result in dollar-for-dollar reimbursement, but it does lower your tax burden, which can mean more cash to help pay for recovery.",
      "Form 4684, which you include when you file your return, walks you through the relevant steps for calculating your casualty write-off.",
      "Victims of disasters may deduct their losses in either the year they suffered the loss or in the previous year \u2014 in that case, by filing an amended return.",
      "In the wake of a disaster, it's normal to feel vulnerable and to listen to voices that promise relief. But scammers often target disaster victims for exactly this reason.",

      "\u201cBut shipments are set to drop back over the coming months and quarters,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. \u201cWe think it could be years before Chinese exports regain current levels.\u201d",

      "After taking office, Trump first ordered a 10% increase in tariffs on imports from China. He later raised that to 20%. Now, China is facing 145% tariffs on most of its exports to the United States, based on the most recent revisions in Trump\u2019s trade policies. China has responded with 125% tariffs on U.S. products and other measures meant to pinch the U.S. where it hurts most, such as controls on exports of critical minerals needed in high-tech manufacturing, such as electric vehicle production.",

Such products accounted for nearly $174 billion in U.S. imports from China last year.",

      "Vietnam is experienced at balancing its relations with the U.S and China. It is run under a communist, one-party system like China but has had a strong relationship with the U.S.",
      "In 2023, it was the only country that received both U.S. President Joe Biden and China\u2019s Xi Jinping. That year it also upgraded the U.S. to its highest diplomatic level, the same as China and Russia.",
      "Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of countries trying to decouple their supply chains from China, as businesses moved here. China is its biggest trading partner, and China-Vietnam trade surged 14.6% year-on-year in 2024, according to Chinese state media.",
      "But the intensification of the trade war has put Vietnam in a \u201cvery precarious situation\u201d given the impression in the U.S. that Vietnam is serving as a backdoor for Chinese goods, said Giang, the analyst at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute. Vietnam had been hit with 46% tariffs under Trump's order before the 90-day pause.",
      "China and Vietnam have real long-term differences, including territorial disputes in the South China Sea, where Vietnam has faced off with China\u2019s coast guard but does not often publicize the confrontations.",
      "After Vietnam, Xi is expected to go to Malaysia next and then Cambodia.",

      "Chinese companies will have to clear a \u201chigh trust bar\u201d when investing in key sectors in the U.K., the country\u2019s business secretary said after he took effective control of Britain\u2019s last remaining factory that makes steel from scratch from its Chinese ...",
      "LONDON -- Chinese companies will have to clear a \u201chigh trust bar\u201d when investing in key sectors in the U.K., the country's business secretary said Sunday, a day after he took effective control of Britain\u2019s last remaining factory that makes steel from scratch from its Chinese owners.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds said Jingye Group, which has owned British Steel since 2020, had not been negotiating \u201cin good faith\u201d with the government in recent months over the future of the heavily loss-making steel works in Scunthorpe in the north of England.",
      "Reynolds said it had become clear on Thursday that Jingye would not accept any financial offer from the government and that it was the company's intention to close the blast furnaces \u201ccome what may,\u201d while keeping the more profitable steel mill operations and supplying them from China.",
      "In an interview with Sky News on Sunday, he declined to accuse the company of deliberately sabotaging the business at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party, but did accept that there is now a \u201chigh trust bar\u201d to bringing Chinese investment into the U.K.",
      "\u201cI personally wouldn't bring a Chinese company into our steel sector,\u201d he said. \u201cI think steel is a very sensitive area.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer summoned lawmakers back to Parliament on Saturday to back a bill primarily aimed at blocking Jingye from closing the two blast furnaces. The bill, which is now law, gives Reynolds the power to direct British Steel's board and workforce, ensure its 3,000 workers get paid and order the raw materials necessary to keep the blast furnaces running.",
      "The British government had been under pressure to act after Jingye\u2019s recent decision to cancel orders for the iron pellets used in the blast furnaces. Without them and other raw materials, such as coking coal, the furnaces would likely have to shut for good, potentially within days, as they are extremely difficult and expensive to restart once cooled.",
      "That would mean the U.K., which in the late 19th century was the world\u2019s steelmaking powerhouse, would be the only country in the Group of Seven industrial nations without the capacity to make its own steel from scratch rather than from recycled material, which use greener electric arc furnaces rather than blast furnaces.",
      "The repercussions would be huge for industries like construction, defense and rail and make the country dependent on foreign sources for so-called virgin steel, a vulnerability that lawmakers from all political parties balked at.",
      "In a separate interview with the BBC, Reynolds declined to give a full guarantee that British Steel will be able to secure enough raw materials in time to keep the blast furnaces going.",
      "He said he would not \u201cmake my situation or the nation\u2019s situation more difficult\u201d by commenting on specific commercial details.",
      "\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t acted, the blast furnaces were gone, steel production in the U.K., primary steel producing, would have gone,\" he said. \"So we\u2019ve given ourselves the opportunity, we are in control of the site, my officials are on site right now to give us a chance to do that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Many of Silicon Valley's most prominent tech leaders have embraced President Donald Trump in his second term",
      "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy.",
      "The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump\u2019s first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company\u2019s Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google\u2019s co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them.",
      "Last weekend was Lyons' second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel.",
      "The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley\u2019s environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration.",
      "To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what\u2019s happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,\u201d Lyons said.",
      "The tech industry's political allegiances remain divided. But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry\u2019s everyday workers have remained liberal \u2014 but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology.",
      "\u201cI think you're seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,\u201d said Ann Skeet, who helps run a center at Santa Clara University studying the ethics of the tech industry.",
      "\u201cThe shift hasn\u2019t been for a lot of people,\u201d said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. \u201cIt\u2019s a handful of people who\u2019ve gotten the attention.\u201d",
      "The biggest example of that is Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest person and CEO of the world\u2019s best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump's administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump's campaign and became the White House\u2019s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump's inauguration in Washington.",
      "Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him. Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors.",
      "Trump has filled a number of his administration's posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites. During Trump's first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe.",
      "It's against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk.",
      "Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still in the belly of the beast,\u201d said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. \u201cIf the lake was frozen, there\u2019s a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.\u201d",
      "The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington\u2019s business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world\u2019s problems.",
      "That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed.",
      "The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers\u2019 dreams of changing the world for the better. Google\u2019s motto was \u201cdon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth.",
      "Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cif you\u2019re part of a startup, you\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll be absorbed in a way that\u2019s profitable.\u201d",
      "Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries.",
      "\u201cI feel sick to my stomach now,\u201d she said.",
      "Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden.",
      "\u201cI saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,\u201d Sylvester said. \u201cIt was not all OK.\u201d",
      "It is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration.",
      "At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs.",
      "But it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump\u2019s challenges to the country\u2019s system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley\u2019s top executives.",
      "\u201cThe money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,\u201d said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. \u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019ve got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust coming here, everyone\u2019s saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,\u201d Wood added. \u201cWe\u2019re all scared.\u201d",
      "Kamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift.",
      "\u201cThe trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what's going on,\" he said. \"It's going to be different forever.\u201d",

      "Taxes may not be the first thing on your mind when you celebrate a joyous occasion like a marriage or a new baby",
      "NEW YORK -- Taxes may not be the first thing on your mind when you celebrate a joyous occasion like a marriage or a new baby. But once you return from your honeymoon or while your newborn is napping, you'll need to spend some time thinking about them.",
      "Keeping your documents organized, updating your withholding and knowing which tax credits you're eligible for are some crucial steps as couples and parents navigate tax season, said Henry Grzes, lead manager of tax practice & ethics for the American Institute of CPAs.",
      "The deadline to file your 2024 taxes is Tuesday. If you run out of time, you can file for an extension until Oct. 15.",
      "Here are some expert recommendations if you are filing taxes as a newlywed or new parent.",
      "Keeping your tax documents organized is a great practice regardless of your filing year. Having your tax documents in a folder on your personal computer, even if it\u2019s pictures of the documents, can help you have everything in the same place, said Tyler Horn, a certified financial planner and head of planning at Origin, a financial planning app.",
      "\u201cJust take a picture with your phone, send it and keep it in that secure folder on your computer. That way you have everything together,\u201d Horn said.",
      "It's also good to keep your records for the future. The IRS recommends that you keep your documents for at least three years and up to seven depending on your situation.",
      "If you changed your last name, you will need to make sure your government documents reflect this. Your tax return must match your Social Security number so, if you choose to change your name, you\u2019ll need to make a change with the Social Security Administration.",
      "Oftentimes, people forget to make this change ahead of time, which leads them to make mistakes on their tax returns.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that people don\u2019t necessarily think about and when they do think about it sometimes it\u2019s it\u2019s too late,\u201d Grzes said.",
      "You can find out more about how to change your name on the Social Security Administration\u2019s website.",
      "One of the biggest changes, for tax purposes, when you get married is whether you choose to file your taxes jointly or separately, Horn said.",
      "To make this decision, each couple should take a look at their specific situation. In most cases, filing jointly might make the most sense but it\u2019s not always that case, Horn said. One of the benefits of filing jointly is that it gives you access to new tax credits and deductions.",
      "It\u2019s important to know that if a couple is married as of Dec. 31, the law indicates that the couple was married for the entire year, Grzes said. So, if you got married in the summer, in the eyes of the IRS you have been married the full year.",
      "You can read more about each filing status on the IRS website.",
      "If you\u2019re planning to file taxes jointly with your spouse, you must update your W-4 form with your employer. Updating your W-4 is meant to reflect your new filing status, from single to married, as well as updating your tax withholding.",
      "Knowing what tax credits and deductions you qualify for is very important when filing your taxes, Horn said. Relevant tax credits for married couples include the Earned Income, American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits.",
      "When it comes to deductions, you can either opt for a standard deduction or itemize. Itemizing generally only makes sense if your itemized deductions add up to more than the current standard deduction of $29,200 for a married couple.",
      "In some cases, a person that qualifies for the Earned Income Credit as a single filer will no longer qualify if they file jointly with their spouse, Grzes said. To avoid surprises when you\u2019re filing your taxes, Grzes recommends that you work with a tax professional ahead of time.",
      "It\u2019s important that you obtain a social security number for your child as soon as you can, Grzes said. The first time you file taxes after you\u2019ve had your new baby, you will be able to apply for several new tax credits, but you can only do so if you claim them as a dependent.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to claim your child as a dependent, you have to have a Social Security number and put that number on the return. Otherwise, the IRS is going to deny you,\" Grzes said.",
      "Usually, hospitals let you apply for a Social Security number registration. However, you can also apply online or at your local Social Security office.",
      "To alleviate some of the expenses of having children, the IRS offers several tax credits, including the Child Tax Credit, Childcare Credit and Adoption Credit. Parents also continue to qualify for the Earned Income Credit, which will continue to be based on your earned income and the number of children you have.",
      "\u201cThe Earned Income Credit clearly provides a significant refund and by having a child, you could increase the amount of income that you could earn and still qualify for that credit,\u201d Grzes said.",
      "Parents can benefit from opening tax-free accounts such as a flexible spending account or a 529 account.",
      "A flexible spending account (FSA), allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for healthcare and childcare costs, while the 529 account lets you set money aside for education expenses.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s worth making sure you are maximizing your tax opportunities,\u201d Grzes said.",

      "The 145% tariff from the U.S. and the retaliatory 125% tariff from China are putting businesses doing trade between the U.S. and China on edge",
      "When the first two rounds of 10% tariffs hit, Zou Guoqing, a Chinese exporter, groaned but didn't find the barriers insurmountable. He gave up some of his profits and offered his client, a snow-bike factory in Nebraska, price cuts ranging from 5% to 10%. It seemed to work: The factory agreed to a new order of molds and parts.",
      "But when President Donald Trump announced an additional 34% universal tariff on Chinese goods on April 2, Zou, who\u2019s been exporting to the U.S. for more than a decade, was incredulous.",
      "\u201cThere's not a thread of feasibility,\" said Zou, who does business in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo. \u201cIt looks like I would have no choice but give up trading with the U.S.\u201d",
      "Then came 50% more from Trump, followed by another hike \u2014 pushing the universal tariff on Chinese goods to the sky-high 145%, and Zou said he now could only hope that the two leaders can communicate. \u201cWe are pausing the shipments,\" he said, \u201cuntil the leaders talk.\u201d",
      "The 145% tariff from the United States and the retaliatory 125% tariff from China are putting businesses doing trade between the U.S. and China on edge. They're fretting not only about their next orders, but also the viability of their business if there's no quick relief. Experts are worried the decades-long trade ties that have underpinned the relationship between the world's two largest economies could be unraveling.",
      "If the high tariff is sustained for the next six months or longer, \u201cthat would actually lead to a real effective decoupling between the American and Chinese economies,\u201d said Chen Zhiwu, professor of finance at Hong Kong University Business School.",
      "Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s GeoEconomics Center, said the sky-high tariff, if kept in place, amounts to \u201calmost a trade embargo,\u201d making it impossible for China to export low-value items such as apparel to the U.S. It also would force U.S. businesses to source elsewhere, away from China, if there should be alternatives, he said.",
      "In China, the central tariff office flat-out declared there was \u201cno possibility for market acceptance\" of U.S. goods exported to China\u201d at the current tariff level.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty worried,\u201d said Hu Jianlong, founder of Brands Factory, a consultancy that works with Chinese companies trying to break into overseas markets. \u201cAt this point in time, there\u2019s no good way forward. This situation has not resolved ... there's no final number. And so everyone\u2019s still waiting to see how this will develop.\u201d",
      "The high-stakes tariff war has come more than 20 years after China \u2014 with the help of the United States \u2014 joined the World Trade Organization and began to see its economy soar on luring foreign investments and exporting to the U.S. and other Western markets. By last year, China-U.S. trade was $582 billion, but tensions have flared over China's widening trade imbalance with the U.S. That led to the first tariff skirmish during the first Trump term.",
      "The trade deficit has since narrowed but stayed stubbornly high, at a time when the U.S. and other Western markets have also grown concerned about another onslaught of Chinese products such as electric vehicles.",
      "During his four-year term, former President Joe Biden stressed that the U.S. was not trying to decouple from China but to \u201cde-risk.\" He took the \u201csmall-yard, high-fence\u201d approach, under which his administration put up barriers in targeted sectors such as advanced chips, artificial intelligence and quantum computing that have national security implications.",
      "Now, Trump is declaring universal tariffs on all Chinese goods but has said he's also willing to talk with Beijing. It remains unclear what his goals might be.",
      "\u201cWhat are they looking for in those negotiations? How much is it possible to reduce these tariffs? What are the other demands apart from China removing its retaliatory tariffs that the United States wants to put forward. We don't know what that would be,\u201d said Greta Peisch, who served as the general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in 2021-2024.",
      "The message from China's leadership is loud and clear. It will talk only when the U.S. stops \u201cmaximum pressure and capricious and destructive behavior,\" said Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson.",
      "Li Cheng, professor of political science at the University of Hong Kong, said the Chinese leadership is upset over being singled out by Trump when the U.S. president paused \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs for 90 days for all other countries. Beijing wants to make sure that \u201cDonald Trump not state one thing in the morning and say other things in the evening,\" Li said, and that Trump's policies on China are not hijacked by his anti-China, hawkish advisers.",
      "With no leadership-level negotiations in the immediate future, businesses are exploring their options.",
      "Lisa Li, who works in sales for an athletic wear manufacturer in the northern Chinese province of Hebei, said her business was negotiating with clients over whether they could split the increased costs. It's too early to say if her company is to give up on the U.S. market, she said, but it will \u201cdefinitely expand other avenues for sales,\u201d such as in Australia or Europe.",
      "In the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou, a manufacturing hub, a holiday lights maker was less optimistic. Bo, who shared only his surname out of concern for retaliation, said he could \u201conly give up\u201d if the tariff hikes were here to stay because other markets might not work.",
      "\u201cIn the past few years, the European market has been in a slump,\u201d Bo said. \u201cSo we had wanted to try and develop our business in the United States.\u201d",
      "In Hong Kong, Danny Lau, who runs an aluminum-coating factory in the nearby southern Chinese city of Dongguan, said one of his U.S clients would keep buying from him for an ongoing project but was unsure about the next project. Another client told Lau that the chances are slim to strike a deal when tariffs are so high. Lau has been exploring other markets, but he says it's not easy because some may find his high-quality products too expensive.",
      "At a port in the Chinese city of Shanghai, ships heading to the U.S. had almost vanished by Thursday, the day after Trump's tariff on China took effect, according to a report by the financial news site Caixin. Major shipping lines were drastically cutting back on trans-Pacific routes, the report said.",
      "For the longer term, the tariff war is likely to prompt Chinese businesses to diversify their supply chains and move part of their manufacturing capacity outside of China, and even to the United States, said Hu, the consultant.",
      "Some might follow in the footsteps of the Tianjin steelmaking business, which gave up trading with the U.S. after both Trump and Biden raised tariffs on Chinese steel. \u201cThe best plan is to not come into contact,\u201d said David Yu, who works in the company's foreign sales department.",
      "However, not everyone is ready to give up on the U.S. market. Zou, the exporter in Ningbo, describes the U.S. market as \u201creliable and without finicky demands.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's the best market on Earth,\u201d he said. \"I am waiting for the rainbow after the storm.\u201d",

      "Argentina's statistics agency says that monthly inflation has accelerated to its fastest pace in seven months, with consumer prices up 3.7% from the month before mainly as a result of rising food prices",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Monthly inflation in Argentina accelerated in March to its fastest pace in seven months, the country's official statistics agency reported on Friday, with consumer prices up 3.7% from the month before mainly as a result of rising food prices.",
      "The steep hike, compared to a 2.4% inflation rate for February, surprised financial analysts and worried Argentines who have become increasingly concerned that President Javier Milei's progress on lowering price increases might be stalling. The last time inflation rose this much on a monthly basis was in August 2024, when prices jumped 4.2%.",
      "The inflation numbers come at a critical juncture for South America's second-biggest economy. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund announced a new $20 billion loan agreement with Argentina. The IMF\u2019s executive board is expected to vote on the program later Friday.",
      "While Milei considers the IMF deal crucial to his efforts to stabilize Argentina's long troubled economy, the still-vague agreement has spread jitters among traders who expect that Argentina will have to impose a new monetary and foreign-exchange policy as a condition of receiving the cash. But further devaluing the peso, now pegged to the U.S. dollar, risks capital flight and even higher inflation.",
      "Milei came to power in December 2023 with a pledge to pull Argentina out of its yearslong inflationary spiral.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump&rsquo;s sweeping global tariffs could cause planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to drop temporarily, but that won&rsquo;t help the climate long-term",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs could cause planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to drop temporarily, but that won\u2019t help the climate long-term",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs have stirred widespread anxiety about a severe economic downturn -- and curiosity, for some, about how it might affect the world\u2019s warming climate.",
      "Experts say a slowdown in international trade might have a brief and slight benefit in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which come in part from fuels like gas and oil that are used to move goods around the world via ships, planes and vehicles. But any such benefit in reducing emissions, which cause climate change, will be swamped by sharply rising costs worldwide that will hurt efforts to transition to green energies.",
      "\u201cI would say it might help the climate in the first year or two if we have a downturn in economic activity or a recession, which no one wants,\u201d said Rob Jackson, head of the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who monitor greenhouse gas emissions yearly. \u201cBut it will hurt the climate long-term because tariffs impact clean tech more than most other industries because of trade with China.",
      "\u201cAny emissions reduction would be temporary,\" said Dan Jasper, senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown. \u201cI'm deeply skeptical that this would have positive impacts on climate change and in particular the energy transition.\u201d",
      "Climate experts have closely studied changes in world economic activity the last century, from the Great Depression to the recent coronavirus pandemic, looking for insights to help shape policies to reduce carbon emissions. A major U.S.-China trade war would be a very different dynamic than other recent slowdowns, as China produces much of the equipment needed for a transition to renewable energies, such as solar panels.",
      "Trump imposed, then suspended for 90 days, import taxes on dozens of countries Wednesday. He escalated his trade war with China, raising tariffs on its products to well above 100%. China makes more than 80% of the world\u2019s solar panels.",
      "The tariffs could slow global trade and economic activity. Carbon dioxide emissions dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and during the global financial crisis in 2009, then rebounded within a year.",
      "Jackson said he expects at most a 1% drop in emissions if full tariffs are implemented \u2014 significant, but far less than the 5.7% that his group calculated for the pandemic's first year. And Jackson noted that the world can't reach net-zero carbon emissions to try to limit future warming without structural changes, namely replacing fossil energy and manufacturing with clean renewable energy.",
      "\u201cA drop in emissions is important. But it boomerangs back to the same levels or keeps increasing afterwards,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we really haven\u2019t done anything meaningful to address climate issues.\u201d",
      "Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, also thinks there could be a slight, temporary drop in greenhouse gas emissions if tariffs paralyze businesses and people aren't working. But, he said, the higher prices for components for new renewable energy facilities will make some not economical to build and there will be far fewer imports of electric vehicles, both of which will lead to more emissions.",
      "The transition to electric vehicles is an important part of the shift to clean energy to reduce emissions from road transport. The United States is a top importer of EVs and China is a top exporter.",
      "Renewable energy investor Excelsior Energy Capital announced Tuesday that it has raised just over $1 billion to continue investing equity in solar, energy storage, wind and other energy transition projects across the United States. Co-founder and managing partner Chris Moakley said they need stability and predictable costs \u2014 tariffs cause volatility.",
      "\u201cIf there is an increase in tariffs, I think there\u2019s going to be a time where we will have a slowdown,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall economics of these investments and transactions, there's going to need to be a reset.\u201d",
      "Grid-scale batteries and solar panels, as well as power transformers, are among the hardest hit by price increases on imports, said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa.",
      "Combining batteries with green energy is a fast-growing climate solution. Batteries allow renewables to replace fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, while keeping a steady flow of power when sources like wind and solar are not producing. Shepheard calculated a 55% price increase for grid-scale batteries if the tariffs are fully implemented on China, where about 80% of these batteries are manufactured, undermining the case for using solar and battery storage to satisfy a surging demand for electricity.",
      "If prices for renewables increase, the United States will turn more to fossil fuels, tying the nation to carbon-emitting power sources for decades, Shepheard added.",
      "President Joe Biden sought to lock in a trajectory for reducing the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Trump began reversing the country\u2019s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. He's also moved aggressively against clean energy technologies, including halting offshore wind lease sales in federal waters, canceling clean energy loans and threatening action against states' climate laws.",

      "Los Angeles-area residents whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January face a whole different set of struggles to their neighbors whose homes were burned to the ground",
      "All sense of survivors\u2019 guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\u201cEvery single item is a battle,\u201d said Maccalla. \u201cIt\u2019s denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\u201d",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents Unite, sharing environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve already had multiple people reach out and say: \u2018Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,\u2019\u201d said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can\u2019t afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\u201cIf I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won\u2019t be,\u201d said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents Unite.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Lawton Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home\u2019s physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\u201cIt can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cYou have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\u201d",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We\u2019re talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \u201cpermanent physical changes,\u201d meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan\u2019s threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\u201cThe damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\u201d Schaffer said. \u201cThey make it complicated because it saves them money.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters\u2019 recommendations.",
      "\u201cOur policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\u201d McLean said.",
      "Lawton Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler\u2019s pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\u201cAfter the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\u201d she said. \"But now there\u2019s no way.\u201d",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire.

      "BEIJING -- China calls on Western countries to work to support multilateralism and open cooperation, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Spain\u2019s visiting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez on Friday, as Beijing woos allies for its escalating tariff fight with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThe two sides should promote the building of a fair and reasonable global governance system, maintain world peace and security, and promote common development and prosperity,\u201d Xi told S\u00e1nchez at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in Beijing, according to a readout of the meeting by the official Xinhua News Agency.",
      "The visit comes at a complex moment for Europe and China. The tariffs announced last week \u2014 and then paused \u2014 by U.S. President Donald Trump could mean that the European Union pursues more trade with China \u2014 the world\u2019s third-largest consumer market after the United States and the EU.",
      "Xi made no direct mention of Trump or the tariffs totaling 145% the U.S. is imposing on Chinese goods, but he referred to \u201cmultiple risks and challenges\u201d facing the world that can only be dealt with through \u201cunity and cooperation.\u201d",
      "S\u00e1nchez is making his third trip to the country in two years as his government seeks to boost investment from the Asian giant. He was also expected to meet with business leaders from several Chinese companies, many of which produce electric batteries or renewable energy technologies.",
      "After meeting Xi, S\u00e1nchez said Spain was in favor of \"more balanced relations between the European Union and China, of finding negotiated solutions to our differences, which we have, and of greater cooperation in areas of common interest.\u201d He added: \u201cTrade wars are not good, nobody wins. And this is clear, the world needs both China and the United States to talk.\u201d",

      "Musk and Saudi Arabia have had a complicated history. Back in 2018, the Tesla CEO claimed he had secured funding from the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund to take the company private. That deal never happened, leading to lingering tensions.",
      "With the launch of its first showroom and service center in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Tesla makes its long-anticipated entry into the Saudi market.

      "\u201cHe\u2019s always looking ahead,\" said Mohammed Osama, a teenager who describes himself as enthusiastic about everything Tesla. \"Maybe a few things don\u2019t make sense right now, but in the future, it\u2019ll all come together \u2014 he\u2019s building something bigger.\u201d",

      "PALACIOS, Texas -- While American consumers and markets wonder and worry about President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs, there's one group cheering him as they hope he'll prop up their sinking business: Gulf coast shrimpers.",
      "American shrimpers have been hammered in recent years by cheap imports flooding the U.S. market and restaurants, driving down prices to the point that profits are razor thin or shrimpers are losing money and struggling to stay afloat.",
      "Tariffs, they hope, could level the playing field and help their businesses not just survive but thrive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been tough the last several years that we\u2019ve tried to fight through this,\" said Reed Bowers, owner of Bowers Shrimp Farm in Palacios, Texas. Tough times meant difficult choices for many. \"Cutting people off, laying people off, or reduce hours or reduce wages ... whatever we can do to survive.\"",
      "Since 2021, the price of imported shrimp has dropped by more than $1.5 billion, according to the Southern Shrimpers Alliance trade association, causing the U.S. shrimp industry to lose nearly 50% of its market value.",
      "The shrimpers alliance complains that the overseas industry has benefitted from billions of dollars invested in shrimp aquaculture, cheap or even forced labor, use of antibiotics banned in the U.S., and few or no environment regulations.",
      "More than 90% of shrimp consumed in the U.S. is imported, according to the alliance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a believer in free trade. I\u2019m a believer fair trade,\u201d Bowers said. \"So if you\u2019re gonna sell into the United States, I think it\u2019s very important to get the same rules and regulations that I have to have as a farmer here in the United States.\u201d",
      "Craig Wallis, owner of W&W Dock & Ice, has been in the business since 1975 and noted that back then shrimpers would run their trawlers 12 months a year.",
      "Not anymore. That's no longer affordable as Gulf shrimpers compete with cheaper product coming in from South America, China and India.",
      "Wallis says he's only able to run his shrimp boats about half the year, yet \u201cthe bills keep coming every month.\u201d",
      "\"We don\u2019t get any subsidies here. We don\u2019t need any help from the government. What we get for our product is what we have to make it on,\u201d he said.",
      "Wallis, who noted he voted for Trump, has watched the back-and-forth on tariffs in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know where the tariffs are going to be settled at,\" he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s definitely going to help.\"",
      "But Trump's tariffs will also force shrimpers to balance the higher costs of equipment, such as trawl cables, webbing, chains and shackles. Some of those items have recently been increasing in price, Wallis said.",
      "\"We got be careful that there\u2019s a good balance,\u201d he said.",
      "If the American shrimping industry collapses, Wallis sees a future where foreign trawlers are operating in the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump renamed the \u201c Gulf of America. \u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hanging on to have something when I retire,\u201d said Wallis, who is 72. \u201cIf it keeps going like it is, it\u2019s taken away from my retirement that I\u2019ve worked for all my life.\u201d",
      "Phan Tran's family used to be shrimpers but quit the boats around 25 years ago to open Tran's Family Restaurant, a place they literally built themselves.",
      "\u201cIt was just my dad, me and one welder,\u201d Tran said.",
      "Tran said he doesn't want to serve imported shrimp to his customers. He doesn't know what shortcuts foreign shrimper firms take.",
      "\u201cThe taste, the size, you could tell the texture of the shrimp, everything. ... Domestic shrimp versus imported shrimp, you could tell the difference,\u201d Tran said, adding he'll be buying straight from the day's catch at the dock, \u201cas long as we have the restaurant business.\u201d",
      "Tariffs will help keep the market fair for local shrimpers, Tran said.",
      "\u201cWe used to have a sign on our window here that says, \u2018friends don\u2019t let friends eat imported shrimp,\u2019\" Tran said. \u201cAnd a few people got a little offended by it, so we had to take it off. (But) that's a true statement that we stand by here.\u201d",
      "Bowers, the shrimp farm owner, hopes seafood tariffs have a positive ripple effect across the industry for American producers.",
      "\u201cI think the price of imported seafood is gonna come up,\" he said. \u201cAnd as that price comes up, it\u2019ll make our seafood, our shrimp, more affordable for everybody else.\u201d",

      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Donald Trump's nominee to oversee an agency that manages a quarter-billion acres of public land has withdrawn her nomination following revelations that she criticized the Republican president in 2021 for inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The withdrawal of Kathleen Sgamma to lead the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management was announced Thursday morning at the start of her confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.",
      "David Bernhardt, who served as interior secretary in Trump\u2019s first term, suggested on X that Sgamma\u2019s withdrawal was \u201cself-inflicted\u201d and he included a link to a website that posted her 2021 comments. Bernhardt indicated that people whose views don\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s should not seek political appointments in his administration.",
      "\u201cI am disgusted by the violence witnessed yesterday and President Trump\u2019s role in spreading misinformation that incited it,\u201d Sgamma said in the comments earlier reported by Documented, which describes itself as a watchdog journalism project.",

      "\u201cI remain committed to President Trump and his unleashing American energy agenda and ensuring multiple-use access for all,\u201d said Sgamma. Since 2006 she's been with the Denver-based Western Energy Alliance, an oil industry trade group, and has been a vocal critic of the energy policies of Democratic administrations.",
      "White House spokesperson Liz Huston said the administration looked forward to naming another nominee but did not offer a timeline.",
      "The longtime oil and gas industry representative appeared well-poised to carry out Trump's plans to roll back restrictions on energy development, including in Western states where the land bureau has vast holdings. The agency also oversees mining, grazing and recreation.",
      "Sgamma's withdrawal underscored the Trump administration's creation of a \u201cloyalty test\u201d to weed out subordinates who are out of step with him, said Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the left-leaning Center for Western Priorities.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the world we're in \u2014 if that\u2019s what happened \u2014 where being sane and acknowledging reality with the White House is enough to sink a nomination,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has been testing how far Republicans are willing to go in supporting his supercharged \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda. Few Republicans have criticized Trump after his sweeping pardons of supporters, including violent rioters, charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "Most congressional Republicans have played down the potential negative impact of Trump\u2019s actions, including widespread tariffs on U.S. allies, and have stressed the importance of uniting behind him.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management plays a central role in a long-running debate over the best use of government-owned lands, and its policies have swung sharply as control of the White House has shifted between Republicans and Democrats. Under President Joe Biden, a Democrat, it curbed oil drilling and coal mining on federal lands while expanding renewable power. The agency under Biden also moved to put conservation on more equal footing with oil drilling and other extractive industries in a bid to address climate change.",
      "Trump is reversing the land bureau's course yet again.",
      "On Thursday, officials announced that they will not comprehensively analyze environmental impacts from oil and gas leases on a combined 5,500 square miles (14,100 square kilometers) of bureau land in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. The leases were sold to companies between 2015 and 2020 but have been tied up by legal challenges.",
      "Also this week, Trump signed an executive order aimed at boosting coal production. That will end the Biden administration's ban on new federal coal sales on bureau lands in Wyoming and Montana, the nation's largest coal fields.",
      "The land bureau had about 10,000 employees at the start of Trump\u2019s second term, but at least 800 employees have been laid off or resigned amid efforts by the Trump administration to downsize the federal workforce.",
      "It went four years without a confirmed director during Trump's first term. Trump moved the agency\u2019s headquarters to Colorado before it was returned to Washington, D.C., under Biden.",
      "Senate energy committee Chairman Mike Lee said he would work with the administration to find a new nominee for the bureau.",
      "\"Its work directly impacts millions of Americans \u2014 especially in the West \u2014 and its leadership matters,\" the Utah Republican said.",

He upped his tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% after China placed retaliatory taxes of 84% on imports from the U.S. While his 90-day pause on other tariffs caused the stock market to rally on Wednesday, countries still face a baseline 10% import tax instead of the higher rates announced on April 2.",

      "Going into Wednesday, the interest rate on a 10-year U.S. Treasury note was increasing and approaching 4.5%. That meant the U.S. government was having a tough time finding possible buyers for its debt, as market participants were wondering if Trump's tariffs had caused foreign buyers to sour on the U.S. government.

      "The S&P 500 stock index jumped 9.5% after the pause was announced. But reality crept back in Thursday and the S&P 500 slumped nearly 3.5% as interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose. Sure, Trump was no longer going to put a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union, a 24% tariff on Japan or 25% on South Korea. But those nations still have imports taxed at an elevated 10%, Trump's new baseline as trade talks begin. And tariffs went up against China, locking the world's two largest economies in a trade war.",
      "Plus, the trade war has expanded with China, and 25% tariffs still apply to imported autos, steel and aluminum. Imports from Canada and Mexico, the two largest U.S. trading partners, still face tariffs of as much as 25%. And Trump still plans tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.",
      "\u201cWhile we appreciate the pause, the reciprocal tariff of 10% still represents more than double the tariff on imports of leather footwear from countries like Vietnam and Cambodia,\u201d said Tom Florsheim, CEO of the Weyco Group, a footwear company. \u201cEven at this level, it means a significant cost increase that will impact consumers.\u201d",
      "Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers, the costs generally get passed along to consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimated Thursday that even with the pause, Trump's current tariff regime would pull down a household's average disposable income by $4,364.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said any trade agreements will be \u201cbespoke\u201d deals, rather than some overarching pact among a group of countries. Trump has laid out a series of grievances and goals regarding tariffs, but Canadian and European counterparts have said the actual asks from administration officials have been vague so far.",
      "Trump has said he wants to eliminate the $1.2 trillion trade deficit, which means he no longer wants the U.S. to import more goods than it exports to other nations. He also wants revenues from tariffs to offset his income tax cut plans. The president has also said he wants the tariffs to bring back factory jobs and raise workers\u2019 wages.",
      "Aides have said Trump wants other nations to scrap regulations and other policies, such as Europe's value-added taxes, that he deems to be a barrier to U.S. goods, an ask that would require other countries to change their laws. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said the goal is to get other nations to \u201crespect\u201d Trump.",
      "His goals might not necessarily be in line with what other nations want.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X that she's \u201cconsistently advocated for a zero-for-zero tariff agreement between the European Union and the United States.\u201d",
      "Lori Wallach, director of the Rethink Trade program at the American Economic Liberties Project, said Trump needs to be more publicly forthright about what he wants out of trade talks and tariffs.",
      "\u201cAbsent transparency about what is being demanded, we could end up with the worst of all outcomes \u2014 a bunch of bad special interest deals, all of the economic damage caused by tariff uncertainty and no trade rebalancing, U.S. manufacturing capacity or goods jobs,\u201d she said.",
      "The Trump administration views China as violating basic trade norms with how it subsidizes its manufacturers, takes intellectual property from its global competitors, suppresses wages for its workers and manipulates its currency.",
      "The White House clarified that the 125% tariffs that Trump announced Wednesday against China were actually 145%, once his previous 20% fentanyl tariffs were included.",
      "Census Bureau data show the U.S. ran a $295 billion trade deficit last year with China. Because U.S. consumers and businesses are such a major customer of Chinese manufacturers, Bessent has said that gives the U.S. an edge in terms of inflicting pain on that nation's economy through tariffs. Of course, China has also spent several years preparing for a trade war.",
      "Trump at his Cabinet meeting expressed hope that he could get an agreement with China, though he didn't offer any specifics on what he was seeking.",
      "\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see what happens with China,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would love to be able to work a deal.\u201d",
      "Wendong Zhang, an economist at Cornell University, said the Chinese economy might suffer a steeper hit to its gross domestic product than the U.S., but it's \u201clikely to stick to its guns\u201d due to internal public support and the ability to increase consumption domestically on goods that might no longer be going to the U.S.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump will need to deal with voters who might be frustrated over the higher price of electronics and other goods resulting from the trade wars.",
      "\u201cMany products that the U.S. imports are predominantly from China: smartphones (73%), laptops (78%), video game consoles (87%), toys (77%), and also antibiotics for U.S. livestock production,\" Zhang said in an email. \u201cResourcing from other countries will take time and result in much higher costs.\u201d",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is vowing to try again to pass the Republican budget framework after abruptly postponing Wednesday night's vote",
      "WASHINGTON -- After abruptly halting votes, House Speaker Mike Johnson vowed to try again Thursday to approve a Republican budget framework, having worked into the night to satisfy GOP holdouts who refused to advance trillions of dollars in tax breaks without deeper spending cuts.",
      "Even a hefty push from President Donald Trump couldn't heave the package to approval. Johnson was forced to abandon Wednesday's scheduled action as the Republican hardliners left him without enough support, and risked upending what the president calls the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\" which is central to his agenda of tax cuts, mass deportations and a smaller federal government.",
      "\u201cThe president is very anxious for us to get this done,\u201d Johnson, R-La., said as he left a late-night meeting with the GOP lawmakers. He said he expects votes on Thursday.",
      "Pushing the budget framework forward would log another milestone for Johnson, who can only lose a few detractors from his slim majority. A failed vote, particularly as the economy was convulsing over Trump\u2019s trade wars, would be a major setback for the Republican agenda in Washington.",
      "\u201cStop grandstanding!\u201d Trump had admonished Republicans during a black-tie fundraising dinner at the National Building Museum earlier in the week.",
      "Trump told the Republicans, \"Close your eyes and get there.\u201d",
      "But by Wednesday afternoon, the outcome was in flux. At least a dozen conservative Republicans, if not more, stood firmly against the plan. Several of them, including members of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, made the unusual move of walking across the Capitol to meet privately with Senate GOP leaders to insist on deeper cuts.",
      "As night fell, Johnson pulled a group of Republicans into a private meeting room as House proceedings came to a standstill. They stayed into the night hashing out alternatives.",
      "Johnson said he spoke with Trump for about five minutes while the GOP meeting was taking place. The GOP speaker said they're trying to figure out the minimal number of cuts and savings \u201cthat will satisfy everyone.\u201d",
      "Options include amending the Senate bill or having a conference committee work out the differences, among others. \"There\u2019s a few different ideas on the table,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "\u201cWe want everybody to have a high degree of comfort about what is happening here, and we have a small subset of members who weren\u2019t totally satisfied with the product as it stands,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "But House GOP conservatives, including several of those who met personally with Trump at the White House this week, remained concerned that the Senate GOP's blueprint, approved last weekend, does not slash spending to the level they believe is necessary to help prevent soaring deficits.",
      "\u201cThe Math Does Not Add Up,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, posted on social media. He said he would not support it.",
      "Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the chair of the Freedom Caucus, led others to met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and other top Senate Republicans.",
      "\u201cAll we can do is make sure that they understand where we\u2019re coming from and how close we want to work with them to get to the final product,\u201d Thune said afterward.",
      "But the Senate GOP leader panned the idea of the House sending back an amended version, which would require another potential all-night voting session like the one senators endured last weekend. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that \u2014 another vote-a-rama, that drags it on indefinitely,\u201d Thune said.",
      "The House and Senate are still at the beginning phase of a process that will take weeks, if not months, as they turn their budget resolutions into legislative text \u2014 a final product with more votes ahead later this spring or summer.",
      "Democrats, in the minority, do not have enough votes to stop the package, but have warned against it.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the Republicans' budget plan is reckless and callous as it proposes slashing budgets to give tax breaks to the wealthy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to make it clear,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cHands off everyday Americans struggling to make ends meet.\u201d",
      "Central to the budget framework is the Republican effort to preserve the tax breaks approved in 2017, during Trump's first term, while potentially adding the new ones he promised on the campaign trail. That includes no taxes on tipped wages, Social Security income and others, ballooning the price tag to some $7 trillion over the decade.",
      "The package also allows for budget increases with some $175 billion to pay for Trump's mass deportation operation and as much for the Defense Department to bolster military spending.",
      "It all would be partly paid for with steep cuts to domestic programs, including health care, as part of the $2 trillion in reductions outlined in the House GOP version of the package, though several GOP senators have signaled they are not willing to go that far.",
      "To clip costs, the Senate is using an unusual accounting method that does not count the costs of preserving the 2017 tax cuts, some $4.5 trillion, as new spending, another factor that is enraging the House conservatives.",
      "Two Republican senators voted against their package during an overnight weekend session \u2014 Maine Sen. Susan Collins objected to steep cuts to Medicaid in the House's framework, while Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul argued the whole package relied on \u201cfishy\u201d math that would add to the debt.",
      "The package would also boost the nation's debt limit to allow more borrowing to pay the bills. Trump had wanted lawmakers to take the politically difficult issue off the table. With debt now at $36 trillion, the Treasury Department has said it will run out of funds by August.",
      "But the House and Senate need to resolve their differences on the debt limit, as well. The House GOP raises the debt limit by $4 trillion, but the Senate GOP boosted it to $5 trillion so Congress would not have to revisit the issue again until after the fall 2026 midterm election.",
      "With Trump's trade wars hovering over the debate, House Republicans tucked a provision into a procedural vote that would prevent House action \u2014 as the Senate has taken \u2014 to disapprove of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",

      "Michael Busch, once a top prospect in the Dodgers\u2019 farm system, had four hits, including a homer and two doubles, and drove in three runs. The first baseman is batting .308 (12 for 39) with three homers, six doubles and 11 RBIs in 10 career games against the Dodgers.",
      "Ian Happ had three hits and scored two runs, and Miguel Amaya replaced the injured Seiya Suzuki (right-wrist pain) in the fifth inning and homered among his two hits and drove in three runs.",
      "Kelly keyed a five-run seventh inning by with a homer 384 feet over the left-field wall against Dodgers reliever Ben Casparius, and then crushed a 391-foot homer on a floater from infielder-turned-pitcher Miguel Rojas for a two-run shot in the ninth.",
      "\u201cYou have to take a quick swing, not a big swing,\u201d Kelly said, when asked how hard it is to homer off a 40-mph pitch. \u201cYou have to find the right timing of it.\u201d",
      "The Cubs pushed their major league-league-leading run total to 112, which is 21 more than the second-place New York Yankees (91), and they have outscored opponents by 41 runs, a margin nearly twice as much as any other team.",
      "Busch, who homered off Dodgers starter Roki Sasaki for a 1-0 lead in the second, came within inches of a monster game when he was robbed of a grand slam by center fielder Andy Pages to end the third.",
      "\u201cI saw him (make the catch) \u2014 unfortunately,\u201d said Busch, a former minor league teammate of Pages. \u201cHe\u2019s a good player. I didn\u2019t want him to do that, so we\u2019re gonna have to have a conversation.\u201d",
      "Sasaki (0-1) left with a 1-0 deficit after allowing one run and four hits in five innings, striking out three and walking two. However, the Cubs then broke through against a Dodgers bullpen that entered with a 2.15 ERA, the fourth-best mark in baseball.",
      "Busch doubled and scored on Justin Turner\u2019s RBI single off Casparius for a 2-0 lead in the sixth, and Amaya (single), Busch (single), Dansby Swanson (single) and Nico Hoerner (sacrifice fly) drove in runs after Kelly\u2019s leadoff homer in the seventh.",
      "Kyle Tucker had a two-run single and Amaya a two-run homer in the eighth, and the Cubs teed off on Rojas in the ninth.",
      "The offensive outburst backed a superb start by Cubs right-hander Ben Brown, who used only two pitches \u2014 a four-seam fastball that averaged 95.6 mph and a knuckle-curve that averaged 86.9 mph \u2014 to blank the Dodgers on five hits in six innings, striking out five and walking none.",
      "Brown (2-1) gave up five runs and seven hits in four innings of his previous start, a no-decision against San Diego.",
      "\u201cJust trying to do the exact opposite of last week,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis past week was a grind working on things, mentally going through things, but I put in that effort, and it obviously showed tonight.",
      "\u201cI was able to slow the game down, slow the heart rate down, execute pitch by pitch and go back to where I was last year \u2026 when my stuff is there, we can get through lineups like that.\u201d",

      "MIAMI -- Alexander Volkanovski reclaimed the featherweight championship early Sunday morning, defeating Diego Lopes by unanimous decision at UFC 314.",
      "Two judges scored the fight 49-46 and the other had it 48-47.",
      "Volkanovski (27-4) had successfully defended his belt four times before losing to Israel Makhachev on Feb. 11, 2023.",
      "Now he has it back.",
      "President Donald Trump, a longtime friend of UFC President and CEO Dana White and a fan of the sport, watched from the front row. Shaquille O'Neal approached Trump and shook his hand. Cabinet officials Tulsi Gabbard, Marco Rubio and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also were in attendance as was X (formerly Twitter) owner and White House adviser Elon Musk.",
      "In the co-main event, No. 12 lightweight contender Paddy Pimblett continued this rise with a technical knockout of No. 7 Michael Chandler at 3:07 of the third round. Plimbett, a 30-year-old from Liverpool, England, has won all seven of his bouts since moving to the organization, giving him a 23-3 record overall.",
      "\u201cI want that world title,\u201d Pimblett said. \u201cSome say I'll never be champ, I'll never get run, I'll never be in the top 10. But what now?\u201d",
      "At nearly 39, Chandler has some decisions to making after winning just two of his most recent seven bouts. He is 23-10.",
      "Featherweight Bryce Mitchell, who fought for the first time since praising Adolf Hitler and denying the Holocaust on a podcast, was also on the card. He later backed off his comments and though White heavily criticized Mitchell, he didn\u2019t discipline him.",
      "Mitchell was little match for Jean Silva in their featherweight fight. Silva won by submission with a guillotine choke with 1:08 left in the second round.",
      "Volkanovski, despite getting cut below his right eye in the second and being floored by an overhand right in that round, dominated the first three rounds. But Lopes' glove caught Volkanovski's other eye in the fourth round and then pounced, but failed to put him away.",
      "That set up the fifth round and, barring a knockout, Volkanovski appeared on his way to victory even though Lopes spent much of the fight verbally challenging him and inviting him to box. Theatrics to the contrary, Volkanovski was the aggressor.",
      "Volkanovski had hoped to get another shot at Ilia Topuria and avenge his loss from more than a year ago at UFC 298. But Topuria moved up to the lightweight division, leaving the featherweight class vacant.",
      "In stepped Lopes, the third-ranked challenger, to take on Volkanovski.",
      "This was the 10th consecutive title fight for Volkanovski, the 36-year-old top-ranked contender from Australia. Lopes, a 30-year-old from Brazil, was in first title bout.",
      "Volkanovski was a -160 favorite at BetMGM Sportsbook to defeat Lopes (26-7), whose five-match winning streak ended.",
      "In preparing for Lopes, Volkanovski said he fully committed himself by beginning training camp earlier than usual and focusing on the workout recovery process and dieting in addition to the physical demands. He said he has never been this lean going into a bout.",
      "Volkanovski had plenty of reason for wanting to get to work. He took an extended layoff after losing in February 2024 to Topuria. More than that, he\u2019s coming off defeats in three of his past four fights, including losing the two most recent matches. All four fights occurred in less than a year, so he was much more rested.",

      "Ennis ran his record to 34-0 after the fight was waved off once Stanionis was unable to continue after the sixth round. Ennis sent Stanionis to the ropes and down to one knee with a series of left-handed uppercuts and body shots.

      "There was a decided Philly flavor in Boardwalk Hall for Ennis' unification victory. \u201cBoots\u201d was accompanied to the ring by Philadelphia 76ers All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey \u2014 who draped the IBF belt over his right shoulder for the ring walk \u2014 and Philly rapper Meek Mill's music played between rounds.",

Celebrity bouts such as Jake Paul\u2019s win over a 58-year-old Tyson have become the rage and can pack 70,000 fans inside a football stadium \u2014 though an expected sellout crowd of about 10,000 fans brought the building to life Saturday night.",
      "Ennis was raised in the Germantown section of Philadelphia and was a Golden Gloves gold medalist as an amateur. He made his pro debut in 2016. As for that Boots nickname? His dad was a boxer and Ennis picked it up as a kid when he tagged along to training sessions in the gym.",
      "Ennis headlined a card in July that attracted a surprising 14,119 fans in Philadelphia to the Wells Fargo Center and his next bout in November at the home of the Flyers and 76ers saw that number dip to about 10,000 fans at the fight.",
      "He's has been vocal about wanting to fight Errol Spence Jr. or Crawford in any weight class. He\u2019d also like a shot at Canelo Alvarez. Ennis also hasn\u2019t ruled out a move up in weight class to 154 pounds.",
      "With Maxey dancing with him in the ring, Ennis can settle for being the best at 147.",

      "Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump\u2019s Federal Trade Commission\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: \u2018It is better to buy than compete.\u2019 True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \u201cneutralize perceived competitive threats,\u201d the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "\u201cUnable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company\u2019s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,\u201d the FTC says.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "\u201cThe FTC already has the difficult task, whether it\u2019s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we\u2019re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,\u201d said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cAnd I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.\u201d",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdefies reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission\u2019s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC \u201cmust prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.\" This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram.",
      "Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",
      "Boasberg \u201cseems to be skeptical\u201d of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a \u201cfact question,\" which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market.",
      "While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram.",
      "\u201cInstagram is now Meta\u2019s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company\u2019s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cThe trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn\u2019t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.\u201d",
      "But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.",
      "\u201cA big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it\u2019s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing \u2014 these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cAnd this will be a case that speaks directly to that.\u201d",

He estimated that the current $1,000 price tag for an iPhone made in China, or India, would soar to more than $3,000 if production shifted to the U.S. And he believes that moving production domestically likely couldn't be done until, at the earliest, 2028. \u201cPrice points would move so dramatically, it's hard to comprehend.\u201d",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The Cupertino, California, company has yet to publicly discuss its response to Trump\u2019s tariffs on China, but the topic may come up on May 1 when Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to field questions from analysts during a quarterly conference call to discuss the company\u2019s financial results and strategy.",
      "And there is no doubt the China tariffs will be a hot-button issue given Apple\u2019s stock price has dropped by nearly 20% and lowered the company\u2019s market value by $600 billion since Trump began increasing them on April 2.",
      "If the tariffs hold, Apple is widely expected to eventually raise the prices on iPhones and other popular products because the Silicon Valley\u2019s supply chain is so heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets caught in the crossfire of the escalating trade war.",
      "The big question is how long Apple might be willing to hold the line on its current prices before the tariffs\u2019 toll on the company\u2019s profit margins become too much to bear and consumers are asked to shoulder some of the burden.",
      "One of the main reasons that Apple has wiggle room to hold the line on its current iPhone pricing while the China tariffs remain in place is because the company continues to reap huge profit margins from the revenue generated by the subscriptions and other services tied to its product, said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. That division, which collected $96 billion in revenue during Apple\u2019s last fiscal year, remains untouched by Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cApple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\u201d Chatterjee said.",
      "Apple tried to appease Trump in February by announcing plans to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the U.S. through 2028, but none of it was tied to making an iPhone domestically. Instead, Apple pledged to fund a Houston data center for computer servers powering artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology the company is expanding into as part of an industrywide craze.",
      "When asked this week about whether Trump believes Apple intends to build iPhones in the U.S., White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt pointed to Apple's investment promise as evidence that the company thinks it could be done. \u201cIf Apple didn\u2019t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn\u2019t have put up that big chunk of change,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also predicted tariffs would force a manufacturing shift during an April 6 appearance on a CBS news program. \u201cThe army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "But during a 2017 appearance at a conference in China, Cook expressed doubt about whether the U.S. labor pool had enough workers with the vocational skills required to do the painstaking and tedious work that Lutnick was discussing.",
      "\u201cIn the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I\u2019m not sure we could fill the room,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIn China, you could fill multiple football fields.\u201d",
      "Trump also tried to pressure Apple, to no avail, into shifting iPhone production to the U.S. during his first term as president. But the administration ultimately exempted the iPhone from the tariffs he imposed on China back then \u2014 a period when Apple had announced a commitment to invest $350 billion in the U.S. Trump's first-term tariffs on China also prompted Apple to begin a process that led to some of its current iPhones being made in India and some of its other products being manufactured in Vietnam.",
      "Cook also took the president on a 2019 tour of a Texas plant where Apple had been assembling some of its Mac computers since 2013. Shortly after finishing that our, Trump took credit for the plant that Apple had opened while Barack Obama was president. \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America,\u201d Trump posted on Nov. 19, 2019.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s loving this, this control over markets, but he better be careful,\u201d said Trump critic and former White House ethics lawyer, Richard Painter, noting that securities law prohibits trading on insider information or helping others do so. \u201cThe people who bought when they saw that post made a lot of money.\u201d",

      "Microsoft said it is \u201cslowing or pausing\u201d some of its data center construction, including a $1 billion project in Ohio, the latest sign that the demand for artificial intelligence technology that drove a massive infrastructure expansion might not need quite as many powerful computers as expected.",
      "The tech giant confirmed this week that it is halting early-stage projects on rural land it owns in central Ohio's Licking County, outside of Columbus, and will reserve two of the three sites for farmland.",
      "\u201cIn recent years, demand for our cloud and AI services grew more than we could have ever anticipated and to meet this opportunity, we began executing the largest and most ambitious infrastructure scaling project in our history,\u201d said Noelle Walsh, the president of Microsoft's cloud operations, in a post on LinkedIn.",

Riley Securities.",
      "The two companies announced on Jan. 21 that they were altering the agreement that had made Microsoft the exclusive provider of OpenAI's computing power, enabling the smaller company to build its own capacity, \u201cprimarily for research and training of models.\u201d It was the same day that newly inaugurated President Donald Trump touted OpenAI's partnership with Oracle and SoftBank to pledge $500 billion in new AI infrastructure in the U.S., starting with a data center in Texas.",
      "Microsoft has long built data centers around the world to run its cloud computing services. The generative AI boom accelerated the demand for such facilities, both to train new AI systems and to keep them running as millions of people start using chatbots and other AI tools at work and home.",
      "The computing it takes to run AI tools is expensive and requires a large amount of electricity \u2014 so much so that Trump this week cited AI needs as part of the justification for using his emergency authorities to boost the U.S. coal industry, a reliable but polluting energy source. Tech companies have also sought to tap into nuclear power, including a proposed Microsoft-backed revival of the shuttered Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, which would feed an electricity grid supplying data centers in Ohio as well as Virginia, the nation's biggest data center hub.",
      "Microsoft said it still plans to spend more than $80 billion globally to expand its AI infrastructure this fiscal year, which ends in June, and has already doubled its data center capacity over the past three years.",
      "\u201cWhile we may strategically pace our plans, we will continue to grow strongly and allocate investments that stay aligned with business priorities and customer demand,\u201d Walsh said.",
      "The Ohio pause nevertheless came as a disappointment to local officials.",
      "Licking County has also attracted data center investments from Microsoft rivals Google and Meta Platforms and a highly anticipated semiconductor factory from Intel, though the struggling chipmaker in February pushed back the expected completion date for the project's first stage to 2030.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Thanks to a mouse watching clips from \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d scientists have created the largest functional map of a brain to date \u2013 a diagram of the wiring connecting 84,000 neurons as they fire off messages.",
      "Using a piece of that mouse\u2019s brain about the size of a poppy seed, the researchers identified those neurons and traced how they communicated via branch-like fibers through a surprising 500 million junctions called synapses.",
      "The massive dataset, published Wednesday by the journal Nature, marks a step toward unraveling the mystery of how our brains work. The data, assembled in a 3D reconstruction colored to delineate different brain circuitry, is open to scientists worldwide for additional research \u2013 and for the simply curious to take a peek.",
      "\u201cIt definitely inspires a sense of awe, just like looking at pictures of the galaxies,\u201d said Forrest Collman of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, one of the project\u2019s leading researchers. \u201cYou get a sense of how complicated you are. We\u2019re looking at one tiny part ... of a mouse\u2019s brain and the beauty and complexity that you can see in these actual neurons and the hundreds of millions of connections between them.\u201d",
      "How we think, feel, see, talk and move are due to neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain \u2013 how they\u2019re activated and send messages to each other. Scientists have long known those signals move from one neuron along fibers called axons and dendrites, using synapses to jump to the next neuron. But there\u2019s less known about the networks of neurons that perform certain tasks and how disruptions of that wiring could play a role in Alzheimer's, autism or other disorders.",
      "\u201cYou can make a thousand hypotheses about how brain cells might do their job but you can\u2019t test those hypotheses unless you know perhaps the most fundamental thing \u2013 how are those cells wired together,\u201d said Allen Institute scientist Clay Reid, who helped pioneer electron microscopy to study neural connections.",
      "With the new project, a global team of more than 150 researchers mapped neural connections that Collman compares to tangled pieces of spaghetti winding through part of the mouse brain responsible for vision.",
      "The first step: Show a mouse video snippets of sci-fi movies, sports, animation and nature.",
      "A team at Baylor College of Medicine did just that, using a mouse engineered with a gene that makes its neurons glow when they\u2019re active. The researchers used a laser-powered microscope to record how individual cells in the animal\u2019s visual cortex lit up as they processed the images flashing by.",
      "Next, scientists at the Allen Institute analyzed that small piece of brain tissue, using a special tool to shave it into more than 25,000 layers, each far thinner than a human hair. With electron microscopes, they took nearly 100 million high-resolution images of those sections, illuminating those spaghetti-like fibers and painstakingly reassembling the data in 3D.",
      "Finally, Princeton University scientists used artificial intelligence to trace all that wiring and \u201cpaint each of the individual wires a different color so that we can identify them individually,\u201d Collman explained.",
      "They estimated that microscopic wiring, if laid out, would measure more than 3 miles (5 kilometers). Importantly, matching up all that anatomy with the activity in the mouse's brain as it watched movies allowed researchers to trace how the circuitry worked.",
      "The Princeton researchers also created digital 3D copies of the data that other scientists can use in developing new studies.",
      "Could this kind of mapping help scientists eventually find treatments for brain diseases? The researchers call it a foundational step, like how the Human Genome Project that provided the first gene mapping eventually led to gene-based treatments. Mapping a full mouse brain is one next goal.",
      "\u201cThe technologies developed by this project will give us our first chance to really identify some kind of abnormal pattern of connectivity that gives rise to a disorder,\u201d another of the project's leading researchers, Princeton neuroscientist and computer scientist Sebastian Seung, said in a statement.",
      "The work \u201cmarks a major leap forwards and offers an invaluable community resource for future discoveries,\u201d wrote Harvard neuroscientists Mariela Petkova and Gregor Schuhknecht, who weren\u2019t involved in the project.",

      "Soil and rocks returned from the moon's far side suggest it may be drier than the side constantly facing Earth",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Soil and rocks returned from the moon\u2019s mysterious far side suggest it may be drier than the side constantly facing Earth, Chinese scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "But they cautioned more samples are needed for a clearer picture.",
      "A better understanding of the abundance of water in the lunar mantle can help explain how the moon evolved, the researchers noted. But it could also be all the more reason for astronauts to stick close to the near side of the moon as currently planned.",
      "China became the first country to land on the moon\u2019s far side last year. The Chang\u2019e 6 spacecraft scooped up the volcanic rock and dirt from the ancient, sprawling South Pole-Aitken basin, one of the largest impact craters in the solar system.",
      "The Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2019 Sen Hu said he and his team received 5 grams of soil samples, then selected 578 particles for detailed analysis using electron microscopes.",
      "They estimated the water abundance at less than 1.5 micrograms per gram, on the dry end of what\u2019s been found in samples gathered over past decades from the moon\u2019s near side. Measurements on samples from the near side have ranged between 1 microgram and 200 micrograms per gram.",
      "Given the limited sampling, it\u2019s uncertain how widespread this dry condition might be, the scientists noted in their study published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cMore far side samples are required for testing and further unraveling\" how much water there is, Hu said in an email.",
      "It\u2019s possible the impact that created this basin may have blasted water elements to the near side, leaving the far side depleted. Another possibility is that the vertical distribution of water could be different between the two hemispheres.",
      "Even if confirmed, the findings shouldn\u2019t drastically alter NASA\u2019s plans to send astronauts to the moon\u2019s south polar region, where permanently shadowed craters are believed to hold massive amounts of ice. This frozen water could be used for drinking, cooking and making rocket fuel.",
      "NASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year under its Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, which put 12 men on the moon from 1969 through 1972. That would be followed by a landing near the lunar south pole by astronauts no earlier than 2027. China is seeking its own astronaut moon landing by 2030.",

      "President Donald Trump nominated Isaacman to become NASA\u2019s 15th administrator late last year. If confirmed, the tech entrepreneur would become the youngest person to lead the space agency that is eyeing returning astronauts to the moon and among only a handful of administrators to have actually rocketed into orbit.",
      "The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee gathered in Washington for the nomination hearing.",
      "\u201cAs the president stated we will prioritize sending American astronauts to Mars. Along the way, we will inevitably have the capabilities to return to the Moon, Isaacman said in his written testimony.",
      "Isaacman, 42, has already flown in space twice, buying his own trips with SpaceX, and performed the world\u2019s first private spacewalk last September. He made his fortune with a payment processing company he started as a high school dropout in his parents\u2019 basement, now called Shift4.",
      "He acknowledged in his testimony that he is not \u201ca typical nominee for this position.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have been relatively apolitical; I am not a scientist and I never worked at NASA\" he said in his written remarks. \u201cI do not think these are weaknesses.\u201d",
      "The space agency and others were anxious to hear Isaacman\u2019s stand on the moon and Mars for human exploration, given his close association with SpaceX\u2019s Elon Musk.",
      "In the audience were the three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian assigned to NASA\u2019s flight to the moon planned for next year.",
      "NASA has been pitching the moon as the next logical step for astronauts for years. The Artemis program aims to send a crew around the moon next year and land astronauts near the moon\u2019s south pole as early as 2027. Lunar bases are planned this time around, not just quick visits like the ones during NASA\u2019s Apollo missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "Artemis has been slow going and expensive, especially for NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket. It\u2019s only blasted off once so far \u2014 in 2022 without a crew.",
      "Musk favors Mars as a destination, as he ramps up more test flights out of Texas for Starship, the world\u2019s biggest and most powerful rocket. By making Starship reusable, he intends to dramatically lower costs of getting people and equipment to the red planet.",
      "NASA has chosen Starship for its first two astronaut landings on the moon under Artemis, named after Apollo\u2019s twin sister in Greek mythology.",

They said the officer presented an incomplete and distorted picture of the evidence.",

Ultimately, he dialed that back, as we saw over the last few days, and folks on the right are up in arms. Basically, I should say -- I mean positively, essentially saying that that was the plan all along. There doesn't appear to be a plan. Let's be, let's be very, very clear about that.

The way people decry his strategy, he's been bloviating about that. They said nothing about it. Instead, they talked about everything from woke culture, the cancel culture, to abortion rights and all of this other stuff. So that wasn't going to win the election, and that's what we have to look at. What is it? What is it going to take to get the job done? That's why somebody who's a sports analyst, for crying out loud, is in the daggone on polls. Yeah, it's not, it's not somebody big upping in me.

I am completely confident, as is [Trump], that this will be worked out in a positive, thoughtful and effective way for the United States of America. I mean, Donald Trump has the ball. I want him to have it. He's the right person with it. He knows how to play this game. He knows how to deal with President Xi. This is the right person for the right role, and I am confident this is going to work out with China. Yes, is it in a tough spot now, of course it is, but that'll -- you'll see.

He knows what he meant, and we all know what he meant, which is that, you know, the Chinese have basically attacked America and ripped us off by, by undercutting our businesses. The government of China assists their businesses to undercut our businesses, drive them out of business and take that manufacturing over to China. It's happened in pharmaceuticals. It's happened in so many industries. ... Imagine if the government of America, the United States of America, was backing your business? I mean, you'd be a killer in the world. So that's what the Chinese have been doing. And finally, Donald Trump is standing up to it.",

As I said, there's a, I saw Panasonic, you know, the battery company, right, Japanese company. They built an amazing factory in Kansas, which they're opening now. ...That is what's coming back to America. You're going to see that production, that, that kind of high tech factor is going to produce things here at very reasonable prices. So I think this is going to work out.\"",
      "On the constitutionality of Trump imposing tariffs",
      "Karl: The Constitution -- Article I, Section 8 -- makes it very clear that Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises.... The president has cited this 1977 emergency law that doesn't mention tariffs. So how concerned are you and are you prepared to defend this in court?",
      "Lutnick: The president knows the law. The president's general counsels know the law. They understand this that Congress has passed laws that gave the president the ability to protect our national security. We need to make medicine in America. If you don't think that's national security, you're not thinking it through. We need to make semiconductors in America. We need steel and aluminum in America. We need to manufacture in America. If we just run gigantic trade deficits and sell our soul to the rest of the world, eventually, we are going to be the worker for the rest of the world. We're going to be the thinker for the rest of the world that they're going to manufacture, and if someday they say, \"Gee, we're not sending it to you,\" we'll be nothing.

      "President Donald Trump's Jan. 29 executive order titled \"Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling\" has been extended to cover the country's military academies. With language targeting what it called \"discriminatory equity ideology\" and \"gender ideology\" -- which he later called \"the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies\" -- the order set in motion extensive removals, reviews and institutional confusion.",
      "\"There isn't any clear criteria,\" Katherine Kuzminski, director of Studies at the Center for a New American Security, told ABC News. \"It leaves leadership scrambling -- how do we ensure compliance without being accused of overcorrecting?\"",
      "Kuzminski said military leaders, bound by a strict code to obey lawful orders, are grappling with what she called the ambiguity of the policy. \"Particularly in the Air Force,\" she noted, \"when the Tuskegee Airmen learning module was removed from basic training for a few days, leadership was trying to follow through with the best of intentions.\"",
      "Department of the Navy leadership determined which books required removal at the Naval Academy library, Hawkins told ABC News.",
      "Initially, officials searched the Nimitz Library catalog, using key word searches, to identify books that required further review, Hawkins said. Approximately 900 books were identified during the preliminary search, he said, and department officials then closely examined the preliminary list to determine which books required removal to comply with directives outlined in executive orders issued by the president.",
      "That ultimately resulted in nearly 400 books being selected for removal from the Nimitz Library collection, he said.",
      "Historians and former military officials told ABC News the implications are chilling. Richard Kohn, a military historian and former chief historian for the Air Force, sees the move as a \"cleansing\" effort. \"It reveals a certain kind of weakness in the current administration's confidence,\" he said. \"They're determined to appeal to their MAGA constituency by rolling back decades of progress on race, religion, and diversity.\"",
      "For Kohn, removing these books from the shelves sends a clear message to cadets: To get ahead in the military, avoid certain ideas.",
      "Retired U.S. Air Force Col. Thomas Keaney, a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced international Studies, spoke about how far the academies have come -- and how far he said they risk falling back. \"When I was there,\" he said, \"it was a whites-only institution,\" he said of the U.S. Air Force Academy. \"It was the poorer for it.\" Education, he insisted, is about exposure. \"You are not harming people by letting them read,\" he said.",
      "In a letter to the secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Democratic Reps. Adam Smith and Chrissy Houlahan called the book removals \"a blatant attack on the First Amendment\" and \"an alarming return to McCarthy-era censorship.\"",
      "They demanded to know who ordered the removals, the process used and which titles were being purged, while urging an immediate halt.",
      "The academies have issued carefully worded responses -- or none at all -- when asked by ABC News for comment.",
      "The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy did not respond to repeated requests. The U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy and U.S. Coast Guard Academy issued brief statements affirming compliance with executive orders but offered few specifics.",
      "\u201cThe Coast Guard Academy is conducting a comprehensive review of its curriculum to ensure compliance with all executive orders,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "The U.S. Naval Academy spokesman confirmed that \"nearly 400 books\" had been removed from its Nimitz Library, explaining the move as an effort \"to ensure compliance with all directives outlined in Executive Orders issued by the President.\"",
      "He emphasized what he called the library's robust collection -- some 590,000 print books and thousands of academic resources -- framing the book removals as minor compared to the size of the overall collection. \"The Naval Academy's mission,\" the spokesperson added, \"is to develop Midshipmen morally, mentally and physically ... to prepare them for careers of service to our country.\"",
      "At the U.S. Air Force Academy, a spokesperson noted that a curriculum review was underway \"to ensure our compliance with executive orders.\"",
      "But outside voices in military academic circles warned that the issue goes beyond compliance, saying it strikes at the core of intellectual development.",
      "\"You can't make ideas safe for people, but you can make people safe for ideas,\" said Kohn, who specializes in civil-military relations. \"If you don't mentor students in the academies to understand what's going on in American society, you don't really educate them.\"",
      "Keaney, the former U.S. Air Force officer, was more circumspect but equally concerned. \"I don't think anyone is going to be hurt by reading anything -- however nutty or outside their own culture it is,\" he said. \"You're not harming people by exposing them to ideas. On the contrary, you're training them to be discerning leaders. Give them a chance. Don't leave them to deal from ignorance.\"",

      "Alexander Smirnov was sentenced to six years in prison in January after pleading guilty to lying to his FBI handler about the Biden family's ties to a Ukrainian energy company -- in addition to a series of unrelated tax fraud charges.",

The indictment accused Smirnov of repeatedly changing his story about the alleged bribery scheme after meeting with senior members of Russia's intelligence services, in what Weiss described as a deliberate effort to influence the 2024 presidential election.",

    "story": [
      "On \"This Week,\" Warren rejects Trump's use of a 1977 emergency law.",
      "After the White House announced late Friday it was exempting smartphones, computers and chips from sweeping tariffs President Donald Trump issued against most trading partners, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Sunday that Trump has no tariff policy or plan to implement it.",
      "\u201cLook, there is no tariff policy. It's just all chaos and corruption. That's all we have going on,\" Warren said in an interview with \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl. \"And how can you believe any of these guys? What did Donald Trump tweet out all in caps -- 'I will not back down.' How many hours was that? 24 hours, 30 hours before he turned around and backed down?\"",
      "\"They talk about an emergency. They've got a 10% tariff on basically every country in the world, everywhere. What's the emergency that we have with Belgium or the emergency we have with South Korea?\u201d Warren said.",
      "Following Trump's tariff pause, markets immediately skyrocketed on Wednesday. However, many experts still warn of high prices for Americans and the dangers of a trade war with China.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump and the Republicans are, it's like they've taken a 5-gallon bucket of paint and just thrown it across the economy and said, 'There, that will take care of everything.' They are trying to put tariffs in place on every country, on virtually every product that they export to the United States, and they're trying to do it all at once with no policy in mind,\u201d Warren said.",
      "Other highlights from Warren\u2019s interview:",
      "Warren on the the courts stepping in",
      "Karl: OK, so -- but that law does not mention the power to tariff, and as you heard me also ask the secretary of commerce, the Constitution itself makes it clear that the power to impose duties, tariffs, lies with Congress. There's also a constitutional challenge here.",
      "Warren: Right.",
      "Karl: Do you think the courts are going to step in here?",
      "Warren: The courts may step in here, but we don't have to wait for the courts to step in here. Look, every Democrat is ready to go, to push back and take away from the president the power he's now exercising and the chaos he's now creating. The question is whether or not the Republicans will join us in this. There will be a vote in about 15 days, and the Republicans can either decide that their entire job is to do nothing but bow down to Donald Trump, or the Republicans in Congress can say that their job is to stand up for the American people and to stand up for the American economy and roll back what Donald Trump is doing. And you know, I just want to underscore here. We talk about what's happening in the stock market, talk about what's happening in the bond market. But a lot of economists are saying and a lot of folks on Wall Street is that we're headed toward a recession.",
      "On the Democrats' stance on tariffs",
      "Karl: I'm old enough to remember when it was Democrats that were pushing for tariffs as a way to protect American jobs and American industries. And I know you've been in favor of tariffs before -- again, not the way Trump is doing it. So what -- where do Democrats stand on this fundamental issue: tariffs, good or bad?",
      "Warren: So -- well, I think that -- I think Democrats are entirely united that Donald Trump's across-the-board tariffs are bad. They make no economic sense. But that doesn't mean there aren't specific cases where tariffs make a lot of sense. If you have a plan in mind, a goal in mind, tariffs can be a tool in the economic toolbox. But remember the underlying here, and I think -- I think you're right to focus on prices and costs. What did Donald Trump say on, day one? He said on day one, he would lower prices. That's what he ran on. Once he got elected, his first interview, he said, the reason he won is because he said on day one, he would lower prices. He's six weeks in when someone points out to him that the tariff policy he's pursuing is likely to raise prices and he said he couldn't care less.",

      "CHICAGO -- For the first time in over a decade, Chicago\u2019s public school teachers have a new contract without a strike or threat of a walkout. The four-year agreement includes pay hikes, hiring more teachers and class size limits.",
      "While negotiations between the Chicago Teachers Union and the district didn\u2019t escalate this time, there was unprecedented turmoil surrounding the unusual yearlong talks. The drama included the school superintendent\u2019s firing, the entire board resigning and historic elections that tested the union\u2019s power.",
      "Now, Chicago faces uncertainty with Trump administration education cuts and looming questions about how the nation\u2019s fourth-largest school district will pay for the contract.",
      "While all parties are celebrating the agreement now, there\u2019s been no shortage of turbulence.",
      "Perhaps the main reason negotiations didn\u2019t devolve into a strike, as was the case in 2019 and 2012, was union ally Mayor Brandon Johnson. A former teacher and CTU organizer, the union helped elect him in 2023.",
      "He spent months trying to oust Chicago Public Schools CEO Pedro Martinez, an appointee of former Mayor Lori Lightfoot, in a public spat.",
      "\u201cAll of that chaos and turmoil there clearly dragged down the bargaining and probably shut it down for a fair amount of time,\u201d said Robert Bruno, a University of Illinois professor of labor and employment relations.",
      "Johnson wanted a $300 million high-interest loan to cover the new contract and a pension payment, which Martinez and the board rejected as fiscally irresponsible. In October, the board resigned in protest.",
      "The next month, the city held its first school elections. The transitional board \u2014 a mix of union-backed candidates, charter school supporters and independents \u2014 includes mayoral appointees until it\u2019s fully elected in 2027.",
      "In December, the board moved to fire Martinez, though he\u2019ll remain until June. At one point, Martinez accused new members of meeting privately with the union and won a judge\u2019s restraining order.",
      "The union started contract talks last year with more than 700 requests, a record for the almost 30,000-member union.",
      "Union leaders say their goal is always equality in the segregated city. Roughly 70% of the 325,000 students in the district are low-income and more than 80% are Black or Latino.",
      "But district officials said those lofty requests would have cost over $10 billion. The district\u2019s annual budget is roughly $10 billion.",
      "The new agreement\u2019s price tag is about $1.5 billion.",
      "\u201cWe stayed true to our values,\u201d Martinez said after the deal was announced. \u201cWe succeeded in keeping the best interest of our students always at the center.\"",
      "Both sides touted transparency. For the first time, some bargaining sessions were publicly livestreamed.",
      "It was also the first time in nearly about decades the union was allowed to bargain on issues like class size. In 1995, a Republican-led Illinois legislature passed a law limiting collective bargaining rights largely to pay and benefits. Democratic leaders changed that in 2021.",
      "CTU President Stacy Davis Gates celebrated the contract as a win that protects students, particularly those who are vulnerable under Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s big, it\u2019s complex and it is certainly a step in the right direction,\u201d she said.",
      "Johnson also took a victory lap, trumpeting his union ties.",
      "\u201cWhen I was running for office, they said it would be a liability,\u201d he told reporters recently. \u201cBut it sounds like to me that no other mayor could have brought Chicago Public Schools, the Board of Education, the mayor\u2019s office and the CTU together to the table to make sure that our children get exactly what they deserve, which is a fully funded, well-rounded education.\u201d",
      "Under the deal, teachers will get 4% retroactive raises as the contract expired last year. Then they\u2019ll get 4% or 5% raises each year after.",
      "Starting next year, the median teacher pay will be $98,000. By the contract\u2019s end in 2028, the average teacher will earn around $110,000, according to the district.",
      "The district, which employs roughly 7,000 teachers, will hire 800 more, and nearly 100 additional librarians. Teachers will get an extra 10 minutes of daily prep time, for 70 minutes total.",
      "Also, class sizes will be limited by grade level. For instance, kindergarten will have the smallest and be capped at 25 students.",
      "Union leaders announced Monday that 97% of members who voted approved the deal. Davis Gates called it \u201coverwhelmingly historic levels\u201d of support for a contract that built on previous years' work, including strikes.",
      "Experts say what happened in Chicago could give other unions momentum. Los Angeles teachers, who are currently negotiating, noted CTU in a recent newsletter.",
      "\u201cOrganizing is how we resist political agendas to dismantle our public schools and public services. And we can Win Our Future in Los Angeles, just like our union siblings in Chicago,\u201d the United Teachers Los Angeles newsletter read.",

      "The district has a roughly $500 million annual deficit and a pending $175 million pension reimbursement to the city. The district is also about to enter contract negotiations with the principals\u2019 union.",
      "Martinez said the first year of the contract is covered, but there\u2019s uncertainty after that.",

      "A political battle fit for the gridiron is raging in Ohio",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A political battle fit for the gridiron is underway in Ohio, where state Republican leaders are clashing over whether to single out the Cleveland Browns for help building a new suburban domed stadium or impose tax hikes to fund stadium upgrades for the Cincinnati Bengals and other teams longer term.",
      "Neither idea is without critics in both parties, who argue that underwriting National Football League stadiums siphons money from the state's policy priorities, including funding infrastructure and public schools.",
      "The most heated debate centers on a proposal by Haslam Sports Group, which owns the Browns, to relocate from the team's existing open-air stadium on downtown Cleveland\u2019s lakeshore \u2014 where they have played since 1999 \u2014 to a new $2.4 billion complex in Brook Park, about 15 miles (24.14 kilometers) south. The team has proposed a private-public partnership to which the state would contribute $600 million.",
      "After the money was approved by the Ohio House last week, commissioners in Hamilton County, home to the Bengals, balked. They moved swiftly to re-up their request for $350 million for Paycor Stadium, where the Bengals' lease is up June 30, 2026. The ask follows Bengals Executive Vice President Katie Blackburn's comments at recent NFL meetings in Florida, where she said, \u201cWe could, I guess, go wherever we wanted after this year\u201d \u2014 while noting negotiations are progressing.",
      "The stadium debate heads to the Ohio Senate after their two-week spring break.",
      "Dee and Jimmy Haslam, generous Republican campaign donors, say they want a facility \u201cconsistent with other world-class NFL stadiums.\u201d With the addition of a dome, the Browns could host year-round events during northeast Ohio's severe winters and \u201ccatalyze meaningful economic impact\u201d at an adjacent entertainment complex. They point out that eight in 10 home game attendees live outside city limits.",
      "Leaders in Cleveland, where Browns games draw coveted economic activity to downtown and the tourism district along Lake Erie, are livid. The existing $247 million Huntington Bank Field was primarily funded by city and county tax dollars. To many, it's a symbol of the hard-luck sports town's commitment to the team it nearly lost when then-owner Art Modell notoriously packed off to Baltimore in 1996.",
      "Modell's messy exit, also hitched to a stadium dispute, led to a state law that says no owner of an Ohio professional sports team that plays most of its home games at a tax-supported stadium can go elsewhere without an agreement with its host city or unless the host city is given six months\u2019 notice with an opportunity to buy the team.",
      "Democratic Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb and members of the city council have threatened for months to invoke the \u201cModell Law\u201d to prevent the Browns from leaving their current location, where the lease runs through the 2028 season. The city plans to remake the so-called \u201cNorth Shore\u201d with an eye toward accessibility, economic development and environmental protection. The team has filed a constitutional challenge to the law, and the city sued it back.",
      "Meanwhile, the clock for allocating dollars toward the project is running down: Lawmakers face a June 30 deadline to finalize the state budget for the next two years.",
      "Republican Gov. Mike DeWine's budget proposal called for raising the $600 million by doubling the tax on sports betting companies from 20% to 40%. The idea was to create a long-term revenue stream that could help both the Browns and the Bengals, and other teams.",
      "\u201cThe governor's plan goes beyond one team,\u201d DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney said. \u201cThe general revenue fund can't afford that. Therefore, we need to look at something that is more sustainable and can help all the teams.\u201d",
      "The GOP-led Ohio House, however, rejected DeWine's plan in a vote last week. Its version of the operating budget calls for issuing $600 million in general obligation bonds to pay for the Browns project instead. Paying off the bonds would cost the state about $1 billion over 30 years.",
      "House Finance Chairman Brian Stewart told reporters that the \u201cmetrics\u201d of bonds are better for Ohio taxpayers because officials project that tax revenue from the Browns' \u201cmegaproject\u201d will be ample to cover the $40 million a year it will take to repay the bonds.",
      "As the Senate takes up the bill, it must weigh opposition to the current plan from all quarters: DeWine, the city of Cleveland, the Bengals, legislative Democrats and Republican Attorney General Dave Yost, who is running to succeed DeWine next year.",
      "\u201cOhio is getting ready to spend more money on a new stadium in one city for one football team than it will spend on new highway construction for the next two years in the entire state,\u201d Yost wrote in a recent Columbus Dispatch op-ed. He called state money for the project a \u201cspendthrift gift to a billionaire.\u201d",
      "House Democrats unsuccessfully fought to pause the funding proposal altogether, citing unanswered questions about revenue projections, economic impacts and commitments by private developers. Cleveland Rep. Terrence Upchurch told reporters that lawmakers have more important priorities than helping the Browns' owners, \u201cespecially since they only won three (expletive) games last year,\u201d referring to the team's 3-14 record.",

      "The councils have been working on programming for America250, an initiative marking the milestone anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. But the Republican administration's deep cost-cutting effort across the federal government has led the National Endowment for the Humanities to cancel its grants for state humanities councils. That has left them with less money for programming to plan for the celebration, ranging from themed K-12 school curriculums to special events at public libraries.",

All of that is now extremely tenuous. And those are exactly the kinds of things people have been looking forward to.\"",
      "The head of Washington state\u2019s humanities council said the NEH funding cuts appeared at odds with Trump's focus on the commemorations. Earlier this year, the president signed an executive order creating a White House task force to plan a \u201cgrand celebration worthy of the momentous occasion of the 250th anniversary of American Independence.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe organization that\u2019s positioned to do that for America is the National Endowment for the Humanities,\u201d said Julie Ziegler, CEO and executive director of Humanities Washington.",
      "The White House and the NEH did not respond to requests for comment. America250, the initiative established by Congress to help orchestrate the commemorations, did not comment for this story.",
      "The humanities funding cuts come as Trump has targeted cultural establishments from the Smithsonian Institution to the Institute of Museum and Library Services in executive orders. The moves are part of his goals to downsize the federal government and end initiatives seen as promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. The order directed at the Smithsonian, for example, said it has \u201ccome under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.\u201d",
      "To comply with the orders, federal agencies have scrubbed images and information designated as DEI material from websites pertaining to certain parts of American history. That ranges from a webpage highlighting baseball trailblazer Jackie Robinson\u2019s military service to the National Park Service removing content about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad. Both were restored after a public outcry.",
      "\u201cI think that what\u2019s happening is the administration is trying to shape the history that we\u2019re going to tell in a way that\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d said James Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association. \u201cThe expertise of professional historians is being set aside in favor of a narrow, ideologically driven idea of the American past.\u201d",
      "State humanities councils across the country have been discussing how to present the myriad histories that make up the U.S. for the 250th commemoration events. But leaders of those councils say the loss of money from the National Endowment for the Humanities means some events are now unlikely to take place.",
      "The NEH is a federal agency that awards money appropriated by Congress to a variety of recipients, including state humanities councils, museums, universities and historic sites. The money supports educational programs, research and preservation, among other things.",
      "This month, the Trump administration's Department of Governmental Efficiency, overseen by billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, placed roughly 80% of NEH staff members on administrative leave, according to the Federation of State Humanities Councils.",
      "The NEH also sent letters to state humanities councils across the country saying their federal grants had been terminated. The halt in funding came during the middle of the fiscal year for thousands of organizations and is causing widespread changes in their programs, including planning for the 250th anniversary.",
      "Georgia Humanities, the state's humanities council, has been planning various events for the 250th anniversary, said president Mary McCartin Wearn.",
      "They include a statewide \u201cdigital book club\" in partnership with the state's public library service, a program for speakers to travel across the state to give lectures and presentations, and a Smithsonian Institution program known as Museum on Main Street, which brings traveling exhibits to small towns and rural areas.",
      "But the council has now lost $740,000 in federal funding that had been awarded to it, placing those programs in jeopardy, said McCartin Wearn, who has been fielding calls and emails from people asking about the status of their programming for the anniversary events.",
      "\u201cIt's really something that is heartbreaking, because it is a moment for reflection about who we are and who we want to be,\u201d she said.",
      "Adam Davis, executive director of Oregon Humanities, said his state had already run trainings at rural libraries and begun conversations about \u201cfreedom, equality, how we remember key events, why we monumentalize or memorialize big things, and how we should do that.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can celebrate the 250th by having a commercial at the Super Bowl and waving a big flag,\" Davis said. \"You could also do things like get community members talking to each other about the core values in the country and what we hope for, and you can build trust and strengthen the fabric of our democracy.\u201d",
      "Without the funding, he said, \u201cthe scale is going to be quite different.\u201d",
      "Miranda Restovic, president and executive director of the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities, said the state\u2019s role in the nation's history makes the 250th anniversary \u201ca really wonderful opportunity.\u201d However, the funding cuts, which amount to $600,000 this fiscal year, put her organization in \u201ccontingency planning mode rather than continuing to think creatively about how we celebrate that important moment for our nation and our history.\u201d",
      "In a state that has shaped American history, cuisine and culture, the group\u2019s plan for the 250th anniversary was to \u201cnudge\u201d people around the state to design programs that would show off the distinct flavors of their communities.",
      "\u201cWe were planning to lean into us as a grant maker and support local initiatives that celebrated the 250th so that people can tell their own story,\" Restovic said. \"We are likely not going to be able to do that.\u201d",
      "Brenda Thomson, executive director of Arizona Humanities, said she had been imagining dramatic readings of the Bill of Rights, theater productions, parades, book readings and festivals as activities that communities would be putting on \u201cwith a heightened sense of pride\u201d for the 250th anniversary.",
      "She said the $1 million cut to her organization will mean curtailing those activities in a way that will not allow the telling of the nation\u2019s full story. She lamented what would be lost.",
      "\u201cHow do you know what you\u2019re doing if you don\u2019t know where you came from,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate has produced the quickest top-level Cabinet confirmation process in the last 20 years under new Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate, once again, was working into the early morning hours Friday with its new majority leader, Republican John Thune, setting the pace.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until just after 2 a.m. that the last of the senators had straggled into the chamber to cast their vote on the confirmation of retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan \u201cRazin\u201d Caine for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The vote capped a grinding start to the year for the Senate that included several all-night floor sessions and \u2014 importantly for Thune \u2014 the quickest top-level Cabinet confirmation process in the past 20 years.",
      "At the outset, however, such an outcome was far from assured. President Donald Trump was making demands that the new Senate leader be ready to put the chamber into recess so he could skip over the Senate confirmation process altogether. Faced with that prospect, Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said his message in conversations with the president was, \u201cLet us do this the old-fashioned way and just use the clock and grind it out, and then we\u2019ll see where we go from there.\u201d",
      "That approach has been successful allowing Thune to show Trump the Senate\u2019s worth while also preserving its constitutional role in installing a president\u2019s Cabinet. But the decision to push forward on even Trump's most unconventional Cabinet nominees has also come at a cost.",
      "Several Cabinet officials have been intimately involved in the early controversies of Trump\u2019s second term, from discussing military plans on an unclassified Signal app chat to encouraging the Republican president to follow through with steep tariffs on trading partners.",
      "GOP senators, many of whom still hold traditional Republican ideas, have often had to mount a response. The Republican chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, last month initiated an investigation by the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general into whether classified information was shared on Signal by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. And GOP senators more recently made a concerted effort to encourage Trump to negotiate trade deals with other nations rather than listen to advisers like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who was adamant that tariffs were there to stay.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press shortly after Trump announced a pause on tariffs to most nations, Thune said the announcement showed the president is \u201cresponding to the feedback he\u2019s given.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think everybody wants to see him succeed with this, wants to see the country succeed and wants to make sure that we\u2019re gauging and calibrating \u2014 as some of these major policy shifts are being made \u2014 the impacts that they have,\u201d Thune added.",
      "That balance \u2014 Thune's supportive yet still cautious approach \u2014 has marked his early months working with a president with whom, until last year, he had a fraught relationship. So far, Trump and Thune have stayed on upbeat terms, but the stakes will only rise for Republicans in the coming months as they try to lift through Congress a massive package of tax breaks and spending cuts on party-line votes.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, it took barely a year \u2014 and some setbacks in Congress \u2014 before Trump began openly feuding with then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.",
      "Discussing the reconciliation package as he sat in McConnell\u2019s old leadership office, Thune stressed that for the GOP\u2019s marquee legislation to work, \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to be rolling in the same direction. It takes a lot of teamwork.\u201d",
      "As Trump has entered office with practically total command of the Republican Party and an agenda to upend the federal government and its role in society, Thune acknowledged that Trump has been aggressive in his use of executive power. But he argued that it was no different from how previous presidents wanted to \u201ctake as much power as they possibly can,\" pointing to President Joe Biden\u2019s moves to cancel student debt and boost government food assistance.",
      "\u201cOur job is to do what we can to support the president and his agenda,\u201d Thune said. \u201cBut, you know, be that important check and balance, too, that the Founders intended.\u201d",
      "Still, as Trump has blazed through constitutional norms with sweeping orders that endanger civil rights, government programs, the federal workforce and America\u2019s relationship with allies, Republicans in Congress have stood by.",
      "\u201cWe need Republicans to get off the sidelines, including the majority leader, and say, \u2019This is unacceptable behavior by any president,'\u201d said Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat.",
      "Kelly cited Trump\u2019s disparagement of NATO and comments about taking over countries like Canada and Greenland and the Panama Canal. \u201cThe damage that Donald Trump is doing to our international reputation is not something we easily recover from,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Kelly added that Thune \u201cdeserves some credit\u201d for making the \u201cmechanics of the Senate function well.\u201d",
      "Thune has been aggressive in trying to get the Senate to move faster through its votes. He noted that he had allowed one recent vote session to close before he had even had a chance to cast his vote because he was at the White House for a meeting.",
      "It\u2019s an incremental change in the Senate\u2019s timing, but one that Thune, a former runner, hopes will contribute to the chamber becoming more active and deliberative in shaping the law. He won the leadership contest in part by pledging to allow individual senators to have more of a say in crafting and amending legislation.",
      "So far, the Senate has also gained bipartisan support to pass bills that will increase prison penalties for fentanyl traffickers as well as mandate the detainment of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and are accused of theft and violent crimes.",
      "Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who has been vocal about changes to the way legislation advances, said Thune has \"done a great job,\" although the Senate hasn't had much of a chance to work on legislation.",
      "\u201cThe truth of the matter,\" he added, \u201cis we've been consumed by confirmations.\u201d",

      "As the Christian world commemorates Holy Week leading up to Easter Sunday, the State Department has issued an appeal for its employees to report instances of alleged anti-Christian bias, including actions taken for opposition to vaccines or personal pr...",
      "WASHINGTON -- As the Christian world commemorates Holy Week leading up to Easter Sunday, the State Department has issued an appeal for its employees to report instances of alleged anti-Christian bias, including formal or informal actions due to opposition to vaccines or personal pronoun choice, that may have occurred during the Biden administration.",
      "The call comes amid heightened fear and anxiety in the American diplomatic corps, which is bracing for a new update on the Department of Government Efficiency -inspired budget and staff cuts that is due to be presented to the White House on Monday. That update is expected to include the State Department\u2019s latest estimates of voluntary retirements and separations and how those will affect potential future layoffs to meet benchmarks from Elon Musk's DOGE and the government's human resources agency, according to officials familiar with the process.",
      "In an unexpected move, Pete Marocco, a Trump administration political appointee who oversaw the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, has left the State Department, the officials said. He had moved to State as the director of foreign assistance in March after the remaining USAID programs were shifted under the department.",
      "Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters at the time that Marocco was filling \u201can indispensable role in aligning all U.S. government foreign assistance with the president\u2019s priorities.\u201d",
      "But in confirming Marocco\u2019s departure on Sunday, the officials said Marocco left after completing the job he was brought on board to do, which was to dismantle USAID.",
      "The update to be presented Monday also is expected to add clarity to plans to fold any surviving USAID programs into the department.",
      "But these officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said the update to the White House Office of Personnel Management would not be the final word on the reorganization of the State Department. And, they denied speculation among the rank and file that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had refused to sign off on the document.",
      "While foreign and civil service employees await word on their futures, the State Department has moved ahead with an initiative aimed at rooting out religious bias in its policies and hiring practices with a specific emphasis on anti-Christian activity that may have occurred under President Joe Biden.",
      "There is no immediate indication that such discrimination, as defined by President Donald Trump\u2019s State Department, took place under Biden.",
      "In a cable sent Friday to all U.S. diplomatic missions, Rubio asked that staffers report any perceived discriminatory actions taken against Christians or employees advocating on their behalf between January 2021 and January 2025. The cable, copies of which were obtained by The Associated Press, says that all reported allegations will be investigated by a government-wide task force on anti-Christian bias and if discrimination is found the culprits may be disciplined. It also makes clear that allegations can be submitted anonymously.",
      "\u201cThe task force will collect information and ideas from individuals and groups, including Department employees, affected by anti-Christian bias or other religious discriminatory conduct,\u201d the cable says.",
      "\u201cThe task force is soliciting examples of anti-religious bias, particularly from the past four years, where the Department targeted anyone for their religion, including discrimination, harassment, exclusion, disciplinary action, adverse security clearance determinations, or any other adverse action, or in retaliation for exercising their religious rights,\u201d the cable said. \u201cThis includes anti-religious bias committed by department employees in their official duties against members of the public.\u201d",
      "Examples of potential violations include formal or informal actions taken against a person because they requested religious accommodation \u201cfrom taking mandatory vaccines or observing religious holidays \u201d and \u201cmistreatment for refusing to participate in events and activities that promoted themes inconsistent with or hostile to one\u2019s religious beliefs, including policies or practices related to preferred personal pronouns,\u201d according to the cable.",
      "Others include \u201cmistreatment for opposing displays of flags, banners or other paraphernalia on or in government facilities because of religious objection or for opposing official media content due to religious objections, forcing employees to remove personal displays of religious faith or conscience, whether as part of clothing/accessories items on desks or in personal workspace,\u201d the cable said.",
      "In non-governmental chat groups and elsewhere, some State Department employees expressed alarm over the cable, particularly as it was issued shortly after the promotion of a junior foreign service officer to temporarily run the department\u2019s human resources office, the Bureau of Global Talent Management.",
      "Lew Olowski assumed that job last week and in his first comments to employees gave a welcome address to a new class of incoming diplomats that cited both biblical verses and religiously themed quotes from President Abraham Lincoln.",
      "After swearing in the new class with the oath to Constitution, Olowski told them: \u201cOaths and words are different. Words are for talking. Dolphins can talk. Oaths are covenants. Animals do not covenant. Only God and man can make covenants.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo an officer of the United States like you and me, the Constitution is our commandment. Its words are like the word of God and the words of the oath are our creation as officers,\u201d he said, according to a transcript of his remarks.",
      "\u201cAnd these words are our beginning. In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God,\u201d he said, before praising foreign service officers who have died while in service to the country.",
      "In a perhaps unusual coincidence, reports of anti-Christian or other religious bias are to be reported to Olowski\u2019s wife, Heather, who is the head of the State Department\u2019s office of civil rights.",
      "Last week, the American Foreign Service Association, which represents U.S. diplomats, and the American Academy of Diplomacy said Olowski's appointment was an affront to the long-held standard that the post be occupied by either a current senior or retired career diplomat. His numerous pro-Trump and anti-immigrant writings in conservative publications over the past several years had been been widely shared among internal group chats.",

      "\u201cOne of the things we can do to honor those lives and try to save others is to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe know there is one thing for sure about New York City\u2019s helicopter tour companies: they have a deadly track record.\u201d",
      "Thursday's crash has re\u200b\u200bnewed safety concerns about New York's sightseeing excursions, a popular tourist draw that whisks passengers high above the city, offering soaring views of the Statue of Liberty, the World Trade Center and other landmarks.",
      "In the last two decades, five helicopters on commercial sightseeing flights have fallen into the Hudson and East rivers as a result of mechanical failures, pilot errors or collisions, killing 20 people.",
      "The president of New York Helicopter Tours, Michael Roth, did not respond to phone and email inquiries. The company said in a statement published on its website that it was cooperating with authorities in the investigation.",

      "\u201cWe stand ready to work with leaders on finding ways to ensure the safety and preservation of our businesses and aviation community,\u201d the group said.",
      "Critics of the industry have long sought to limit or entirely ban nonessential helicopter flights from taking off above the city, though they have had limited success. After New York City capped the number of flights that could take off from Manhattan heliports at 30,000 annually in 2016, many companies moved operations to New Jersey.",

      "After years of a shortened crab fishing season aimed at preventing whale entanglements off the West Coast, California crabbers are experimenting with a new fishing method that allows them to stay on the water longer while keeping the marine mammals safe",
      "After years of a shortened crab fishing season aimed at preventing whale entanglements off the West Coast, California crabbers are experimenting with a new fishing method that allows them to stay on the water longer while keeping the marine mammals safe.",
      "The state has been running a pilot program since 2023 to try out so-called pop-up gear to protect whales while finding a solution to fishermen's woes and is expected to fully authorize the gear for spring Dungeness crab fishing in 2026.",
      "The gear, which uses a remote device to pull up lines laid horizontally across the sea floor, also is being tried on lobster in Maine, black sea bass in Georgia and fisheries in Australia and Canada.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it has been six years we've been delayed or closed early for whales,\u201d said Brand Little, a San Francisco Dungeness crab fisherman who is among those participating in the pilot.",
      "\"This is a way to get our industry back,\" he said.",
      "The effort comes after reports of whale entanglements off the Pacific Coast spiked a decade ago during a marine heat wave. The change in temperature drove whales, many of them threatened or endangered humpbacks, to seek out food sources closer to the California coast, where they were caught in vertical fishing lines that had been strung between crab pots on the ocean floor and buoys bobbing on the surface.",
      "In response, California state regulators barred Dungeness crab fishing when whales are known to be present. That shortened the season significantly, giving fishermen a narrow window in which to make a living. So some began trying pop-up gear and determined the method works and is worth the additional cost.",
      "The gear lets fishermen use a remote-operated, acoustic release device to pop-up a crab pot from the ocean floor rather than have it tethered to a floating buoy. Pots can be strung together with ropes laid horizontally instead of vertically, so whales can pass over them while migrating through the area.",
      "\u201cIf you remove the vertical line, you have removed the entanglement risk, and you have allowed a fishery to continue,\u201d said Ryan Bartling, senior environmental scientist supervisor with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "Many long-time Dungeness crab fishermen have been slow to warm up to the idea due to the cost, which can run $1,000 per pop-up device plus an on-board unit. It also takes time to restring the pots after an intense winter season of derby-style fishing, which takes place when whales are calving in warmer waters to the south.",
      "There also is a need for a unified tracking system since the gear isn\u2019t visible on the surface, Bartling said.",
      "More than four dozen whales were entangled in fishing nets in 2015, compared with an annual average of 10 in prior years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Many were humpback whales, which were listed as endangered in the 1970s and have been recovering since protections were put in place, the agency said.",
      "Environmental advocates sued California over the increased entanglements and reached a settlement with the state in 2019 that encouraged the use of ropeless gear.",
      "Bart Chadwick, who owns San Diego-based Sub Sea Sonics, said he previously used pop-up technology to retrieve expensive equipment while conducting environmental work at sea. When he retired from his job, he made tweaks so it could be adapted for fishing.",
      "\u201cIt allows them to fish in places they wouldn\u2019t otherwise,\u201d Chadwick said, adding the technology also reduces gear losses.",
      "Most Dungeness crab fishermen make their money during the early part of the season when whales typically aren't near the California coast. Experts say the pop-up gear won't work then due to crowding and the technology is currently being considered solely for the smaller spring season, which starts April 16 in central California.",
      "Geoff Shester, senior scientist at conservation organization Oceana, said he thinks the method could eventually be used more broadly if fishermen find it efficient and cost-effective.",
      "\u201cThink about electric cars, or hybrids, or even digital cameras,\" Shester said. \"Every time you have a new technology, there is a lot of resistance at first.\u201d",
      "Crab fisherman Ben Platt said he was a vocal opponent but will join this year's pilot since multiple pots now can be strung together, making the method simpler and cheaper. Still, he said many fishermen have concerns and aren't likely to get on board.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see and take a look at the results,\u201d Platt said.",
      "For Stephen Melz, who fishes out of Half Moon Bay, California, having more time out on the ocean is key. Years ago, he said he would go out for Dungeness crab starting in November and fish through the spring.",
      "Now, with the shortened season, he said there is no room for error and the gear helps him get out so he can pay his bills.",
      "\u201cBetter than just sitting at dock,\u201d he said.",

      "The Republican president is a longtime UFC fan and sports enthusiast, who has frequently attended major fights. The mixed martial arts fight at Miami\u2019s Kaseya Center was Trump's first UFC visit since he took office in January, and it came weeks after Trump attended the Saudi-sponsored LIV golf tournament at his golf club in Miami.",
      "In a further nod to his sports enthusiasm, Trump has also attended the Super Bowl and Daytona 500 since taking office. He sat cageside at a UFC championship fight in New York City last November, shortly after he won the 2024 election.",
      "Aside from the president, the main event for the UFC 314 fight is a championship bout between Australian former champion Alexander Volkanovski and Brazilian fighter Diego Lopes, who are competing for the featherweight championship title. It's the fourth UFC event in Miami, in a county that supported the president by about 11 percentage points in the November election.",
      "The president arrived in West Palm Beach on Friday for his 10th visit to South Florida since he became president, spending the evening in his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. He flew to Miami after playing golf at his club in West Palm Beach.",

      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Signs of renewal are underway at the Buffalo Trace Distillery in Kentucky since floodwaters that inundated the whiskey-making campus receded. But executives say the painstaking task of inspecting any bourbon barrels touched by the high water will take time.",
      "The historic distillery has resumed shipping spirits and hopes to reopen its bottling operation in the coming days, Jake Wenz, CEO and president of the Sazerac Co. and the distillery, said Friday. The campus could reopen to visitors soon on a limited basis but for now is closed to guests through Sunday.",

      "The Frankfort, Kentucky-based distillery \u2014 which produces some of the most sought-after bourbon brands \u2014 was inundated by floodwaters from the nearby Kentucky River after days of downpours overfilled rivers to near-record levels across parts of the Bluegrass State.",
      "Now that the murky floodwaters are gone, the cleanup at Buffalo Trace is progressing. Teams of engineers and restoration experts have been assessing damage in the buildings that were flooded.",
      "The overall amount of damage is still being determined, the distillery said.",
      "Those damage assessments include some of the barrels filled with aging whiskey. Bourbon gets its flavor and golden brown color during aging. Workers were able to move some barrels of bourbon to upper floors of storage warehouses before the prolonged rains produced the flooding.",
      "Inspections of any barrels touched by the flood began Thursday and will continue until each is carefully assessed, a process that could take several weeks to complete, the distillery said. It hasn\u2019t said how many barrels were affected but said it doesn\u2019t expect any meaningful loss of inventory.",
      "\"This is a very involved process, including both barrel inspection as well as a rigorous quality testing that we do with all of our products,\u201d said Harlen Wheatley, master distiller at Buffalo Trace.",
      "Based on its experience from previous floods, the distillery is \u201cconfident in our process\u201d and that it successfully recovered the barrels affected by the flood, Wheatley said. The distillery has markers of several high-water marks from previous floods inside its buildings.",

In February, the president and governor sparred during a meeting at the White House. As the president discussed an executive order on transgender athletes, he sought out Mills and asked her if she'd comply with it.",
      "She told him she'd comply with state and federal law.",

      "Woodcock wrote that his order did not directly address the larger dispute that formed the \u201cbackdrop of the impasse.\u201d",
      "The court's order came the same day Maine officials said the state would not comply with a ban on transgender athletes in high school sports in the wake of a Trump administration finding that the state violated antidiscrimination laws by allowing the students to participate.",
      "The U.S. Education Department said in March that an investigation concluded the Maine Department of Education violated the federal Title IX law by allowing transgender girls to participate on girls\u2019 teams.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. importers are bracing for the impact of President Donald Trump's staggering 145% levy on Chinese imports",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rick Woldenberg thought he had come up with a sure-fire plan to protect his Chicago-area educational toy company from President Donald Trump\u2019s massive new taxes on Chinese imports.",
      "\"When he announced a 20% tariff, I made a plan to survive 40%, and I thought I was being very clever,\" said Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a third-generation family business that has been manufacturing in China for four decades. \"I had worked out that for a very modest price increase, we could withstand 40% tariffs, which was an unthinkable increase in costs.\"",
      "His worst-case scenario wasn\u2019t worst-case enough. Not even close.",
      "The American president quickly upped the ante with China, raising the levy to 54% to offset what he said were China\u2019s unfair trade practices. Then, enraged when China retaliated with tariffs of its own, he upped the levies to a staggering 145%.",
      "Woldenberg reckons that will push Learning Resource\u2019s tariff bill from $2.3 million last year to $100.2 million in 2025. \u201cI wish I had $100 million,\u201d he said. \u201cHonest to God, no exaggeration: It feels like the end of days.\u201d",
      "It might at least be the end of an era of inexpensive consumer goods in America. For four decades, and especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, Americans have relied on Chinese factories for everything from smartphones to Christmas ornaments.",
      "As tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2014 and geopolitical rivals \u2014 have risen over the past decade, Mexico and Canada have supplanted China as America\u2019s top source of imported goods and services. But China is still No. 3 \u2014 and second behind Mexico in goods alone \u2014 and continues to dominate in many categories.",
      "China produces 97% of America\u2019s imported baby carriages, 96% of its artificial flowers and umbrellas, 95% of its fireworks, 93% of its children\u2019s coloring books and 90% of its combs, according to a report from the Macquarie investment bank.",
      "Over the years, American companies have set up supply chains that depend on thousands of Chinese factories. Low tariffs greased the system. As recently as January 2018, U.S. tariffs on China averaged just over 3%, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "\u201cAmerican consumers created China,\u201d said Joe Jurken, founder of the ABC Group in Milwaukee, which helps U.S. businesses manage supply chains in Asia. \u201cAmerican buyers, the consumers, got addicted to cheap pricing. And the brands and the retailers got addicted to the ease of buying from China.\"",
      "Now Trump, demanding that manufacturers return production to America, is swinging a tariff sledgehammer at the American importers and the Chinese factories they rely on.",
      "\u201cThe consequences of tariffs at this scale could be apocalyptic at many levels,\" said David French, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Retail Foundation.",
      "The Yale University Budget Lab estimates that the tariffs that Trump has announced globally since taking office would lower U.S. economic growth by 1.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "The tariffs are also likely to push up prices. The University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment, out Friday, found that Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.",
      "\"Inflation\u2019s going up in the United States,\" said Stephen Roach, former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and now at Yale Law School\u2019s China Center. \u201cConsumers have figured this out as well.\"",
      "It's not just the size of Trump\u2019s tariffs that has businesses bewildered and scrambling; it\u2019s the speed and the unpredictability with which the president is rolling them out.",
      "On Wednesday, the White House said the tariffs on China would hit 125%. A day later, it corrected that: No, the tariffs would be 145%, including a previously announced 20% to pressure China to do more to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States.",
      "China in turn has imposed a 125% tariff on the U.S. effective Saturday.",
      "\u201cThere is so much uncertainty,\u201d said Isaac Larian, the founder of MGA Entertainment, which makes L.O.L. and Bratz dolls, among other toys. \u201cAnd no business can run on uncertainty.\u201d",
      "His company gets 65% of its product from Chinese factories, a share he is trying to winnow down to 40% by the end of the year. MGA also manufactures in India, Vietnam and Cambodia, but Trump is threatening to levy heavy tariffs on those countries, too, after delaying them for 90 days.",
      "Larian estimates that the price of Bratz dolls could go from $15 to $40 and that of L.O.L. dolls could double to $20 by this year's holiday season.",
      "Even his Little Tikes brand, which is made in Ohio, is not immune. Little Tikes depends on screws and other parts from China. Larian figures the price for its toy cars could rise to $90 from a suggested retail price of $65.",
      "He said MGA would likely cut orders for the fourth quarter because he is worried that higher prices will scare off consumers.",
      "Marc Rosenberg, founder and CEO of The Edge Desk in Deerfield, Illinois, invested millions of dollars of his own money to develop $1,000 ergonomic chairs, which were to start production in China next month.",
      "Now\u2019s he calling off production and exploring markets outside the U.S., including Germany and Italy, where his chairs wouldn\u2019t face Trump\u2019s triple-digit tariffs.",
      "He had looked for ways to make the chairs in the United States and had discussions with potential suppliers in Michigan, but the costs would have been 25% to 30% higher.",
      "\"They didn\u2019t have the skilled labor to do this stuff, and they didn\u2019t have the desire to do it,\u201d Rosenberg said.",
      "Woldenberg\u2019s company in Vernon Hills, Illinois, has been in the family since 1916. It was started by his grandfather as a laboratory supply company and evolved over the years into Learning Resources.",
      "The company specializes in educational toys such as Botley: The Coding Robot and the brainteaser Kanoodle. It employs about 500 people \u2014 90% in the United States \u2014 and makes about 2,400 products in China.",
      "Woldenberg is reeling from the size and suddenness of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cThe products I make in China, about 60% of what I do, become economically unviable overnight,\u201d he said. \"In an instant, snap of a finger, they\u2019re kaput.\"",
      "He described Trump\u2019s call for factories to return to the United States as \u201ca joke.\"",
      "\u201cI have been looking for American manufacturers for a long time ... and I have come up with zero companies to partner with,\u201d he said.",
      "The tariffs, unless they\u2019re reduced or eliminated, will wipe out thousands of small Chinese suppliers, Woldenberg predicted.",
      "That would spell disaster for companies like his that have installed expensive tools and molds in Chinese factories, he said. The stand to lose not only their manufacturing base but also possibly their tools, which could get caught up in bankruptcies in China.",
      "Learning Resources has about 10,000 molds, weighing collectively more than 5 million pounds, in China.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like you just bring in a canvas bag, zip it up and walk out,\u201d Woldenberg said. \u201cThere is no idle manufacturing hub standing fully equipped, full of engineers and qualified people waiting for me to show up with 10,000 molds to make 2,000 products.\"",

      "A helicopter crash that killed six in New York City has renewed concerns about the safety of the popular sightseeing excursions",
      "NEW YORK -- A helicopter ride giving a thrilling sweep of Manhattan\u2019s iconic skyline has long been on the to-do list for New York City tourists of means.",
      "For several hundred dollars, tour companies fly passengers high above the rivers that encircle the city, showcasing a stunning, bird's-eye view of the Statue of Liberty, One World Trade Center and other monumental landmarks.",
      "But Thursday\u2019s crash that killed a family of five visiting from Spain and the helicopter\u2019s pilot, a Navy SEAL veteran, has renewed concerns about the safety of the popular sightseeing excursions.",
      "Since 2005, five helicopters on commercial sightseeing flights have fallen into the Hudson and East rivers as a result of mechanical failures, pilot errors or collisions, killing 20 people.",
      "Longtime opponents have revived calls to ban or limit \u201cnonessential\u201d helicopter flights, including the roughly 30,000 sightseeing rides over the city each year.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams on Friday said he doesn\u2019t support further restrictions on the aircraft, saying they\u2019re crucial for everything from transporting Wall Street executives to police work, and that tens of thousands of tourist flights happen each year with no problems.",
      "\u201cPeople want to see the city from the sky,\u201d he said on WINS radio, though he added that \"it must be done right.\u201d",
      "The Democrat said the city's airspace is highly regulated, pilots are well-trained and the aircraft are well maintained.",
      "Not everyone has his level of comfort.",
      "\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t go on them,\u201d Al Yurman, a former investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, said of helicopter tours. \u201cI feel like the industry doesn\u2019t look after itself the way it should.\u201d",
      "Tourist flights seemed like they might be in jeopardy after a disaster in 2009, when a Liberty Helicopters sightseeing flight carrying Italian visitors collided with a private plane over the Hudson River, killing nine.",
      "After that crash, which involved missed radio communications, a distracted air traffic controller and two pilots who didn't see each other until it was too late, the Federal Aviation Administration created new safety rules for the congested airspace over the city's rivers.",
      "A few years later, New York City cut the number of flights allowed at Manhattan\u2019s downtown heliport in half, capping them at just under 30,000 a year.",
      "Then, in 2018, five people died when a helicopter offering \u201copen door\u201d flights crashed in the East River after a passenger's restraint tether snagged on a fuel switch, stopping the engine. The pilot escaped but the passengers couldn't get out of their safety harnesses and drowned.",
      "That crash prompted more industry scrutiny.",
      "Late last month, the company that arranged that flight, FlyNYON, settled a lawsuit over the crash for $90 million. FlyNYON's chief executive, Patrick Day, said it had made numerous changes to improve safety, including changing its passenger restraint system, switching to a different model of helicopter, adding training for pilots and hiring a safety officer.",
      "\u201cThe introspection and self-critical analysis we have undertaken in the last six-and-a-half years have shaped our view of what it means to be an industry leader, and we\u2019re a safer, smarter, and stronger company for it,\u201d Day said.",
      "The cause of Thursday\u2019s crash is still undetermined.",
      "Videos taken by bystanders showed the Bell 206 helicopter breaking apart mid-flight. The cabin plummeted into the water without its severed tail boom or main rotor, which spun off into a different part of the river and hasn't been recovered.",
      "Nationwide, there were 88 helicopter accidents last year across all sectors \u2014 the lowest in 25 years, according to Jeff Smith, chairman of the Eastern Region Helicopter Council, a trade group for helicopter operators based in Kearny, New Jersey, where many Manhattan tour companies depart.",
      "Helicopter tours, he added, accounted for a small fraction of all those accidents.",
      "\u201cWe shoot for vision zero, which means no fatalities,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe train for that. We preach it. It is a cornerstone of our industry.\u201d",
      "Justin Green, an aviation lawyer and former Marine helicopter pilot, agreed there\u2019s nothing especially problematic about New York\u2019s helicopter tour industry, despite the crashes that seem to happen every few years.",
      "At the same time, he said, tour operators should be required to equip their aircraft with modern safety measures, such as terrain awareness technology.",
      "Steve Cowell, a Colorado-based aviation expert, suggested the FAA should take a more active role in scrutinizing smaller operators with known financial difficulties.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, when people fly, they oftentimes do not check into the safety records or financial viability of the company,\u201d Cowell said. \u201cThey\u2019re placing their trust and confidence in the abilities of not only the pilots but the maintainers.\u201d",
      "New York Helicopter, operator of the aircraft that crashed Thursday, had gone through a bankruptcy and been sued twice by creditors in recent months, an AP review found.",
      "The company declined to answer questions, but released a statement saying it was \u201cprofoundly saddened\" by the deaths of its passengers and pilot.",
      "\u201cThe safety and well-being of our passengers and crew has always been the cornerstone of our operations,\u201d it said.",

      "ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. -- Animal lovers now have a place to hang out with the \u201cit\u201d animals of the moment \u2014 big furry rodents.",
      "In the back of a real estate office building in what is known as America's oldest city, capybaras are crawling into visitors' laps, munching on corn on the cob and hunting for scratches from humans at The Capybara Cafe in St. Augustine, Florida.",
      "\u201cYou give them lots of scratches and love,\" said Stephanie Angel, who opened The Capybara Cafe late last year. \"A lot of times they\u2019ll climb on your lap because they\u2019re very used to people, and if you\u2019re really good at giving scratches, they\u2019ll actually fall over. So that\u2019s always our goal to get them so comfortable that they fall over.\u201d",
      "Since opening its doors in October in downtown St. Augustine, near the Flagler College campus, hundreds of animal lovers have visited the site to give the capybaras head scratches. Reservations are booked several months in advance by patrons like Leah Macri, who recently visited the northeast Florida location from Orlando with her daughter.",
      "\u201cTheir fur kind of feels like straw a bit,\u201d Macri said.",
      "After entering a reception area with couches and an open pen of baby chicks, visitors are escorted into a smaller room in groups of a half dozen or so people. Blankets are placed over their laps, and three capybaras are brought into the room. Other animals like a skunk, wallaby and armadillo are also introduced into the room, and they crawl among the humans and into their laps. The cost is $49 per person for a half-hour encounter, and $99 for an hour-long encounter that involves the other animals.",
      "Even though she had come for the capybaras, Macri enjoyed holding the armadillo the most.",
      "\u201cHe was the cuddly, like the best. He was just the softest,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was just very sweet.\u201d",
      "The capybara \u2014 a semi-aquatic South American relative of the guinea pig \u2014 is the latest in a long line of \u201cit\u201d animals to get the star treatment in the United States. During last year's holiday shopping season, shoppers could find capybara slippers, purses, robes and bath bombs. Axolotls, owls, hedgehogs, foxes and sloths also had recent turns in the spotlight.",
      "The web-footed capybaras can grow to more than 4 feet (1.2 meters) long and weigh well north of 100 pounds (45 kilograms).",
      "Several zoos and wildlife parks across the U.S. offer encounters with capybaras, but Angel said none of them provide the intimacy with the animals that visitors get at the Capybara Cafe.",
      "Angel said she plans to open another capybara cafe across the state in St. Petersburg, Florida, soon. The St. Augustine location doesn't sell coffee or hot food, like a cafe implied in its name, but it does sell capybara-themed T-shirts, coffee mugs and stuffed animals.",
      "The cafe was created to financially support the Hastings, Florida-based nonprofit Noah's Ark Sanctuary Inc., an animal refuge, Angel said.",
      "Chris Cooper, who visited the Capybara Cafe with his wife, was surprised at how rough and coarse the capybaras' hair was.",
      "\u201cAnd I wasn't expecting how affectionate they were,\u201d said Cooper, who drove up 157 miles (253 kilometers) from Weeki Wachee to see the critters. \u201cThey enjoyed the hands-on rubs.\u201d",

      "He was detained March 8 in the lobby of his university-owned apartment.",
      "Khalil isn\u2019t accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia.

      "Even though the judge found Khalil removable on foreign policy grounds, nothing will happen quickly in the immigration proceeding, his attorney, Marc Van Der Hout, said.",

      "Immigration authorities have cracked down on other critics of Israel on college campuses, arresting a Georgetown University scholar who had spoken out on social media about the Israel-Gaza war, canceling the student visas of some protesters and deporting a Brown University professor who they said had attended the Lebanon funeral of a leader of Hezbollah, another militant group that has fought with Israel.",

    "summary": "Vital materials stored nearby to the Scunthorpe plant will arrive in the \"coming days\", Downing Street says.",
    "story": [
      "Downing Street has said it is \"confident\" the raw materials needed to keep the furnaces at British Steel's Scunthorpe site switched on will reach it in time.",
      "The government has been attempting to source the material needed to fuel the plant's central blast furnaces since taking control of it on Saturday, and has confirmed a shipment will arrive \"in the coming days\".",
      "Ministers seized control of operations after talks with British Steel's Chinese owner Jingye broke down, and the government accused the firm of planning to switch the furnaces off.",
      "Beijing has accused the British government of \"politicising trade cooperation\" and said the move raised doubts about investment in the UK.",
      "Officials had been attempting to obtain the coking coal and iron ore needed to power the steel-producing furnaces - materials which ministers have accused Jingye of selling off.",
      "Speaking during a visit to the site on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said \"everything is in place\" for the furnaces to continue to fire after the fuel materials were secured.",
      "Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's official spokesman confirmed efforts to ensure a \"steady supply\" had progressed.",
      "Two shipments of both materials are being held at Immingham docks, 30 miles east of Scunthorpe, and will reach the steelworks first, he said - while a third shipment of raw materials is onboard a vessel off the coast of Africa and making its way to the UK.",
      "The spokesman also suggested the order of supplies had begun prior to the government taking control of the site, but that \"there were contractual issues that have now been sorted\".",
      "Sourcing and transporting the raw materials to the Scunthorpe plant quickly is critical because blast furnaces can sustain permanent damage if their temperature drops too low, while restarting a furnace is also costly and complex.",
      "An emergency law was rushed through Parliament on Saturday which gave the government control of the Lincolnshire site to prevent Jingye from closing the furnaces against ministers' wishes.",
      "On Monday, the government appointed two long-standing British Steel employees to run the plant on an interim basis.",
      "Why did the government take control of British Steel?",
      "Chris Mason: British Steel law rushed through Parliament but it is just a stop gap",
      "Reynolds refuses to say if steel furnaces can keep running",
      "The situation at British Steel has raised questions about Chinese investment in industries the UK government has deemed strategically critical.",
      "Treasury minister James Murray told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, while Jingye had \"clearly behaved irresponsibly\", the actions of one firm did not \"speak to all companies who are based in China\".",
      "He also said there needed to be a \"high level of scrutiny\" for any foreign investment in critical infrastructure.",
      "The UK government has so far stopped short of taking British Steel back into full public ownership but has not ruled out nationalisation, while also looking for potential private investors to fund operations at Scunthorpe.",
      "While Rayner said the government wanted to work with the company to continue to secure the site, as well as explore alternative private investment, she said no option was \"off the table\".",
      "China's embassy in the UK has urged ministers to negotiate with Jingye to \"find a solution acceptable to all parties\", while its foreign ministry urged the UK government to hold further talks with Jingye.",
      "According to AFP news agency, spokesman Lin Jian said: \"It is hoped that the British government will... avoid politicising trade cooperation or linking it to security issues, so as not to impact the confidence of Chinese enterprises in going to the UK for normal investment.\"",
      "Hopes raised for site's future",
      "On Monday morning, Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community Union - which represents the majority of steelworkers - said the blast furnaces are \"in a far better position\" than before the government stepped in.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Rickhuss said he was certain the plant would remain running and that the furnaces were \"secure\".",
      "Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, from the GMB Union, told BBC Breakfast that she had spoken to British Steel on Sunday night and had been reassured the raw materials would be secured by the government.",
      "The Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people and is the last site in the UK that can produce virgin steel, a high-grade product which is needed for large construction projects.",
      "Without the plant, the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make virgin steel - which the government believes is a risk to the country's economic security.",
      "The site produces the majority of rail tracks used by Network Rail. The company said it does not expect \"any impact on the continued delivery of reliable rail services\" as it built up a stockpile of steel in anticipation of the plant's possible closure.",
      "The virgin steel made there is also critical for large-scale infrastructure developments, such as building nuclear power plants like the ongoing Hinkley Point C project in Somerset.",
      "However, in March, Jingye said the Scunthorpe site was losing \u00a3700,000 a day, which it said was \"no longer financially sustainable\", and the company began a consultation on job cuts.",
      "Talks with Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough. The government said the company had rejected an offer of \u00a3500m in public money to help keep the furnaces operating, and had demanded more than twice as much with few guarantees it would keep the plant open.",
      "On Sunday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it \"became clear\" to the government that Jingye was intent on closing down the blast furnaces no matter the financial support offered, prompting it to recall Parliament to pass the emergency law wresting control of the site from its owner.",
      "\"It might not be sabotage, it might be neglect,\" Reynolds said of the company's actions. On Monday, Rayner said there was \"no evidence\" of so-called sabotage.",
      "The Conservatives have criticised the government for not stepping in sooner to save the plant.",
      "Tory shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the party had supported the emergency law because \"it's the least worst option on the table\".",

      "Listen to an audio version of this article on BBC Sounds",
      "From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution?",
      "\"A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please.\" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands.",
      "The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot.",
      "He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it.",
      "Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth \u00a36bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets.",
      "Our meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail.",
      "His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe.",
      "But six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail's parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed \"legally binding\" undertakings.",
      "The government was awarded a so-called \"golden share\", requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions.",
      "Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way.",
      "But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic?",
      "How Royal Mail's crown slipped",
      "Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door.",
      "But in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes.",
      "Royal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year.",
      "In December 2024, it was fined \u00a310.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.",
      "While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share.",
      "Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of \u00a33.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap.",
      "At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than \u00a36bn but had slumped to just over \u00a32bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April.",
      "He sealed the deal at \u00a33.6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago.",
      "\"Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,\" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. \"It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal.",
      "\"This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff.\"",
      "Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International.",
      "Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do.",
      "\"Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,\" says Ms King.",
      "The 'Czech Sphinx's' plan",
      "Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27.5% stake in Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company \u2013 EP Group \u2013 intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics.",
      "He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon.",
      "The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail \u00a3300m a year \u2013 putting it back on a break-even footing.",
      "Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO \"as long as I am alive\", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that \"rational minds prevail\" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form.",
      "So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".",
      "Given letter numbers are falling, \"we have to think about what is economical\", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail \"to make sure it is sustainable\".",
      "While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements.",
      "Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets \u2013 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five \u2013 is \"over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service\".",
      "It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies \"goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation\".",
      "European parcel know-how",
      "But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business.",
      "Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 \u2013 long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised.",
      "Last year GLS made a profit of \u00a3320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost \u00a3348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business.",
      "\"GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be \"nonsensical\".",
      "In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations.",
      "What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL.",
      "Catching up with competitors",
      "Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors?",
      "Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly.",
      "Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense.",
      "Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe.",
      "Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst.",
      "Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box.",
      "Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an \"historic change\" to give postboxes \"a new lease of life\".",
      "All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time.",
      "\"If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "\"There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries.\"",
      "But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK.",
      "Winning over doubters",

The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders.",
      "Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago.",
      "Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. \"The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,\" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. \"We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor.\"",
      "But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU.",
      "Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.",

    "published": "Mon, 14 Apr 2025 05:39:46 GMT",
    "summary": "A Guyanese political commentator says Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in the country.",
    "story": [
      "The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries.",
      "Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports.",
      "Following Trump's change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place?",
      "Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in Guyana.",
      "Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.",
      "For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.",
      "The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of \"consequences\" if it were to use force against Guyana.",
      "But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. \"I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.",
      "\"The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president \u2013 and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.\"",
      "The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments. The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.",
      "Last year it exported $3.13bn (\u00a32.4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.",
      "This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.",
      "And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.",
      "Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.",
      "So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.",
      "With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.",
      "In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China.",
      "\"Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,\" she explains. \"I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer.",
      "\"I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.\"",
      "Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item's cost.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs \"extremely worrisome\" and is urging citizens to \"buy smarter and buy local\".",
      "Trump's tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries.",
      "\"For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,\" he says.",
      "\"The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.\"",
      "As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: \"Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.\"",
      "The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.",
      "\"These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,\" Sir Ronald continues.",
      "Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1.5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February.",
      "Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.",
      "Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US \"can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement\".",
      "He adds: \"It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.\"",
      "Many Caribbean leaders feel the best strategy to thwart the fallout from tariffs is to negotiate as a bloc.",
      "Mia Mottley, chair of the intergovernmental group Caricom, said the region was facing the most challenging of times since its 15 member states gained independence several decades ago.",
      "\"We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but\u2026 this trade war will mean higher prices for all of us,\" she said in a recent statement.",
      "Ms Mottley added that it was vital to redouble efforts to \"invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing\".",
      "\"We must build our ties with Africa, Central and Latin America, and renew those ties with some of our older partners around the world, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and in Canada. We must not rely solely on one or two markets.\"",
      "Ms Mottley, who is also the prime minister of Barbados, is calling for Washington to \"work with\" the Caribbean to keep prices down.",

    "story": [
      "The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, to prevent it from closing.",
      "A race is now on to try and secure raw materials to stop the plant's blast furnaces from shutting down.",
      "What is British Steel and why is it important?",
      "British Steel's Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company's workforce.",
      "It is the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like buildings and railways. It has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",
      "Were the plant to stop producing virgin steel, the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it. The government views that as a risk to the UK's economic security.",

      "Why is British Steel Chinese-owned?",

      "Private investment firm Greybull Capital bought it for \u00a31 and renamed the business British Steel.",
      "However, following financial collapse in 2019, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service.",
      "It was sold to Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "Can British Steel's blast furnaces keep running?",
      "Scunthorpe's skyline has four blast furnaces, all named after English Queens - Bess, Mary, Anne and Victoria. Bess and Anne are the only two still working.",
      "The supplies needed to keep them running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low.",
      "However, the government says the materials are \"in the country\". Officials are \"working as fast as they possibly can\" to get them to the plant.",
      "On Saturday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it had become clear that Jingye intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "Why can't a blast furnace easily be restarted?",
      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "The furnaces operate at extreme temperatures, with iron ore and coking coal poured in at the top and liquid iron extracted at the bottom. This iron goes to the steel plant to make steel.",
      "If a furnace stops working, the molten metal will cool and solidify. This is called a \"salamander\".",
      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" process can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal. However, this can be a dangerous process.",
      "Has British Steel been nationalised?",
      "The emergency legislation fast-tracked through Parliament on Saturday gives the government the ability to order raw materials for the furnaces and to direct the company's workforce and managers.",
      "Any employees sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated and the plant can be entered by force, if necessary, to secure assets.",
      "But Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "It said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with moving to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "After the government took control of the plant, China's embassy in the UK said it was \"closely following\" developments.",
      "It said: \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years.\"",
      "Who else produces steel in the UK?",
      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms, according to government figures.",
      "Tata Steel at Port Talbot in Wales was once the UK's largest virgin steel producer but it turned off its blast furnace in September 2024, saying it was losing \u00a31.7m a day.",
      "An agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",
      "Other steelmakers in the UK include Liberty Steel, Celsa, Marcegaglia and Outokumpu.",
      "Liberty Steel also has a plant in Scunthorpe which is facing closure. More than 120 jobs are at risk, with bosses blaming high energy costs.",
      "In 2023 the UK steel industry contributed \u00a32.3 billion to the UK economy -  equivalent to 0.1% of total UK economic output and 1.0% of manufacturing output.",

      "First, he scaled back duties that had been planned on some countries, such as the European Union, in what was described as a 90-day pause.",
      "Then, as market turmoil continued, he exempted smartphones and other electronics from the duties, announcing the carve-out just a few days after Mr Medina felt pressure to make a purchase.",
      "\"I can't keep up with the president. Every day is something new,\" said Anna Woods, 42, who recently received a message from her son's summer camp warning that the tariffs might affect pricing of standard gear such as T-shirts.",

      "\"I just feel like we're living in uncertain times,\" she said, adding: \"I do need to make some purchases .... Everything is going up.\"",
      "The latest tariffs include a 10% tax on the vast majority of imports - and an eye-popping 145% duty on goods from China, which is the third biggest supplier of imports to the US after the European Union and Mexico and a key source of essentials such as smartphones, shoes and umbrellas.",
      "The measures followed previous orders that added 25% levies on cars, steel, aluminium and some goods from Canada and Mexico.",

      "The disruption has the potential to cause near-term shortages in the US of items where China dominates the supply, such as baby carriages, colouring books and umbrellas, analysts at Macquarie noted this week.",
      "Analysts say the pickup in consumer purchases is likely to prove temporary, or an acceleration of transactions that would have happened anyway.",
      "If price rises start to hit, many economists expect Americans to opt for cheaper substitutes, delay purchases, or simply do without - a pullback with major consequences for an economy driven by consumer spending.",

    "summary": "Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water molecules to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",
      "\"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said.",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",
      "Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.",
      "The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.",

    "story": [
      "There were some heroic efforts from Donald Trump and those around him on Wednesday night to suggest the past seven days were something other than absolute chaos.",
      "By this reading, Trump's 4D game of chess has left China in check. Certainly the Chinese economy faces a massive hit from punitive tariffs in its biggest market. But even accounting for the President's roll back, the US has still erected a massive protectionist tariff wall, not seen since the 1930s.",
      "The world is left with a universal 10% tariff, irrespective of whether that country (for example the UK or Australia) actually sells less to the US than the US sells to it.",
      "There is now no difference between the EU, which clearly does have a massive trade deficit in goods and was preparing to retaliate, and the UK.",
      "There is also an anxious wait to find out what comes next. One of the questions is whether President Trump pushes ahead with tariffs on medicines, the UK's second biggest goods export.",
      "Plus there is potential logistical chaos on the cards from a little-noticed multi-million dollar port tax for every cargo vessel docking in the US that was \"made in China\". That is more than half of the global merchant fleet - and it is due next week.",
      "Even with Trump's stated 90 day pause on implementing higher tariffs, there remains too much uncertainty for companies to go through the rigmarole of rerouting global trade.",
      "The China fallout",
      "The central issue now, however, is that the world's two great economic superpowers are facing off against each other like rutting stags.",
      "Tariffs at these sky-high rates are massively hitting business between two nations which together account for around 3% of the entire world's trade. The main motorway of the global economy is effectively shut.",
      "The visible tangible consequences of all this will become very real very quickly: Chinese factories will close, workers will stroll from plant to plant looking for work.",
      "Beijing will need to organise a stimulus package to account for the loss of whole percentage points of GDP, the kind of thing that happens when a natural disaster flattens a major city. Painful, but manageable at a cost, though not forever.",
      "Meanwhile the US will see consumer prices surge. President Trump might try to order these US companies not to raise prices, but the effect will come through soon enough.",
      "In theory this will be in sharp contrast to what is happening in other countries in the world. Across the border in Canada, or in Europe, not only will there not be such China-sourced price rises, there could be price cuts.",
      "From trade wars to currency wars",
      "Trade wars on this scale do not stay confined to the flow of goods. They tend to become currency wars.",
      "What we saw this week was the trade turmoil spread to credit markets, especially the US bond market, having already hit share prices.",
      "Indeed there was an invaluable reveal for the game theory of this conflict. The Trump administration revealed a key pressure point with its concern about the \"yippy\" - as Trump called it - bond market.",
      "As trading in US government debt continued overnight in Asia, the effective interest rate on these bonds rose to 5%.",
      "This sort of borrowing should not move in such an erratic fashion.",
      "The last time this happened was in the \"Dash for Cash\", the key moment of financial fragility at the very beginning of the pandemic. The world was focussed on life or death in March 2020, but this potential further crisis was alleviated only by emergency action.",
      "Effectively, the President's row back was a form of emergency policy change.",
      "Was the Chinese government behind this rash of US government bond sales in Asia? Probably not. However, what happened on Wednesday highlighted a vulnerability for Trump.",
      "China is the second biggest holder of US government debt in the world and if it chose to, dumping all that debt would be catastrophic for America. But doing so would be a form of mutually assured economic destruction - the losses for China would be huge.",
      "More importantly, what the bond markets were telling Trump is that they are deeply sceptical about his tariff policy.",
      "The US does have the Federal Reserve, which does have some power to tranquillise bond markets. But right now it does not look like its chairman Jerome Powell will ride to the rescue.",
      "The bond market scepticism echoes the sentiment of the ascendant Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. He is now pushing for Trump to reach trade deals with their allies because the US needs them to take on China.",
      "Given the US was previously calling these same close allies cheaters, looters and pillagers, there is no way this was the strategy all along.",
      "This does matter. The US needs the EU, UK, the rest of the G7 on side in terms of China. China probably needs those countries just to stay neutral, and carry on soaking up its exports.",
      "The rest of the world has seen Trump's team struggle to explain tariffing penguin islands or poor African economies and the President himself recirculating the suggestion he was crashing stock markets on purpose. And they've witnessed the fact that the tariff rates were changed after they came into effect and also the absurd nature of the equation used to calculate them.",
      "It's in this context that Trump's handling of the situation has handed leverage back to the rest of the world, because neither friend nor foe will know quite what they are negotiating  with this America.",
      "There is a calm, welcomed by all, but it could be rather brief.",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "War has changed Zelensky - but now is the time for him to transform again",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:37:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Some analysts say that if costs incurred by tariffs pass to consumers, US iPhone prices could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",
      "While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.",
      "\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.",
      "Where are iPhones made?",
      "The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.",
      "It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.",
      "Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.",
      "India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.",
      "As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.",
      "Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.",
      "Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.",
      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",
      "Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.",
      "However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly.",
      "This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.",
      "Apple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.",
      "But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.",
      "\"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Will iPhone prices go up?",
      "Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.",
      "Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.",
      "\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.",
      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",
      "Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.",
      "Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.",
      "They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.",
      "While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.",
      "What can consumers do about it?",
      "There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen.",
      "This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.",
      "The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.",
      "Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.",
      "\"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said.",
      "Bruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad.",
      "\"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.",
      "We will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.",
      "But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.",
      "CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.",
      "The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.",
      "The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.",
      "\"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood.",

    "story": [
      "Barclays has become the biggest UK lender so far to cut mortgage rates as the continued uncertainty caused by US tariff policy raises expectations of interest rate cuts this year.",
      "Barclays is reducing the rate on certain fixed-term deals to 3.99%, joining several other lenders who have cut mortgage rates this week.",
      "US President Donald Trump has brought in import taxes on dozens of countries since re-entering the White House, although on Wednesday he paused the higher rate on some of them.",
      "But concerns that tariffs may cause an economic slowdown has led to many analysts predicting the Bank of England will reduce borrowing costs by more than expected this year in order to boost growth.",
      "Barclays is cutting rates on several of its products, including its two-year and five-year fixed deals, from Friday.",
      "However, these fixed rates of below 4% are only available to borrowers with a 60% loan-to-value and an \u00a3899 fee applies.",
      "Coventry Building Society, TSB, the Co-operative Bank and Bank of Ireland are among those to have cut rates this week.",
      "According to the financial data company Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate ticked down on Thursday from 5.3% to 5.29%. The average five-year fix dipped from 5.15% to 5.14%.",

      "But after Trump announced bigger-than-expected tariffs on a number of countries, financial markets now predict four cuts.",
      "So-called swap rates, which influence the price of fixed-rate mortgage deals, have been falling in recent days. However, they bounced back slightly on Thursday following the pause on some of the steepest tariffs.",
      "Andrew Montlake, chief executive of Coreco mortgage brokers, said it showed how volatile markets are at present.",
      "While he would like to see more lenders offer cheaper deals, \"lenders may well prefer to adopt more of a wait and see approach,\" he said.",
      "\"Rate cuts are on the cards, with the Bank of England expected to cut further in May, but mortgage rates may not fall quite as much as some are predicting.",
      "\"Trying to play the market in this environment is fraught with danger,\" he added.",
      "Hannah Bashford, mortgage and protection adviser at Model Financial Solutions, said that while Barclays' cuts were \"a very positive step\" for borrowers, the sub-4% rates it was offering were for purchases and not for people looking to re-mortgage.",
      "\"This is a signal that the lenders are still trying to keep the housing market alive but are keeping re-mortgage customers out in the cold,\" she said."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqj3z4g0e1o",
    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:07:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Cocoa prices are soaring so new chocolate firms are looking at an alternative ingredient.",
    "story": [
      "The first thing I notice is the lack of a strong aroma. There's no familiar, powerful waft of cocoa when opening this bag of sweets, the packet of biscuits, or the caramel-filled truffles.",
      "And as I taste each one as part of my solemn commitment to inform the public, I don't get quite the same burst of chocolate flavour that you might expect from treats with that familiar, waxy, light brown chocolate-like coating. The thing is, this isn't chocolate. It's made with sunflower seeds. Or fava (also called broad) beans.",
      "The selection before me is just a smattering of the non-cocoa containing alternatives to chocolate that are creeping into the European retail market right now. Their makers have spied an opportunity, partly because real chocolate prices are soaring.",
      "\"The average increase in price for chocolate was 9% over 2024,\" says Richard Caines, principal analyst in UK food and drink research at market research firm Mintel. \"In January just gone, it's shot up by 14%.\"",
      "That's the retail price of chocolate. The wholesale price of the key ingredient, cocoa \u2013 which is made from fermented, roasted and ground cacao beans \u2013 has increased by an astonishing 300% in 2024.",
      "\"I have been looking at this chocolate market for quite a few years now \u2013 I don't remember a big story like this on costs going up,\" adds Mr Caines.",
      "A key reason for this increase is climate change-related weather impacts on cacao farms, particularly in West Africa.",
      "Plus, some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favour of illegal gold-mining, according to reports.",
      "It means that there was a deficit of roughly 500,000 tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year.",
      "Real chocolate could become a \"luxury\" item in the future says Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and chief executive of Italian firm Foreverland, which makes a cocoa powder alternative called Choruba.",
      "The company opened its production facility in March, where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks.",
      "Carob trees produce small, brown, banana-shaped pods containing seeds. It's possible to process the pods to create a cocoa-like powder. This chocolate alternative has a long history, however \u2013 and not a very happy one.",
      "A New Yorker article claims a generation was \"traumatized\" by carob-based confectionary during the 1970s. It didn't taste as good as real chocolate, and it didn't melt in your mouth in the same way, apparently.",
      "But Mr Sabatini insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product. He acknowledges that carob \"really doesn't taste like chocolate\" but adds that Foreverland's fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavour to get it closer to cocoa.",
      "Their carob-based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel-like than real dark chocolate, he explains.",
      "There could be health benefits to this. \"We can reduce drastically the sugar content,\" says Mr Sabatini. Carob is also higher in fibre and lower in fat than cocoa.",
      "German food manufacturer Planet A Foods has developed a different chocolate alternative. Sara Marquart, co-founder and chief technology officer, says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices.",
      "Unlike Foreverland, Planet A Foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative, ChoViva.",
      "\"We process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans,\" explains Dr Marquart. \"It's a highly abundant ingredient, there's millions and millions of tonnes on the market.\"",
      "ChoViva is now present in roughly 35 different retail products, mostly on the market in Germany and France \u2013 though it also appears in mini egg-shaped sweets sold by Aldi in the UK. The sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate-like coating containing ChoViva.",
      "When I try them, the flavour is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg's core. But the chocolatey texture of the coating is impressive. The same applies to ChoViva-covered biscuits made by the firm.",
      "I note that the chocolate-like coating is rather thin and not overly flavourful. But again, the texture is pretty much what you'd expect from real chocolate, though not quite as melty.",
      "The company's ChoViva-covered popcorn is probably the most chocolatey item I try \u2013 the popcorn doesn't usurp its coating.",
      "Overall, there's nothing here that would perturb a consumer. Especially one unaware that these products don't actually contain chocolate.",
      "A UK start-up also keen to compete in this space is Nukoko. Two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture.",
      "\"We saw first-hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain,\" says Ross Newton, co-founder. Like Foreverland and Planet A Foods, Nukoko has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally \u2013 to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks. But in Nukoko's case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fava beans.",
      "\"There's around a million tonnes harvested in the UK every year,\" says Mr Newton.",
      "It's early days for the company but he adds that he hopes to begin selling their cocoa powder alternative to food firms later this year.",
      "Mr Newton says imitating the flavour of real chocolate is very hard but that, out of 25 crucial flavour compounds in real chocolate, his company's product manages to include 24 of them \u2013 though in some cases at slightly different concentrations.",
      "The company sends me four caramel-filled truffles to try. The caramel totally dominates and the truffles are very sweet. But the chocolate alternative is as smooth and glossy as you'd expect, and very satisfying to chew.",
      "\"Anything new that comes out has got to meet equal taste expectations,\" says Mr Caines, noting how discerning consumers are when it comes to their favourite chocolate-containing products. Getting them to embrace alternatives devoid of cocoa will be no mean feat.",
      "He adds that alternatives might fare best when used in bakery products \u2013 such as the chips in chocolate chip cookies: \"The chocolate is not so much the star of the show there so it might actually be more acceptable.\"",
      "Should chocolate alternatives meet with success, there is some risk that this could negatively impact cacao farmers, says Tonya Lander, a lecturer in biology at Oxford University.",
      "\"It's something that should be worked through with farmers or farmer collectives,\" she says. Cacao farmers are among the poorest agricultural workers in the world.",
      "Nukoko, Planet A Foods and Foreverland all say they don't aim to replace chocolate, rather, the goal is to fill the gap left by cocoa production shortfalls.",
      "Dr Lander and colleagues have studied environmental factors that influence yield from cacao trees.",
      "Poor pollination and high temperatures negatively affect how much cacao the trees produce, the researchers report in a study published in February.",
      "By shading cacao trees on plantations, for example, it might be possible to improve harvests and potentially reduce the volatility of cocoa supplies. Such interventions, besides switching to cocoa alternatives, could help satisfy confectionary-obsessed consumers in the coming years.",

    "story": [
      "It sounds like something from a science fiction movie, but Stephen Eisele is confident that one day his company will open a data centre on the Moon.",
      "\"The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you're really offering unparalleled security,\" says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings.",
      "Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them.",
      "The environmental campaigners fighting against data centres",
      "Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years'",
      "Concern UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off.",
      "Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth.",
      "The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world.",
      "As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey.",
      "New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.",
      "And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby.",
      "Putting data centres in space \u2013 either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts.",
      "Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground.",
      "Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results.",
      "The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results.",
      "It determined that deploying data centres in space \"could transform the European digital landscape\", and be \"more eco-friendly\".",
      "Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers.",
      "Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit.",
      "Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible.",
      "\"But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,\" he says.",
      "\"The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037.\"",
      "However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.",
      "\"Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,\" he says. \"Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.\"",
      "Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work well without gravity.",
      "Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.",
      "Dr Vicinanza adds: \"And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.",
      "\"A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.\"",
      "Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. \"We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,\" says Mr Scott.",
      "Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.",
      "Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.",
      "\"It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,\" he says. \"You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.\"",
      "The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups.",
      "And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin.",
      "\"Under space law, that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state - it is an actual embassy in space,\" he says.",

    "summary": "India wants to boost the domestic trainer industry but will small domestic makers suffer?",
    "story": [
      "It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products.",
      "Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.",
      "So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.",
      "Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.",
      "The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains.",
      "\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.",
      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",
      "To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.",
      "Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.",
      "\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.",
      "But many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands.",
      "Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector.",
      "Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market.",
      "Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra.",
      "\"Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,\" he says.",
      "\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"",
      "So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?",
      "\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma.",
      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",
      "Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands.",
      "While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.",
      "Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class.",
      "Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement.",
      "Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.",
      "\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.",
      "\"And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.\"",
      "Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate.",
      "It claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing.",
      "\"This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,\" says founder Utkarsh Gupta.",
      "He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads.",
      "\"Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,\" he says.",
      "Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"",
      "\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds.",
      "Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.",
      "\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"",
      "But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.",
      "\"The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly.",

      "\"A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please.\" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands.",
      "The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot.",
      "He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it.",
      "Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth \u00a36bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets.",
      "Our meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail.",
      "His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe.",
      "But six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail's parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed \"legally binding\" undertakings.",
      "The government was awarded a so-called \"golden share\", requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions.",
      "Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way.",
      "But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic?",
      "How Royal Mail's crown slipped",
      "Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door.",
      "But in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes.",
      "Royal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year.",
      "In December 2024, it was fined \u00a310.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.",
      "While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share.",
      "Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of \u00a33.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap.",
      "At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than \u00a36bn but had slumped to just over \u00a32bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April.",
      "He sealed the deal at \u00a33.6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago.",
      "\"Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,\" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. \"It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal.",
      "\"This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff.\"",
      "Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International.",
      "Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do.",
      "\"Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,\" says Ms King.",
      "The 'Czech Sphinx's' plan",
      "Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27.5% stake in Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company \u2013 EP Group \u2013 intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics.",
      "He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon.",
      "The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail \u00a3300m a year \u2013 putting it back on a break-even footing.",
      "Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO \"as long as I am alive\", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that \"rational minds prevail\" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form.",
      "So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".",
      "Given letter numbers are falling, \"we have to think about what is economical\", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail \"to make sure it is sustainable\".",
      "While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements.",
      "Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets \u2013 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five \u2013 is \"over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service\".",
      "It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies \"goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation\".",
      "European parcel know-how",
      "But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business.",
      "Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 \u2013 long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised.",
      "Last year GLS made a profit of \u00a3320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost \u00a3348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business.",
      "\"GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be \"nonsensical\".",
      "In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations.",
      "What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL.",
      "Catching up with competitors",
      "Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors?",
      "Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly.",
      "Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense.",
      "Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe.",
      "Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst.",
      "Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box.",
      "Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an \"historic change\" to give postboxes \"a new lease of life\".",
      "All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time.",
      "\"If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "\"There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries.\"",
      "But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK.",
      "Winning over doubters",
      "That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws.",
      "Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe \u2013 paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders.",
      "Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago.",
      "Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. \"The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,\" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. \"We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor.\"",
      "But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU.",
      "Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.",
      "Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky \"couldn't be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years\".",
      "So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice?",
      "The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not.",
      "The monarch's head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.",

      "\"These children are not spending these hours on their phones while sat in school,\" Dame Rachel said in a new report.",

    "story": [
      "CCTV of an autistic pupil being restrained by staff in a seclusion room at a special school is \"brutal\" and \"unlawful\", a restraint expert has told the BBC.",
      "The footage shows the 12-year-old being held face-down on the floor in a prone restraint involving five members of staff.",
      "His mother, who gave it to the BBC, said she was \"horrified\" when she watched it.",
      "The management of the school, in Leeds, said multiple investigations found staff had no case to answer and the expert views were a \"difference of opinion\".",
      "The BBC has also spoken to an autistic pupil who was aged five when he was detained for prolonged periods at a different school.",
      "The BBC's investigation into seclusion - facilities known variously as calming, quiet or safe rooms - began last year when we uncovered CCTV of non-verbal pupils being abused and neglected at Whitefield School in north London.",
      "A spokesperson for the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described those failings as \"horrendous\" and said they \"must never happen again\".",
      "Now, we have separately learned of concerns about the use of such rooms elsewhere, including footage recorded in October 2023 at Springwell Leeds Academy North site - a school for pupils with social, emotional and mental health special needs.",
      "The CCTV includes one 50-minute video in which an 12-year-old autistic pupil is repeatedly restrained by staff and shown trying to kick them.",
      "Near the end of the footage, the child swings his arm at staff and is then manoeuvred to the floor. He is then held in a prone restraint for three minutes.",
      "Eric Baskind, an expert on the use of force in institutional settings who has reviewed the footage, said the restraint is \"too brutal, unnecessary and, in my view, unlawful\" - an opinion endorsed by a second expert asked to review the footage by the BBC.",
      "Mr Baskind said the force was unreasonable as staff members already had control of the boy and could have moved him into a sitting position on the bench instead.",
      "\"They just dragged him [into the prone position],\" he said. \"That would have been really traumatic, and it would have escalated the hostility in the situation, which is the exact opposite of what they ought to have been trying to do.\"",
      "A third expert, education consultant Elizabeth Swan, said the use of force was \"unreasonable, excessive and unnecessarily prolonged\".",
      "She also said the room resembled a \"holding cell\" and many autistic children find being deprived of sensory stimulation traumatising.",
      "The boy's mother, Zoe, requested the footage from the school through an application for his personal information known as a subject access request, and later shared it with the BBC.",
      "\"This is a child and these are five grown adults in a school where he's supposed to be safe,\" she said.",
      "\"A calming room should be a room for children to calm down with blankets, teddies and soft lighting. Not a padded cell. You wouldn't put an animal in there.\"",
      "In response, Wellspring Academy Trust's chief executive, Mark Wilson, told the BBC that it had conducted three investigations into the footage and found no case to answer against staff.",
      "He also said that an investigation by Leeds City Council's local authority designated officer - responsible for managing allegations against adults who work with children - had found that malpractice was unsubstantiated.",
      "In a further statement, Mr Wilson said the incident was typical of those that happen in schools \"from time to time\" and this \"difference of opinion\" concerned footage which was \"selective\", lacking context and sound, and misrepresentative of staff care. He also said the school was rated \"good\" by Ofsted.\u00ad",
      "Although the door to the room at the Leeds school was open, the BBC's investigation into seclusion has revealed that pupils are also sometimes locked in rooms elsewhere. Zip up tents have also been used - and even, in one instance, a cage.",
      "We have spoken to an eight-year-old autistic pupil who was repeatedly locked inside seclusion rooms at a different school while aged five.",
      "The boy - whose identity we have protected - told the BBC that being sent there was \"horrible\" and left him feeling angry and worried.",
      "\"It was just very scary because they can put me in there for as long as they want,\" he said.",
      "Our initial investigation into Whitefield School in London showed pupils being pushed into rooms with Rhino pads - that are often used in rugby training - and also being thrown to the floor and left sitting in vomit, before its calming rooms were shut in 2017.",
      "However, no rules have been changed and schools in the UK are not legally required to tell parents when they place their child in seclusion.",
      "In 2021, 550 hours of CCTV were handed to the Metropolitan Police after it had been discovered by new leadership at Whitefield School - but the force's investigation into staff concluded last year without anyone being charged.",
      "Now the BBC has learned that the local authority where the school is based, Waltham Forest, was warned that calming rooms were being over-used at Whitefield the year before they were shut down following an Ofsted inspection - but it failed to act.",
      "A charity, the British Institute of Learning Disabilities, visited the school and warned of the harms of seclusion. Waltham Forest did not comment when approached by the BBC.",
      "The Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has repeatedly declined to be interviewed about the lack of regulation of calming rooms.",
      "In response to our latest findings, the government said a consultation is under way about use of force and restrictive interventions - and it is awaiting the findings of a Waltham Forest investigation.",
      "Draft guidance asks schools to have a policy on seclusion but this will not be a legal requirement.",
      "Meanwhile, the families of Whitefield pupils have now formed a campaign group that is calling on the government to act.",
      "Maria - the parent of one of the 39 affected Whitefield pupils - said ministers \"have seen the footage and said 'this can't happen again' - and yet there's no change.\"",
      "\"Anything that happens to any other child or young person since they said that is on them - as their inaction makes them culpable.\"",
      "Maria said footage of her son in the Whitefield calming rooms was the \"most degrading, dehumanising and undignified video\" she had ever seen.",
      "Gemma Grant, of the Challenging Behaviour Foundation charity, said school staff face enormous challenges but seclusion rooms are \"outdated and inhumane\" and should be banned.",
      "While schools will legally be required to report use of force to parents in England from September, there will still be no statutory requirement to tell them about the use of seclusion, despite it being \"really clear it's causing harm to children\", according to Mrs Grant.",
      "In Scotland, guidance already advises that schools report seclusion to parents as soon as possible, but it is not a legal requirement. In Northern Ireland, statutory guidance on seclusion is being developed, while in Wales schools are asked to obtain parental consent.",

      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",

      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",

      "Parents do not need to make such a wholesale change as Martha, Prof Wass said, as studies showed just five to 10 minutes of attention could have a beneficial effect on children.",
      "\"In the morning, for example, it's very easy - I'm exactly the same - to be very focused on 'I've got to do this' and then you've got your list of jobs to do in a hurry.",
      "\"But just to take five minutes to wipe all of that out of your mind and say, 'OK, I'm going to sit and I'm going to play with my kids, I'm going to watch and respond to what they're interested in, this isn't about me and what I need to get done, this is about me being there for the child and supporting my child in what they want to do'.\"",
      "He added: \"This type of child-led learning, where you're sitting and responding and sustaining and helping them to engage in what they're interested in, is really, really important for child outcomes.",
      "\"But the other thing is, it's great for you as a parent too, just to force yourself to forget your day-to-day worries and to be there with your child really, really helps you to manage your stress and to manage your bad moods at the same time.\"",
      "Working from home became normalised during the pandemic, with many people reluctant to return to the office once lockdown ended.",
      "But the culture of home working is coming under pressure from businesses and commentators claiming to be concerned over its impact on the economy.",
      "Mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan has said central London was being \"emptied out\", while organisations including the Metropolitan Police are bringing in requirements for staff to work a standard number of days in the office.",
      "Not every job has the option to work from home; those who work on construction sites, in schools, hospitals or shift-based roles in hospitality and shops for example, cannot.",
      "Clare McNeil from Timewise, a social enterprise which helps employers support flexible working, said although it was great that there had been a rise in hybrid working, they were concerned about workers who had not benefitted from this cultural shift.",
      "\"Our work shows that you can, even in these frontline roles, introduce greater choice around shifts and working patterns to introduce greater flexibility through team-based working for example,\" she said.",
      "\"We want more workers to be able to benefit from these opportunities, thinking about the impact on children and families as well.\"",
      "Flexible working definition",
      "The employment rights bill which is making its way through parliament, will make flexible working the \"default\" for all workers.",
      "Employers are required to say yes to requests from staff from their first day starting in a job unless they can prove it is \"unreasonable\".",
      "The government defines flexible working as a way of working \"that suits an employee's needs\", for example, having flexible start and finish times, or working from home.",
      "Employees can already request flexible working from their first day in a job, but an employer can refuse an application if they have a good business reason for doing so.",
      "\"We are hopeful that the government's legislation that they're introducing will be an opportunity for more work, more employers to think differently about how they design jobs,\" Ms McNeil added.",
      "John Dickie, chief executive at BusinessLDN, said there was no one-size-fits-all when it comes to flexible working, and decisions about work arrangements would be unique for every business because every business is unique.",
      "He said: \"Flexible working has many benefits, especially when it comes to employee wellbeing for those juggling multiple responsibilities. Equally, there's no substitute for the enhanced productivity, innovation and creativity that stems from doing business in person.",

    "story": [
      "Fifty-seven years into his career, Neil Young has harvested millions of fans \u2013 but none of those followers is more devoted than his pet dogs.",
      "\"They love the music,\" says the musician's wife, actress Daryl Hannah.",
      "\"They go to every sound check and lay under the piano on the stage. Whenever Neil is playing, the dogs just migrate right to him and lay at his feet.\"",
      "It's not just the dogs. During the 2020 lockdown, Young performed a livestream concert from the barn at his Colorado farm, surrounded by alpacas, ducks, chickens and even a horse.",
      "\"And every single one of the animals came over and laid down and watched him,\" Hannah says. \"It was so cool. I think they're really drawn to the music.\"",
      "Hannah, known for appearing in films such as Blade Runner, Splash and Kill Bill, directed that livestream \u2013 and she's stayed behind the camera to make a documentary about Young's 2023 solo tour.",
      "Filmed largely on her phone (\"and it's not even the most recent model\"), it captures the star's return to the stage, aged 75, after a four-year break, with his dogs in tow.",
      "\"He was very nervous about it,\" she recalls.",
      "\"There's always a point where he's like, 'I don't know if I can do this\u2026 We'll see'.\"",
      "\"It's funny, because he didn't do any rehearsals before the tour. He likes things to be real and spontaneous. But as soon as he walked out on stage, he was fine.\"",
      "Playing without a band, the shows were loose and unpredictable. The setlist changed every night, and even recurring songs like Heart of Gold and Like A Hurricane would be played in different settings, on different instruments, without warning.",
      "It's a set-up that caused his director a few headaches.",
      "\"It was really hit or miss because every day he would go out to do sound check, and he would choose one of his three pianos and play something like Expecting To Fly,\" says Hannah.",
      "\"So we'd set a camera on that piano but, when it came to show time, he wouldn't go near it. There were quite a few shows where we literally got no footage.",
      "\"I was frustrated in the editing room, trust me.\"",
      "Despite those challenges, Hannah captured spellbinding, stripped back versions of rarely-played tracks like Vampire Blues, If You Got Love and Prime Of Life.",
      "More revealing, however, was the footage she shot off the stage.",
      "Large stretches of the film take place on a silver eagle tour bus, where Young rides shotgun beside his longtime driver, Jerry Don Burden.",
      "Together, they shoot the breeze like Vladimir and Estragon - but rather than waiting for Godot, they're waiting for the next arena car park.",
      "The conversations are wonderfully mundane. There is ample discussion of scenery, snacks and setlists (\"people think they want to hear the hits, because that's all they've ever heard\", Young observes.)",
      "It's punctuated by stretches of companionable silence, where Young drums on his knees, or interacts with his son Ben, who was born with severe cerebral palsy.",
      "Later, the musician emerges from the bathroom, stares into the camera and deadpans: \"Now there's no risk of having to pee in the middle of the show\".",
      "Capturing that day-to-day normality was Hannah's motivation from the start.",
      "\"So many performers put on a persona, and Neil just does not have that quality at all. Whatever he's talking about with his bus driver, he continues talking about with the audience.",
      "\"People think of him as this intimidating, inscrutable person who'll make an album the record company refuses to put out,\" she continues, referring to the time Geffen Records sued Young for submitting two albums it considered \"musically uncharacteristic\".",
      "Hannah says people who judge him on that basis have got it wrong.",
      "\"He just has an absolute, uncanny commitment to his creative muse,\" she argues.",
      "\"He's not driven by financial interests, he's not driven by self-aggrandisement, he's not driven by anything other than that creative force, and it's pretty incredible to witness.",
      "\"Having spent so much time with him, my perception is that he's completely guileless. He has a lot of warmth and innocence, so I wanted to show that.\"",
      "Barred from America?",
      "Young recently made headlines for pulling out of the Glastonbury Festival, saying the BBC had asked him \"to do a lot of things\" he was \"not interested in\".",
      "He later backtracked, saying he'd received bad information, and will top the bill on the Pyramid Stage this June (Hannah jokes he'll serenade Glastonbury's livestock, in the style of his lockdown sessions).",
      "But his European tour isn't without peril. Writing on his website, Young has shared concerns that he could be barred from the US upon his return, following a rise in the number of people being detained and deported upon entering the country.",
      "\"If I talk about Donald J Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminium blanket,\" he wrote.",
      "Young, who holds dual Canadian-American citizenship, has long been an outspoken critic of President Trump, calling him \"a disgrace to my country\" and suing him for using the song Rockin' In the Free World on the campaign trail.",
      "Hannah reveals her husband was harassed during the first Trump administration, as he went through the process of becoming a US citizen.",
      "\"They tried to every trick in the book to mess him up, and made him keep coming back to be re-interviewed and re-interviewed. It's ridiculous [because] he's been living in America and paying taxes here since he was in his 20s.\"",
      "Despite that, she doesn't think Young will be prevented from entering the country.",
      "\"They've been detaining people who have green cards or visas \u2013 which is hideous and horrifying -  but they have not, so far, been refusing to let American citizens back in the country, so I don't think that's going to happen.\"",
      "Hannah will accompany Young to Glastonbury, and says she'll film his performance from the side of the stage (perhaps the BBC can use that footage, if all else fails).",
      "The trip happens to fall on the 25th anniversary of her West End debut, in The Seven Year Itch. So, has she any desire to tread the boards again?",
      "\"Oh God, no,\" she exclaims. \"I really loving directing, because I don't have to be the focus of things, and that's a much more comfortable position for me.",

      "The British actress said the US comedy programme \"punched down\" on her and suggested the sketch was misogynistic.",
      "In a series of Instagram posts, Wood wrote that she was happy to be made fun of \"when it's clever and in good spirits\" but that there \"must be a cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap way\".",

      "Wood's character Chelsea was portrayed by cast member Sarah Sherman using a pronounced accent and fake teeth.",
      "At one point, in a reference to the actress's teeth, she asks: \"Fluoride? What's that?\"",
      "Wood, who burst onto screens in Netflix's Sex Education, said she was \"not thin skinned\" and understood that SNL was about \"caricature\".",
      "\"But the whole joke was about fluoride,\" she wrote on Sunday.",
      "\"I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.\"",
      "\"The rest of the skit was punching up,\" Wood added, \"and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on\".",
      "She said that she was not \"hating on\" Sarah Sherman, but \"hating on the concept\".",
      "Wood also shared a comment by an unnamed user describing the sketch as \"sharp and funny\" before taking \"a screeching turn into 1970s misogyny\".",
      "\"This sums up my view,\" the actress added.",
      "She also criticised Sherman's accent, writing: \"I respect accuracy even if it's mean.\"",
      "Wood, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, wrote that she had received \"thousands of messages\" agreeing with her since sharing her posts, and that she was glad she \"said something\".",
      "Speaking to GQ magazine last week, Wood said that the conversation surrounding her teeth made her \"a bit sad because I'm not getting to talk about my work\".",
      "\"It makes me really happy that it's symbolising rebellion and freedom, but there's a limit,\" she said.",
      "Wood added: \"I don't know if it was a man would we be talking about it this much? It's still going on about a woman's appearance.\"",
      "Sister's support",

      "The British screen and stage star won an Emmy for her portrayal of hard-bitten but ultimately kind-hearted maid Rose Buck in the 1970s TV drama about the class system in Edwardian England.",
      "Marsh also had roles in Hollywood films including Cleopatra, Willow and Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy and on TV in Doctor Who.",
      "In a statement, Marsh's friend the film director Sir Michael Lindsay-Hogg paid tribute to her as \"wise and funny... very pretty and kind, and talented both as an actress and writer\", adding she died \"peacefully in bed looked after by one of her very loving carers\".",
      "In his statement, Sir Michael described almost daily phone conversations with Marsh over the past 40 years. She was, he said, an \"instinctively empathetic person who was loved by everyone who met her\".",
      "Marsh came up with the idea of a period drama involving the servants of a wealthy family while house sitting in France with her friend, the actress Dame Eileen Atkins, she later told the New York Times.",

      "Asked by the Daily Telegraph in 2010 why viewers appeared to be so interested in master-and-servant dramas, Marsh said: \"We still seem to want it because if you rose out of your class, you knew you had done well. And we like it because the past is not as worrying as the news.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:02:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The distinguished Peruvian author won the Nobel Prize and courted controversy most of his life.",
    "story": [
      "Mario Vargas Llosa, who has died at the age of 89 in his native Peru, was a towering figure in Latin American literature and culture who rarely shied away from controversy.",
      "With more than 50 works to his name, many of which have been widely translated, Vargas Llosa won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2010 when judges dubbed him a \"divinely gifted story-teller\". His depictions of authoritarianism, violence and machismo, using rich language and imagery, made him a star of the Latin American Boom literary movement that shone a global spotlight on the continent.",
      "At first sympathetic to left-wing ideas, he grew disillusioned with Latin America's revolutionary causes, eventually running unsuccessfully for the Peruvian presidency with a centre-right party in 1990.",
      "Vargas Llosa was born in 1936 to a middle-class family in Arequipa in southern Peru. After his parents separated while he was an infant, he moved to Cochabamba in Bolivia with his great-grandparents. He returned to Peru aged 10 and six years later he wrote his first play, The Escape of the Inca. He graduated from Lima University, studied in Spain and later moved to Paris.",
      "His first novel, The Time of the Hero, was an indictment of corruption and abuse at a Peruvian military school. Written at a time when the country's military wielded significant political and social power, it was published in 1962.",
      "Its forceful, menacing imagery was condemned by several Peruvian generals. One accused Vargas Llosa of having a \"degenerate mind\".",
      "It was based on the writer's own time as a teenager at the Leoncio Prado Military Academy, which he described in 1990 as \"an extremely traumatic experience\". His two years there made him see his country \"as a violent society, filled with bitterness, made up of social, cultural, and racial factions in complete opposition\". The school itself burnt 1,000 copies of the novel on its grounds, Vargas Llosa claimed.",
      "His experimental second novel The Green House (1966) was set in the Peruvian desert and jungle, and described an alliance of pimps, missionaries and soldiers based around a brothel.",
      "The two novels helped found the Latin American Boom literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The Boom was characterised by experimental and explicitly political works that reflected a continent in turmoil.",
      "Its leading authors, who included Vargas Llosa's Colombian friend and sometime rival Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez - who pioneered the kaleidoscopic magical realism style of writing - became household names and their works were read around the world.",
      "Famously the two authors did not speak to each other for decades after Vargas Llosa punched Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in the face in a Mexican cinema in 1976. Reports of why Vargas Llosa punched his Colombian friend differ.",
      "Friends of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez said the dispute had revolved around Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's friendship with Vargas Llosa's then-wife, Patricia, but Vargas Llosa told students at a Madrid university in 2017 that it had been down to their opposing views on Cuba and its communist leader, Fidel Castro.",
      "They reconciled in 2007 and three years later, in 2010, Vargas Llosa was awarded the Nobel Prize - the first South American writer to be chosen for the literature prize since Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez took the honour in 1982.",
      "Much of Vargas Llosa's work is inseparable from the instability and violence in parts of Latin America in the second half of the 20th Century as the region experienced waves of revolutions and military rule.",
      "His novel Conversations in the Cathedral (1969) was celebrated for exposing how the Peruvian dictatorship of 1948-56 under Manuel Odr\u00eda controlled and eventually ruined the lives of ordinary people.",
      "Like many intellectuals, Vargas Llosa supported Fidel Castro but became disillusioned with the communist leader following the \"Padilla Affair\" when poet Heberto Padilla was imprisoned for criticising the Cuban government in 1971.",
      "In 1983 Vargas Llosa was appointed president of a commission investigating the gruesome killing in a village in the Peruvian Andes of eight journalists, which became known as the Uchuraccay massacre.",
      "Peruvian officials maintained that the journalists had been killed by indigenous villagers who had mistaken the journalists for members of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group.",
      "The commission's report backed the official line, leading to fierce criticism of Vargas Llosa by those who believed that the gruesome nature of the crime and the horrific mutilations inflicted on the body were the hallmark of an infamous anti-terrorist police rather than signs of \"indigenous violence\".",
      "Moving further right on the political spectrum, in 1990 Vargas Llosa ran for the Peruvian presidency with the centre-right Frente Democr\u00e1tico coalition on a neo-liberal platform. He lost to Alberto Fujimori, who went on to govern Peru for the following 10 years.",
      "Despite the criticism levelled against him over the investigation into the Uchuraccay massacre, Vargas Llosa continued to expose state terror and abuse of power through literature.",
      "His novel The Feast of the Goat, published in 2000, focused on dictator Rafael Trujillo, who ruled the Dominican Republic for 31 years until his assassination in 1961. The novel won praise from the Nobel Prize Committee for its attention to \"structures of power\" and \"images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat\".",
      "Other works were adapted for the big screen. His book Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, based on his first marriage, was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow.",
      "His later work covered figures as diverse as Irish nationalist Roger Casement (The Dream of the Celt, 2012).",
      "He spent the latter years of his life in Peru as well as Madrid.",
      "The author appeared in the pages of Spanish gossip magazine Hola after he left his wife of 50 years in 2015 to be with Spanish-Filipino socialite Isabel Preysler, the mother of popular Latin singer Enrique Iglesias.",
      "He also continued to attract criticism for controversial remarks.",
      "In 2019 he was condemned for blaming the rise in killings of journalists in Mexico - more than 100 in the past decade - on the expansion of press freedom \"which allows journalists to say things that were not permitted previously\". While he also said that \"narcotics trafficking plays an absolutely central part in all of this\", some commentators felt that he failed to express sympathy with the victims and their families.",
      "And in 2018 he caused a stir when, in a column for Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, he called feminism \"the most determined enemy of literature, trying to decontaminate it from machismo, multiple prejudices and immoralities\".",
      "He died in Lima on 13 April surrounded by his family and \"at peace\", his son \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa announced.",
      "With his death, the last of the Latin American Boom's great stars has gone."

    "story": [
      "US TV institution Saturday Night Live has entertained viewers and created comedy stars for 50 years. Can a British version reach the same heights?",
      "For five decades, the phrase \"Live from New York, it's Saturday night!\" has boldly opened episodes of Saturday Night Live, with its tried and tested mix of topical sketch comedy, celebrity cameos and big-name musical guests.",
      "Now, the stateside staple is to come live from London after Sky announced that a \"star-studded\" UK spin-off, fronted by British comedic talent, will launch next year.",
      "Overseen by the US original show's creator Lorne Michaels, now 80, the broadcaster is promising the same \"live, fast-paced style\" as its American cousin.",
      "Comedy heritage",
      "Since being launched by Michaels in 1975, SNL has been a livewire springboard for comedic talents like Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell and Mike Myers.",
      "Famed for its ever-revolving cast, Joe Piscopo of the 1980s cohort summed it up in a documentary marking the show's 50th anniversary: \"They took sketch comedy to a whole other level,\" he said. \"Comedy slowly became rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "The unpredictable live premise, combined with its longevity, has helped maintain its status. No other show has been nominated for (331) or won (90) more Emmy Awards.",
      "\"I don't think you can underestimate that heritage when accounting for its current success,\" says the Guardian's TV and comedy writer Rachel Aroesti. \"Which is something the UK version obviously won't be able to emulate.\"",
      "The heritage is one reason why the show still attracts major young stars like Timothee Chalamet, who grew up watching it even as linear TV audiences have dropped sharply in the streaming age.",
      "\"In the US, the guests' involvement is often newsworthy in itself - they also know their presence will generate a lot of publicity, so it's a win-win situation,\" Aroesti adds.",
      "\"I would be surprised if the UK version is able to attract the same calibre of guest.\"",
      "'Courageous' move",
      "The Atlantic writer Helen Lewis says the general industry reaction has been that commissioning a UK version is a \"courageous\" move - wishing the team luck with the \"difficult proposition\".",
      "There are some notable differences between the two transatlantic TV industries.",
      "The US SNL budget will be far bigger than UK TV norm, paying for a large cast and a team of writers working to the wire to keep jokes current.",
      "\"In the American version, it's a very expensive format, having a writers' room and keeping a cast of actors on retainer, essentially, the whole time. That's really expensive,\" Lewis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.",
      "The US comedy culture is also different, Lewis believes.",
      "\"The humour can sometimes be much more slapsticky. Quite a lot of the time, Americans struggle with British humour because they think we're extremely mean.\"",
      "Comedy writer Jack Bernhardt agrees that there are different comedic traditions. UK sketch groups often form through friendships and showcase their talent at the Edinburgh Fringe, whereas many US comedians train at improv and sketch clubs, specifically honing their skills for shows like SNL.",
      "Bernhardt says these differences \"can't necessarily be fixed by commissioning the UK version of SNL - it's an entire comedy culture that would need to shift\".",
      "\"That's not to say one can't do the other,\" he adds. \"Just that this version of a sketch show isn't necessarily playing to the unique strengths of the UK comedy scene. And that's even before we get into the difficulties of doing a live show.\"",
      "Given these challenges, importing a legacy brand name like SNL may seem a gamble, especially at a time when the UK TV industry is faltering.",
      "However, the US show's fortunes have held relatively firm this decade, even if ratings are well below the pre-streaming era.",
      "Vulture found that SNL averages 8.4 million weekly viewers, outperforming all other late-night shows combined. It's also US network TV's top entertainment series among adults aged 18 to 49.",
      "\"You rarely hear anyone asking whether SNL will 'survive', only how once Michaels moves on,\" wrote reporter Josef Adalian. \"Linear TV may be fighting for its life, yet SNL seems safe.\"",
      "Crucially, the sketch format lends itself perfectly to social media age, being easily digestible on digital platforms. According to the Economist, online SNL clips are averaging about 216 million views per episode on TikTok, X and YouTube. Sure, these viewers are not watching live, but the content undoubtedly lives.",
      "Previous attempts to translate US late-night shows to the UK have often struggled.",
      "However, in the 1980s, Saturday Live - later renamed Friday Night Live - ran for four seasons and helped the careers of Ben Elton, Harry Enfield, Stephen Fry and Rik Mayall, while Channel 4's The 11 O'Clock Show gave breaks to Ricky Gervais and Sacha Baron Cohen.",
      "British comedy producer Jimmy Mulville, whose company Hat Trick Productions has made shows including Have I Got News For You and Whose Line is it Anyway?, says the opportunity to develop new talent will be one of the key draws for Sky, despite the risks.",
      "\"If Sky get this right, they'll create new stars, and from that they can spin-off other shows with those performers,\" he explains. \"These shows can be fantastic, they can go on for years, and they can show off new talent all the time.\"",
      "He says the producers will need to assemble the right team of writers and performers.",
      "\"If it's well-produced, I've no reason to see why it shouldn't be successful,\" says Mulville, who co-hosts Insiders: The TV Podcast.",
      "He recently took the BBC's long-running topical panel show Have I Got News For You to the US, where it has been commissioned for a second season by CNN. One US talent agent warned that the show was \"too British\" to work across the pond, he recalls.",
      "\"I said, 'Yes it is, but I'm going to get it written by Americans and performed by Americans for Americans'.\"",
      "The reverse will be true for SNL. \"In the UK, you're going to have it written by British writers with British performers for a British audience. So it's not an American show any more.\"",
      "Indeed, being \"live from London\" won't be enough on its own to succeed, and SNL UK will need to feel like a truly British comedy creation and not just a reheated imitation of an American hit.",

    "story": [
      "A new Universal theme park near Bedford - the first in Europe - was announced to much fanfare earlier this week.",
      "Set to open in 2031, construction is to begin at the 476-acre (1.9-sq-km) site, where attractions are likely to feature James Bond, Paddington and The Lord of the Rings.",
      "But from deciding how many loops to include on a coaster, to making sure even the trees blend in seamlessly with an area's design, building a dream world is a painstaking task.",
      "To find out what planning lies behind the thrills, and what sort of things we could expect when the new Universal park finally arrives, BBC News spoke to some rollercoaster experts.",
      "Building an iconic rollercoaster",
      "Of course, any good theme park needs some good rides - but maybe it's an understatement to say that's a tall order.",
      "While \"at least two or three iconic rides\" are needed, these need not necessarily be the fastest, tallest or most innovative to stand out, explains Andy Sinclair-Harris, creative director at Katapult, which has designed attractions for the likes of Legoland and Alton Towers.",
      "\"What is more important is the depth of storytelling,\" he says, so that you're fully immersed in the experience of the ride.",
      "A good example, says Robbie Jones, insights director at Katapult, is a Harry-Potter-themed rollercoaster called Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, located at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal's Orlando resort. Riders sit in replicas of Hagrid's motorbike and zoom through recreations of settings from the popular film series.",
      "\"There's nothing particularly brand new or absolutely amazing about that ride, other than it tells a story amazingly well,\" he adds.",
      "How Universal Studios almost came to Essex",
      "Bond and Paddington could star at Universal park",
      "If the rumours that there's going to be a Back to the Future ride at Universal's UK venture are true, those behind it will be ensuring that the DeLorean time machine is included, he says.",
      "During the brainstorming stage of building a resort, rides are often \"developed as storytelling tools\" in a \"specific genre or world\", says Joseph Bright, CEO at Scruffy Dog, which provides creative project management for theme parks.",
      "While an iconic ride might help to \"anchor\" a zone of a park, \"it's never developed in isolation\" - rather \"cohesion is critical [and] every element... must serve the wider guest story\".",
      "Dennis Speigel, founder of International Theme Park Services, says meticulous planning goes into the most immersive rides.",
      "He adds that the size of a rollercoaster is partly dictated by the number of guests its designers hope to get on board - \"between 1,500 and 2,000 an hour\" at popular parks.",
      "Usually, that means a coaster that is over 3,000ft (914m) long, with the first dip \"somewhere in the 150ft (45m) range\".",
      "Mr Speigel says that while an upcoming coaster at Six Flags Qiddiya in Saudi Arabia is set to break records when it sends riders speeding at over 150mph (240 km/h) around the tracks, most coasters today reach between 70-90mph (110-145 km/h) on their first drop.",
      "Once the larger rides are planned out, theme park designers then consider what he describes as \"flat rides\", which cater to less thrill-seeking crowds.",
      "\"Those are your smaller rides that take people around and around, like a merry-go-round or a monster,\" he says. \"[They're] rides that can often be bought off the shelf from a manufacturer.\"",
      "Your route to the ride is key",
      "When you step foot in a theme park, you're probably thinking about the rides you'll be going on - but you might think less about how you get there.",
      "During the design phase, you have to let your imagination run wild, says Mr Sinclair-Harris. \"Budget is a thing, but when you have those first initial discussions, you shouldn't be tempered by anything,\" he says.",
      "The \"story\" of your park is crucial, he adds. \"It's knowing the story, the characters and being true to that world.\"",
      "Discussions about potential ride dimensions and manufacturers soon follow, as well as a masterplan, which configures how attractions, pathways and amenities all fit into the space. It often determines how long people will end up queuing for.",
      "An artist's conception of the Universal UK park depicts a huge lake in middle of what appears to be different themed areas. Far from just looking pretty, it can allow crowds to fan out to multiple rides without congestion forming around one.",
      "Alton Towers has a lake too. Theme park vlogger and fanatic Charlotte Branford - known as Diary of a RollerCoaster Girl - believes it means other visitors often choose to go left around it (to the Wicker Man ride), or right around it (towards the Smiler). She heads to the back of the park to try to avoid the crowds.",
      "At the back of parks designed in this way you'll often find a show with set times \"to try and stop people running around to the back of the park to get to some big attraction\", says Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club, who has been involved in rollercoaster designs.",
      "\"Without realising it, they're trying to make you do roughly what they want you to do when you're in the park.\"",
      "Another tried and tested layout is the \"hub and spoke\" often seen at Disneyland resorts, says Mr Sinclair-Harris.",
      "\"In a sense you've got that central gathering point... like the castle in the Magic Kingdom... with different lands like spokes on a wheel, radiating out.\"",
      "Universal's new Epic Universe theme park in Orlando will follow a version of this - allowing you to venture into different lands through portals.",
      "The finer details",
      "So the stories behind the rollercoasters are intertwined with the story of the theme park layout itself.",
      "Then come the finishing touches - to maintain your sense of being in a futuristic or fantasy world while you're there.",
      "Trees, artificial rock or even other buildings are often used to obscure unsightly but necessary objects, Mr Sinclair-Harris says. \"If you're in an amazing world with castles and dragons, seeing a telephone pole removes you from that story\".",
      "Even the audio playing out, scent of a park and queue lines are considered because they \"play a role in that illusion,\" says Mr Bright.",
      "As Mr Garvanovic puts it, \"there's tons of subtle stuff going on in the background\" in a well thought-out theme park.",
      "The sign of success, perhaps, is when you barely even notice it.",

      "As main character Brennan hunts down a man known only as Monroe, viewers become aware of a painful secret he's been hiding and the struggles he is facing to find justice in a hearing-centred world.",
      "The Guardian called the performances in the show \"outstanding\" and the switch between signed and spoken language \"utterly seamless\", while the Independent says Reunion is \"in many ways, a groundbreaking show\".",
      "Ultimately, Mager says he wanted to touch on issues unique to the deaf community in the programme, as well as providing opportunities for deaf creatives.",
      "'Unfortunately, that's still the reality'",
      "Mager says communication is a central theme of Reunion and the drama shows how each character struggles with it.",
      "One key example is a scene where Brennan's daughter Carly has to pass on painful information to her mother and father that would usually be relayed by professionals, due to a lack of interpreters.",
      "\"Unfortunately, that's still the reality today,\" Mager says, explaining his wife recently experienced this, having to interpret for her mother at a hospital appointment, because an interpreter had not been booked.",
      "Mager says this shows how deaf people often have to rely on someone else voicing them in order to be understood.",
      "\"That can be hard for a deaf person to relinquish that control over what they're saying to someone else,\" he says.",
      "Another thing Mager wanted to draw attention to was literacy rates in deaf children.",
      "A key plot point in Reunion is that Brennan is unable to read or write in English which, coupled with the prison's failure to book interpreters, means he misses important letters from his daughter and does not have his case details fully explained.",
      "\"Deaf children often lag behind their hearing counterparts in education, particularly [in] reading and writing,\" Mager says.",
      "The writer adds that, in his opinion, this is partly due to language deprivation, resulting from deaf children not being given access to the language they're most comfortable with from a young age.",

    "story": [
      "The young cast of Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza\u2019s film Warfare had to bond pretty quickly, to play a US military unit whose lives depended on each other, during the Iraq war in 2006.",
      "Familiarity was crucial, so before filming began, the cast were sent on a three-week military bootcamp.",
      "They lived together, learning military jargon and gun safety and were pushed beyond their limits - all of which brought them closer together.",
      "First off though, they agreed to shave each other's heads to look the part, boosting trust and familiarity.",
      "\"We shaved our heads on day one, and got tattoos at the end of the process, so it bookended the experience,\" Poulter tells the BBC.",
      "The actor, who recently appeared in The Bear and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, plays Captain Eric, who was part of a group of US soldiers and Iraqi scouts on a surveillance mission.",
      "We see how it goes wrong, with devastating consequences.",
      "Heartstopper star Connor plays newcomer Tommy, hitting home how young the soldiers were - he's just turned 21, the same age Tommy was at the time.",
      "The actor says the decision to get a shared tattoo with his castmates after filming wrapped was a \"no-brainer\". The casts of The Avengers and The Lord of the Rings did the same thing after their final films.",
      "Warfare's actors decided their tattoo would say \"Call On Me\", to reflect their brotherhood, while referencing Erik Prydz's 2004 dance hit, which kicks the film off.",
      "The cast features some other big names, including Reservation Dogs' D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Sh\u014dgun's Cosmo Jarvis, Stranger Things and the forthcoming Beatles biopic's Joseph Quinn, and Riverdale's Charles Melton.",
      "\"It was really formative for me,\" Connor says about his time  on the film. \"I've made friends I really do believe I will know for a long time.",
      "\"We all wanted to commemorate it - we are so proud of the work we've done together.\"",
      "The movie is based entirely on a real-life mission that took place during the Iraq war, and is built on the memories of the US soldiers who were there.",
      "The group was embedded in the home of an ordinary Iraqi family, who we briefly see in the film, in Ramadi - an area controlled by Al-Qaeda forces.",
      "The military's goal had been to slip into and observe the area under the cover of darkness, to ensure the safe passage of ground forces there the next day.",
      "What they didn't know what that they were next door to an insurgent house, making them the target of an attack.",
      "Shot in real-time, Warfare has no music or flashbacks, so there's no let-up for the audience. You're dropped into the thick of the action for the whole film.",
      "The soldiers in command have to make split-second decisions amid the pain and chaos, with the Iraqi family caught in the crossfire.",
      "Oscar nominee Garland, whose back catalogue includes the 28 Days film franchise and Ex Machina, got the idea for Warfare when he was making last year's film Civil War.",
      "He was working on the battle scenes with Hollywood stunt man and gunfight co-ordinator Ray Mendoza.",
      "\"During the edit process of Civil War, I was able to really focus on some of the work Ray had done, and how sophisticated and how nuanced it was,\" Garland recalls.",
      "They got chatting about Mendoza's previous life as a US Navy Seal, and about the Ramadi operation, where he was its communications officer.",
      "Mendoza said he'd always wanted to make a film about that mission.",
      "The veteran had a very big reason for wanting to recreate what happened that day - to help replace the lost memories of his colleague Elliott Miller.",
      "Miller, a former Navy Seal, was so badly injured in Ramadi that he suffered traumatic brain injury and memory loss, and had to have a leg amputated.",
      "During the mission, Mendoza carried the unconscious soldier to the rescue tank that ultimately saved his life.",
      "\"Elliott doesn't remember it, and when he woke up, he had a lot of questions,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"No matter how many maps we drew, or how many times we wrote it out - without that core memory, I think he's had a hard time.",
      "\"It just raised more questions than answers. So I wanted to recreate this one.\"",
      "So Garland and Mendoza decided to make Warfare together, sharing writing and directing credits, and dedicating the film to Miller.",
      "The crucial question is whether seeing the film helped Miller piece things together.",
      "\"It did, yeah - he was a sponge,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"We walked him through it - he had a lot of questions, he's got kids that have questions.",
      "\"It's now a film memory, but it's as close as he's gonna have \u2013 he's super grateful.\"",
      "Miller was played by Jarvis, who calls him \"a funny guy... he's great - a living embodiment of perseverance\".",
      "It was a \"unique situation to be in when you're entrusted with portraying somebody that's sitting right across from you\", Jarvis said, about having the person he was playing actually on set.",
      "\"But because he didn't remember [what happened], a lot of my references had to come from his colleagues.\"",
      "The soldiers' casting has caused some excitement online, with some publications breathily calling the actors \"all of the internet's boyfriends\" and \"red hot rising stars\".",
      "Garland arches an eyebrow at this, and Mendoza jumps in to talk about why those actors were chosen.",
      "\"I've said this to them, so I'm not trying to offend them, but we weren't looking for the best actors. They're all great actors. We were looking for the right actors,\" he says.",
      "\"So what that means is their willingness to push their bodies past a comfort level that they're maybe not used to. 'You're gonna be exhausted. You're gonna be required to rely on other people. It's not about you, it's about the team'.",
      "\"And the ones that jump at that opportunity, you're like, 'Yep, that's the attitude that we need'.\"",
      "Collating and cross-checking the soldiers' memories was a big job, largely undertaken by Garland.",
      "\"I think there's an inherent value in attempting to be honest and truthful about something as serious and significant as war,\" he says.",
      "He shot the film in a studio in a suburb north of London, on a former World War Two airfield, making it in real-time to recreate \"a real incident of combat... as honestly, forensically and accurately as possible\".",
      "Not surprisingly, while sharing credits with Garland, former US Navy Seal Mendoza ran the actors' bootcamp.",
      "He was played by Woon-A-Tai, who calls him \"a brilliant instructor who instilled a lot of confidence in us\", while also making gun safety a top priority.",
      "The actor was also fascinated by the narrative not being \"dramatised or Hollywoodised\".",
      "\"To see these guys not obey orders - and do what they needed to save their platoon was interesting to me,\" he says, talking about the soldiers' evacuation process.",
      "Mendoza thinks the film may also help veterans who are struggling to express what warfare can be like.",
      "\"Some of these things are harder to explain in words,\" he says. \"So art imagery is how I'm able to communicate that.\"",
      "Connor echoes this, saying: \"A lot of these men are very much less inclined to talk about themselves in these situations, whether it be to be due to humility, or a difficulty in really articulating it.",
      "\"A lot of them just don't really enjoy talking about their involvement.\"",
      "The film has been called \"the most harrowing \u2013 and honest \u2013 depiction of modern combat ever made\" by the Telegraph, while the New Yorker said it offers a \"hyperrealist rebuke of the American war movie\".",
      "The Guardian said the \"film-makers' message gets lost in the deafening blizzard of battle\", while Empire added: \"It may well be cinema's most effective, purest anti-war film: there is no sentimentality, no hand-wringing, but most significantly not a second of it makes war look cool, or attractive.\"",
      "Poulter says he admires the film-makers' determination to make Warfare purely factual.",
      "\"Hopefully this film contributes to a better understanding of just how negative, and how the consequences of war are characterised by a lot of loss...",
      "\"I think this is as much an anti-war film as you can possibly hope to see.\"",

    "story": [
      "While on holiday in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) last week, there was only one mission on my mind - getting my hands on the viral \"Dubai chocolate\" bar.",
      "If you're on TikTok, you will have seen the bar, which combines the flavours of chocolate, pistachio and tahini with filo pastry, and is inspired by the Arab dessert Knafeh.",
      "The original, called Can't Get Knafeh of It, by FIX Chocolatier, has been sold exclusively in the UAE since 2022. It become so popular on social media that it's only on sale for two hours a day and often sells out within minutes.",
      "But now imitations, known by the nickname \"Dubai chocolate\", have hit UK supermarkets including Waitrose, Lidl and Morrisons, with some supermarkets limiting the number of bars customers are allowed to buy.",
      "Yezen Alani, who co-owns FIX with his wife Sarah Hamouda, told the BBC the global attention Dubai chocolate was getting was \"flattering and humbling\".",
      "The FIX chocolate bar was first imagined by Hamouda in 2021, who craved the flavours while she was pregnant.",
      "Alani and Hamouda started developing the bar a year later, running the business alongside their corporate jobs.",
      "\"Sarah and I were brought up in the UK and we moved to Dubai 10 years ago, so we've got Western and Arab roots.",
      "\"We wanted to create flavours that were inspired by that,\" Alani says.",
      "Part of the appeal of the chocolate is its exclusivity - you can only order it using a food delivery app, rather than walking into a shop or grabbing it at the supermarket.",
      "It costs around \u00a315 per bar and can only be bought during specific hours of the day to ensure the company can fulfil all their orders.",
      "I also saw similar bars sold in many shops in the region, dubbed \"Dubai chocolate\" and adorned with pictures of pistachios and filo pastry.",
      "Alani says the \"copycat\" bars are \"very frustrating because people are trying knockoffs, which damages our brand\".",
      "One of the reasons for the bar's surge in popularity has been social media - with a viral video by TikTok user Maria Vehera  from 2023 being cited as one of the main reasons for its rise to prominence.",
      "It shows Vehera trying the Knafeh bar for the first time - along with several others made by the same chocolatier - and has been liked nearly seven million times.",
      "The way the bar looks is made for social media -  from the attractive orange and green spots on top of the smooth milk chocolate to the crunch sound it makes when you break off a piece.",
      "Chocolate combined with pistachio isn't new but the real standout element is the crunchy nature of the filling, with the filo pastry adding a texture and thickness to the bar.",
      "Since the Can't Get Knafeh of It bar is only available in one country, other brands have started to sell their versions in the UK, including Swiss chocolate manufacturer Lindt whose Dubai chocolate is being sold for \u00a310 in supermarkets.",
      "Since stocking the bar, Waitrose says they've had to introduce a two-bar limit for customers in order to regulate stock levels.",
      "Another version has also been sold by Home Bargains, while supermarket Lidl has its own version for \u00a34.99 and is also limiting purchase numbers.",
      "One influencer documented how the has bar been kept behind tills for this reason.",
      "Having tried the Lindt bar and a couple of other versions being sold in corner shops, there is quite a contrast.",
      "The FIX chocolate is billed as a \"dessert bar\" and needs to be kept in the fridge, with a short expiry date like many dairy items.",
      "This isn't the case for the others, which have been designed to have a longer shelf life.",
      "You can also see the difference in taste and texture - the original bar is almost double the width of the Lindt bar, which is more aligned to the size and shape of a standard chocolate bar.",
      "When Alani and Hamouda first started out, they employed one person to fulfil around six to seven orders a day.",
      "But since growing in popularity, primarily thanks to TikTok, their business now employs 50 people, who fulfil 500 orders a day.",
      "One big talking point has been the price of the product, which is \u00a315 per bar.",
      "\"It's all handmade, every single design is done by hand,\" Alani says.",
      "\"We use premium ingredients and the process is not like making other bars - you've got the baking, moulding the chocolate to the design and with the filling itself, even the pistachios are hand-picked and processed\".",
      "Speaking to Arabian Business last year, Hamouda said: \"My mother used to make Knafeh, and that's something I wanted to capture my own way.",
      "\"Knafeh was the first flavour we perfected. The crunch, the pistachio, it had to be just right,\" she added.",
      "Despite the product's success, Alani says \"it's been a tough journey\" as the pair have been working together full time while also raising their two children.",
      "\"There's been times where we've wanted to give up, but we said to ourselves 'we'll keep going as long as we can pay the rent' and now we have no regrets as its worked out\"."

      "Music fans wondering what Pulp would do for an encore have finally got their answer as the Britpop legends announced they would be releasing their first new album for almost a quarter of century in June.",
      "The first single from the upcoming More takes a familiar path to their much-loved previous songs, with singer Jarvis Cocker drawing on his own experiences and interactions for its lyrics.",
      "Its main inspiration though is not the band's native Sheffield or Cocker's meandering life through London, Paris or the Peak District, but a gig that has a special place in music history - The Stone Roses' almost legendary show at Spike Island.",
      "Held on the banks of the Mersey in Widnes, Cheshire, at the height of the Madchester pioneers' fame in 1990, it has become one of rock music's most mythologised gigs.",
      "Who were The Stone Roses?",
      "Formed in Manchester in 1985, The Stone Roses originally featured singer Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bass player Gary 'Mani' Mounfield and drummer Alan 'Reni' Wren.",
      "With singles such as This Is the One, I Am the Resurrection and Fools Gold, they provided some of the biggest soundtracks of the Madchester music scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s.",
      "The movement saw an explosion of a musical and cultural scene in their home city, where a blend of indie rock, acid house, psychedelia and 1960s pop rose in popularity.",
      "Matt Mead, who has published a book about the band, said they were \"the biggest band at that time\".",
      "\"They were as big, if not bigger, than U2, who were massive,\" he said.",
      "\"Their musicianship was second to none.",
      "\"You just had four members, but there was some sort of magic that happened when they were on stage.\"",
      "Along with the music, the band also had a distinctive style, leading fans to adopt baggy clothing, mop haircuts and bucket hats.",
      "Their beloved Manchester United even launched a kit collection in 2024 inspired by the band.",
      "Why did they play Spike Island?",
      "As part of their series of gigs, The Stone Roses held a concert at Spike Island on a sunny day on 27 May 1990.",
      "It seemed like the ideal spot, almost equidistant from the huge musical hubs of Manchester and Liverpool and the band's legions of North-West fans.",
      "Created after the 1833 extension of the Sankey Canal in Widnes, Cheshire, the island was the centre of Britain's chemical industry during the Industrial Revolution.",
      "Factories and railways dominated the area until the industry went into decline in the 20th Century.",
      "The area has now become a haven for wildlife with paths for walkers and cyclists.",
      "What happened at the concert?",
      "Official figures suggest about 28,000 people attended the concert on 27 May 1990 but Mead reckons that goes up to about 30,000 if gatecrashers were included.",
      "Dave Haslam performed a DJ set before The Stone Roses' performance.",
      "He said there was an element of chaos from the start as the band's management booked the wrong DJ acts, getting rave favourite Frankie Bones instead of house legend Frankie Knuckles.",
      "He said that sort of misstep was \"evidence of the endearing amateurism around the gig\".",
      "\"My generation were not really into open air festivals,\" he said.",
      "\"Glastonbury wasn't anywhere like it is as big now.",
      "\"We liked rave venues or basement live music.",
      "\"We liked sweaty little venues clubs in the middle of town.\"",
      "There have been mixed reviews of the concert with Pulp guitarist Mark Webber telling BBC 6 Music describing the show as \"a slight anticlimax\".",
      "\"There was a lot of anticipation but it didn't sound very good,\" he said.",
      "\"It was very windy and the vibe wasn't there.\"",
      "Haslam said that was another example of the lack of experience of putting on such big shows.",
      "\"I don't think anyone appreciated that you need to a lot of amplification to reach the back of the crowd, because all the sound just gets lost in the atmosphere,\" he said.",
      "Mead, who is helping on a documentary project about the concert, said recently-found footage revealed \"key moments\".",
      "\"When the band play I Wanna Be Adored and you see the crowd, it's electric,\" he said.",
      "\"It's like nothing else \u2013 wall-to-wall bouncing from the front to the back.\"",
      "He said there was also \"blissed-out dancing\" during Fools Gold and \"everyone's arms in the air\" for I Am the Resurrection.",
      "Haslam also remembers fans filing out of the gig in \"very, very high spirits\".",
      "\"Whatever the problems with the sound and waiting around and all of that, I think for those young people, they knew they'd had a day out to remember,\" he added.",
      "Why has it become the stuff of legend?",
      "Until a full recording came to light in 2024, it was thought the concert had not been captured on film, making it the subject of much mystique for those who weren't there.",
      "But even with the new find, Haslam believes the gig was significant because The Stone Roses \"didn't play that often\" and it felt like \"a life-changing moment\".",
      "\"It was an opportunity to see this band that had somehow seemed to be the most significant band of the era.",
      "\"It was the culmination of two or three years when a certain look and a sound that was a kind of cross between funky indie and rave really animated a new generation.\"",
      "He said the Spike Island show was part of a series of gigs that \"took The Stone Roses from being a big local band and a kind of Manchester secret to being internationally renowned\".",
      "Crews travelled from France and Germany for the event while fans came from across the country.",
      "Haslam said there \"wasn't really anything similar afterwards\" for the band due to the time it took the band to release a second album.",
      "\"That took far too long - four or five years - so a lot of the momentum went out of the Roses at that point and by the time they came back, that part of the world had all moved on to Oasis\".",
      "He said Spike Island \"was the only moment where you had The Stone Roses absolutely at their peak, playing music that had been quite underground but had been becoming accepted by the mainstream - that mix of euphoric rave vibe with rock music\".",
      "What happened to The Stone Roses?",
      "After the Spike Island show, The Stone Roses became embroiled in a long legal battle with their record label and did not release a follow-up album, The Second Coming, until 1994.",
      "Three months after its release, Reni left the band and was followed a year later by Squire.",
      "Brown and Mani tried to carry on with guitarist Aziz Ibrahim and drummer Robbie Maddix joining the band, but within a few months, they dissolved the band.",
      "Squire, Brown and Mani went on to have post-Roses success, while Reni left music altogether.",
      "After years of rumours, the original line-up finally reformed in 2011, going on to play huge gigs across the globe before Squire confirmed in 2019 that they had split once more.",
      "How did the gig come to inspire Pulp?",
      "Though Pulp had been a working band for over a decade when Spike Island happened, they did not break into the mainstream until the release of their His 'n' Hers album in 1994, before becoming huge stars with the release of their landmark single Common People a year later.",
      "That song was taken from their most successful album, Different Class, which also spawned the hit, Sorted for E's and Wizz, which Cocker has now revealed was a sister song to the new single and was also based on a fan's experience of the Stone Roses' gig.",
      "The inspiration for that track was \"a girl that I was speaking to at The Leadmill (nightclub) in Sheffield one night,\" he said.",
      "\"She said all that she could remember were people going round saying, 'Is everyone sorted for E's and wizz?'.",
      "\"So that phrase stuck in my mind.\"",
      "He said he did not go to Spike Island, but had written the new song's lyrics after speaking to various attendees, including musician Jason Buckle, from the band All Seeing I, who co-wrote the single.",

      "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.",
      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",
      "\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"",

      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",

    "story": [
      "Downing Street has said it is \"confident\" the raw materials needed to keep the furnaces at British Steel's Scunthorpe site switched on will reach it in time.",
      "The government has been attempting to source the material needed to fuel the plant's central blast furnaces since taking control of it on Saturday, and has confirmed a shipment will arrive \"in the coming days\".",
      "Ministers seized control of operations after talks with British Steel's Chinese owner Jingye broke down, and the government accused the firm of planning to switch the furnaces off.",
      "Beijing has accused the British government of \"politicising trade cooperation\" and said the move raised doubts about investment in the UK.",
      "Officials had been attempting to obtain the coking coal and iron ore needed to power the steel-producing furnaces - materials which ministers have accused Jingye of selling off.",
      "Speaking during a visit to the site on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said \"everything is in place\" for the furnaces to continue to fire after the fuel materials were secured.",
      "Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's official spokesman confirmed efforts to ensure a \"steady supply\" had progressed.",
      "Two shipments of both materials are being held at Immingham docks, 30 miles east of Scunthorpe, and will reach the steelworks first, he said - while a third shipment of raw materials is onboard a vessel off the coast of Africa and making its way to the UK.",
      "The spokesman also suggested the order of supplies had begun prior to the government taking control of the site, but that \"there were contractual issues that have now been sorted\".",
      "Sourcing and transporting the raw materials to the Scunthorpe plant quickly is critical because blast furnaces can sustain permanent damage if their temperature drops too low, while restarting a furnace is also costly and complex.",
      "An emergency law was rushed through Parliament on Saturday which gave the government control of the Lincolnshire site to prevent Jingye from closing the furnaces against ministers' wishes.",
      "On Monday, the government appointed two long-standing British Steel employees to run the plant on an interim basis.",

      "He also said there needed to be a \"high level of scrutiny\" for any foreign investment in critical infrastructure.",
      "The UK government has so far stopped short of taking British Steel back into full public ownership but has not ruled out nationalisation, while also looking for potential private investors to fund operations at Scunthorpe.",

      "China's embassy in the UK has urged ministers to negotiate with Jingye to \"find a solution acceptable to all parties\", while its foreign ministry urged the UK government to hold further talks with Jingye.",
      "According to AFP news agency, spokesman Lin Jian said: \"It is hoped that the British government will... avoid politicising trade cooperation or linking it to security issues, so as not to impact the confidence of Chinese enterprises in going to the UK for normal investment.\"",
      "Hopes raised for site's future",
      "On Monday morning, Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community Union - which represents the majority of steelworkers - said the blast furnaces are \"in a far better position\" than before the government stepped in.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Rickhuss said he was certain the plant would remain running and that the furnaces were \"secure\".",
      "Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, from the GMB Union, told BBC Breakfast that she had spoken to British Steel on Sunday night and had been reassured the raw materials would be secured by the government.",
      "The Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people and is the last site in the UK that can produce virgin steel, a high-grade product which is needed for large construction projects.",
      "Without the plant, the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make virgin steel - which the government believes is a risk to the country's economic security.",
      "The site produces the majority of rail tracks used by Network Rail. The company said it does not expect \"any impact on the continued delivery of reliable rail services\" as it built up a stockpile of steel in anticipation of the plant's possible closure.",
      "The virgin steel made there is also critical for large-scale infrastructure developments, such as building nuclear power plants like the ongoing Hinkley Point C project in Somerset.",
      "However, in March, Jingye said the Scunthorpe site was losing \u00a3700,000 a day, which it said was \"no longer financially sustainable\", and the company began a consultation on job cuts.",
      "Talks with Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough. The government said the company had rejected an offer of \u00a3500m in public money to help keep the furnaces operating, and had demanded more than twice as much with few guarantees it would keep the plant open.",
      "On Sunday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it \"became clear\" to the government that Jingye was intent on closing down the blast furnaces no matter the financial support offered, prompting it to recall Parliament to pass the emergency law wresting control of the site from its owner.",
      "\"It might not be sabotage, it might be neglect,\" Reynolds said of the company's actions. On Monday, Rayner said there was \"no evidence\" of so-called sabotage.",
      "The Conservatives have criticised the government for not stepping in sooner to save the plant.",

      "The dispute centres around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles.",

      "The economy expanded by 0.5%, with the services sector having a strong month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.",
      "The better-than-expected figures come as the UK economy braces itself for the impact of tariffs imposed on goods imported to the US, with analysts warning that growth could prove short-lived.",
      "Tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on 12 March, while a 10% tariff on other goods came into effect this week.",
      "Goods exports from the UK to the US increased for the third consecutive month and are now at the highest level since November 2022, the ONS said.",
      "\"There are clear signs that UK firms increased goods exports to the US ahead of the introduction of tariffs,\" said William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).",

      "Economists had predicted UK growth of just 0.1% in February, but the ONS said several factors contributed to the surprise rise which was driven by a boost in manufacturing and production.",
      "The government has made growing the UK economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said February's surprise growth was due to computer programming, telecoms and car dealerships in the services sector all having \"strong months\".",
      "She added that manufacturing, electronics and pharmaceutical businesses performed well, and the car making industry also picked up after \"its recent poor performance\".",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the latest growth figures an \"encouraging sign\", but added the government was \"not complacent\".",
      "\"We must go further and faster to kickstart economic growth, provide security for working people and put more money in their pockets,\" she added.",

      "Monthly figures alone can be volatile so should be taken in context. The more stable three-month average to February shows growth is up 0.6%.",
      "This would have been considered normal growth a decade ago, but has been elusive in recent years.",
      "However, it suggests that recent talk of a recession has been way off the mark.",

      "On Saturday, the government is changing the law to answer that question.",
      "Unless something truly weird happens, Parliament will vote to give Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, the power to tell British Steel what to do \u2013 in practice, buying coal to keep the fires burning, to keep the once mighty steel industry alive.",

      "At one point in the talks, sources suggest they were asking for a billion-pound taxpayer bailout to keep the plant alive. But I'm told that price wouldn't have been accompanied by any guarantee that jobs would be saved, or the plant protected for good.",
      "Taking control on Saturday does not do that. The Chinese owners will remain the shareholders, for now. But Labour's decision literally and metaphorically keeps the flames alive \u2013 the government hopes. And it commits taxpayers to start coughing up to save the steel industry \u2013 for how long, is a more complicated question.",

      "Talking to interested parties on Friday night, that seemed vanishingly unlikely.",

Remember Jingye were the only bidder last time round \u2013 when a Conservative source says, \"there were no other bidders \u2013 the alternative was closure or nationalisation, and the Conservatives were never going to nationalise\". So will Labour?",

      "That's not just because ministers are loathe to see good jobs disappear. But because in government, the capacity to make steel is an important part of what the UK needs to be able to do. If the plant closes, the UK would become the only G7 country without primary steel making capability.",
      "That wasn't something the government was willing to tolerate. So if the private sector won't do it \u2013 enter the state. Although, it wouldn't be unfair to wonder why they have ended up making this decision at the last minute when the fuel for the furnaces is about to run out, given it was three weeks ago that the company sounded the alarm about possible closures.",
      "Second, that requirement to act has become politically attractive because it fits into Sir Keir Starmer's more and more familiar script, that the new world order has changed \u2013 governments need to be more active and agile in protecting their own interests.",
      "It follows, if, as Treasury Minister Darren Jones, told us last week, globalisation is over, then the UK has to be able to make the materials and products like steel that it really needs itself.",
      "One source remarks: \"Dragging the Tories to Parliament over the weekend to back the Labour government's plans to save British steel: I can finally see why people said government was worth it\".",
      "It is politics after all.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has blamed the government's \"incompetence\" for the last-minute recall, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was an opportunity to come up with \"a serious plan\" for domestic steel production.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the government's plan was just a \"short-term sticking plaster\" and both he and the Green Party have called for public ownership as the only option.",
      "It is worth remembering the problems in the steel industry didn't start with Donald Trump, or this government, or even Jingye. Steel was nationalised in 1967, then sold back into the private sector in 1988.",
      "Frantic negotiations with government about jobs, bailouts, survival are familiar. But there is gathering momentum around nationalisation as the solution, in a way unthinkable not so long ago.",
      "Hypothetical conversations started at the top of government a couple of months ago about the possibility, detailed work only in the last week or so. But there is a growing consensus - one source familiar with the situation even says, \"nationalisation is inevitable and has been for some time\".",
      "But \u2013 \"the hurdles are huge\" \u2013 a source tells me. The most obvious obstacle? Cold hard cash, way beyond the initial price tag for raw materials to keep Scunthorpe going for a few more weeks.",
      "In the long term, the blast furnaces are near the end of their life, the plant needs investment, massive investment, to make it safe and to have a proper future. One industry source told me modern electric furnaces could have a price tag as as much as \u00a33bn each, and Scunthorpe might need two.",
      "Energy costs for new or existing furnaces are enormous. In Number 10 and Number 11 there is an acknowledgement that the costs of energy for industry can be crippling. That could be another area where government is keen to act.",
      "The government hasn't yet shared, or hasn't yet worked out, what the potential cost of taking on the plant in the long term might be. A Treasury source says it will have to be within the current plans for spending. And you don't need me to remind you again how tight Number 11 says money is, how tightly Chancellor Rachel Reeves wants to stick to her spending rules.",
      "And yet \u2013 if a big ticket effective nationalisation is the political choice, and it runs to many billions? Let's see.",
      "MPs voting later won't determine the entire future for British Steel. But it puts the government on a path to make real some of its rhetoric in recent weeks, as one figure put it \u2013 \"neoliberalism is over. Ownership matters again -  Labour needs to define Britain's place in this new,  new world order\".",
      "But passing a law in a rush is one thing. Political excitement another. Sir Keir used to attract ire from the left of his own party for walking away from some of his previous beliefs in common ownership, nationalising vital industries. Embarking on an expensive and complicated adventure to preserve a struggling multi-billion pound industry was not meant to be part of the plan.",

    "story": [
      "The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, to prevent it from closing.",
      "A race is now on to try and secure raw materials to stop the plant's blast furnaces from shutting down.",
      "What is British Steel and why is it important?",
      "British Steel's Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company's workforce.",
      "It is the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like buildings and railways. It has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",
      "Were the plant to stop producing virgin steel, the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it. The government views that as a risk to the UK's economic security.",

      "Live: China warns UK against 'politicising' British Steel",
      "UK takes control of British Steel under emergency powers",
      "Why is British Steel Chinese-owned?",
      "In 2016, Tata Steel sold the loss-making part of its business that made \"long products\" like transport rails and steel sections for construction.",
      "Private investment firm Greybull Capital bought it for \u00a31 and renamed the business British Steel.",
      "However, following financial collapse in 2019, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service.",
      "It was sold to Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "Can British Steel's blast furnaces keep running?",
      "Scunthorpe's skyline has four blast furnaces, all named after English Queens - Bess, Mary, Anne and Victoria. Bess and Anne are the only two still working.",
      "The supplies needed to keep them running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low.",
      "However, the government says the materials are \"in the country\". Officials are \"working as fast as they possibly can\" to get them to the plant.",
      "On Saturday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it had become clear that Jingye intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "Why can't a blast furnace easily be restarted?",
      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "The furnaces operate at extreme temperatures, with iron ore and coking coal poured in at the top and liquid iron extracted at the bottom. This iron goes to the steel plant to make steel.",
      "If a furnace stops working, the molten metal will cool and solidify. This is called a \"salamander\".",
      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" process can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal. However, this can be a dangerous process.",
      "Has British Steel been nationalised?",
      "The emergency legislation fast-tracked through Parliament on Saturday gives the government the ability to order raw materials for the furnaces and to direct the company's workforce and managers.",
      "Any employees sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated and the plant can be entered by force, if necessary, to secure assets.",
      "But Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "It said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with moving to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "After the government took control of the plant, China's embassy in the UK said it was \"closely following\" developments.",
      "It said: \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years.\"",
      "Who else produces steel in the UK?",
      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms, according to government figures.",
      "Tata Steel at Port Talbot in Wales was once the UK's largest virgin steel producer but it turned off its blast furnace in September 2024, saying it was losing \u00a31.7m a day.",
      "An agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",
      "Other steelmakers in the UK include Liberty Steel, Celsa, Marcegaglia and Outokumpu.",
      "Liberty Steel also has a plant in Scunthorpe which is facing closure. More than 120 jobs are at risk, with bosses blaming high energy costs.",
      "In 2023 the UK steel industry contributed \u00a32.3 billion to the UK economy -  equivalent to 0.1% of total UK economic output and 1.0% of manufacturing output.",
      "In the same year, the UK produced 5.6 million tonnes of crude steel, or 0.3% of the world's total. In comparison, China produced more than 1,000 million tonnes, 54% of global production.",
      "The EU produced 126 million tonnes of steel in 2023, 7% of the world's total. Compared with EU countries, the UK ranked as the eighth largest steel producer, after Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Austria, Poland and Belgium.",

      "For most other nations, Donald Trump has paused implementing higher taxes on US imports for 90 days.",
      "It means that those countries will now face a lower levy of 10% - the same level as Trump imposed on the UK when he made his initial announcement last week.",
      "The UK appeared to have come off lightly compared to other economies.",
      "But, British exporters still face an extra charge on goods sold into the US and there are many other ways the UK will be affected, from growth to inflation.",
      "The exact impact remains very uncertain. But some of the emerging fallout may have an upside - and here's why.",
      "Business",
      "Those most directly exposed in the UK to this trade war are British businesses - from carmakers to food producers - selling goods into the US.",

      "They already risk a dent to their sales from tariffs, threatening jobs and investment plans. Other companies too could be squeezed by more competition, if cheap imports from other nations are diverted to the UK - China makes a third of global goods.",

      "Two-thirds of British exports to the US are services - the likes of banking, insurance  and advertising - which aren't subject to tariffs. The UK's success in this area makes it a particular area of strength in its trade portfolio.",
      "But that strength can also be a weakness.",
      "Some services exports are linked to goods; think after-sales services or marketing. The demand for those could be affected by tariffs in the US.",
      "Sales of services exports could more broadly be impacted elsewhere if demand from other countries suffers.",
      "Some in the advertising industry are already fretting because spending on their services are often the first to suffer when there are budget cutbacks.",
      "And that trade success could be a vulnerability.",
      "The Bank of England notes that the size of the UK's export sector compared to the economy, and its financial sector, means it may be susceptible to risks to financial stability from weaker global growth.",
      "It's for all these reasons that Chancellor Rachel Reeves is warning that growth in the UK will be hit, even if we're now on a level playing field with other countries in terms of the 10% tariff.",

      "And the wild swings in stock markets around the world, egged on by the heightened risk of global recession, have not been good news for investors in the UK.",
      "When share prices drop, they reduce the value of products such as ISAs and pension funds.",
      "But as seasoned analysts caution, those sorts of funds are long-term ones. Swings in the value of investments tend to get smoothed out over time - and most people aren't drawing from such funds day-to-day. On the whole, households here are less exposed to the stock market directly than those in America are.",

      "When Sarah and Gordon Brown's daughter Jennifer died days after her birth in January 2002 there was an outpouring of support from the public.",
      "The former prime minister was chancellor of the exchequer at the time and the couple's high profile loss struck a chord with people who had experienced similar tragedy.",
      "\"For Gordon and I, losing Jennifer was the greatest loss and it's one that stays with us,\" Sarah tells BBC Scotland News. \"That doesn't change.\"",
      "The couple wanted to understand what had happened but doctors couldn't offer an answer.",
      "Among the 13,000 letters of support were many from people with similar stories.",
      "Sarah says she wanted to do more to look into the causes and consequences of premature birth.",
      "\"What I realised was that there was more we needed to understand, that I didn't have answers for what had happened and so many other families didn't either,\" she says.",
      "The couple set up the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory in 2004, in memory of their daughter, who died just 10 days after she was born, seven weeks premature.",
      "For the past decade, the Theirworld Edinburgh Birth Cohort has been a key part of the research laboratory's work.",
      "It is recording the progress of 400 children from birth to adulthood and aims to provide insights into the long-term effects of premature birth on the developing brain.",
      "Preterm birth \u2013 when a child is born before 37 weeks \u2013 is the single biggest cause of death and disability among newborn babies and is a leading cause of impaired brain development in childhood.",

      "\"We think it's crucial to understand the hows in order to develop new treatments and new ways of supporting that group of children.\"",
      "He says one of the key findings so far is that poverty has an impact on brain development.",
      "\"It would be fair to say that a baby born at full term to a more deprived couple has a similar sort of risk of developing some developmental difficulties as a baby born at 25 weeks into a well-to-do family,\" Prof Boardman says.",

      "\"I was in hospital for five nights before he came along. And he was in there for four months \u2013 until a month past his due date, with all sorts of complications.\"",
      "Elliot had to return to hospital a number of times due to the impact of a chronic lung disease - but Robyn says he has been doing really well.",

    "summary": "Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water molecules to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",
      "\"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said.",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",
      "Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.",
      "The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.",

      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",

      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",

      "Emma Marsh, RSPB's executive director, told Radio 4's Today programme that it is a \"real shame\" because the starling is \"one of our most charismatic birds\".",
      "She said small actions in people's gardens can benefit starlings and other wildlife.",
      "These include avoiding pesticides, which reduce the number of insects around that starlings eat; having a mix of short and long grass to help starlings watch out for predators; keeping lawns natural with dandelions and clovers so there would be more invertebrates; and putting up nest boxes.",
      "Ms Speight added: \"While our homes and gardens often provide the perfect place for individual people to help, we also urgently need governments and businesses to join us in the wider fight to restore our natural world.\"",

      "The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster.",
      "The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.",
      "And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.",
      "\"Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,\" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst.",
      "The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection.",

      "Scans of Titanic reveal wreck as never seen before",
      "The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots.",
      "More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the \"digital twin\", which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.",
      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",
      "The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.",
      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",
      "Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.",
      "This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.",
      "All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"",
      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",

      "\"You can reconstruct [it], but it's not good enough to do anything else with.\"",
      "Instead, he added, the de-extinction team used new synthetic biology technology - using the ancient DNA to identify key segments of code that they could edit into the biological blueprint of a living animal, in this case a grey wolf.",
      "\"So what Colossal has produced is a grey wolf, but it has some dire wolf-like characteristics, like a larger skull and white fur,\" said Dr Rawlence. \"It's a hybrid.\"",
      "Dr Beth Shapiro, a biologist from Colossal Biosciences, said that this feat does represent de-extinction, which she described as recreating animals with the same characteristics.",
      "\"A grey wolf is the closest living relative of a dire wolf - they're genetically really similar - so we targeted DNA sequences that lead to dire wolf traits and then edited grey wolf cells... then we cloned those cells and created our dire wolves.\"",
      "According to Dr Rawlence though, dire wolves diverged from grey wolves anywhere between 2.5 to six million years ago.",
      "\"It's in a completely different genus to grey wolves,\" he said. \"Colossal compared the genomes of the dire wolf and the grey wolf, and from about 19,000 genes, they determined that 20 changes in 14 genes gave them a dire wolf.\"",

      "The pups certainly look like many people's vision of a dire wolf and the story has gathered global attention. So why is this scientific distinction important?",

      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",

      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water molecules to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",

I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",

    "story": [
      "More than 40 percent of the world's electricity was generated without burning fossil fuels in 2024, according to a new report from think-tank Ember.",
      "But carbon dioxide emissions, which warm the planet, have risen to an all time high, the report says, with hot weather pushing up the overall demand for power.",
      "That meant an increase in the use of fossil fuel burning power stations.",
      "Solar power continues to be the fastest-growing energy source, with the amount of electricity it generates doubling in the last three years.",
      "\"Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition,\" said Phil Macdonald, the managing director of Ember.",
      "\"Amid the noise, it's essential to focus on the real signal. Hotter weather drove the fossil generation increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.\"",
      "In a separate report, the European Copernicus climate service said March 2025 was the second hottest on record, extending a spell of record or near record breaking temperatures.",
      "Ember is a global energy think tank which has been predicting for several years that emissions of the climate warming gas carbon dioxide were about to start falling.",

      "Four ways climate change worsens extreme weather",
      "Solar revolution",
      "Cheap and relatively easy to install, for the twentieth year in a row solar is the fastest growing electricity source. According to Ember, the amount generated by solar panels has doubled every three years since 2012.",
      "China continues to dominate the growth of solar with more than half of the increase taking place there. India's solar capacity doubled between 2023 and 2024.",
      "Though it is growing fast, solar remains a relatively small part of the global energy mix contributing just under 7% of global supply \u2013 that's the same as powering the entire country of India.",
      "Wind contributes just over 8%, with hydropower contributing 14% making it the largest source of clean energy. Both hydro-electric and nuclear power (9%) are growing much more slowly than wind and solar.",
      "Back to the 1940s",
      "The report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.",
      "The big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy.",
      "That means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.",
      "According to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024.",
      "This was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.",

      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",

      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",
      "Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.",
      "This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.",
      "All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"",
      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:37:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Some analysts say that if costs incurred by tariffs pass to consumers, US iPhone prices could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",
      "While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.",
      "\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.",
      "Where are iPhones made?",
      "The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.",
      "It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.",
      "Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.",
      "India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.",
      "As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.",
      "Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.",
      "Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.",
      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",
      "Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.",
      "However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly.",
      "This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.",
      "Apple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.",
      "But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.",
      "\"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Will iPhone prices go up?",
      "Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.",
      "Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.",
      "\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.",
      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",
      "Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.",
      "Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.",
      "They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.",
      "While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.",
      "What can consumers do about it?",
      "There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen.",
      "This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.",
      "The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.",
      "Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.",

      "\"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.",
      "We will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.",
      "But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.",
      "CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.",
      "The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.",
      "The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.",

      "Dame Rachel told BBC Radio 5Live that the vast majority schools were already restricting and banning phones, adding: \"Blanket ban if you want, but they're doing it.\"",

      "\"These children are not spending these hours on their phones while sat in school,\" Dame Rachel said in a new report.",
      "She said schools should educate young people about online risks - but parents and carers needed more help to manage their children's online habits and technology companies must \"take responsibility for making the online world safe\".",
      "She added that she would back any head teacher's decision to ban phones, but added: \"It should always be their choice, based on their knowledge of what's best for the children in their own classrooms, not a direction imposed nationally by the government.\"",

      "But Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said he believed a government ban on smartphones in schools would \"assist parents, but also take the pressure off schools\".",

      "Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.",
      "The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains.",
      "\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.",
      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",
      "To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.",
      "Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.",
      "\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.",
      "But many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands.",
      "Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector.",
      "Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market.",
      "Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra.",
      "\"Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,\" he says.",
      "\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"",
      "So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?",
      "\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma.",
      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",
      "Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands.",
      "While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.",
      "Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class.",
      "Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement.",
      "Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.",
      "\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.",
      "\"And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.\"",
      "Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate.",
      "It claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing.",
      "\"This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,\" says founder Utkarsh Gupta.",
      "He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads.",
      "\"Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,\" he says.",
      "Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"",
      "\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds.",
      "Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.",
      "\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"",
      "But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.",
      "\"The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly.",
      "\"But I don't think the small guys will disappear completely. The smart ones will find their niche.\"",

      "A South African court has begun a fresh inquest into the death of one of the most renowned campaigners against the racist system of apartheid, which had initially been described as accidental.",
      "A 1967 inquest ruled that Chief Albert Luthuli was walking on a railway line when he was struck by a train and died after fracturing his skull.",
      "Activists and his family have long cast doubt on the official version of events, and have said they welcomed the re-opening of the inquest.",

      "\"We believe the TRC [Truth and Reconciliation Commission] let many families of victims down by giving amnesty to apartheid murderers,\" he added, referring to the post-apartheid process where perpetrators of violence in the previous decades were encouraged to come forward to fully confess their crimes.",

      "He had been stabbed 45 times and his throat had been slit.",

      "Nofemela, together with the squad's commander Dirk Coetzee and David Tshikalange, were in 1997 found guilty of Mxenge's murder but were granted amnesty by the TRC before the criminal case could be concluded.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump is in \"excellent cognitive and physical health\", says his White House physician.",
      "In the first annual physical of his second presidential term at a Washington DC-area hospital, Trump was also found to have scarring \"on the right ear from a gunshot wound\", after an assassination attempt last July.",
      "\"President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,\" his doctor, Captain Sean Barbabella, said in a memo.",
      "At 78, Trump was the oldest president to take office in January, though his predecessor, Joe Biden, was older at 82 by the time he left.",
      "As a part of Friday's nearly five-hour medical examination at the Walter Reed hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, Trump received several blood tests, a cardiac examination and ultrasounds, said his doctor, a US Navy emergency physician who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "\"President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State,\" Dr Barbabella wrote in the memo released by the White House on Sunday.",
      "The president received neurological tests on his mental status, nerves, motor and sensory function and reflexes and showed no signs of depression or anxiety, according to the memo.",
      "Trump was also given the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and scored 30 out of 30, said Dr Barbabella. The test is commonly used to detect cognitive decline and early signs of dementia and has tasks such as naming animals, drawing a clock and repeating words back five minutes later.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump said he \"got every answer right\" on the cognitive test.",
      "\"Overall, I felt I was in very good shape,\" Trump said. \"A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul.\"",
      "He added that doctors had given him \"a little bit\" of advice on lifestyle changes to improve his health, though he did not provide details.",
      "Dr Barbabella also said Trump had \"minor sun damage\" and a few \"benign skin lesions\".",
      "The president takes several medications to control his cholesterol - Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe - as well as Aspirin for cardiac prevention and Mometasone cream for a skin condition, said the memo.",
      "Trump's cardiac examination showed \"no abnormalities\", wrote Dr Barbabella.",
      "The examination noted the president's medical history of \"well-controlled hypercholesterolemia\", a condition which can increase a patient's risk of a heart attack.",
      "Other conditions noted in his medical history included a past Covid infection, rosacea, which is a skin condition often causing redness in the face, and a benign colon polyp.",
      "The president weighs 224lb (101kg) and stands 6ft 2.5in tall, according to the records from Dr Barbabella. Trump has shed some pounds since February 2019, when he weighed 243lb.",
      "Under the Body Mass Index calculator, he would currently be categorised within the overweight range, and not obese.",
      "The memo noted that the president's \"joints and muscles have a full range of motion\", while crediting his good health to an active lifestyle, including \"frequent victories in golf events\".",
      "It is the first medical report on Trump released to the public since a gunman tried to kill him at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July, grazing his ear with a bullet.",
      "At the time, Trump's former White House doctor, Ronny Jackson, released a report saying his injuries from the incident were superficial.",
      "During Trump's first term in office, a White House doctor said he was in good health but needed to lose weight and exercise.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump frequently attacked his rival, Biden, over his cognitive and physical health.",
      "After a poor debate performance last year against Trump, Biden declined to commit to taking a cognitive test, which he said he had not undergone while in office."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg41r4kx0lko",
    "published": "Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:02:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The Peruvian was  called a \"divinely gifted story-teller\" when he won the Nobel in 2010.",
    "story": [
      "Mario Vargas Llosa, who has died at the age of 89 in his native Peru, was a towering figure in Latin American literature and culture who rarely shied away from controversy.",
      "With more than 50 works to his name, many of which have been widely translated, Vargas Llosa won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2010 when judges dubbed him a \"divinely gifted story-teller\". His depictions of authoritarianism, violence and machismo, using rich language and imagery, made him a star of the Latin American Boom literary movement that shone a global spotlight on the continent.",
      "At first sympathetic to left-wing ideas, he grew disillusioned with Latin America's revolutionary causes, eventually running unsuccessfully for the Peruvian presidency with a centre-right party in 1990.",
      "Vargas Llosa was born in 1936 to a middle-class family in Arequipa in southern Peru. After his parents separated while he was an infant, he moved to Cochabamba in Bolivia with his great-grandparents. He returned to Peru aged 10 and six years later he wrote his first play, The Escape of the Inca. He graduated from Lima University, studied in Spain and later moved to Paris.",
      "His first novel, The Time of the Hero, was an indictment of corruption and abuse at a Peruvian military school. Written at a time when the country's military wielded significant political and social power, it was published in 1962.",
      "Its forceful, menacing imagery was condemned by several Peruvian generals. One accused Vargas Llosa of having a \"degenerate mind\".",
      "It was based on the writer's own time as a teenager at the Leoncio Prado Military Academy, which he described in 1990 as \"an extremely traumatic experience\". His two years there made him see his country \"as a violent society, filled with bitterness, made up of social, cultural, and racial factions in complete opposition\". The school itself burnt 1,000 copies of the novel on its grounds, Vargas Llosa claimed.",
      "His experimental second novel The Green House (1966) was set in the Peruvian desert and jungle, and described an alliance of pimps, missionaries and soldiers based around a brothel.",
      "The two novels helped found the Latin American Boom literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The Boom was characterised by experimental and explicitly political works that reflected a continent in turmoil.",
      "Its leading authors, who included Vargas Llosa's Colombian friend and sometime rival Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez - who pioneered the kaleidoscopic magical realism style of writing - became household names and their works were read around the world.",
      "Famously the two authors did not speak to each other for decades after Vargas Llosa punched Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in the face in a Mexican cinema in 1976. Reports of why Vargas Llosa punched his Colombian friend differ.",
      "Friends of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez said the dispute had revolved around Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's friendship with Vargas Llosa's then-wife, Patricia, but Vargas Llosa told students at a Madrid university in 2017 that it had been down to their opposing views on Cuba and its communist leader, Fidel Castro.",
      "They reconciled in 2007 and three years later, in 2010, Vargas Llosa was awarded the Nobel Prize - the first South American writer to be chosen for the literature prize since Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez took the honour in 1982.",
      "Much of Vargas Llosa's work is inseparable from the instability and violence in parts of Latin America in the second half of the 20th Century as the region experienced waves of revolutions and military rule.",
      "His novel Conversations in the Cathedral (1969) was celebrated for exposing how the Peruvian dictatorship of 1948-56 under Manuel Odr\u00eda controlled and eventually ruined the lives of ordinary people.",
      "Like many intellectuals, Vargas Llosa supported Fidel Castro but became disillusioned with the communist leader following the \"Padilla Affair\" when poet Heberto Padilla was imprisoned for criticising the Cuban government in 1971.",
      "In 1983 Vargas Llosa was appointed president of a commission investigating the gruesome killing in a village in the Peruvian Andes of eight journalists, which became known as the Uchuraccay massacre.",
      "Peruvian officials maintained that the journalists had been killed by indigenous villagers who had mistaken the journalists for members of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group.",
      "The commission's report backed the official line, leading to fierce criticism of Vargas Llosa by those who believed that the gruesome nature of the crime and the horrific mutilations inflicted on the body were the hallmark of an infamous anti-terrorist police rather than signs of \"indigenous violence\".",
      "Moving further right on the political spectrum, in 1990 Vargas Llosa ran for the Peruvian presidency with the centre-right Frente Democr\u00e1tico coalition on a neo-liberal platform. He lost to Alberto Fujimori, who went on to govern Peru for the following 10 years.",
      "Despite the criticism levelled against him over the investigation into the Uchuraccay massacre, Vargas Llosa continued to expose state terror and abuse of power through literature.",
      "His novel The Feast of the Goat, published in 2000, focused on dictator Rafael Trujillo, who ruled the Dominican Republic for 31 years until his assassination in 1961. The novel won praise from the Nobel Prize Committee for its attention to \"structures of power\" and \"images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat\".",
      "Other works were adapted for the big screen. His book Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, based on his first marriage, was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow.",
      "His later work covered figures as diverse as Irish nationalist Roger Casement (The Dream of the Celt, 2012).",
      "He spent the latter years of his life in Peru as well as Madrid.",
      "The author appeared in the pages of Spanish gossip magazine Hola after he left his wife of 50 years in 2015 to be with Spanish-Filipino socialite Isabel Preysler, the mother of popular Latin singer Enrique Iglesias.",
      "He also continued to attract criticism for controversial remarks.",
      "In 2019 he was condemned for blaming the rise in killings of journalists in Mexico - more than 100 in the past decade - on the expansion of press freedom \"which allows journalists to say things that were not permitted previously\". While he also said that \"narcotics trafficking plays an absolutely central part in all of this\", some commentators felt that he failed to express sympathy with the victims and their families.",
      "And in 2018 he caused a stir when, in a column for Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, he called feminism \"the most determined enemy of literature, trying to decontaminate it from machismo, multiple prejudices and immoralities\".",
      "He died in Lima on 13 April surrounded by his family and \"at peace\", his son \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa announced.",
      "With his death, the last of the Latin American Boom's great stars has gone."

      "As the US leads efforts to negotiate peace in Ukraine, those living under Russian occupation face a brutal, repressive future.",
      "Already, the Kremlin has put in place severe restrictions designed to stamp out Ukrainian identity, including harsh punishments for anyone who dares to disagree.",
      "Now, there are fears that Kyiv could be forced to give up at least some of the territory occupied by Russia as part of a potential ceasefire or peace deal.",
      "Ukrainian officials reject this, but Moscow says that at the very least it wants to fully capture four Ukrainian regions it partly controls - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - in addition to Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.",
      "Due to repression by the Russian authorities, speaking to the media and even your own relatives in occupied territories can be fraught with danger.",
      "The Kremlin has also launched a wide-ranging campaign to force Ukrainians in occupied territories to take Russian passports. Evidence suggests that Ukrainians are being denied healthcare and free movement unless they take up Russian citizenship.",
      "Maria (not her real name) said she was a member of an all-female underground resistance group waging a campaign of peaceful resistance in those territories, mainly by distributing leaflets and newsletters.",
      "In an interview with the BBC's Today programme, she used a Ukrainian proverb to describe the danger she is facing: \"You have fear in your eyes, but your hands are still doing it. Of course it's scary.\"",
      "The BBC cannot reveal her real name or location so as not to put her in danger.",
      "Atmosphere of fear",
      "The atmosphere of fear and suspicion is such that when I was trying to contact residents of occupied Mariupol, I was accused of being a Russian journalist.",
      "\"You won't like what I've got to say. People like you kill if you tell them the truth,\" one person told me via direct message on social media. They claimed to be from the port city, captured by the Russians in May 2022 after a bloody siege that left it in ruins.",
      "Later, I asked some Ukrainian friends if I could speak to their relatives living in occupied areas. All said no - that would be too dangerous.",
      "Sofia (also not her real name) is from a village in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region. It was occupied at the start of the full-scale invasion of 2022.",
      "Sofia is now in the UK but her parents are still in her village and she told me about the care she needs to take when talking to them.",

That wasn't true, and later the Russian military told my parents that they had been reported by their neighbours. That's why I try not to provoke anything like that,\" Sofia tells me.",
      "\"I have to read between the lines when they tell me about what's going on.\"",

      "Ways of punishment",
      "According to Maria, Russian administrations have been installing surveillance systems to monitor any manifestations of dissent. \"They are putting up a lot of CCTV cameras to control everybody, to find all the activists,\" she says.",
      "Numerous Ukrainian activists have been killed or disappeared under Russian occupation. According to the Ukrainian rights group Zmina, at least 121 activists, volunteers and journalists have been killed during the full-scale invasion, most of them during its first year.",
      "Prior to the invasion, Russia had drawn up lists of activists to be arrested or killed, the group says.",
      "More recently, Russia-installed authorities have been applying a host of repressive laws against dissenters. They can be penalised for alleged transgressions such as spreading \"false information\", \"discrediting\" the Russian army or supporting \"extremism\".",
      "In Crimea alone, 1,279 cases have been launched so far on charges of \"discrediting\" the Russian armed forces, says the Ukrainian government office for Crimea. According to it, 224 people have been jailed in the occupied Ukrainian region for expressing dissent, most of them members of the indigenous Crimean Tatar community.",
      "Despite the dangers, a number of underground resistance groups are active in occupied parts of Ukraine.",

    "summary": "India\u2019s obesity crisis is surging - and the humble pot belly may be a bigger villain than it seems.",
    "story": [
      "The Indian pot belly - once a badge of prosperity, indulgence and aging respectability - has long been a target of satire and social commentary.",
      "In literature, it quietly signalled comfort or complacency; in films, it became a shorthand for the lazy official, gluttonous uncle, or a corrupt policeman. Cartoons exaggerated it to mock politicians. In rural settings, it was once considered a status symbol - a sign that \"this man eats well\".",
      "But what was once dismissed or even celebrated is now raising alarm bells. The obesity crisis in India is ballooning - and the seemingly harmless pot belly may be a far bigger villain than we think.",
      "India had the second-highest number of overweight or obese adults in 2021, with 180 million affected - behind only China. A new Lancet study warns this number could soar to 450 million by 2050, nearly a third of the country's projected population.",
      "Globally, more than half of all adults and a third of children and adolescents are expected to face the same fate.",
      "At the heart of this issue in India lies the pot belly, or in medical terms, abdominal obesity.",
      "This form of obesity refers to the accumulation of excess fat around the belly and doctors say it's more than a cosmetic concern. As far back as the 1990s, studies showed a clear link between belly fat and chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Obesity isn't just abdominal. It appears in different patterns, depending on fat distribution: peripheral obesity affects the hips, thighs, and buttocks, while generalised obesity involves fat spread more evenly across the body.",
      "The numbers on abdominal obesity in India are already troubling. According to the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) -  which, for the first time, measured waist and hip sizes - about 40% of women and 12% of men in India have abdominal obesity.",
      "Abdominal obesity, based on Indian guidelines, means a waist over 90cm (35 inches) for men and 80cm (31 inches) for women. Among women aged 30 to 49, nearly one in two already show signs of it. Urban populations were found to be more affected than rural ones, with high waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratios emerging as a key red flag.",
      "Indians are getting fatter - and it's a big problemWhy are Indian children getting fatter?",
      "Indians are getting fatter - and it's a big problem",
      "Why are Indian children getting fatter?",
      "So why is belly fat such a big deal?",
      "One reason is insulin resistance - a condition where the body stops responding properly to insulin, the hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. Abdominal fat disrupts how the body uses insulin, making it harder to control blood sugar.",
      "Studies have found South Asians, including Indians, tend to have more body fat than white Caucasians at the same Body Mass Index. (BMI is a simple measure that assesses a person's weight in relation to their height.)",
      "It's not just how much fat you have - it's where it goes. In South Asians, fat tends to collect around the trunk and under the skin, but not always deep in the abdomen as visceral fat.",
      "Though South Asians may have less of the more harmful deep abdominal fat around organs like the liver and pancreas, studies show their larger, less efficient fat cells struggle to store fat under the skin. As a result, excess fat spills into vital organs that regulate metabolism - like the liver and pancreas - raising the risk of diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Scientists still don't fully understand the biological reasons behind the fat distribution patterns. Though numerous genetic studies have been conducted, no single gene has consistently explained this tendency.",
      "One theory offers an evolutionary root. India, for centuries, was racked by famines and chronic food shortages, leaving generations to survive on meagre nutrition.",
      "In such conditions, the human body adapted for survival in extreme scarcity.",
      "The body needed a depot for this energy and the abdomen, being the most expandable area, became the prime storage site. Over time, as food became more plentiful, this fat store continued to grow -  eventually to harmful levels.",
      "\"It's a conjectural but plausible evolutionary theory - one that can't be proven, but makes sense,\" says Anoop Misra, who heads Delhi's Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology.",
      "Last year, in a paper doctors belonging to the Indian Obesity Commission redefined obesity guidelines for Asian Indians, moving beyond BMI to better reflect how body fat relates to early health risks.",
      "They created a two-stage clinical system that considers fat distribution, related diseases and physical function.",
      "Stage one involves a high BMI, but without abdominal obesity, metabolic disease, or physical dysfunction. In such cases, lifestyle changes like diet, exercise and sometimes medication are usually enough.",
      "Stage two includes abdominal obesity - the harmful visceral fat -  and is often accompanied by health issues like diabetes, knee pain or palpitations. This stage signals higher risk and calls for more intensive management.",
      "This classification guides treatment intensity. Once belly fat appears, early action is key - new weight loss drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide are proving effective at targeting it, doctors say.",
      "\"As shocking as it may sound, even people with a normal weight can have dangerous levels of belly fat,\" says Dr Misra.",
      "Indian physicians say abdominal obesity is rising due to lifestyle changes - more junk food, takeaways, instant meals and greasy home cooking. Between 2009 and 2019, Cameroon, India and Vietnam saw the fastest growth in per capita sales of ultra-processed foods and beverages, studies found.",
      "So, what needs to be done?",
      "Experts say Indians need tougher lifestyle changes than Western norms recommend. While 150 minutes of weekly exercise may suffice for their European men, their South Asians counterparts need around 250\u2013300 minutes to offset slower metabolism and less efficient fat storage, studies show.",
      "\"Our bodies simply aren't as good at handling excess fat,\" says Dr Misra.",
      "In short, the pot belly isn't just a punchline - it's a warning sign. And India is sitting on a ticking health time bomb.",

      "\"I made a real decision when I was, like, 11 that I wasn't gonna be like a typical teenager,\" says Bella Ramsey.",
      "Talk about an understatement.",
      "By the time Bella was 13, they had been cast in the world's biggest TV show at the time, Game of Thrones.",
      "And when the actor, now 21 years old, speaks to BBC Newsbeat, it's the night after walking the red carpet at the London premiere of The Last of Us season two.",
      "The smash-hit adaptation of the PlayStation video game was a critical and ratings success, launching the young star to full-on leading role status.",
      "\"I think it's quite a unique experience,\" Bella, who's originally from Nottingham, England, modestly admits.",
      "The rest of this article contains spoilers for The Last of Us season one.",
      "Bella, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, plays Ellie in the HBO drama, set in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity has been almost wiped out by cordyceps.",
      "The deadly parasitic fungus turns humans into zombie-like creatures, but Ellie is immune from infection and is humanity's last hope for a cure.",
      "In the first season viewers saw a father-daughter relationship slowly blossom between Ellie and mercenary Joel, played by Pedro Pascal.",
      "After escorting the 14-year-old on a dangerous journey across the USA to meet doctors working on a vaccine, it becomes apparent Ellie must die for a potential remedy to be produced.",
      "Rather than sacrifice her, Joel kills the medics and flees with the unconscious teenager.",
      "When she awakes, he lies to her about what happened, and season one's cliffhanger ending leaves viewers with the strong impression that Ellie is well aware of the deception.",
      "So when the new season begins, five years later, \"obviously there's tension in that relationship,\" says Bella.",
      "\"It was quite horrible to play.\"",
      "Young Bella's vow to not be a \"typical teenager\" was actually less about their career and more about their relationship with their parents, they say.",
      "No screaming matches, no slamming doors.",
      "\"So I never went through that with my dad,\" says Bella. \"Me and my dad are great.\"",
      "\"So it was kind of sad to do that with Ellie and Joel.\"",
      "But, Bella adds, Ellie \"is very justified in her feelings about everything\".",
      "Ellie is 19 in season two, not too much younger than Bella, who began shooting the first series back in 2021.",
      "Number two was delayed by the 2023 Hollywood strikes, so a lot has happened for Bella in the meantime.",
      "There's symmetry there.",
      "\"It's so fun getting to step back into a character but with kind of new revelations about her and about me in my own life,\" says Bella.",
      "\"There's always like a merging of me and whatever character I'm playing and that happens times 10 with Ellie because I'm spending so much time in her skin.\"",
      "Bella's recently spoken publicly about being diagnosed with autism while working on the first series of the show.",
      "\"It was something that I didn't really think about too much before,\" Bella starts.",
      "\"Actually, no, that's a lie. I did, because I said that I was neurodiverse before, and then I was like, 'Why don't I just say what it actually is, which is, yeah, I'm autistic.\"",
      "Bella says opening up has allowed them \"to be a bit more free\" and hopes it will inspire others.",
      "\"You can be in industries like this and openly say that you're autistic, why there shouldn't be sort of such a stigma around that and such a fear around that,\" says Bella.",
      "\"So I'm very proud to be able to say it out loud and also just to bring more awareness.",
      "\"Autism comes in all different shapes and sizes, and and I'm not someone that people would maybe typically see and go like 'oh, you're autistic'.\"",
      "Bella also identifies as non-binary, and the new series of The Last of Us more deeply explores Ellie's same-sex relationship with Dina, played by Isabella Merced.",
      "\"I feel like we're still figuring out how to portray queer storylines in the media in a way that feels very authentic but that also feels very genuine in terms of the story,\" says Bella.",
      "\"That's what The Last of Us does so well, I think, with Ellie and Dina.",
      "\"It doesn't feel like it's like representation added on top to check a box - it really feels like it's just a part of the story.",
      "\"So that was what was exciting about getting to portray this sort of relationship in this medium.\"",
      "The Last of Us has already been commissioned for a third series after a positive critical reception for season two, so Bella - and Ellie - will still be growing up in the public eye for a while yet.",
      "It's something that \"comes with pros and cons,\" says Bella.",
      "\"But it's kind of lovely that my growth and development has been immortalised on-screen.",
      "\"I feel very grateful for that.\"",
      "But Bella says there's one thing that doesn't get any easier.",

      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",
      "Host of \"Gatsby\" centennial events planned in New York, Minnesota",
      "A host of \"Gatsby\"-themed events are planned to mark the novel's centennial anniversary. In New York, the Empire State Building announced plans to light up in green in a nod to the novel's symbolic green light at the end of Tom and Daisy's dock.",
      "There was also a rowdy \"Roaring Twenties\" party at the Empire Steak House in New York, which was an opulent opera house in Fitzgerald's era. Billed as the \"nation's most extravagant celebration,\" the event featured live jazz, period dancing, and speeches from officials with the New York Public Library.",
      "In honor of the legendary stage play, Broadway has marked the occasion with a release of new block tickets for the show. Tickets are on sale now and will run through Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "The iconic Victorian-themed New York bar, Oscar Wilde, is also hosting a Gatsby-inspired soir\u00e9e on Saturday. The event information markets the celebration as \"an all-day affair of music, opulence and mischief.\" Events kick off at 2 p.m. and continue into the evening until 11 p.m.",
      "Additionally, multiple restaurants are offering exclusive discounts on cocktails, and even a free drink at some places. Gatsby's Landing, Nothing Really Matters, Angelina Bakery and The Plaza are all listed as participants. All events and discounts are ongoing throughout the month of April.",
      "In Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, the events include a new exhibit of the author's life and times at the Minnesota History Center, as well as various, less-than-sober events leaning into the novel's party-friendly Prohibition-era setting.",
      "If you managed to get through high school without having been assigned to read the book, there are a number of live readings of the book scheduled this month, including at St. Paul's Gale Family Library.",

      "\"Family law in California in the late '80s wasn't enough room for it. At that time, you kind of had to have the receipts of physical abuse to get pulled out of a situation. And once we crossed that rubicon is when I moved to Los Angeles,\" she said.",
      "What Hanks learned about her mother",
      "Despite the difficult relationship, Hanks said she remained protective of her mother. In writing the memoir, she incorporated her mother's poetry as a way to reconnect with her.",
      "\"At the time, my mom kind of had this stance like a thoroughbred who had been put out to pasture too soon, and she didn't get her chance as an artist because of my dad's, as I describe it, catastrophic fame,\" Hanks said. \"I think including her poetry in the book is a way of treating her seriously as an artist and getting back into conversation with her. And anybody who's buried a parent knows that a two-way conversation suddenly becomes a one-way conversation.\"",
      "When asked about the truth she now understands, Hanks reflected, \"The truth is, my mother had good days and bad days. And I was lucky to experience the good days, and I was shaped by the bad days. All of the care and protection I had for the child that I was doesn't diminish what happened between us. But it means that as I get older, there's more wiggle room and acceptance for her flaws and mine.\"",
      "The memoir also explores themes of place and identity. As a journalist accustomed to interviewing others, Hanks discovered, \"When you're talking to stone-cold strangers, you can't start with, 'Tell me about your mom,' but you can start with, 'Tell me where you're from.' If someone wants to talk about their hometown, it's an elevator to their deepest self.\"",
      "She added, \"Identity and where you're from, that's the whole story. I learned that I'm the product of where I'm from.\"",

      "\"While we may be seeing less [fraud], we're still dealing with 2024 taxes,\" said Erin Kinard, director of systems and intake for the Health and Economic Opportunity Program at Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit serving western North Carolina that offers both legal help and assistance with ACA problems.",
      "Consumers who suspect they were fraudulently enrolled should immediately call their federal or state ACA marketplace, experts say. Some consumers will be referred to special federal caseworkers throught he marketplaces. But some of those caseworkers are now part of the broad reduction in force by theTrump administration.",
      "In recent days, \"they laid off two divisions on the Affordable Care Act side,\" said Jeffrey Grant, who oversaw ACA issues as CMS' deputy director for operations in the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight before leaving in February.",
      "With fewer caseworkers, \"it will take longer to get problems taken care of,\" said Grant, who is now president of Schedule F Healthcare Strategies, a consulting group that aims to help laid-off federal workers find new jobs. \"The marketplace is twice as big as it was the last time the Trump administration was here, and now they are cutting caseworkers to less than were around then.\"",

      "And these cases are difficult because the rogue brokers who enrolled consumers sometimes misstated their income so they would qualify for the largest tax credits possible. Other consumers have found they were enrolled even though they had affordable employer coverage, making them ineligible for ACA subsidies.",
      "That's what happened to Anthony Akra and his wife, Ashley Zukoski, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were enrolled in a plan without their knowledge in 2023, by a broker in Florida with whom they had never spoken. The couple had health insurance through Zukoski's employer. The broker listed an income that qualified the household for a large subsidy that fully offset the monthly premium cost, so the couple never received a bill. One day, a 1095-A form showed up in their mailbox.",
      "\"I didn't know what the hell it was,\" said Akra, who said the form showed that he had been receiving hundreds of dollars a month in premium tax credits.",
      "He would owe a big chunk of that back unless he could get the plan retroactively canceled. Because their pharmacy, part of a national chain, had switched them to the new plan, also without telling them, they had used the new coverage every time they filled a prescription. That inadvertent use of the policy complicated their efforts to get the fraudulent coverage revoked.",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS withheld more than $4,000 from their tax refund based on the information sent through that 1095-A form.\u00a0 Months passed, but with assistance from a \"navigator\" program \u2014 a government-fundednonprofit that helps people deal with insurance problems \u2014 they were able to get the incorrectinsurance canceled and a refund at the end of October.",
      "It is not unusual for people to spend weeks or even months trying to sort out the mess, said Kinard, whose organization is similar to the one that helped Akra.",
      "While navigator programs nationwide are still operating to help people sign up for health coverage or address issues, the Trump administration has targeted their funding for a 90% cut. Meanwhile, ACA enrollees may face a range of other surprises due to policy and budget steps proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "More Potential Changes",
      "Congress must decide whether to extend premium tax credits that were enhanced during the covid pandemic, which expanded eligibility for the credits and made them larger for many enrollees. Keeping them in place would be expensive, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would add $335 billion to the deficit through 2034.",
      "That debate will come amid another deficit-affecting decision: whether to extend tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration, which would add trillions to the budget deficit through 2034.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies are not renewed, monthly premium costs would rise by an average of over 75%, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Premiums could more than double in some states, including many GOP-led ones, such as Texas, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia.",
      "That could spark a political backlash. Additionally, the enhanced subsidies are seen as a main reason for strong enrollment growth, leading to more than 24 million people signing up for ACA plans for this year.",
      "A recent KFF study found the 15 states with the most enrollment growth since 2020 were all won by Trump in 2024.",
      "A proposed rule released last month by the Trump administration includes provisions to shorten the annual enrollment period, get rid of a special open enrollment period that allows low-income people to sign up year-round, and require stricter verification of income and other information when people apply for coverage. The administration says most of these steps are needed to reduce fraud in the system.",
      "The administration estimates that 750,000 to 2 million fewer people would enroll in coverage as a result of the changes.",
      "The new rule, if finalized, will make it harder for people to enroll, said Xonjenese Jacobs, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. Losing the year-round enrollment for very low-income people, for example, would affect people short on cash who move often to stay with relatives or friends, and those who have unsteady employment, making it hard to know when or where to enroll and what their income might be in the coming year.",
      "\"They don't have the same ability to plan,\" Jacobs said. \"It's definitely going to make a difference for a lot of the individuals that we service.\""

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-trump-tariffs-13-04-2025/",
    "published": "Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:00:24 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's approvals on economy and inflation dip, as Wall Street has one of its most volatile weeks in recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Amid a tumultuous week in the markets, the outlook on President Trump's trade and tariff policy hinges not just on what Americans think will happen, but when.",
      "People split on whether they believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan, and most don't think the tariffs will be permanent \u2014 rather that he's using them to negotiate. More like his goals regarding\u00a0trade policy than his approach to it. For those who think he does have a plan \u2014 predominantly, Republicans \u2014 it'll take months or longer to judge the impact. Republicans stand apart from the public overall in showing that patience.",
      "But in the short term, a big majority of Americans think new tariffs are going to raise prices, and many think that's the case in the long term, too. So, an inflation-weary public is bracing for that to hit their bottom line: a growing number think Trump's policies are making them financially worse off, not better, and most think that tariffs will make the economy worse more immediately, too.",
      "In turn, Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative.",
      "Either way one lasting impression may be this: in the public mind it is Donald Trump's economy now. A majority say his policies, not Joe Biden's, are responsible for it.",
      "Views about the potential impact on prices are especially important in this context because in recent years inflation has consistently been a top concern for Americans, and it is still a top way people evaluate their finances and the economy.",
      "Opinion is more mixed on how tariffs might impact U.S. manufacturing jobs: it is mostly Republicans who believe they will lead to more jobs.",
      "Trump's trade policies",
      "In all, more people say they like Trump's goals with tariff and trade policy than like his approach.",
      "And new tariffs continue to get net negative \u2014 but very partisan splits \u2014 in support.",
      "As does the view on whether or not Trump has a plan, where almost all Republicans say so.",
      "Most Americans don't think the tariffs will stay \u2014 they think Mr. Trump is using them for negotiations and will remove them later. Republicans especially think that \u2014 and it's related to how they view the long-term impact on prices.",
      "Despite many anticipating short-term price increases, Republicans and most independents say judging Trump's trade policies will take at least a few months to evaluate, while Democrats are more ready to evaluate them sooner.",
      "Support for tariffs is also connected to who people think they'll help or hurt. Either way large numbers think the wealthy and corporations will benefit. Those in favor see the middle and working class benefitting too.",
      "Trump's job handling",
      "When Mr. Trump was entering office, a sizable four in 10 Americans thought he'd make them financially better off \u2014 it was a key reason he won the election. That changed in March, with more seeing the impact as worse, and now that worsening view has continued today.",
      "The market was volatile this week while the poll was being conducted, but overall more Americans said Mr. Trump's policies were making the market go down.",
      "In all, the trend is for sliding ratings for Mr. Trump on handling the economy, handling inflation, and overall. (That overall number is down from its high at the start, but still higher than anything he had in his first term.)",
      "Some of the change in Mr. Trump's overall approval has come from independents disapproving more.",
      "As has been the case, Mr. Trump gets better marks for handling immigration than either the economy and inflation.",
      "Impacting the economy",
      "Ultimately, every president's policies put their stamp on the U.S. economy. In political terms, most of the public considers this Donald Trump's economy now: the majority view his policies (not Joe Biden's) as mostly responsible for the way things are today. And combined, three-quarters assign him at least shared impact.",
      "Here's another way Mr. Trump is a central figure in the economy: given a list of reasons why they might think the economy is either good or bad, in either case, sizable numbers give Mr. Trump as a reason. For the large majority who think it's bad, prices and general lack of confidence are top reasons, along with Donald Trump specifically. Those who think the economy is good \u2014 a group that includes a lot of Republicans \u2014 list Mr. Trump, along with general confidence, and the job market.",
      "Polarization also plays a role in a difference between people's assessments now and their outlook. In the last few weeks, their collective outlook has changed a little more.",
      "First, views about their own outlook for the economy got a little worse, with fewer expecting it to hold steady and more expecting a recession.",
      "And a slight majority of Americans \u2014 and slightly more than last month \u2014 said they think the economy is getting worse. That came from Democrats, as most Republicans say it's getting better. (Separately, in a different study, the consumer confidence index slipped in April.)",
      "Meanwhile, current views of the U.S. economy have been majority negative for years and still are. More Republicans are calling it good now, a partisan effect we often see over the years when the White House changes hands. And Republicans say that's in part due to their confidence in general and because of Donald Trump in particular. Those Republicans pushed the overall economy rating up a bit, even as Democrats and independents rated it worse.",
      "Partisan differences on trade \u2014 how the base sees it",
      "We can see more into Mr. Trump's support from the GOP base by where people go for trusted information about the tariffs and their impact: for Republicans, they trust Trump \"a lot\" for that information, far more than they do Wall Street or business leaders in general.",
      "Along with economics and jobs, Republicans also see tariffs and trade as a matter of fairness and patriotism.",
      "And most Republicans don't want Congress involved, even though it's a Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats and independents, who are less supportive of tariffs, likely for pragmatic reasons would call for more congressional involvement to stop them.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,410\u00a0 U.S. adults interviewed between April 8-11, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

      "The S&P 500 gained 95 points, or 1.8%, to 5,363, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 619 points, or 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1%.",

      "Beijing on Friday announced that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. That matches the 125% duties on Chinese goods that President Trump\u00a0announced this week\u00a0\u2014 those tariffs will rise to as much as 145% for some of the Asian nation's products.",
      "\"The U.S. alternately raising abnormally high tariffs on China has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance, and will become a joke in the history of the world economy,\" a Chinese finance ministry spokesman said in a statement announcing the new tariffs. \"However, if the U.S. insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China's interests, China will resolutely counter and fight to the end.\"",

    "summary": "Some people whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January are struggling to convince their insurers to test their properties for safety.",
    "story": [
      "All sense of survivors' guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\"Every single item is a battle,\" said Maccalla. \"It's denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\"",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents United, sharing indoor environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\"I've already had multiple people reach out and say: 'Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,'\" said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can't afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\"If I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won't be,\" said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents United.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "No help from FEMA",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home's physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\"It can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\" Ruiz said. \"You have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\"",
      "Disputes over fire damage coverage",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\"It's perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We're talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \"permanent physical changes,\" meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan's threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\"The damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\" Schaffer said. \"They make it complicated because it saves them money.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters' recommendations.",
      "\"Our policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\" McLean said.",
      "Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler's pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\"After the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\" she said. \"But now there's no way.\"",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\"It feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \"They should have a process to keep people safe because this isn't the first disaster like this.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. businesses are starting to add a tariff fee to customer bills and shopping carts to offset rising import costs.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's volley of tariffs has U.S. companies scrambling for ways to absorb \u2014 and if possible avoid \u2014 the added business costs.",
      "Some enterprises, from small businesses to nationally recognized brands, have already announced higher prices, citing President Trump's tariffs. While others, from footwear companies to furniture brands, are warning consumers to brace for increased costs to come.",
      "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0Thursday that he expects the tariffs to lead to higher prices on a host of consumers goods, noting that the site's third-party sellers are likely to pass on tariff-related costs.",
      "Some consumers are also preparing for price hikes by\u00a0stocking up on goods\u00a0they think are likely to become more expensive if U.S. \"reciprocal levies\" on dozens of countries,\u00a0which are paused for 90 days, take effect.",
      "A 10% tariff on all U.S. imports remains in place. China, which accounts for nearly a third of all goods imported into the U.S., faces levies of up to 145% for some items. In an escalation of the trade war between the world's two largest economics, Beijing fired back Friday by announcing it will hike duties on American exports from 84% to 125% and deriding Mr. Trump's tariffs as a \"joke.\"",
      "Tariff fees on what you buy",
      "Although the tariffs and retaliatory moves by other countries have yet to hit economic growth, U.S. businesses aren't waiting around. Some are introducing \"tariff surcharges,\" announcing new prices on their websites and in letters to consumers.",
      "Labucq, which sells high-end footwear that is fabricated in Italy, addressed tariffs and their effect on pricing in a recent social media\u00a0post. The company said a 20% U.S. tariff on imports from the European Union, which Mr. Trump announced on April 2 before pausing them, would require the company to hike prices by 10% beginning April 15. Labucq said its pricing will then jump by an additional roughly 10% on May 7, noting the increases are necessary for it to \"remain sustainable.\"",
      "Dame, a sexual wellness brand that makes adult toys and personal care products, has implemented a $5 \"Trump tariff surcharge\" that is automatically added to customers' online shopping carts at checkout.",
      "Dame CEO Alexandra Fine said the fee doesn't cover all of its extra costs and that the company is analyzing its pricing given that most of its products are made in China. \"Our whole industry is in China, so we've already seen the impact,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Fine also said she wants to be transparent with customers about what is happening, rather than quietly inflating prices.",
      "\"The intention of adding the Trump tariff surcharge as a line item at checkout was to remind people that this is an extra tax on us. I wanted people to understand why it's more expensive \u2014 that it's because of political decisions that were made,\" she said.",
      "Other companies are also moving to raise prices. In a quarterly earnings call last month, a senior executive with U.S. chip maker Micron said some of its products would be subject to higher U.S. tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China and that it plans to \"pass those costs along to our customers.\"",
      "Honeywell Building Automation, which designs safety and efficiency systems for buildings, in early March announced new pricing related to fresh tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. The company started applying a 6.4% \"tariff surcharge\" on its building management systems, excluding software and subscription services, saying the move was necessary \"to mitigate the impact of tariffs.\" Honeywell also said it would eliminate the extra duty \"as soon as such tariffs are no longer in force.\"",
      "Lemonade out of lemons",
      "Other companies are using the situation as a promotional tool. While it's true that consumers could eventually pay more if they wait to purchase furniture, electronics, automobiles and more, \"pre-tariff sales\" play into consumers' fear that prices could rise, and can be an effective way to boost sales, according to experts.",
      "\"The tariffs are injecting uncertainty into the marketplace and when there is high uncertainty, consumers tend to overestimate their losses, so they try to hedge their losses as much as possible in a very irrational way,\" Denish Shah, professor of marketing at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "And in times of market uncertainty, explains Denish, consumers are prone to panic-buying.",
      "\"They tend to stockpile necessities, fearing that tomorrow, suddenly, prices could go up. So they'll say, 'Let me try to accelerate all the purchases I can that I would have made anyway,'\" he said.",
      "That said, consumers' overarching goal, particularly after battling years of relentless inflation, is to save money. \"Consumers are very price-sensitive in this environment, so they are going to react very strongly to sales that companies are promoting,\" Shah added.",
      "The pre-tariff sales strategy is already working for some sellers, such as Burlap & Barrel, a spice company that imports single-origin spices from around the world. It sources ingredients from small farms in Guatemala, Iceland, India, Spain, Turkey, Vietnam and more. Over the weekend, the spice importer announced\u00a0a \"spring cleaning-turned-impromptu Tariff sale,\" marking down all products by 20%, through Tuesday.",
      "\"When we planned this sale, we thought it'd be a routine springtime promotion, but in the last few days it has turned into something very, very different,\" Burlap & Barrel wrote in a social media post. The company said that it's waiting to see how tariffs are applied to its products, but it's sure that they \"will be bad for our business,\" given that it cannot easily overhaul its supply chains.",
      "The company states that it is running the sale \"To show that we're serious about not raising our prices, and to finance another year or purchasing from smallholder farmers in the face of economic instability and political crisis.\"",
      "Another company, Freewrite, sent an email to customers on Friday urging them to buy its digital typewriters before it hikes prices on its China-made products next week due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Everyone, including our contract manufacturing partners, is helping us explore our options, but the truth is that it is incredibly difficult to move factories. It takes careful planning, huge expense and much more time than we have,\" Freewrite CEO Adam Leeb wrote in the email. \"On Monday, we will be raising prices. Not because we want to, but because we have to.\"",
      "Large chains are putting their own spin on tariff-related promotions. Furniture maker Raymour & Flanigan is urging customers to \"lock in pre-tariff pricing\" in a banner on its website. The company does not indicate what kind of price hikes it could implement in the future, though, as a result of the new levies.",

    "story": [
      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economy faces a critical stretch, while also warning of the ongoing uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariff policies.",
      "\"The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and 'trade wars,' ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,\" he said Friday during the banking giant's first-quarter earnings call.",
      "Dimon told Wall Street analysts that JPMorgan expects tariffs to increase inflation roughly 0.5% this year. But he also expressed confidence that the Trump administration is eager to negotiate trade agreements with other countries, which would ease the strain on the economy.",
      "\"I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think that will be good for everybody, and they want to do it, too,\" he said.",
      "Dimon, considered the country's most influential banking leader, said earlier this week that U.S. tariffs could lead to higher inflation, weaker economic growth and potentially even a recession.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" he said in his annual shareholder letter Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump this week\u00a0paused most country-based tariffs\u00a0for 90 days \u2014 a move that came as CEOs and Wall Street investors publicly pressed the White House to reconsider its trade measures and as financial markets gave a resounding thumb's down to U.S. trade policies.",
      "After suspending the \"reciprocal\" tariffs, Mr. Trump said he had watched an interview with Dimon on Fox Business in which the banker said the tariffs would make a recession a \"likely outcome,\" according to Bloomberg.",
      "Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, also decried the tariffs this week,\u00a0saying\u00a0on social media Sunday that \"we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:27:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent cuts eliminated a small, specialized workforce that sets the poverty standards determining who is eligible for Medicaid as well as assistance with food, home heating, child care, and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",

      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Glattstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Glattstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Glattstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Glattstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

    "summary": "Inflation cooled in March, but economists expect prices to reaccelerate as some of President Trump's tariffs kick in.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, showing progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to bring down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.6% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "March's report comes after\u00a0inflation rose 2.8% on an annual basis in February.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices actually fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years.",
      "Inflation eased last month due partly to lower fuel prices, with gasoline tumbling 9.8% on an annual basis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "Another reason prices fell was sharp drops in travel-related costs, including airfares, which decreased 5.3% just from February to March. Hotel room prices dropped 3.5%.",
      "Economists said those declines in part reflected much slower international demand as the number of tourists visiting the United States has fallen sharply amid Trump's aggressive trade policy.",
      "Visits to the United States from overseas fell nearly 12% last month, according to government data.",
      "What experts say",
      "Easing inflation combined with President Trump's announcement yesterday of a 90-day pause in his reciprocal tariffs should help alleviate some concerns for the Federal Reserve when it meets on May 7 to make its next interest rate decision, said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.",
      "But because other tariffs orchestrated by Mr. Trump have recently gone into effect \u2014 such as auto tariffs \u2013 inflation nevertheless could pick up later this year, experts say.",
      "Yet March's data is \"backward looking\" and doesn't reflect the trade policy changes orchestrated by the Trump administration, noted Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are still expected to lift inflation later in the year as the impact of the import duties trickle through the economy. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart when they accept shipments of foreign goods, they typically pass off all or some of the tariff cost onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "The president's 90-day pause excludes China, a major exporter to the U.S., which will continue to face tariffs of 125% on its goods. And Mr. Trump's 10% universal duty will also likely to push up prices in the coming months, economists say. The higher import taxes will likely weigh on the economy's growth as well.",
      "What the CPI shows about egg prices",
      "Although consumer prices cooled in March, the CPI data showed egg prices continued to inch higher last month. According to the CPI figures, egg prices increased in March to reach a new record-high of $6.23 despite a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.",
      "More recently, grocers have told CBS News that egg prices are\u00a0showing signs of easing.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks were cited as the major cause of price spikes in January and February after more than 30 million egg-laying chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.",
      "Since the current bird flu outbreak began, more than 168 million birds have been slaughtered, most of them egg-laying chickens. Any time a bird gets sick, the entire flock is killed to help keep bird flu from spreading. That can have an effect on the egg supply because massive egg farms may have millions of birds.",
      "What the CPI means for your money",
      "Despite today's cooler-than-expected CPI numbers, inflationary risks are still a threat to the U.S. economy, especially as some of Mr. Trump's tariffs are still in place while others are merely delayed, experts say.",
      "\"Going forward, the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft,\" Haigh said. \"We expect the Fed's initial reaction to be cautious, but the risks remain that a sharper than expected slowdown in the economy could result in a resumption of the Fed's easing cycle.\"",
      "Three of four economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting on May 7. The current federal funds \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 now stands in a range 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That means consumers and businesses are unlikely to see any relief on loan rates in the near term, although economists are penciling in cuts later in the year, with the majority forecasting a reduction at the Fed's June 18 meeting.",

      "CBS has lost distribution rights to \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Jeopardy!,\" with a Los Angeles court rejecting the network's bid for a preliminary injunction that would have blocked Sony from taking over.",
      "Sony, which produces the two iconic game shows, filed a complaint in October 2024 alleging that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing agreements. Specifically, the entertainment company claimed CBS licensed the shows at below-market rates and failed to maximize advertising revenue, among other alleged contract violations (CBS News and CBS are owned by Paramount Global.)",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 18:45:25 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump had brushed off the stock market's plunge, but turmoil in the bond market got his administration's attention.",
    "story": [
      "Even as stocks plunged in reaction to his administration's sweeping tariffs, President Trump expressed\u00a0confidence in his trade policies, saying last week that \"markets are going to boom.\" But by Wednesday, a collective thumb's down to the tariffs by bond investors had given Mr. Trump pause.",
      "With U.S. and global financial market tumbling, he abruptly suspended his administration's \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other countries for 90 days, acknowledging that the bond market was \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's about-face was by no means the first time a sitting American president had blinked in the face of bond investors expressing alarm over U.S. policies they viewed as fiscally reckless and harmful to their portfolios. In their first terms, both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also found themselves knocked back when the bond market rebelled at the cost of some of their strategic priorities.",
      "The \"bond vigilantes\" ride again",
      "Americans might think of bonds as a less risky asset class they turn to in their 401(k)s to offset more volatile investments, such as stock. But the $2.8 trillion Treasury market is also a bedrock of the U.S. government. The federal government finances the country's debt by selling Treasury bills to investors, who prize the asset because of the country's sterling credit rating and its guarantee of making good on interest payments.",
      "As the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs went into effect on Wednesday, the bond prices slid and the yield on 2-year Treasury notes rose by as much as 0.3 percentage points, marking the biggest intraday move since 2009, according to financial data firm FactSet. (Bond prices move in inverse relation to their interest rates, or yields.)",
      "Such sudden moves can signal that investors are dumping their bonds. That pushes bond prices lower but boosts yields, which are the returns that bond holders pay to investors.",
      "\"Why is this happening? Fixed-income investors may be starting to worry that the Chinese and other foreigners might start selling their U.S. Treasuries,\" economist Ed Yardeni said in an April 8 research note.",
      "Yardeni, who coined the term \"bond vigilantes\" in the 1980s to describe fixed-income investors who express their disapproval of government policies by dumping Treasuries, added that the bond market was cautioning that \"the Trump administration may be playing with liquid nitro.\"",
      "In another report after Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, Yardeni noted, \"The Bond Vigilantes have struck again. As far as we can tell, at least with respect to U.S. financial markets, they are the only 1.000 hitters in history.\"",
      "Some Trump administration officials acknowledged that the bond market's hostile reaction to the tariffs influenced the decision to pause the tariffs.",
      "\"[The] bond market was telling us, 'Hey, it is probably time to move,'\" White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett\u00a0said\u00a0on CNBC on Thursday.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump announced his April 2 tariffs, economists raised concerns\u00a0about the potential impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The president claimed the tariffs, which he called \"reciprocal\" because they were aimed at equalizing the trade barriers between the U.S. and its trading partners, would help revive manufacturing to the U.S. and raise revenue for the federal government.",
      "But experts warned that the tariffs, which ranged from a baseline 10% for most nations up to more than 100% for Chinese imports, raised the risks of a recession and would likely reignite inflation. Investors dumped stocks and bonds as they digested the economic risks of Mr. Trump's tariff barrage.",
      "While the stock market plunge hurt millions of Americans' retirement savings, the turmoil in the bond market creates very real pressures on the nation's finances. Because the Treasury Department pays interest to debt holders, any increase in yields puts more financial strain on the nation's coffers.",
      "\"Developments in the last 24 hours suggest we may be headed for serious financial crisis wholly induced by U.S. government tariff policy,\" Harvard University economist and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers\u00a0said\u00a0in an April 9 thread on social media.",
      "He added, \"Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards. This highly unusual pattern suggests a generalized aversion to U.S. assets in global financial markets.  We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market.\"",
      "An expensive problem",
      "Given the size of the Treasury market, the surging bond yields and broader market turmoil could create an expensive problem for the federal government. For Mr. Trump, the timing was especially poor as he pushes Congress to pass an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, which are forecast to cost trillions over the next decade.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion to service its debt, more than double its roughly $500 billion in 2020, according to Treasury data. That's largely due to higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to battle the post-pandemic surge in inflation.",
      "An increase in bond yields could add to that expense, putting even more pressure on the federal budget.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market selloff, once the bond market began to weaken, too, it was only a matter of time before he folded on his eye-wateringly high tariffs,\" noted economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in an April 9 research note.",

      "U.S. stocks soar in relief rally",
      "On Wall Street, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, an amount that would count as a good year for the market. It had been sinking earlier in the day on worries that Mr. Trump's trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.",
      "\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" the president said, after recognizing the more than 75 countries that he said have been negotiating on trade and hadn't retaliated against his latest increases in tariffs.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later told reporters Mr. Trump was pausing his so-called \"reciprocal' tariffs\" on most of the country's biggest trading partners but maintaining his 10% tariff on nearly all global imports.",
      "China was a huge exception, though, with Mr. Trump saying tariffs are going up to 125% against its products. That raises the possibility of more swings ahead that could stun financial markets. The trade war isn't over, and an escalating battle between the world's two largest economies can create plenty of damage. U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago, when Trump announced worldwide tariffs on what he called \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But on Wednesday, at least, the focus on Wall Street was on the positive. The Dow shot to a gain of 2,962 points, or 7.9%. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2%. And the S&P 500 had its third-best day since 1940.",
      "The relief came after doubts had crept in about whether Mr. Trump cared about the financial pain the U.S. stock market was taking because of his tariffs. The S&P 500, the index that sits at the center of many 401(k) accounts, came into the day nearly 19% below the record its set less than two months ago.",
      "That surprised many professional investors who'd long thought a president who used to crow about records for the Dow under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent markets reeling.",
      "Wednesday's rally pulled the S&P 500 index away from the edge of what's called a \"bear market.\" That's what professionals call it when a run-of-the-mill drop of 10% for U.S. stocks, which happens every year or so, graduates into a more vicious fall of 20%. The index is now down 11.2% from its record.",
      "Bonds rebound",
      "Wall Street also got a boost from a relatively smooth auction of U.S. Treasurys on Wednesday. Earlier jumps in Treasury yields had indicated increasing levels of stress and Trump said he had been watching the bond market \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Higher yields on Treasurys put pressure on the stock market and push upward on rates for mortgages and other loans for U.S. households and businesses. U.S. Treasury yields have historically dropped - not risen - during volatile times because the bonds are usually seen as some of the safest possible investments.",
      "This week's sharp rise had brought the yield on the 10-year Treasury back to where it was in late February.",
      "After approaching 4.50% in the morning, the 10-year yield pulled back to 4.34% following Trump's pause and the Treasury's auction.",
      "By early Thursday, it was trading at 4.28%, up from 4.26% late Tuesday and from just 4.01% late last week.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 08:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's aggressive use of tariffs has fueled concerns about the economy and roiled the stock market.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world this year has rattled consumers, businesses and investors. Although President Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, he upped import duties on Chinese goods to 125% \u2014 escalating a conflict between the world's two largest economies.",
      "We asked you what questions you had about tariffs and answered some of those in a CBS News 24/7 special. Read on for some answers to your questions below.",
      "Are global tariffs legal, and have U.S. levies on other countries risen or fallen over the years?",
      "CBS MoneyWatch: Tariffs are legal under World Trade Organization rules, although participating countries must comply with certain restrictions and levies are generally capped.",
      "As a result, nations have long had the right to impose multilateral tariffs, although those costs vary widely based on trade agreements, product type and many other factors.",
      "In the 19th century, average U.S. tariff rates on trading partners routinely exceeded 30%. The government sharply reduced those levies after the Great Depression, cutting them to single digits. After resuming power in 2025, President Trump raised the effective U.S. tariff to 22% \u2014 the highest since 1909.",
      "For the Trump administration, are these massive tariffs intended to pressure other nations into more favorable trade deals, or is the goal to push American businesses to invest more in domestic manufacturing? Or both?",
      "Both, correct. These historically large tariffs have several main objectives. In the short term, the tariffs are intended to pressure countries to come to the table to negotiate what Mr. Trump sees as more favorable trade deals.",
      "Over the long term, Trump administration officials say that sharply raising U.S. tariffs will spur both domestic and foreign companies eager to avoid the added costs to expand here at home, creating jobs, reinvigorating manufacturers and boosting economic growth.",
      "President Trump has also long argued that global trade rules, enshrined in entities like the World Trade Organization, disdvantage the U.S. by, for example, permitting countries like China, Germany and Japan to subsidize key industries. He blames those rules for fueling large global trade imbalances that have saddled the U.S. with a large, and growing, trade deficit.",
      "Another goal of tariffs is to generate federal revenue \u2014 funds that Mr. Trump will likely need to offset additional tax cuts he has promised to Americans and to corporations.",
      "Why do some people oppose deploying tariffs against countries that impose tariffs on the U.S.?",
      "Most mainstream economists think the kind of sweeping tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on nearly all U.S. imports act as a tax on businesses and consumers. Such levies raise the cost of many essential items, leading to higher prices for American households; depress economic growth; and could even trigger a recession.",
      "Under this view, a trade war in which countries jack up tariffs on their economic partners effectively makes them all poorer.",
      "By contrast, trade experts also say that targeted tariffs \u2014 implemented as but one element in a larger industrial strategy \u2014 can help protect critical U.S. industries and workers from unfair foreign competition.",
      "How do these tariffs impact consumers, especially when it comes to prices on everyday items like groceries or housewares?",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers such as Walmart, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of those appliances jumped more than 11%, tacking on about $86 to the cost of a new unit, according to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "While consumers can opt for U.S.-made merchandise, domestic manufacturers also may raise their prices due to tariffs. Sometimes that's due to an increase in the cost of imported goods they need to manufacture their products. But some companies also take the opportunity to hike prices because the newly expensive foreign-made products provide them with more pricing flexibility.",
      "Without Mr. Trump's pause, imported vegetables, fruit and nuts were set to rise by 19% due to the tariffs, according to a recent analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a public policy think tank. That would have boosted prices for those foods by more than 6%, after adjusting for an expected 0.6% increase in the cost of the same items grown in the U.S.",
      "What's the long-term outlook \u2014 are these tariffs likely to strengthen the U.S. economy or just cause temporary disruption?",
      "Economists say Mr. Trump's tariffs have increased the risk that the U.S. and other nations could tumble into a recession in the next year. Because tariffs raise prices, Americans are expected to cut back on spending \u2014 a potentially major problem given that 70 cents of every $1 in the nation's gross domestic product is based on consumer spending.",
      "For instance, the tariffs could slow GDP growth to 1.4% in 2025, while core inflation could rise to 3.9% this year, according to an April 2 forecast from Oxford Economics. That would represent a significant slowdown from the economy's 2.8% growth rate in 2024.",
      "Other experts say leaving sharply higher U.S. tariffs in place could leave much deeper scars. GDP growth could fall by 0.6 percentage points over the next decade, the Yale Budget Lab estimated.",
      "What is the end goal for the Trump administration's tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has said he believes tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs. By making it more expensive to sell foreign-made goods in the U.S., the president wants to convince American and foreign companies to build factories here.",
      "But he's also highlighted other goals for his tariff barrage, such as convincing other nations to give more favorable trading terms to the U.S.",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a way to raise billions in revenue for the U.S. government, even though economists point out that tariffs are essentially a sales tax which are paid by American consumers.",
      "Does Mr. Trump really think he's going to be able to rebuild manufacturing in America again?",
      "Mr. Trump is adamant that tariffs can revive manufacturing in the U.S., which has been on the decline for at least half a century. Yet economists and other experts aren't so sure.",
      "There are several reasons for their skepticism. For one, building the types of factories and infrastructure to support the manufacturing that is now handled by other nations, such as China and Vietnam, would require years and billions in investment.",
      "The U.S. manufacturing sector has been shrinking for decades, so companies repatriating factories from abroad would struggle to find enough skilled workers, especially in technology and other areas higher up the industrial value chain",
      "And because of the uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, some businesses might not want to commit to such an investment given that the import duties might disappear or be sharply lowered \u2014 as they were today.",
      "What could happen to block the U.S. tariff increases?",
      "Several factors could halt the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump, according to experts.",
      "First, Congress could introduce a resolution to terminate the emergency declaration used by Mr. Trump to issue the tariffs. Since both the Senate and House are controlled by Republicans, that would require several members of the GOP to join Democrats in voting against Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "But Mr. Trump would likely veto any such measure that reached his desk, which means that two-thirds of both chambers would need to vote in favor of the measure in order to make it veto-proof.",
      "Second, the courts could intervene and rule that Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority. Already, there has been a lawsuit filed by a small business in Florida that argues that Mr. Trump has overstepped by issuing the April 2 tariffs, and that the power should belong to Congress alone.",
      "Third, the violent reaction in financial markets that followed Mr. Trump's latest tariff salvo could persuade him to change course. His move on Wednesday to pause many of the tariffs followed a five-day plunge in stocks that put the S&P 500 on the verge of entering a bear market \u2014 when equities fall at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "That steep decline in stock prices hurts tens of millions of Americans saving for retirement and could lead them to cut their spending, a big drag on economic growth.",

      "Despite the pause, experts noted that uncertainty remains an issue for U.S. businesses, given that the tariffs could restart in 90 days and that the penalties on China \u2014 a major trading partner \u2014 are likely to dampen economic growth.",

      "China trade war intensifies",
      "Still, the trade war continues between the U.S. and China continues to rage.

The retaliation signals Beijing isn't backing down from Mr. Trump's global trade war.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has shaken up\u00a0stock markets\u00a0around the world as he announced\u00a0sweeping tariffs\u00a0on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0last week, then partially reversed course shortly after. The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's April 2 announcement set out a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",
      "Exactly a week later, the president paused many of the newly announced reciprocal duties, with the exception of those placed on China.",
      "The reversal came a little over a month after Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs\u00a0on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and\u00a0then announced a pause just two days later.",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "As markets fluctuate, and with many of his most recent\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0paused, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "Trump reverses course, pauses tariffs",
      "Two days after Mr. Trump said during a\u00a0meeting with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his planned tariffs and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% \u2014 with the exception of China.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0stock market surged\u00a0immediately after the president's announcement.",
      "When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said on April 7, \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "On April 9, citing China's unwillingness to negotiate, Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he's raising taxes on China to 125%. China announced earlier in the day that it would\u00a0raise its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%.",
      "The president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on April 5 as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on April 6 on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street on Monday, April 7, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday, April 7, to raise duties imposed on China to 50% after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "China did not withdraw its tariffs and the ratcheting up continued, with Mr. Trump increasing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 104% and then and then 125% as China upped\u00a0its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%.",

      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on April 2 announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports face the baseline rate of 10%, while China-made products are now paying an import duty that has jumped to 104%\u00a0\u2014 the reciprocal tariffs combined with previously announced duties of 20% \u2014 after slapping its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his April 2 remarks.",
      "However, on April 9 Mr. Trump backed away from parts of his plan, announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs and lowering the tariff rate to 10% for almost all nations. The notable exception was China, with Mr. Trump saying that he's instead raising the tariff rate on the country's imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Stocks soared after Mr. Trump's April 9 announcement, with the S&P 500 gaining 8.4% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 7%. Still, some on Wall Street cautioned that the pause is still on track to end in 90 days, which could signal more volatility ahead.",
      "\"The tariff clouds parted for the first time today, but it's too soon to know how sunny the skies will be tomorrow \u2014 or 90 days from now,\" said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team, in an email.",
      "Worst-hit countries",
      "Before he announced the pause, Asian nations were set to face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "China retaliated by saying it planned to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, followed by Mr. Trump retaliating with plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on its imports and China ratcheting up its rate to 84%.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When do these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates were originally set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9, but later that day President Trump announced a\u00a0postponement for 90 days. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which took effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries retaliating against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, and then raised the level to 84%. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",

      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",

      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

      "Bukele and Bondi made the comments in the Oval Office alongside President Trump, as the two world leaders meet. Over the weekend, the Justice Department said in court filings that they're willing to take \"all available steps to remove any domestic obstacles\" to facilitate his return.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\" Bukele asked the press. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United Sates? I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"",
      "Bondi, speaking before Bukele, said it's \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\" Bondi said that \"first and foremost, he was illegally in our country.\"",
      "\"That's not up to us,\" Bondi said. \"The Supreme Court ruled, President, that if El Salvador wants to return him ... we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.\"",
      "But the Supreme Court offered no qualifier of whether El Salvador wants to return Abrego Garcia. The court ruled that a lower court order properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release from El Salvador's custody. The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of the\u00a0Maryland man\u00a0from custody in El Salvador, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers insist he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador. The Trump administration acknowledged\u00a0that his deportation to the high-security prison in El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "\"It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,\" Michael G. Kozak, a senior State Department official, said in a Friday court filing. \"He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "The Trump administration sent deportation flights with scores of foreign nationals that they describe as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. Among them was Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children.",
      "Bukele, a tough-on-crime leader, said it was an \"honor to be here\" and \"we're very eager to help\" with stopping crime and terrorism. Bukele told Mr. Trump what he's doing with the border is \"remarkable,\" praising the plunge in crossings at the U.S. southern border. Under Bukele's tenure, El Salvador has seen a dramatic decrease in its crime rate.",
      "In announcing his meeting with Bukele, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post, that their nations \"are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity.\"",
      "\"President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation's custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government.

    "summary": "Cody Balmer was charged with attempted murder, terrorism and other counts after officials said he intentionally set a fire at the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence.",
    "story": [
      "A Pennsylvania man has been charged with attempted murder, terrorism and other offenses after an overnight fire at the Governor's Residence in Harrisburg forced Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family to evacuate the home, according to court documents filed in Dauphin County.",
      "Officials said Cody Balmer, 38, hopped a fence and intentionally set a fire at the residence early on Sunday, April 13, while Shapiro and his family were home. Balmer, of Harrisburg, was charged Monday with criminal homicide/attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and more. He was taken into custody on Sunday in the Harrisburg area.",
      "Shapiro said the attack was targeted, but officials don't know Balmer's specific motive yet.",
      "\"This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society,\" Shapiro said. \"And I don't give a damn if it's coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another, it is not OK, and it has to stop. We have to be better than this. We have a responsibility to all be better.\"",
      "Balmer's mother, Christie Balmer, told CBS News her son is \"mentally ill and he went off his medication.\"",
      "Christie Balmer said she tried to get her son \"picked up\" last week and reached out to four different police departments but \"couldn't get anybody to help. So he was mentally ill, went off his meds, and this is what happened.\"",
      "State police said crews from the Harrisburg Bureau of Fire went to the Governor's Residence on North Front Street in Dauphin County around 2 a.m. Sunday for a report of a fire.",
      "Shapiro said that he and his family were asleep at the home when the fire broke out. The Pennsylvania governor said they woke up to bangs on the door by the Pennsylvania State Police. Shapiro, his wife, Lori, and his children, along with two dogs and the relatives staying with them, evacuated the Governor's Residence as Harrisburg fire crews worked to extinguish the blaze.",
      "The Pennsylvania governor said that no one was injured, and the fire was brought under control.",
      "The fire happened after Shapiro, who is Jewish, and his family celebrated the first night of Passover. Shapiro declined to call the fire a hate crime but said that the blaze won't deter him from doing his job or celebrating his faith.",
      "\"I'm not fearful,\" Shapiro said. \"I'm obviously emotional. I'm worried about my family. I want my kids to be OK. When we were in the State Dining Room last night, gathered with the community and family and friends, we told the story of Passover, and it's a story of going from bondage, from slavery, into freedom. I think it's an important story, both literally and figuratively, to tell, and I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempts to put on me by attacking us, as they did here last night. I refuse to let anyone who had evil intentions like that stop me from doing the work that I love, stop me from being a leader of this commonwealth and looking out for all Pennsylvanians. I will not be deterred in my work, and I will not be afraid to do that work.\"",
      "Pennsylvania State Police Troop H is investigating the fire, which they said caused significant damage to a portion of the home. State police encourages anyone with information related to the fire to call 1-800-4PA TIPS (1-800-472-8477).",
      "The Governor's Residence was built on the Susquehanna River and is described as a 29,000-square-foot Georgian-style home designed by architect George Ewing.",
      "The home has housed eight governors and their families, according to the state's website.",
      "Shapiro spoke with FBI Director Kash Patel and said he promised all the resources necessary for the investigation.",
      "\"Lori and I are overwhelmed by the prayers and the messages of support that we've received from all across Pennsylvania and all across the United States,\" an emotional Shapiro said. \"We've heard from our fellow governors and first spouses. We've heard from several of the former governors of Pennsylvania. Heard from so many friends and loved ones. We've heard from so many caring citizens of this great commonwealth. I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light. We appreciate the light that you have shined upon us.\"",
      "Who is Cody Balmer, and how did he enter the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence?",
      "Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said that Balmer climbed over a fence and \"evaded troopers\" while they were searching for him on the property before the fire.",
      "Bivens said that Balmer broke into the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence and set the fire with a homemade incendiary device.",
      "It's unclear if Balmer knew the layout of the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence, but he was inside the house for less than one minute, according to Bivens.",
      "\"That's all part of the ongoing investigation. In terms of the layout, I will tell you that he clearly had a plan,\" Bivens said. \"He was very methodical in his approach and moved through it without a lot of hurry, again, in a very methodical, planned manner, and carried it out, although in a very short period of time.\"",
      "A security review is currently underway to find out how Balmer was able to enter and then exit the property after allegedly setting the fire. There will also be extra security around Shapiro and the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence following the incident, officials said.",
      "Pennsylvania leaders respond after Governor's Residence fire",
      "Leaders from the commonwealth and surrounding areas posted statements on social media about the fire, the Shapiro family's safety and the emergency crews' response.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, Attorney General Dave Sunday praised the first responders for their quick actions and said his office \"stands ready with any resources needed to find the culprit of this senseless act of violence.\"",
      "Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge posted on\u00a0social media\u00a0that he and his wife are thankful the Shapiro family made it out safely, saying, \"The images showing the damage to the home we lived in with our children for nearly eight years are heartbreaking.\" Another former commonwealth leader, Gov. Mark Schweiker, called the fire, which state police are investigating as arson, a \"despicable act of cowardice.\"",
      "Lt. Gov. Austin Davis posted his sentiments on\u00a0social media, writing in part, \"I won't speculate on motivations, but I will say that targeting elected officials and their family members with violence is never acceptable.\"",
      "Democratic Speaker of the Pennsylvania House Rep. Joanna McClinton\u00a0said in part, \"cowardly acts of violence meant to stoke fear have no place in our commonwealth.\"",
      "New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim additionally condemned the fire,\u00a0writing, \"Violence can never be tolerated.\"",
      "Philadelphia City Council President Kenyatta Johnson said in a statement: \"On behalf of all of the members of Philadelphia City Council, we are all happy that Governor Josh Shapiro and his family are safe after the heinous act of arson.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-trump-tariffs-13-04-2025/",
    "published": "Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:00:24 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's approvals on economy and inflation dip, as Wall Street has one of its most volatile weeks in recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Amid a tumultuous week in the markets, the outlook on President Trump's trade and tariff policy hinges not just on what Americans think will happen, but when.",
      "People split on whether they believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan, and most don't think the tariffs will be permanent \u2014 rather that he's using them to negotiate. More like his goals regarding\u00a0trade policy than his approach to it. For those who think he does have a plan \u2014 predominantly, Republicans \u2014 it'll take months or longer to judge the impact. Republicans stand apart from the public overall in showing that patience.",
      "But in the short term, a big majority of Americans think new tariffs are going to raise prices, and many think that's the case in the long term, too. So, an inflation-weary public is bracing for that to hit their bottom line: a growing number think Trump's policies are making them financially worse off, not better, and most think that tariffs will make the economy worse more immediately, too.",
      "In turn, Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative.",
      "Either way one lasting impression may be this: in the public mind it is Donald Trump's economy now. A majority say his policies, not Joe Biden's, are responsible for it.",
      "Views about the potential impact on prices are especially important in this context because in recent years inflation has consistently been a top concern for Americans, and it is still a top way people evaluate their finances and the economy.",
      "Opinion is more mixed on how tariffs might impact U.S. manufacturing jobs: it is mostly Republicans who believe they will lead to more jobs.",
      "Trump's trade policies",
      "In all, more people say they like Trump's goals with tariff and trade policy than like his approach.",
      "And new tariffs continue to get net negative \u2014 but very partisan splits \u2014 in support.",
      "As does the view on whether or not Trump has a plan, where almost all Republicans say so.",
      "Most Americans don't think the tariffs will stay \u2014 they think Mr. Trump is using them for negotiations and will remove them later. Republicans especially think that \u2014 and it's related to how they view the long-term impact on prices.",
      "Despite many anticipating short-term price increases, Republicans and most independents say judging Trump's trade policies will take at least a few months to evaluate, while Democrats are more ready to evaluate them sooner.",
      "Support for tariffs is also connected to who people think they'll help or hurt. Either way large numbers think the wealthy and corporations will benefit. Those in favor see the middle and working class benefitting too.",
      "Trump's job handling",
      "When Mr. Trump was entering office, a sizable four in 10 Americans thought he'd make them financially better off \u2014 it was a key reason he won the election. That changed in March, with more seeing the impact as worse, and now that worsening view has continued today.",
      "The market was volatile this week while the poll was being conducted, but overall more Americans said Mr. Trump's policies were making the market go down.",
      "In all, the trend is for sliding ratings for Mr. Trump on handling the economy, handling inflation, and overall. (That overall number is down from its high at the start, but still higher than anything he had in his first term.)",
      "Some of the change in Mr. Trump's overall approval has come from independents disapproving more.",
      "As has been the case, Mr. Trump gets better marks for handling immigration than either the economy and inflation.",
      "Impacting the economy",
      "Ultimately, every president's policies put their stamp on the U.S. economy. In political terms, most of the public considers this Donald Trump's economy now: the majority view his policies (not Joe Biden's) as mostly responsible for the way things are today. And combined, three-quarters assign him at least shared impact.",
      "Here's another way Mr. Trump is a central figure in the economy: given a list of reasons why they might think the economy is either good or bad, in either case, sizable numbers give Mr. Trump as a reason. For the large majority who think it's bad, prices and general lack of confidence are top reasons, along with Donald Trump specifically. Those who think the economy is good \u2014 a group that includes a lot of Republicans \u2014 list Mr. Trump, along with general confidence, and the job market.",
      "Polarization also plays a role in a difference between people's assessments now and their outlook. In the last few weeks, their collective outlook has changed a little more.",
      "First, views about their own outlook for the economy got a little worse, with fewer expecting it to hold steady and more expecting a recession.",
      "And a slight majority of Americans \u2014 and slightly more than last month \u2014 said they think the economy is getting worse. That came from Democrats, as most Republicans say it's getting better. (Separately, in a different study, the consumer confidence index slipped in April.)",
      "Meanwhile, current views of the U.S. economy have been majority negative for years and still are. More Republicans are calling it good now, a partisan effect we often see over the years when the White House changes hands. And Republicans say that's in part due to their confidence in general and because of Donald Trump in particular. Those Republicans pushed the overall economy rating up a bit, even as Democrats and independents rated it worse.",
      "Partisan differences on trade \u2014 how the base sees it",
      "We can see more into Mr. Trump's support from the GOP base by where people go for trusted information about the tariffs and their impact: for Republicans, they trust Trump \"a lot\" for that information, far more than they do Wall Street or business leaders in general.",
      "Along with economics and jobs, Republicans also see tariffs and trade as a matter of fairness and patriotism.",
      "And most Republicans don't want Congress involved, even though it's a Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats and independents, who are less supportive of tariffs, likely for pragmatic reasons would call for more congressional involvement to stop them.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,410\u00a0 U.S. adults interviewed between April 8-11, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

      "U.S. trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer said Sunday that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping \"don't have any plans\" to speak amid an escalating trade war between the two countries.",
      "\"Since April 2, we have this at the leaders level, and at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them,\" Greer said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "In what Mr. Trump dubbed \"Liberation Day\" on April 2, the president announced that the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, along with higher, \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on U.S. exports. Then, shortly after the tariffs went into effect, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs after U.S. and global financial markets plunged. At the same time, the president said he would increase the tariff rate on goods imported from China to 125%. A 20% fentanyl tariff brings Mr. Trump's universal tariffs on China to a total of 145%.",
      "China said Friday that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125% in response, arguing in a statement that the U.S. imposition of the levies violates international economic and trade rules, while also calling the rising tariffs a \"joke.\"",
      "Despite questions swirling about how the lower the temperature between the two countries, Greer insisted that the president is working to reshore American manufacturing and trade as part of a broader global issue. Greer said \"the only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate.\"",
      "\"So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, 'we want to negotiate with the Americans,'\" Greer said. \"And the Chinese made a different decision \u2026 It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.\"",
      "The trade representative said when asked whether the U.S. is prepared for the possibility that China could sell assets it holds in the United States that the issue is \"we've become so dependent on China\" and haven't had fair market access for decades.",
      "\"We see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well. So it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves,\" Greer said, adding that \"we obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.\"",
      "When asked what happens after the 90-day pause, and whether the period given enough time to negotiate with 70 countries, Greer said conversations have been underway since before the tariffs were announced, \"because everyone knew tariffs were coming.\"",
      "\"The reality is, we're working around the clock, day and night, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States,\" Greer said.",

      "Before April 2, I had a conversation with my counterpart, and others did since April 2. We have this at the leaders level. And, at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China holds about $1.5 trillion in assets in this country. About half of them are U.S. treasuries.",
      "In the past, you've talked \u2013 you've spoken about strategic decoupling from China and acknowledged it would cause some short-term pain. Are you trying to get China to sell some of those assets? Is that part of your goal as well?",

And so \u2013 so again, we see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well.",
      "So, it's not \u2013 it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves. We obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, last Friday, late in the day, the administration published some exceptions to the tariffs on countries including China with smartphones, computers, electronics and machines that make semiconductor computer chips.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But now those high-tech items are given these exceptions. So, is the goal still to move electronics manufacturing to the United States?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We certainly need to have semiconductors and the downstream electronics supply chain move to the United States.",
      "What happened is \u2013 it's not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it. What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime, where we have studies ongoing for pharmaceuticals, for semiconductors, metals, et cetera.",
      "So, it's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring. They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But those tariffs aren't in place?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they are exempt from them.",

      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I would just disagree with that, Margaret.",
      "We have two different tariff programs. You have the global reciprocal tariff getting at the trade deficit, and you have critical sector national security tariffs, where we \u2013 we have tariffs in place on auto, steel and aluminum, and we have them coming on semiconductors in the supply chain, pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, et cetera.",
      "They're just different approaches to do it. We have to be much more deliberate about the semiconductor supply chain\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026 because we don't even import semiconductors, as such, that much, right? They go into downstream products. So, we have to be very careful. And we want the whole supply chain here, not just one product.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president said on Monday he'd be much more specific. Will we see those sectoral tariffs announced?",
      "I mean, he \u2013 he's saying he's already putting big tariffs on pharma. You're telling me that there's going to be an investigation into it. That's something that sounds like it's far in the future. What \u2013 what time frame are we talking about?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, you have \u2013 for the national security tariffs, you have to do an investigation in order to impose the tariffs. That's just legal process. That's \u2013 that's how we do it. That's how it's done for steel, aluminum, autos, et cetera.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you've decided the outcome.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026. investigations for those.",
      "No, we have not. We have not. That's why they're exempt. That's why they're \u2013 you know, they don't have a tariff covered right now, because you have to go through the investigation to determine the outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Is it\u2026",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff on that, but we have to go through the investigation, figure out what's appropriate. And that \u2013 and that's a Commerce Department function to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "I understand you and the Treasury secretary are going to be meeting on the 17th of \u2013 of the month with Japanese officials to talk about the potential of a trade deal. I have been told you've been looking at some of these non- tariff barrier issues that the United States sees problems with in current \u2013 including their currency.",
      "Are you asking governments to do things like that, not just, you know, to buy into America, but to actually change their own currency and change, like, their central bank policy?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So, our view, Margaret, is that currency manipulation or misalignment, whatever you want to call it, that can have a negative impact on U.S. exporters and unfairly advantage foreign exports into the United States.",
      "In the USMCA and in the Japan-China \u2013 the Japan-U.S. deal from the first Trump term, we had chapters with the parties committing not to do currency manipulation. You know, the Treasury Department has a statute to avoid that. So we certainly are in these kinds of discussions with these countries to see if they're willing to make these types of commitments as well, as have been done in other contexts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty big ask.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, the Japanese agreed to it in the first Trump term.",
      "The Canadians and the Mexicans agreed to it. This is something that periodically has \u2013 has happened over the years. Countries have had to revalue to make sure they aren't giving artificial competition \u2013 you know, artificial competitive advantage to their exports.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I mean, it's a big ask because we're in a \u2013 we're in a nefarious situation.",
      "We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit that Biden left us with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: It's the highest in human history. And currency is certainly part of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but \u2013 but I say it's a big ask because it takes time to negotiate. It could take you longer than 90 days, right?",
      "So, does that mean this 90-day reprieve could continue to be renewed? I mean, do you know what happens at the end of 90 days? Is that the amount of time you have to negotiate deals with the 70 countries the White House says are calling?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I'm \u2013 I'm considering that we have 90 days. Before April 2, we were already having many talks with other countries, because everyone knew tariffs were coming.",
      "This was \u2013 this was not some secret. Everyone knew. And so we already were in conversations with several countries. You know, it's going to be up to these countries to come to the table, continue coming to the table, and make these kinds of offers.",
      "I mean, the reality is, we're working around the clock day and night, you know, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But 90 days could be a rolling deadline, is what I hear you saying?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I \u2013 I would not say that. In the president's Cabinet meeting last week, he was asked about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And he said, well, we'll see.",
      "I mean, my goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And I think we're going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, the president \u2013 I know you were testifying on \u2013 on the Hill when the president changed the policy on reciprocal tariffs.",
      "He said later to reporters that he didn't have access to lawyers when he made the announcement of the change in policy \u2013 quote \u2013 \"We wrote it up from our hearts. It was written from the heart.\"",
      "He said that a few times. Why doesn't the president have access to trade lawyers when he's announcing policy? These are massive policy shifts. I'm sure there's somebody who could have taken a call.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So that type of \u2013 that type of discussion had been happening for \u2013 for several days. He's talking about drafting the tweets. He drafted the tweet from his heart.",
      "But that kind of policy, that was always a possibility, and the order was drafted by lawyers to ensure that the president could modify the policy to further the underlying goals of the order.",
      "So \u2013 so lawyer \u2013 you know, trade lawyers like \u2013 like myself and a huge staff that works for me, White House Counsel, et cetera, they've all been involved from day one to give the president the kind of flexibility he needs to address the emergency he's declared that's \u2013 forms the basis for these tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Greer, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be watching what you get done.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI (President, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like two billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China.",
      "Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that.",
      "I just heard from an ag leader two days ago in Minnesota, who said that, even if there's a 10 percent tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China, because it's a competitive global market. It's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else.",
      "And so, in many sectors, whether it's a 10 percent tariff or 50 percent or 100 percent tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil, so looking to other suppliers, potentially.",
      "I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest.",
      "What makes you say that?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit.",
      "It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is, interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy.",
      "So, now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is, we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up.",
      "It could be that investors are saying, hey, there are other places we also want to invest, that it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people typically think of U.S. treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.",
      "So when the president says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the U.S. and around the world are trying to determine, what is the new normal in America?",
      "You know, I saw an interview on Friday where BlackRock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10-year treasury would go to a 5 percent yield. He just offered it as a possibility.",
      "We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for, where are these trade negotiations going to end up? Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5 percent treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100 percent determined by trade policy and fiscal policy.",
      "And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see. And, at the Fed, our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what \u2013 yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries.",
      "And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what you \u2013 what concerned you?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern.",
      "It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So, we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near-term ups and downs in the economy. But, ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the Central Bank's control. We cannot affect that.",
      "All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building and a house, those may raise prices.",
      "Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If \u2013 what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated.",
      "The question is, is it a one-time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one-time adjustment in prices, and nothing longer-term than that.",
      "So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation, because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs and a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until, what, May 7?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet.",
      "But, yes, obviously, we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer.",
      "But, obviously, this is the biggest \u2013 in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I have been at the Fed, except for March of 2020, when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy.",
      "And we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45 percent chance of recession.",
      "Is the risk that high, in your estimate?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: You know, it's really going to be determined by, is \u2013 are there quick resolutions? To your prior guest, are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners?",
      "The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and, hopefully, those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation. If everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time, that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself, setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices.",
      "And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: They are.",
      "I mean, obviously, the market participants are trying to grasp for, where is this all going to settle? And that's causing volatility as they're \u2013 as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: But markets are functioning. Transactions are happening. And so I anticipate that's going to continue.",

      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For more on our latest poll on how Americans are reacting to the Trump economic agenda, we're joined now by our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, President Trump put tariffs at the center of his campaign. Now he's enacting them. Is there support for what he's doing?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Like a lot of the way people look at investments, it depends on what you see as your goals and your time horizon. By which I mean, in the immediate we see three quarters of Americans think that tariffs will raise prices. At least in the short term. And a lot think in the long term, too. Now, they're sensitive to that because, as we've discussed for many years, inflation and prices are top concerns right?",
      "The second thing we see is an increase in the number of people who think that Donald Trump's policies now are making them financially worse off. And it's not just that movement, but it's the setup against expectations. Back at the start of his term a few months ago, a lot of people thought that his policies would make them financially better off. So, that's a big change.",
      "But now let me talk about the time horizon, because this applies to his political base, to Republicans, many of whom say, hold on a second, you can't evaluate this right now. You have to give it six months. You have to give it a year to see how his tariff and trade policies are going to play out.",
      "So, with that, they're much more supportive of tariffs and of his approach. They also think that he is just using this as a negotiating tactic. Most of them think that he's going to ultimately remove those tariffs, maybe when he gets what he wants. And so that's why you still see a lot of Republican support for all of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House had said it's not up for negotiation, but then President Trump said there is a negotiation, and that's where there's some of the confusion right now.",
      "But you did indicate the approval rating itself is under pressure. Where is that pressure centered?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, more people say that they like his goals with trade and tariff policies than his approach. And that approach part is weighing on his ratings for handling the economy, which are down, his ratings for handling inflation, tied to what I described about prices, which are also down.",
      "But look, the market, in the public mind, is not the economy. There's a -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not. The stock market isn't.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a pricing mechanism of the future of the economy.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Exactly. And it is an indicator, especially for people who say they have money, not just in the market, but that their finances are sensitive to what happens in the market. They're much less approving of his approach right now.",
      "But having said that, consider also jobs. The public is mixed on whether Trump's approach is going to lead to more manufacturing jobs. Republicans think it will. But again, that's kind of a long-term issue.",
      "Back to the politics for a second. You know, people often ask, when does a president own the economy? And right now this looks like Donald Trump's economy. A majority of people say it's his policies that are responsible, either way, good or bad, for how it is, not Joe Biden's. And that, of course, sets things up going forward.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from another state, Ohio.",
      "Good morning to you, Congressman.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to what's happening to Silicon Valley in just a moment on the trade and tech front. But, first off, I want to ask you, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, for any insight you might have on one of the announcements made late on Friday. The president authorized the U.S. military to take over a large swath of public land along the southern border, including in the state of California. And I understand that that means the Pentagon's budget can now be used for things like border security or potentially to even detain migrants in that area.",
      "Has Congress been briefed on these plans? Do you have any sense of what's happening?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We have not. And, Margaret, it's longstanding law that you can't use the military for domestic enforcement. It's a violation of the Constitution. I'm hopeful the Supreme Court would 9-0 rule that way, just like they've ruled that the deportation of Abrego (ph) was unconstitutional. But we have not heard any specifics of it, and it's blatantly against the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You there were talking about Maryland resident Abrego Garcia, who was detained and then sent to a prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court said that the Trump administration actually has to facilitate getting him back, but they didn't actually rule on whether he was a gang member or not. I mean the Justice Department can't substantiate it. But why did you bring up that specific case as proof of something?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it just shows that this administration is taking actions that are unconstitutional. Look, Vice President Vance said that the - Abrego was an M-13 gang member with no legal rights here. And the Supreme Court said, well, we don't know. And he does actually have legal rights.",
      "And so, similarly, you now have an administration that is using the military for domestic enforcement, which is illegal. And I believe that even this Supreme Court, a conservative Supreme Court, would rule it's unconstitutional.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Garcia, ICE said it was an administrative error that led to this man's arrest in the first place. It seems the Trump administration is saying it's now in the hands of the president of El Salvador, who will be at the White House this week. So, we will watch for developments on that space.",
      "But going back to the line of questioning here regarding Armed Services, we understand that the president sent his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to talk to Iranian officials over this past weekend. We don't know much, other than they're going to meet again. But in the meantime, the U.S. military has positioned as many as six B-2 bombers in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of aircraft that would carry a weapon that could be used to take out underground facilities for a nuclear program.",
      "Do you believe President Trump would need congressional approval to carry out a strike, even if it was just in support of Israel leading that attack on Iran?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Absolutely. And almost a third of our B-2 bombers are there.",
      "Look, it's unconstitutional what they're doing in Yemen. I said it was unconstitutional when Biden made those strikes. We - they need to come to Congress.",
      "And look, the president was elected by the American people to say, we don't want our tax dollars going for more bombing in the Middle East, for more wars in the Middle East. I think he's ignoring the base that actually elected him that does not want more of these strikes.",
      "In the case of Yemen, the Saudis had war there for almost ten years. And the - it didn't do anything to address the situation with the Houthis. The president campaigned on diplomacy. He hasn't seen that. And what we're seeing is escalation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see what the diplomacy he's attempting achieves in the near term.",
      "But let me ask you why you're out in Ohio talking to us this morning. I understand in the coming days you're also going to go to Connecticut, to Yale Law, on Tuesday. Are you trying to sort of troll Vice President Vance? And, if so, why?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, no. I mean the Cleveland City Club invited me to give a speech on the economy. And let's talk about these tariffs. I mean, they were chaotic and they were totally haphazard. So, you had Howard Lutnick on saying that we were going to bring manufacturing back, electronics manufacturing back to the United States. And they realized suddenly that that wasn't going to happen. Actually, the iPhone price would go up to $1,700 or $2,000. And, by the way, if that manufacturing moved, it would probably move to Malaysia or Vietnam.",
      "So, they suddenly reversed. They exempted all of electronics manufacturing, which is about a third of our trade deficit. And I'm here at the Cleveland City Club to say, if you want to have electronics manufacturing here, the way to do it is not blanket tariffs. You have to create an electronic manufacturing hub, the kind we did with the Chips Act. That means investing in tool engineering and workforce. It means having investment tax credits. It means having government buy things from the United States. The president has no plan of how to actually have high-end advance manufacturing in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the district you represent includes Silicon Valley. So, you must be hearing from some of these CEOs. Who are they lobbying, apparently successfully, to get these carve-outs?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think they're talking about sound economic policy. I mean it really would have been - they're talking to anyone they can at the White House. They're talking to anyone they can who has the president's ear. But what they're saying is pretty simple. First they're saying that Howard Lutnick, the screws and the screwing only is about 0.1 percent of an iPhone's cost. I mean you need to - the actual components are memory, are camera, are ram. I mean it's like you - I understand they have 19th century policies of McKinley, but they need to have a 21st century understanding of the economy.",
      "And then they're saying, OK, you really want to do this? The iPhone will cost $1,600 to $1,700 but we're not going to be able to bring it back to the United States. We'll go to India. We'll go to Malaysia. We'll go to Vietnam.",
      "And if you want to bring back the manufacturing to the United States, you have to invest in the workforce, you have to have some investment tax credit for the facilities, and you have to be able to buy the things we make in the United States.",
      "So, all I'm saying is, let's have sound economic policy. And, you know, I saw the poll earlier.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: This is not a hypothetical. This is not something the president will be able to spin. Either we're going to see new factories come, or we're not. And tariffs just aren't going to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we didn't get a clear answer on when these semiconductor tariffs are coming. But the administration argues they're in the pipeline and that, you know, China's not going to get a free pass when it comes to tech. What is that going to mean for your part of the country?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it's - again, they don't have any sense of when the tariff will come, when it won't come, and they're against the Chips Act. So, how are you going to - let's say you suddenly put tariffs on China. What it would mean is the production would move to other parts of the Asia. It still isn't going to come here unless you're financing those factories here, willing to buy here. Tariffs can be a tool used as a broader Hamiltonian industrial policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: And that's what I'm here in Ohio to talk about, which is, what is actually going to bring advanced manufacturing to this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "All right, Congressman Khanna, we'll be watching.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy claimed last week that the measles outbreak may be plateauing, but the highly contagious virus continues to spread mostly in unvaccinated people. And the CDC reports that the number of cases topped 700 in 2025 so far.",
      "The measles virus, which was once effectively eradicated here in America thanks to widespread vaccination, is now in two dozen states.",
      "We spoke Friday with Dr. Peter Marks, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine program, who was forced to resign last month as part of Kennedy's redesign of America's health policy. Our conversation began on the subject of the measles outbreak and the response by the Trump administration.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Kennedy spoke to my colleague, Dr. Jon LaPook, earlier this week following the death of a second unvaccinated child in Texas due to measles. Kennedy reiterated, people should get the MMR vaccine.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "DR. JON LAPOOK: What's the position, philosophically, of the federal government in terms of public health?",
      "ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (Health and Human Services Secretary): The federal's government's position, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But at - if - the - the government should not be mandating those.",
      "LAPOOK: Understand. But the -",
      "KENNEDY: You know, I've always said during my campaign and - and every part that - every public statement I've made, I'm not going to take people's vaccines away from them.",
      "LAPOOK: Right.",
      "KENNEDY: What I'm going to do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a sufficient endorsement?",
      "PETER MARKS (M.D., Former Director, FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research): As a public health professional, I'm going to tell you what an endorsement of the measles vaccine sounds like right now. If you can hear my voice right now and you have a child that is unvaccinated against measles, we have measles spreading it this country very significantly. You wouldn't put your child in a back seat of a car without being strapped into their car seat. You want to get your child vaccinated against measles so that they don't have a one in a thousand chance of dying from measles if they contract it. There is no reason to put your child at that risk because the vaccine does not cause death. It does not cause encephalitis. And it does not cause autism. So, that's what an endorsement sounds like. Just make the comparison.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That has to be extremely frustrating for you as someone who worked in the vaccine space for so long. You clearly feel that this is safe and effective and that not saying it clearly is endangering people. And I understand the frustration.",
      "PETER MARKS: Right. So, another way of - yes, no, exactly. Exactly. And - but - there's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks that to not use it is the equivalent of, again, throwing - I mean if you saw a child - if you saw a 15-month-old rolling around in the back seat of a car, you'd probably call child protective services.",
      "Now, I'm not saying we should have - we should order parents to do this because I don't want to get into the whole issue of mandates. But we should have a moral responsibility to protect our children against something that could potentially be life-threatening, particularly when it's spreading across the United States the way it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said there are people like you who can't speak freely. You can speak freely because you're no longer at the FDA?",
      "PETER MARKS: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying your former colleagues can't directly answer a question, they can't honestly answer a question and endorse a vaccine right now?",
      "PETER MARKS: I think it's challenging in this environment for some of them, but you'd have to ask them directly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "In your resignation letter you wrote of the measles outbreak, and what happens when confidence in science is undermined. You said it's clear truth and transparency are not desired by the secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.",
      "Did you ever speak to him about your concerns?",
      "PETER MARKS: So, just a matter of record, I never interacted with the secretary. I don't - I don't intend to engage on, you know, disputing any of that. If the administration can have me come and go, that's fine. The more important thing here is that we deal with the issue at hand, which is vaccine confidence is really important for this country and it's been undermined over and over again over the past years. And now we're seeing the result of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are saying here that the man running HHS doesn't take in information, wishes subservient confirmation of misinformation and lies. There's presumed outcomes, is what you're saying?",
      "PETER MARKS: I think that my words then spoke for itself. I don't need to belabor it here.",
      "You know, science is the pursuit of objective truth for the benefit of mankind. And those of us who believe in it, we - we take it very seriously. And it hurts us deeply when there are those who would undercut the name of science, undercut the very name of science because it's convenient for them to purvey lies.",
      "And that's just - it's not OK because at the end of the day I was so strongly affected by what happened last week with the death of a second child, that I actually - I actually used profanity with a reporter without - while - while I was on the record without realizing it, which is something I've never done. I really - I don't believe that we should be saying, well, these are people who believe that they shouldn't be vaccinated because my experience -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're from the Mennonite community.",
      "PETER MARKS: The Mennonite community.",
      "My experience is that if you meet people on their level, they generally will eventually come around.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Many parents probably know ASD diagnosis rates are on the increase in this country. The CDC says the current numbers are one in 36 American children. This is a huge - a very broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. There is no established cause.",
      "On Thursday, the HHS secretary, Kennedy, said he's got hundreds of scientists from around the world working on it, and he promised this.",
      "KENNEDY: By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be - we'll be able to eliminate those exposures.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That gives tremendous hope to a lot of people. Do you know anything about that ongoing research?",
      "PETER MARKS: I know a minimal amount of effort that's being - going on to try to relook at prior autism research. But I am not aware of what is being discussed there.",
      "I cared for leukemia patients for a significant number of years. Giving people false hope is something you should never do. It is absolutely - you could be incredibly supportive of people. But giving them false hope is wrong.",
      "If you just ask me, as a scientist, is it possible to get the answer to quickly? I don't see any possible way.",
      "And, remember, you're talking to the person who came up with Operation Warp Speed for vaccines. Autism is an incredibly complicated issue. So, we have the issue of diagnosis bias. We don't know how many of those cases are true, how much of this is true growth of autism, how much of this is just that we now have diagnostic criteria and we diagnose it more often.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of the United States said, something artificial is causing autism rates to go up. On Thursday he said, maybe you stop taking something. You stop eating something. Or maybe it's a shot. But something's causing it. Right after that, RFK appeared at - the HHS secretary appeared on Fox News and dismissed 14 studies that have shown no link between autism and vaccines. He said it is an epidemic.",
      "KENNEDY: Epidemics are not caused by genes. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So, we know that it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm. And we are going to identify it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there scientific evidence ruling out genetics as a cause of ASD?",
      "PETER MARKS: There is no - there's no scientific evidence ruling out genetics. In fact, there is data that had been published that say that genetics may contribute to autism. There are, obviously, data that can - that suggest that perhaps environmental factors may. But one has to be incredibly careful, incredibly careful about making associations between environmental factors and autism.",
      "There is a wonderful graphic that shows that Coca-Cola increase goes along with the increase in autism, but there's also a wonderful graphic that you can find online that shows that the increase in spending on organic food also goes along with the rise in autism false causality. Scientists do not want to find false causality. We want to find true causality.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It stood out to us that Secretary Kennedy has hired someone named David Geier to conduct analysis of the links between autism and vaccines. He was charged by the state of Maryland in 2011 with practicing medicine without a license. That was weeks after his father's medical license was suspended for putting autistic children at risk by giving them a hormone blocking agent.",
      "So, what should the public know or expect from the work that he will do for the U.S. government?",
      "PETER MARKS: So, all I can say is, I would not - he's - to the best of my knowledge, he's not had any training after college in any of the sciences that we value here.",
      "What I think we can expect is the expected, that there will be an association determined between vaccines and autism because it's already been determined. This is not how science is conducted.",

    "story": [
      "The former top vaccines official at the Food and Drug Administration criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for downplaying the deaths of unvaccinated children from measles, amid this year's record outbreak of the virus.",
      "\"To dismiss children's deaths due to infectious diseases that are preventable by vaccines as just expected or not a big deal, that's just not acceptable to me,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, in an interview airing Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Weekly measles cases have climbed to the highest levels seen in the U.S. since a 2019 wave of the virus, which had been the worst in decades. Three deaths have been linked to this year's measles outbreak, including two unvaccinated children in Texas.",
      "\"We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic,\" Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting.",
      "Kennedy also contrasted U.S. measles case numbers to Europe, where thousands more infections and dozens of deaths have been reported in recent months. Kennedy has also used the comparison as evidence that his response to the outbreak was a success.",
      "Marks criticized Kennedy's comparison, noting that Europe's figures \"includes Romania, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, other places that have less robust public health efforts than we do.\" He also said that \"even a single death in this country from measles, it's just\u2014 it's just not excusable.\"",
      "\"That's just not the right thing to do. We should be comparing our measles response now to what we accomplished during the first two decades of the 20th century, until the 2019 measles outbreak, which is, we shouldn't be having any deaths from measles,\" said Marks.",
      "Changes at the FDA",
      "Before he was ousted by Kennedy's aides, Marks was the director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which regulates vaccines and other medical products derived from living sources. He was also the architect of the Operation Warp Speed effort to speed the development of COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.",
      "He warned that it is now \"challenging in this environment\" for some of his former colleagues in the federal government to endorse vaccines.",
      "\"There's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks,\" Marks said.",
      "Days after Marks submitted his resignation letter, Kennedy implemented steep layoffs and forced resignations across the FDA, as part of a sweeping restructuring of the nation's health agencies.",
      "The cuts have forced federal health officials to confront difficult decisions, including over how to prioritize fewer food and drug safety inspections. Marks praised the remaining staff at the agency as \"heroes in public health\" who are \"struggling because there's a lot to be done.\"",
      "\"They keep tabs on the infections. They make sure that the vaccines that are coming in for approvals might work their way through. They make sure that outbreaks are investigated. Those people are continuing to do their job the best they possibly can,\" Marks said.",
      "Marks said the delay to an approval decision on Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to be greenlighted earlier this month by the FDA, was concerning. And he warned that his own ouster could signal a change to the agency's approach to vaccines.",
      "\"Why would you de-emphasize something that is so basic to public health,\" Marks said.",
      "\"Does a disservice to pseudoscience\"",
      "Marks said he never interacted directly with Kennedy as secretary. He also said he did not know much about the administration's efforts to reopen research into the repeatedly debunked theory that vaccines cause autism, amid broader plans to determine the cause of autism.",
      "Asked about Kennedy's claim that \"we know it is an environmental toxin\" causing autism, Marks said it was \"very rare for scientists to speak in absolutes.\" Kennedy has been criticized for years for claiming that vaccines cause autism, among a range of unfounded claims he has espoused about the danger posed by immunizations.",
      "\"Most things are not that black and white, and we don't speak in absolutes. Whereas pseudoscientists find it very easy to speak in absolutes because they're not actually looking to use science for the benefit of mankind, they're usually using science for their own benefit,\" he said.",
      "Marks said he was familiar with the past work of Dr. Mark Geier and his son, David Geier, who The Washington Post reported has been tasked by Kennedy this year to revisit a past Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"They have a firm and fixed notion that vaccines cause autism. So it's very hard for me to see how we're going to get to any other idea than vaccines cause autism,\" Marks said.",
      "Describing the work by Geier and his father as pseudoscience \"does a disservice to pseudoscience,\" Marks said.",
      "David Geier was fined by Maryland regulators for practicing medicine without a license, including for prescribing the drug Lupron to autistic children. Lupron is also used as a chemical castration drug for sex offenders.",
      "\"I don't know. I can't even conceive as a physician of how he thought that could be a good idea,\" said Marks.",

      "REP. RO KHANNA: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to what's happening to Silicon Valley in just a moment on the trade and tech front. But first off, I want to ask you, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, for any insight you might have on one of the announcements made late on Friday, the President authorized the US military to take over a large swath of public land along the southern border, including in the state of California. And I understand that that means the Pentagon's budget can now be used for things like border security or potentially to even detain migrants in that area. Has Congress been briefed on these plans? Do you have any sense of what's happening?",
      "REP. KHANNA: We have not. And Margaret, it's longstanding law that you can't use the military for domestic enforcement. It's a violation of the Constitution. I'm hopeful the Supreme Court would nine to zero rule that way, just like they've ruled that the deportation of Abrego was unconstitutional, but we have not heard any specific- specifics of it, and it's blatantly against the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, there, were talking about Maryland resident Abrego Garcia, who was detained and then sent to a prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court said that the Trump administration actually has to facilitate getting him back, but they didn't actually rule on whether he was a gang member or not. The Justice Department can't substantiate it. But why did you bring up that specific case as proof of something?",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, it just shows that this administration is taking actions that are unconstitutional. Look, Vice President Vance said that the- Abrego was an M-13 gang member with no legal rights here, and the Supreme Court said, well, we don't know, and he does actually have legal rights. And so similarly, you now have an administration that is using the military for domestic enforcement, which is illegal. And I believe that even this Supreme Court, a conservative Supreme Court, would rule it's unconstitutional.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Garcia, ICE said it was an administrative error that led to this man's arrest in the first place. It seems the Trump administration is saying it's now in the hands of the President of El Salvador, who will be at the White House this week. So we will watch for developments on that space. But going back to the line of questioning here regarding armed services, we understand that the President sent his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to talk to Iranian officials over this past weekend. We don't know much other than they're going to meet again, but in the meantime, the US military has positioned as many as six B-2 bombers in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of aircraft that would carry a weapon that could be used to take out underground facilities for a nuclear program. Do you believe President Trump would need congressional approval to carry out a strike, even if it was just in support of Iran- Israel leading that attack on Iran?",
      "REP. KHANNA: Absolutely, and almost a third of our B-2 bombers are there. Look, it's unconstitutional what they're doing in Yemen. I said it was unconstitutional when Biden made those strikes. We- they need to come to Congress. And look, the President was elected by the American people saying we don't want our tax dollars going for more bombing in the Middle East, for more wars in the Middle East. I think he's ignoring the base that actually elected him, that does not want more of these strikes with- in the case of Yemen, the Saudis had war there for almost 10 years, and though it didn't do anything to address the situation with the Houthis. The President campaigned on diplomacy. He hasn't done that, and what we're seeing is escalation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see what the diplomacy he's attempting achieves in the near term. But let me ask you, why you're out in Ohio talking to us this morning? I understand in the coming days, you're also going to go to Connecticut to Yale Law on Tuesday. Are you trying to, sort of, troll vice president Vance? And if so, why?",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, no, I mean, Cleveland City Club invited me to give a speech on the economy and- let's talk about these tariffs. I mean, they were chaotic, and they were totally haphazard. So you had Howard Lutnick on, saying that we were going to bring manufacturing back and- electronics manufacturing back to the United States, and they realized suddenly that that wasn't going to happen. Actually, the iPhone price would go up to 1700 or 2000 dollars. And by the way, if that manufacturing moved, it would probably move to Malaysia or Vietnam. So they suddenly reverse. They exempt all of electronics manufacturing, which is about a third of our trade deficit. And I'm here at the Cleveland City Club to say, if you want to have electronics manufacturing here, the way to do it is not blanket tariffs. You have to create an electronic manufacturing hub, the kind we did with the CHIPS Act. That means investing in tool engineering and workforce. It means having investment tax credits. It means having government buy things from the United States. The President has no plan of how to actually have high end advanced manufacturing in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the district you represent includes Silicon Valley. So you must be hearing from some of these CEOs. Who are they lobbying- apparently successfully, to get these carve outs.",
      "REP. KHANNA: I think they're talking about sound economic policy. I mean, it really would have been- they're talking to anyone they can at the White House. They're talking to anyone they can who has the President's ear. But what they're saying is pretty simple. First, they're saying that Howard Lutnick the screws and the screwing only is about 0.1% of an iPhone's cost. I mean, you need to- the actual components or memory or camera or RAM. I mean, it's like, I understand they have 19th century policies of McKinley, but they need to have a 21st century understanding of the economy. And then they're saying, okay, you really want to do this. The iPhone will cost 16 to 1,700 dollars but we're not going to be able to bring it back to the United States. We'll go to India, we'll go to Malaysia, we'll go to Vietnam. And if you want to bring back the manufacturing to the United States, you have to invest in the workforce, you have to have some investment tax credit for the facilities, and you have to be able to buy the things we make in the United States. So all I'm saying is, let's have sound economic policy. And I saw the poll earlier. This is not a hypothetical. This is not something the President will be able to spin. Either we're going to see new factories come or we're not, and tariffs just aren't going to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we didn't get a clear answer on when the semiconductor tariffs are coming, but the administration argues they're in the pipeline, and that, you know, China is not going to get a free pass when it comes to tech. What is that going to mean for your part of the country?",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, it's- again, they don't have any sense of when the tariff will come, when it won't come, and they're against the CHIPS Act. So how are you going to- let's say you suddenly put tariffs on China. What it would mean is the production would move to other parts of Asia. It still isn't going to come here, unless you're financing those factories here, willing to buy here. Tariffs can be a tool used as a broader Hamiltonian industrial policy, and that's what I'm here in Ohio to talk about, which is what is actually going to bring advanced manufacturing to this country.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Dr. Peter Marks, former head of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, a portion of which aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 13, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined by Dr. Peter Marks, who recently resigned as the FDA's top vaccine regulator. Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "DR. PETER MARKS: Thanks so much for having me today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about a number of things, but let's talk about one of the most immediate problems, and that is this measles outbreak. The CDC has now recommended additional measles shots for people traveling within the U.S., specifically to the states of Kansas and Texas due to record outbreaks. The guidance wasn't on the website, but it was told to local authorities, what do you make of that public health guidance?",
      "DR. MARKS: What I make of that is that we have enough spread of measles and some uncertainty in people's vaccination status that they're trying to make sure that people are as protected as they can be. Some people who were vaccinated, for instance, for a period in the early 60s, they may not be fully vaccinated in the extent that the vaccine was not as good back then. So sometimes we ask them to get revaccinated and additionally, some people don't know their vaccination status. So better to be safe than to put yourself at risk, because it is a very- it's one of the safer vaccines that we have. In fact, it is possibly characterized as among the safest vaccines that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The MMR vaccine.",
      "DR. MARKS: The MMR vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you just said something interesting. You said the- the composition of the shot was different years ago, the quality of it?",
      "DR. MARKS: It- it was- right, well, it was the quality of the shot that was being given, the potency, that's the strength of it. For a period of time for a few years in the early 60s was such that there are generally people in the period between about 1957 and 1967 if they got vaccinated against measles, they may want to ask their doctor if they should be revaccinated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I focus in on that, because the HHS Secretary said that the measles vaccine quote \"wanes,\" that was the word he used in effectiveness 4.5 percent each year, and that older people are essentially unvaccinated and unprotected. That's slightly different from what you're saying. Is what he characterized correct, because it does sound like you're saying older Americans might want to look into this.",
      "DR. MARKS: Older Americans- so first of all, if you were born before 1957 it's unlikely that you have to worry about this, because you almost certainly had the measles like I did. I wasn't born before 1957 but I had the measles just the same, okay. But if you were born before 1957 we don't worry about measles vaccination because it's assumed that people had the measles, and natural measles infection gives one pretty robust lifetime immunity. There's a period between 1957, 1967 some people say 1963, but to be generous we'll say 1967, when if you got the measles vaccine, you might want to check with your doctor. And then, since that time, though, the newer version of the measles vaccine, as long as you've had two doses of that vaccine, it's generally considered to provide lifetime protection, and we don't generally see people later in life getting measles. I mean, it's true, there are people who have immunocompromising conditions that may need to be revaccinated later in life. But in general, if you've had two doses of the measles vaccine, one doesn't need to get revaccinated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two doses, it's not wearing off is what you're saying.",
      "DR. MARKS: It's- well\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not waning?",
      "DR. MARKS: It's- it's not- so let's- let's be clear, many vaccines, the protection wanes over time, but there's a threshold effect, and as long as you're above that threshold in terms of protection, you're safe. And so by and large, when people have had two doses of the existing MMR vaccine that's used in the United States, they maintain, for all intents and purposes, lifetime immunity against measles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Kennedy spoke to my colleague, Dr. Jon LaPook earlier this week, following the death of a second unvaccinated child in Texas due to measles. Kennedy reiterated people should get the MMR vaccine. Take a listen.",
      "(TAKE VIDEO)",
      "DR. JON LAPOOK: What's the position philosophically of the federal government in terms of public health?",
      "HHS SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: The federal Government's position, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine, but if- the government should not be mandating those\u2013",
      "DR. JON LAPOOK: Understand, but the\u2013",
      "HHS SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: \u2013 I always said during my campaign and in every part, every public statement I've made: I'm not gonna take people's vaccines away from them. What I'm gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.",
      "(END VIDEO)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a sufficient endorsement?",
      "DR. MARKS: So I'm not going to comment to that, but I'm going to tell you as a public health professional. I'm going to tell you what an endorsement of the measles vaccine sounds like right now. If you can hear my voice right now, and you have a child that is unvaccinated against measles, we have measles spreading in this country very significantly. You wouldn't put your child in a back seat of a car without being strapped into their car seat. You want to get your child vaccinated against measles so that they don't have a one in a thousand chance of dying from measles if they contract it. There's no reason to put your child at that risk, because the vaccine does not cause death, it does not cause encephalitis and it does not cause autism. So a vaccine that is safe, yes, occasionally kids get fevers. If you don't keep the fevers down, about 15 in 100,000 will get a convulsion that happens once it goes away. But if you take their temperatures, keep it down, that's unlikely. And the other four or five side effects per 100,000 are ones that come and go. So, very safe vaccine that is going to potentially protect your child and save its life. And there's just- the issue here is we should love our children enough that if you care about your child, just like you'd strap them in that car seat, you're going to get them vaccinated with two doses of the measles vaccine. They will be well protected against this. Once you've had two doses of the measles vaccine, it's virtually unheard of that a child dies of measles. Three or four percent may get the measles, but it's not a life threatening illness, so it's really important to get vaccinated. Get your child vaccinated if you need to, you have questions, ask your pediatrician, ask your health care provider. If you have religious objections or issues, go to your clergy member, because most major religions actually understand how important vaccination is, and they will go ahead and tell you that it's okay to get vaccinated. So that's what an endorsement sounds like. Just make the comparison.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That has to be extremely frustrating for you. As someone who worked in the vaccine space for so long, you clearly feel that this is safe and effective, and that not saying it clearly is endangering people",
      "DR. MARKS: Yeah",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Am I understanding--",
      "DR. MARKS: So another way. Yes, No, exactly--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your frustration?",
      "DR. MARKS: Exactly. But there's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks that to not use it is the equivalent of, again, throwing- I mean, if you saw a child, if you saw a 15-month-old rolling around in the backseat of a car, you'd probably call Child Protective Services. Now, I'm not saying we should have, we should order parents to do this, because I don't want to get into the whole issue of mandates, but we should have a moral responsibility to protect our children against something that could potentially be life threatening, particularly when it's spreading across the United States the way it is. Just this week, we now have additional states that have been declared as outbreak states. That means they have at least three cases of measles in them. There are now seven states, the epicenter being obviously Texas, but now Indiana has an outbreak. Ohio has an outbreak. So you can see these are places that are very concerning, particularly because Ohio, Pennsylvania, these are states that have Amish populations, that typically have vaccination rates that are can be as low as in the low 20% range.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said there are people like you who can't speak freely. You can speak freely because you're no longer at the FDA.",
      "DR. MARKS: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying your former colleagues can't directly answer a question. They can't honestly answer a question and endorse a vaccine, right now?",
      "DR. MARKS: I think it's challenging in this environment for some of them, but you'd have to ask them directly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, in your resignation letter, you wrote of the measles outbreak, and what happens when confidence in science is undermined. You said it's clear truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies. Did you ever speak to him about your concerns?",
      "DR. MARKS: So just a matter of record, I never interacted with the secretary. I don't, I don't intend to engage on, you know, disputing any of that.its administration can have me come and go. That's fine. The more important thing here is that we deal with the issue at hand, which is vaccine confidence is really important for this country, and it's been undermined over and over again over the past years, and now we're seeing the result of this. By the way, it's not just measles. We had two deaths in Louisiana from whooping cough, which is caused by pertussis. Again, these are deaths that in under vaccinated or unvaccinated populations, we don't need to be seeing. And I don't buy the idea that we need to take a break from infectious diseases to deal with chronic diseases. We can do both. We are a great nation, and we should be able to do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is the current stated policy of the secretary. What you just said, looking more at chronic.",
      "DR. MARKS: You'll have to say whether it is or not. I can just tell you that, from my perspective, I think we have a broad enough public health enterprise to do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what you seem to be saying there, and I think it gets to the core of what scientists do is you're dealing in fact, and you are constantly questioning the evolution of the science and adjusting conclusions you need to be able to take in information. You are saying here that the man running HHS doesn't take in information, wishes subservient confirmation of misinformation and lies. There's presumed outcomes, is what you're saying.",
      "DR. MARKS: I think that my words then spoke for itself. I don't need to belabor it here. You know, science is the pursuit of objective truth for the benefit of mankind and those of us who believe in it, we we take it very seriously, and it hurts us deeply when there are those who would undercut the name of science, undercut the very name of science, because It's convenient for them to purvey lies. And that's just, it's not okay, because at the end of the day, I was so strongly affected by what happened last week with the death of a second child that I actually, actually used profanity with a reporter without while I was on the record without realizing it, which is something I've never done. I just- people who know me know that just I try to avoid it, and it just showed me how badly I was affected. Because even one death, even a single death in this country from measles, it's just it's not excusable. It's not, and a second death. And I really, I don't believe that we should be saying, well, these are people who believe that they shouldn't be vaccinated. Because my experience--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The Mennonite community.",
      "DR. MARKS: The Mennonite community. My experience is that if you meet people on their level, they generally will eventually come around. Because in generally, in every religious community, you eventually find someone who understands that part of that religious belief is that you don't harm those who can't help themselves. We are as adults, can take care of our children. And I think I don't have any problem of working on the faith level with people and telling them, look, you know, if you- let me try to answer all your medical questions, and if you're still left with faith issues that you know that you feel like God will provide for your child. Well, guess what, God provided me. I know about science. Science has provided us with these vaccines that can save your child's life. God helps those who help themselves. So we have to, we have to communicate better. I'm not- I'm the first to acknowledge that over the course of the past years, particularly during the COVID 19 pandemic, we could have communicated better as scientists. So you're not going to get any arguments with- from me on that. But right now, with this crisis, there is no reason why we should not as a country be making a full court press to get our measles vaccination rates above 90%, because otherwise we're not going to get this under control. And for those who can't, for those who really don't care about little babies dying or children dying, I'll tell you what will happen too, once we lose measles elimination status, we will then be forced, potentially, when we go overseas, to places in Europe which have achieved elimination status, we'll have to show little yellow cards showing that we have either immunity or been vaccinated against measles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Those little vaccination passports\u2013",
      "DR. MARKS: Right, those little passports yeah. Now, but, but, I mean, I'm, I'm embarrassed to even use that as a reason, because I couldn't care less. What I really care about is the fact that along the way of getting there, we will have more deaths.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I appreciate everything you're laying out there. I want to talk to you about some of what happened during COVID as well, but to follow up on- particularly the MMR vaccine. You know where I'm going next, the allegations of that specific vaccine and links to autism. Many parents probably know ASD diagnosis rates are on the increase in this country. The CDC says the current numbers are one in 36 American children. This is a huge- very broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. There's no established cause, but yesterday- on Thursday, the HHS Secretary, Kennedy, said he's got hundreds of scientists from around the world working on it, and he promised this.",
      "(TAKE VIDEO)",
      "HHS SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic, and we'll be- we'll be able to eliminate those exposures.",
      "(END VIDEO)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That gives tremendous hope to a lot of people. Do you know anything about that ongoing research?",
      "DR. MARKS: I know a minimal amount of effort that's being going on to try to relook at prior autism research, but I'm not aware of what is being discussed there. And I would just say the following- so I'm somebody who in my career as a physician taking care of patients- and there are people probably who are hearing me now who know that I cared for leukemia patients for a significant number of years. Giving people false hope is something you should never do. It is absolutely- you can be incredibly supportive of people, but giving them false hope is wrong--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Can you--",
      "DR. MARKS: Unless someone- unless somebody actually knows the answer or has a pretty good idea of the answer right now, or thinks they have a good idea of the answer, I don't see how one could have- as a scientist, I'm not speaking about anything. If you just ask me, as a scientist, is it possible to get the answer that quickly? I don't see any possible way. And remember, you're talking to the person who came up with Operation Warp Speed for vaccines. Autism is an incredibly complicated issue, so we have the issue of diagnosis bias. We don't know how many of those cases are true- how much of this is true growth of autism, how much of this is just that we now have diagnostic criteria and we diagnose it more often.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying- just to be clear here, because you hear Secretary Kennedy often compare rates now to when he was a child. What you are saying is that the broad array of things under that ASD umbrella has only widened, so it was a much narrower category than what it is now.",
      "DR. MARKS: Right. And I'm not denying that there could be environmental- and we know there are probably genetic features, there have been publications in scientific journals. There are genetic and environmental possibilities here, but the totality of all these interactions and sorting out this incredible complexity, to try to do that in six months time- my calculation of how many months it is till September, I don't- you can help do that, but six months time--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unless you're buying research from somebody else who's already in the midst of it?",
      "DR. MARKS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, is that credible way to come to a conclusion?",
      "DR. MARKS: He may be aware of a bunch of research that I'm not aware of, and that's why I'm going to be respectful here. I'd love- you know something? I just- I'd love to hear it presented. But the piece, though, that I will put to- put to you that I will not accept as a cause of autism is the MMR vaccine- or, for that matter, any of the other vaccines we use because we've studied them in so many millions of children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to- I want to come up to you specifically on this issue, because the President the United States said something artificial is causing autism rates to go up on Thursday, he said, maybe you stop taking something, you stop eating something, or maybe it's a shot, but something's causing it. Right after that, RFK appeared- the HHS Secretary, appeared on Fox News and dismissed 14 studies that have shown no link between autism and vaccines. He said it is an epidemic.",
      "(TAKE VIDEO)",
      "HHS SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: Epidemics are not caused by genes. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So we know that it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm, and we are going to identify it.",
      "(END VIDEO)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there scientific evidence ruling out genetics as a cause of ASD?",
      "DR. MARKS: There's no- there's no scientific evidence ruling out genetics. In fact, there's data that have been published that say that genetics may contribute to autism. There are obviously data that can- that suggest that perhaps environmental factors may, but one has to be incredibly careful- incredibly careful about making associations between environmental factors and autism. There's a wonderful graphic that shows that Coca-Cola increase goes along with the increase in autism. But there's also a wonderful graphic that you can find online that shows that the increase in spending on organic food also goes along with the rise in autism. False causality. Scientists do not want to find false causality. We want to find true causality. And maybe, let's say this- those of us who- many of the people at FDA are like me, we've spent six years- I spent six years after getting a college degree, getting an MD and a PhD. I spent six years after that training in internal medicine and getting- doing a fellowship in in hematology oncology so that I have three board certifications. After that, I worked in academic medicine, in industry and in government on really focusing on human health. We have a pretty good sense of science. And so the question is, I hope that people, at least when they're listening me today, find me a credible witness to say that if I'm telling you that- you know it's hard to trust people that you see on TV, but if you're hearing my voice, I hope I'm a credible witness in support of the science behind the benefit and risk- particularly for the MMR vaccine, but it's true for vaccines in general.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said there may be environmental factors, environmental toxins. He said, \"We know it is an environmental toxin.\" How can you know it if the study is ongoing?",
      "DR. MARKS: I'm not going to engage again with Mr. Kennedy on this, but I'm going to tell you how science works. Science, when it's done as it- at its best, is keeping an open mind to all the possibilities. I don't know about this, with a large number of cases we have, for sure what causes- and that's because I'm not an expert in autism. And at least the people I talk to are also wondering and and trying to look at all the different possibilities of environmental, genetic, and it could be one or the other or interactions, but I don't think anybody has that knowledge that they can speak dispositively like that. People who don't know science, people who don't know how science works, people who want to control other people by pseudoscience \u2013 they talk in absolute terms. But you will- the way you detect a true scientist from a pseudo scientist is because it's very rare for scientists to speak in absolutes. There are some absolutes. If I take this mug and drop it now, I know that gravity is going to make it fall to the ground, and it's going to probably break and make a mess in the studio. On the other hand, most things are not that black and white, and we don't speak in absolutes. Whereas pseudoscientists find it very easy to speak in absolutes because they're not actually looking to use science for the benefit of mankind, they're usually using science for their own benefit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You spoke about credentials, it stood out to us that Secretary Kennedy has hired someone named David Geier to conduct analysis of the links between autism and vaccines. He was charged by the state of Maryland in 2011 with practicing medicine without a license. That was weeks after his father's medical license was suspended for putting autistic children at risk by giving them a hormone blocking agent. So what should the public know or expect from the work that he will do for the U.S. government?",
      "DR. MARKS: So all I can say is I would not concede- he's to the best of my knowledge, he's not had any training after college in any of the sciences that we value here. What I think we can expect is the expected: that there will be an association determined between vaccines and autism, because it's already been determined. This is not how science is conducted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying there's a preconceived notion he's going into the study with is what you're saying.",
      "DR. MARKS: I know the body of evidence that his- his father, who recently passed away, and I know what Mr. Geier has written in the past, that they have a firm and fixed notion that vaccines cause autism. So it's very hard for me to see how we're going to get to any other idea than vaccines cause autism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll watch for the outcome of his research, but it could have impact, clearly, on vaccines, and uptake of them or faith in them.",
      "DR. MARKS: Yeah. So I just I- I- I think, as someone who believes in the strength of our country, our strength is that we remain healthy as a nation. And we will be less healthy as a nation if we don't take advantage of vaccines, and our adversaries will laugh at us, because I sincerely doubt that countries like China will actually sit around and- and think that, you know, oh, we should have doubt about measles vaccine. They know that measles vaccine works, and they're going to have their populations vaccinated. I would also say to you one other thing, while I have a moment on measles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "DR. MARKS: To compare our numbers of measles cases to the WHO Europe region, which includes Romania, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, other places that have less robust public health efforts than we do, is just- that's just not the right thing to do. We should be comparing our measles response now to what we accomplished during the first two decades of the 20th century, until the 2019 measles outbreak, which is, we shouldn't be having any deaths from measles. We shouldn't be- I have had this problem with several individuals--and this is the closest you'll get me to a statement that may be a little bit out there--to dismiss children's deaths due to infectious diseases that are preventable by vaccines as just expected or not a big deal, that's just not acceptable to me. I've watched in my life close family members, two children who have died of parents- those parents were broken. They were broken for years, and it's bringing tears to my eyes right now. No family should have to lose a child. Even- I- I feel for the families in Texas, even those that feel that they did the right thing by not giving their child the measles vaccine because God wanted it, I feel for them, because they needlessly lost a child.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are more vaccines your colleagues at the FDA are still working on. I want to ask you about the Novavax COVID vaccine approval. It was delayed. Do you know of any reason why the FDA shouldn't be approving this COVID vaccine?",
      "DR. MARKS: So I really can't speak about matters that are still under- under consideration by the agency that I was involved in, but I would say that the fact that we haven't heard anything about it- because normally, by the goal date for these we're supposed to hear about them, it's concerning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Concerning to you because you think there may be a change in our government's approach to vaccine approval going forward?",
      "DR. MARKS: I guess on a larger scale, stepping back from any particular vaccine. I think just the fact that I was let go is a concern to me. I think- I hope that it wasn't because of my work on cell tissue gene therapies and on modernizing the blood donation policies that someone thought I did something wrong. I suspect--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would they think that?",
      "DR. MARKS: I don't know, I don't know, but I suspect it was because we wanted to- there was a distinct change in how the approach to vaccines would be. And I- I understand that it's a- it's a choice, potentially, that we want to focus more on chronic diseases today. But this is like, you know, why would you- why would you de-emphasize something that is so basic to public health? It's like me telling you, you know, don't bother anymore separating where you get your drinking water from, from where you put your sewage. You would never do that, right? Because that's going back 300 years when it was figured out that you shouldn't do- do that. Why would we go back to putting our children at risk? Remember that- remember that in the- in the 18th century, in places around the globe, 10% of people- 10% of people, died of smallpox because they got it at some point in their life. There were populations where it was 5%, populations 20%. We don't know what smallpox is anymore. Why? Because of vaccines. And anyone who tries to tell you that it was public health or sanitation or the virus just got tired out, all they need to do is- is look at how robust that virus is to know that the only reason why it's not here is because of vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There have been massive personnel cuts to many federal agencies, particularly in the public health space. It's about 10,000, I believe more than 3,000 at the FDA itself. What does the public need to know about the impact of those cuts?",
      "DR. MARKS: It's- I think what I can comment on is that the people that are left behind are going to do their best to maintain the public health, okay? They're struggling because there's a lot to be done. But they are heroes. I- you know, the people who are the heroes in public health are the everyday people who come in every day. They keep tabs on the infections. They make sure that the vaccines that are coming in for approvals might- work their way through. They make sure that outbreaks are investigated. Those people are continuing to do their job the best they possibly can. And it's my hope that, you know, things organize appropriately.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Peter Marks, thank you for your time.",
      "DR. MARKS: Thanks so much.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For more, we go to United States Trade Representative, Ambassador. Jamieson Greer. Good morning to you, Mr. Ambassador.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Good morning, Margaret, how are you?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well. I'm hoping you can give us some news of movement on this clash. Is the Trump administration opening any kind of channel to Beijing right now? Are there any plans for presidents Trump and Xi to speak?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Right now, we don't have any plans on that. This issue is truly at the leaders level. Before April 2, I had a conversation with my counterpart, and others did since April 2. We have this at the leaders' level, and at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China holds about one and a half trillion dollars in assets in this country, about half of them are U.S. Treasuries. In the past, you've talked- you've spoken about \"strategic decoupling from China\" and acknowledged it would cause some short-term pain. Are you trying to get China to sell some of those assets? Is that part of your goal as well?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: That's not part of this plan. President Trump has a global program to try to reshore American manufacturing and address the trade deficit. It's a global issue. The only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate. So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, we want to negotiate with the Americans, and the Chinese made a different decision. So, it's not a plan to do that. It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you prepared for China to consider selling assets it holds in the United States, and do you want that to happen?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, remember, China has been selling off Treasuries for some time. It's not a- it's not a brand-new development. You know, the Treasuries market will fluctuate. You know, I'm not the Treasury Secretary, so I'm not the best poised to talk about that. But I think the issue is we've become so dependent on China, and for so many decades, we haven't had fair market access. And so- so again, we see China taking action, implementing their policy, to try to be less tied up with us as well. So, it's not- it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves. We obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So last Friday, late in the day, the administration published some exceptions to the tariffs on countries, including China, with smartphones, computers, electronics and machines that make semiconductor computer chips. Last Sunday on this program, the Commerce Secretary told us the tariffs are part of a strategy to bring high tech factories to the US. Take a listen.",
      "(START SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The army of millions and millions of human beings, screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones. That kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated and great Americans, the tradecraft of America, is going to fix them, is going to work on them\u2026.. Our high school educated Americans, the core to our workforce, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America, to work on these high-tech factories.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But now those high-tech items are given these exceptions. So, is the goal still to move electronics manufacturing to the United States?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: We certainly need to have semiconductors, and the downstream electronics supply chain move to the United States. What happened is- it's not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it. What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime, where we have studies ongoing for pharmaceuticals, for semiconductors, metals, et cetera. So, it's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring. They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But those tariffs aren't in place?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER:\u00a0 That's right.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So, they are exempt from them?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER:\u00a0 -- that is- that is subject to study by the Commerce Department. For now, they're subject to a 20% tariff. They're subject to a 20% tariff that's on China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Commerce Secretary was on another network this morning, and he said semiconductors are, \"exempt from reciprocal tariffs,\" but that won't be a permanent sort of exemption. Here's what you told my colleague, Nicole Killion, April 8.",
      "[START SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "NIKOLE KILLION: Why aren't there any exemptions with some of these tariffs, sir?",
      "GREER: The President decided that we're not going to have exemptions. We can't have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we're facing.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying the carve outs are temporary, but isn't that still the Swiss cheese situation you said you were trying to avoid?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: I would just disagree with that, Margaret. We have two different tariff programs. You have the global reciprocal tariff getting at the trade deficit, and you have critical sector national security tariffs, where we- we have tariffs in place on auto, steel and aluminum, and we have them coming on semiconductors in the supply chain, pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, et cetera. They're just different approaches to do it. We have to be much more deliberate about the semiconductor supply chain, because we don't even import semiconductors as such that much, right? They go into downstream products. So, we have to be very careful. And we want the whole supply chain here, not just one product.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the President said on Monday, he'd be much more specific. Will we see those sectoral tariffs announced? I mean, he- he's saying he's already putting big tariffs on pharma. You're telling me that there's going to be an investigation into it. That's something that sounds like it's far in the future. What- what time frame are we talking about?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, you have- for the National Security tariffs, you have to do an investigation in order to impose the tariffs. That's just legal process. That's- that's how we do it. That's how it's done for steel, aluminum, autos, etc--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you've decided the outcome.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: -- investigations for those. No, we have not. We have not. That's why they're exempt- that's why they're, you know, they don't have a tariff covered right now, because you have to go through the investigation to determine the outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Is it--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: -- We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff on that, but we have to go through the investigation, figure out what's appropriate, and that- and that's a Commerce Department function to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. I understand you and the Treasury secretary are going to be meeting on the 17th of- of the month with Japanese officials to talk about the potential of a trade deal. I've been told you've been looking at some of these non-tariff barrier issues that the United States sees problems with, in current- including their currency. Are you asking governments to do things like that, not just, you know, to buy into America, but to actually change their own currency and change, like their central bank policy?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So, our view, Margaret, is that currency manipulation or misalignment, whatever you want to call it, that can have a negative impact on U.S. exporters and unfairly advantage of foreign exports into the United States. ln the USMCA and in the Japan- China- the Japan-U.S. deal from the first Trump term, we had chapters with the parties committing not to do currency manipulation. You know, the Treasury Department has a statute to avoid that. So we certainly are in these kinds of discussions with these countries to see if they're willing to make these types of commitments as well (INAUDIBLE)--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty big ask.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, the Japanese agreed to it in the first Trump term. The Canadians and the Mexicans agreed to it. This is something that periodically has- has happened over the years. Countries have had to revalue to make sure they aren't giving artificial competition- you know, artificial competitive advantage to their exports. I mean, it's a big ask, because we're in a- we're in a nefarious situation. We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit that Biden left us with. It's the highest in human history. And currency certainly part of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but I say it's a big ask because it takes time to negotiate. It could take you longer than 90 days, right? So, does that mean this 90-day reprieve could continue to be renewed? Do you know what happens at the end of 90 days is that the amount of time you have to negotiate deals with the 70 countries the White House says are calling?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, I'm considering that we have 90 days before April 2. We were already having many talks with other countries, because everyone knew tariffs were coming. This was- this was not some secret everyone knew. And so, we already were in conversations with several countries. You know, it's going to be up to these countries to come to the table, continue coming to the table and make these kinds of offers. I mean, the reality is, we're working around the clock, day and night, you know, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But 90 days could be a rolling deadline, is what I hear you saying?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, I- I would not say that. In the President's Cabinet meeting last week, he was asked about this, and he said, well, we'll see. I mean, my goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days, and I think we're going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, the president, I know you were testifying on- on the Hill when the president changed the policy on reciprocal tariffs. He said later to reporters that he didn't have access to lawyers when he made the announcement of the change in policy. Quote, \"we wrote it up from our hearts. It was written from the heart.\" He said that a few times. Why doesn't the president have access to trade lawyers when he's announcing policy? These are massive policy shifts. I'm sure there's somebody who could have taken a call.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: So that type of- that type of discussion had been happening for- for several days. He's talking about drafting the tweets. He drafted the tweet from his heart. But that kind of policy, that was always a possibility, and the order was drafted by lawyers to ensure that the President could modify the policy to further the underlying goals of the order. So- so lawyer- you know, trade lawyers like- like myself and a huge staff that works for me, White House Counsel, et cetera, they've all been involved from day one to give the President the kind of flexibility he needs to address the emergency he's declared that's forms the basis for these tariffs.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 13, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like 2 billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China. Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country?",
      "KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that. I just heard from an ag Leader two days ago in Minnesota who said that even if there's a 10% tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China because it's a competitive global market, it's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else. And so in many sectors, whether it's a 10% tariff or 50% or 100% tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yep, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil. So looking to other suppliers, potentially. I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest. What makes you say that?",
      "KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit. It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy. So now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up. It could be that investors are saying, 'Hey, there are other places we also want to invest.' That it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So people typically think of US Treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. So when the President says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did?",
      "KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the US and around the world are trying to determine what is the new normal in America. You know, I saw an interview on Friday where Blackrock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10 year treasury would go to a 5% yield. He just offered it as a possibility. We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for where are these trade negotiations going to end up. Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5% treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100% determined by trade policy and fiscal policy. And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see and at the Fed. Our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries. And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what, what concerned you?",
      "KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern. It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near term ups and downs in the economy, but ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the central bank's control. We cannot affect that. All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building in the house, those may raise prices. Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If, what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up.",
      "KASHKARI: Well there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated. The question is, is it a one time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one time adjustment in prices and nothing longer term than that. So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs in a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until what, May 7?",
      "KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet. But obviously we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy, January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer. But obviously this is the biggest in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I've been at the Fed, except for March of 2020 when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy, and we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45% chance of recession. Is the risk that high in your estimate?",
      "KASHKARI: You know it's really going to be determined by are there quick resolutions? To your prior guests. Are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners? The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and hopefully those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation if everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself. Setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices. And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point?",
      "KASHKARI: They are. I mean, obviously the market participants are trying to grasp for where is this all going to settle, and that's causing volatility as they're, as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected, but markets are functioning, transactions are happening, and so I anticipate that's going to continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Neel Kashkari, always good to get your insights. Thank you for joining us. We'll be right back with more. Face the Nation.",

They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\"",
      "The state department's filing comes one day after a U.S. government attorney struggled in a hearing to provide U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis with any information about Garcia's whereabouts.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to release new documents on former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 assassination in the coming days, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Thursday, bringing fresh attention to a killing that has drawn public fascination for decades.",
      "It's not clear what \u2014 if any \u2014 new information will emerge from the release. But the disclosures have drawn the backing of President Trump and his health and human services secretary, the slain politician's son Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "During the cabinet meeting in which Gabbard announced the planned release, the health secretary \u2014 who has claimed for years his father's convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, may be innocent \u2014 said he's \"very grateful\" for the release, while Mr. Trump said, \"it's time.\"",
      "Why is the Trump administration releasing files on RFK?",
      "Days after taking office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing his government to release files on the 1960s assassinations of three high-profile figures: President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert F. Kennedy and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "The administration released a set of newly unredacted files on John F. Kennedy's 1963 killing last month. Gabbard said in a Cabinet meeting Thursday there are \"over a hundred people working around the clock to scan the paper\" around Robert F. Kennedy and King's 1968 assassinations, and her team will \"have those ready to release here within the next few days.\"",
      "What do we expect in the newly released RFK files?",
      "It's unclear what documents on Robert F. Kennedy's assassination are held by the federal government or slated for release. It also remains to be seen whether the disclosures will contain new information, though, on Thursday, Gabbard referenced files that have been \"sitting in boxes in storage for decades\" and \"have never been scanned or seen before.\"",
      "Many files on Robert F. Kennedy's assassination \u2014 which was handled by local police investigators in California, where he was killed \u2014 are already public. The state of California has held tens of thousands of pages of documents on the killing since the late 1980s, including troves of records from the Los Angeles Police Department's initial investigation into Sirhan. The bulk of those documents are publicly available, the state says, writing, \"every effort has been made to provide the fullest possible disclosure of the records.\"",
      "The University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, also maintains an archive with public records on the assassination.",
      "Tim Tate, a writer who argues Sirhan did not fire the bullets that killed Robert F. Kennedy, told CBS News he's \"cautious\" about the Trump administration's promise to release new documents. He noted the files held by the California state archive \u2014 including records from a separate FBI probe on the assassination \u2014 are supposed to be comprehensive. While it would be \"disturbing\" if any files from the FBI or other agencies were omitted, it's unclear what, if anything, was withheld, he said.",
      "Tate said it's possible \"it could all turn out to be a great big nothing burger.\"",
      "Similarly, writer Dan Moldea \u2014 who says Sirhan was solely responsible for the assassination \u2014 said he \"can't imagine something coming out on the RFK files that is going to be striking.\"",
      "\"I can't imagine anything of any importance coming out of this,\" Moldea said. \"Anything important would have been in the LAPD files.\"",
      "But Lisa Pease, a writer who has argued Sirhan did not kill Robert F. Kennedy, told CBS News she believes the federal government may hold documents that could shed new light on the assassination. She pointed to records suggesting the CIA communicated with the Los Angeles Police Department about Sirhan during its probe into the killing.",
      "\"We've only ever seen the LAPD's side of that conversation, so this is our first chance to maybe, hopefully, find the CIA's records pertaining to those conversations,\" Pease said. \"I think there might be some very interesting files.\"",
      "Who assassinated RFK \u2014 and why is RFK Jr. interested in it?",
      "Robert F. Kennedy, then a New York senator and leading Democratic presidential primary candidate, was fatally shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968. Five others were injured. Sirhan was convicted of first-degree murder in the killing in 1969 and has spent over a half-century in California state prison, losing over a dozen requests for parole.",
      "Sirhan\u2014 whose family is Palestinian \u2014 has admitted to killing Kennedy and suggested he was motivated by the presidential candidate's support for Israel, though he has also asserted his innocence at various points or claimed he couldn't remember key details from the slaying.",
      "For decades, some critics of the investigation have questioned whether Sirhan was the true assassin or claimed he wasn't the only gunman. They often cite conflicts between an autopsy report and eyewitness testimony or muddled evidence about the number of gunshots. Still, plenty of other researchers have supported the conclusion that Sirhan acted alone.",
      "One skeptic is Kennedy's son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who met with Sirhan in prison in 2018 and later told the Washington Post he was \"disturbed that the wrong person might have been convicted of killing my father.\" He and his brother Douglas Kennedy backed Sirhan's 2021 bid for parole, and\u00a0California's parole board later recommended Sirhan's release, though Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom later rejected the request.",
      "Several of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s siblings disagree with the health secretary, vehemently pushing back against Sirhan's bids for parole. Chris Kennedy told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2021 that he doesn't believe Sirhan's claims of innocence: \"I know he's a murderer, so it's not a big leap to believe he's a liar,\" he said.",

      "Mr. Trump was at the hospital for just over four hours, slightly less than the four hours and 45 minutes the White House schedule had allotted for the visit. The results of his exam weren't immediately available, but Mr. Trump said the doctor would release his medical report on Sunday.",
      "Leavitt, who briefed the press while the president was at Walter Reed, said Mr. Trump was \"undergoing quite a few tests, imaging.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, who at 78 is the oldest president to be sworn in for a new term, had his last known comprehensive examination in September 2023. He released only limited details from that visit. Mr. Trump told reporters Friday that he also took a cognitive test at the exam.",
      "Presidential physicals are time-consuming, and typically include a battery of tests and checks.",
      "\"The basic thing they're going to be doing are vital signs, your heart, lung, abdominal exam that you're used to getting at the doctor's office,\" said CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder. \"Basic labs like your cholesterol, your blood sugar, maybe kidney and liver tests. And then if there is a prior medical history of risk factor or some other issue, maybe an EKG, a chest X-ray, ultrasound, echocardiogram, that sort of thing.\"",
      "But Gounder noted there's another element to it as well.",
      "\"A presidential physical is not your typical physical exam,\" she said. \"I think it makes more sense to think about this as a curated medical PR event, really intended to reassure the public that the president is able to perform his duties.\"",
      "In November 2023, Mr.\u00a0Trump posted a letter\u00a0from his doctor of osteopathic medicine, Bruce Aronwald, summarizing his September checkup. The letter said Mr. Trump's \"overall health is excellent,\" and his \"physical exams were well within the normal range and his cognitive exams were exceptional.\" But the letter did not offer any specifics such as Mr. Trump's vital signs or any medications he was taking.",
      "After Mr. Trump's ear was struck by a bullet at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July, Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson \u2014 a doctor who was Trump's physician during his first term \u2014\u00a0posted a memo\u00a0about the president's health. Jackson said he reviewed Mr. Trump's hospital records and that he was \"doing extremely well\" after the assassination attempt. Mr. Trump has said he isn't suffering from any long-term health effects from the shooting, and his ear has since healed.",
      "The last annual physical Mr. Trump underwent as president was in June 2020. A summary of the physical released by the White House at the time said he weighed 244 pounds, and his blood pressure was 121 over 79.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled Thursday the U.S. must facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and imprisoned.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge said Friday that the Trump administration failed to comply with an order for it to provide information she requested about a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, including where he is currently located and whether they have taken any steps to facilitate his return to the United States.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said in a written order that the administration \"made no meaningful effort to comply\" with her directive to file a declaration addressing three questions related to the confinement of\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u00a0at a Salvadoran supermax prison: his current physical location and custodial status; what stems the administration has taken to facilitate his return to the U.S.; and what steps they will take and when to facilitate his release.",
      "\"From this court's perspective, defendants' contention that they could not answer these basic questions absent some nonspecific 'vetting' that has yet to take place, provides no basis for their lack of compliance,\" she wrote.",
      "Xinis directed the administration to file daily declarations providing information in response to her queries. Her written order came after a hearing Friday.\u00a0 The Justice Department had told her in a filing earlier in the day that it was unable to provide the information she requested about Abrego Garcia and called a Friday morning deadline she set to provide the details \"impracticable.\"",
      "Xinis had\u00a0ordered the Trump administration to give her information about Abrego Garcia after the Supreme Court on Thursday reaffirmed her directive for the federal government to \"facilitate\" his release from Salvadoran custody.",
      "During the hearing Friday afternoon, Xinis asked Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, why he could not provide answers to her questions, including on Abrego Garcia's whereabouts.",
      "\"I'm not asking for state secrets,\" she said. \"I'm asking a very simple question: where is he?\"",
      "Ensign repeatedly said he was not given information that he could provide to the court, including Abrego Garica's custodial status and who had authority over him. Trump administration officials are still evaluating the Supreme Court's order, he said.",
      "Xinis repeatedly pressed Ensign about where Abrego Garcia is. He noted that his lawyers said Abrego Garcia's last known location is in El Salvador and acknowledged the government has not put forth information to the contrary.",
      "The judge called the lack of evidence from the Justice Department about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts \"extremely troubling.\"",
      "\"It behooves this case and how the system of justice works that the following be communicated to your clients: You are the officer of the court. You are the instrument to represent\" the government, Xinis said. She said that the record in the case currently shows that despite her directive to take steps to bring Agrego Garcia back to the U.S., \"your clients have done nothing to facilitate\" his return.",
      "\"I'm not sure what to take from the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly and yet I can't get an answer today about what you've done, if anything, in the past,\" Xinis said.",
      "Ensign told the judge that the federal government \"intends to comply with the Supreme Court's order.\" He said that while the administration is prepared to answer her questions about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and what actions have been taken to secure his return, they may assert privileges.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's lawyer, said his lawyers and family have not had contact with Abrego Garcia, and accused the Trump administration of \"playing games with their own lawyers.\"",
      "\"They clearly didn't comply\" with the district court's order to turn over information about Abrego Garcia, he said.",
      "In the\u00a0filing to the court ahead of the hearing, Justice Department attorneys told the judge they \"are not in a position where they 'can' share any information requested by the court. That is the reality.\"",
      "\"Defendants received the order late in the evening last night. They are reviewing the order and actively evaluating next steps,\" they wrote. \"It is unreasonable and impracticable for defendants to reveal potential steps before those steps are reviewed, agreed upon, and vetted. Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review.\"",
      "The Justice Department lawyers said that the judge gave them an \"insufficient amount of time\" to review the Supreme Court's order and argued she has not yet provided clarity as to the scope of her initial directive, as the high court told her to do.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys opposed the government's request for more time to respond to the judge's directives and accused the Justice Department of continuing \"to delay, obfuscate, and flout court orders, while a man's life and safety is at risk.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children, was arrested and removed to El Salvador last month after Trump administration officials accused him of having ties to the MS-13 gang.\u00a0 His lawyers said he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "The 29-year-old is being confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, along with other migrants sent there by the administration as part of an agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. Under the deal, the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees.",
      "But Abrego Garica's case emerged as a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration crackdown after a U.S. immigration official acknowledged in a court filing that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "In 2019, an immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia relief known as withholding of removal, which forbids the government from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "While the Trump administration admitted the error in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the district court has no jurisdiction over the Salvadoran government and therefore cannot force it to release Abrego Garcia from its prison. Justice Department lawyers have said that the Salvadoran government has custody of Abrego Garcia, so he cannot be returned to the U.S. unless it releases him.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his wife filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland following his arrest and removal, alleging it violated federal immigration law. They sought an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "Xinis granted that request last week following a hearing and directed the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The dispute ended up before the Supreme Court, and Chief Justice John Roberts put that deadline on hold to allow the high court more time to consider the matter.",
      "Then, on Thursday, the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that the Trump administration had to \"facilitate\" the release of Abrego Garcia from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador\" \u2014 to provide Abrego Garcia with due process of law.",
      "But the Supreme Court also directed the district court to clarify its order, and specifically the directive that the government \"effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said. \"For its part, the government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jena, Louisiana \u2014 An immigration judge in Louisiana on Friday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its effort to deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, upholding one of the deportation grounds cited by the government.",
      "Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans ruled that the administration's determination that Khalil poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S. is \"facially reasonable\" and makes Khalil deportable.",
      "The judge gave Khalil's lawyers until April 23 to file applications for relief to stop his deportation to Syria or Algeria on this ground. Khalil was born in Syria but is a citizen of Algeria, according to court documents.",
      "Comans held in abeyance the second deportation ground cited by the Trump administration: a claim that Khalil committed immigration fraud because he allegedly omitted information about his work history in his green card application.",
      "Comans made the determinations Friday afternoon, inside the courtroom of the privately operated U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Jena where Khalil has been held for weeks.",
      "Khalil, a vocal member of the protests at Columbia University over the war in Gaza, was arrested in early March by ICE, outside of his New York City apartment, where he lived with his pregnant U.S. citizen wife.",
      "After Comans issued her ruling, Khalil, attired in a blue uniform and sandals, asked to be allowed to give remarks.",
      "Khalil noted that the judge had previously talked about \"due process and fundamental fairness,\" and the former Columbia student said those principles were not followed in his case.",
      "Khalil said the Trump administration shipped him \"1,000 miles away\" from his family. He concluded by telling the judge that the cases of other migrants detained here at the ICE facility in Jena, Louisiana should also be addressed with urgency.",
      "After the hearing, Marc van der Hout, an attorney for Khalil, said in a statement, \"Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent. This is not over, and our fight continues.\"",
      "\"If Mahmoud can be targeted in this way, simply for speaking out for Palestinians and exercising his constitutionally protected right to free speech, this can happen to anyone over any issue the Trump administration dislikes,\" van der Hout added.",
      "The government hasn't charged Khalil with any crime, but it has argued in immigration court that he should be stripped of his green card and deported on two civil immigration grounds.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows the government to seek the deportation of noncitizens whose \"presence or activities\" are determined to \"have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Faced with a deadline this week to provide evidence against Khalil, the Department of Homeland Security filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlining the foreign policy rationale.",
      "Rubio cited no specific evidence against Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident whose American citizen wife is in the late stages of pregnancy. But he said Khalil's presence in the country undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "The Trump government has separately alleged that Khalil committed immigration fraud by failing to disclose certain information in his green card application, including his work for the British Embassy in Beirut and the United Nations agency for Palestinian migrants and refugees.",
      "Khalil's attorneys harshly criticized Rubio's memo and the government's case against Khalil. They claim the government is violating Khalil's right to free speech.",
      "\"If the secretary of state claims the power to arrest, detain and deport someone, including a lawful permanent resident, simply because that person dissents from U.S. foreign policy, there are no limits. There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case, on Thursday.",
      "Khalil has separately sued the government over his arrest, detention and the effort to deport him. That case, in federal court in New Jersey, seeks an order that would require Khalil's release and the rescinding of the Rubio determination. It also asks a judge to prohibit the Trump administration from targeting noncitizens \"who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel.\"",

      "\"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson \u2014 an innocent man and father of two young children \u2014 was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.

      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE.

      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has suggested he supports eliminating daylight saving time, although he's also called it a \"50/50 issue.\"",
    "story": [
      "A Senate committee heard from several experts Thursday on setting a year-round time standard instead of switching back and forth with daylight saving time. President Trump recently called it a \"50/50 issue,\" but he previously vowed to get rid of daylight saving.",
      "At the hearing, the committee's chairman, Sen. Ted Cruz, said there is a general consensus among his colleagues that the system of switching the clocks needs to be changed, but he said there is disagreement about whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time.",
      "\"I personally struggle with the two choices here, because it's a question of what do you care about more: sunshine and joy and fun and money, or health, mental health, physical health,\" said Cruz, a Republican from Texas. \"And the honest answer for most people, gosh, I care about all that stuff.\"",
      "Cruz said an alternative has been discussed to pick daylight saving time, but letting states opt out. Arizona and Hawaii current opt out of changing the clock. But others said in Thursday's hearing that having different standards for different states could cause widespread confusion.",
      "The Senate Commerce Committee hearing notice did not set a preference for daylight saving time or standard time, but instead said it would focus on \"various issues around whether the country should continue 'springing forward' and 'falling back' each year with time.\"",
      "Daylight saving time begins in March, when clocks are moved forward an hour, and ends in October, when the clocks go back to standard time.",
      "The twice-yearly time changes are\u00a0generally unpopular\u00a0among Americans, with 63% saying they\u00a0would like to eliminate\u00a0them completely, compared to just 16% who said they would not, according to an Economist/YouGov poll in November 2021.",
      "\"People across our country are tired of the constant cycle of falling back and springing forward,\" Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware said, calling it time for a \"thoughtful solution\" across the country.",
      "\"The important thing is that we land of something consistent and make smart investments to keep people safe,\" she said.",
      "\"Time is always complicated and the system we have is complicated, but it's complicated because it's a human creation,\" said Scott Yates, the founder of the Lock the Clock movement, which supports getting rid of twice-yearly time changes.",
      "\"The sun moving around the earth doesn't actually have anything to do with time,\" Yates said. \"We need this system, but this system has this bug right now, and the bug is daylight saving time, the switching of the clocks. And so if we have a little bit of time, a couple of years, so the individual states can address all of these complexities and make those decisions, then we will be able to get rid of this bug permanently. It is something we have been stuck with since World War I, and this is our opportunity to finally fix it.\"",
      "A 2020\u00a0commentary\u00a0for the journal JAMA Neurology found evidence linking the annual transition to daylight saving time to\u00a0increased strokes,\u00a0heart attacks\u00a0and\u00a0teen sleep deprivation.",
      "The Senate in 2022 passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act to make daylight saving time permanent, but the bill never went anywhere in the House. The 2022 bill had 17 cosponsors from both parties and was spearheaded by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who is now the Secretary of State in the Trump administration.",
      "President Trump has given a range of comments about his views. He said in March that it's a \"50/50 issue,\" saying \"it's hard to get excited about it. I assume people would like to have more light later, but some people want to have more light earlier because they don't want to take their kids to school in the dark.\"",
      "But on Friday, after the latest hearing, he posted on social media: \"The House and Senate should push hard for more Daylight at the end of a day. Very popular and, most importantly, no more changing of the clocks, a big inconvenience and, for our government, A VERY COSTLY EVENT!!!\"",
      "In December, he said the \"Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't!\"",
      "Mr. Trump in the past had supported making daylight saving time\u00a0permanent \u2014 that is, keeping clocks shifted one hour ahead, which happens in the spring. His\u00a0December comment\u00a0called for daylight saving time to be eliminated.",
      "In addition to Yates, testifying Thursday was Jay Karen, chief executive officer of the National Golf Course Owners Association; Karin Johnson, practicing physician and professor of neurology at UMass Chan School of Medicine Baystate, on behalf of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine; and David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.",

      "Thirty-five is the minimum age requirement for the U.S. presidency, but there's no upward limit. The two last presidential elections, which brought Joe Biden, now 82, and Donald Trump, at\u00a078, to the White House, are proof of this political reality.",
      "The Founding Fathers excluded a maximum age limit from the Constitution, giving those in their golden years the ability to run for the highest office in the land.",
      "According to Pew Research, 19 inaugurations have involved presidents in their 60s and just four have involved presidents in their 70s. The median age for U.S. presidents\u00a0on their first day in office is 55.",
      "The 2024 election cycle again brought discussion about\u00a0how old is too old\u00a0for office, which accelerated after Mr. Biden's on-air debate fumbles in June 2024. The political firestorm led to his his decision\u00a0to step aside as the Democratic nominee a few weeks later. Critics have also raised concern about Mr. Trump's age and competency.",
      "Here's a look at the history of the oldest presidents \u2014 in the Oval Office and beyond:",
      "Who were the oldest U.S. presidents at election and in office?",
      "Presidents Trump and Biden are the two oldest presidents ever to be sworn in. When Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2025, he eclipsed Biden by a few months to take the record. Both were inaugurated at age 78, but Mr. Trump was about 5 months older.",
      "The third oldest president at his inauguration was Ronald Reagan, who was 69 when he was sworn in in 1981. \"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,\" Reagan famously said in 1984 while running for reelection against Walter Mondale.",
      "In fourth place is the nation's ninth president, William Henry Harrison. Harrison was elected in 1841 at age 68, but his tenure as president was short-lived. He died 32 days into his first term, making his presidency the shortest in U.S. history.",
      "Who are the oldest living U.S. presidents?",
      "The oldest living president is Biden, who turned 82 on Nov. 20, 2024, just weeks after the election. Mr. Trump and two former presidents, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, all 78 years old, roughly tied for second.",
      "Who was the longest-living president?",
      "Jimmy Carter who died at the age of 100\u00a0in December 2024, was the oldest living former U.S. president in history. Carter, a Democrat from Georgia, served one term, from 1977 to 1981. He\u00a0broke the longevity milestone in 2019, at 94 years old, surpassing George H.W. Bush to become the longest-living president.",
      "More than 1,000 people recently paid tribute to the former president at a\u00a0benefit concert\u00a0ahead of his centennial. He\u00a0celebrated his 100th birthday\u00a0on Oct. 1, 2024, more than a year after it was announced he had entered hospice care.",
      "After he left office more than 40 years ago, Carter kept busy building more than 4,000 homes for Habitat for Humanity, traveled the world to promote human rights and won the Nobel Peace Prize.",

      "Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason in August last year, in a new prison swap on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed her release in a social media post early Thursday, but offered no information about the terms of her release.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported\u00a0Karelina's release, saying she was freed in a swap arranged by the two countries' intelligence agencies, and a CIA official later told CBS News that the agency had played a central role in the deal on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"American Ksenia Karelina is on a plane back home to the United States,\" Rubio said in his post. \"She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release.\"",
      "The plane landed around 11 p.m. EDT at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where she was greeted by several people including her boyfriend, professional boxer Chris van Heerden. In a touching moment, Karelina and van Heerden had a long embrace.",
      "In a statement first published by the Journal and later provided to CBS News, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said, \"President Trump brought home another wrongfully detained American from Russia,\" and added his praise for \"the CIA officers who worked tirelessly to support this effort\" and for the United Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which he said had enabled the exchange. The swap of the two detainees was carried out in Abu Dhabi.",
      "Ratcliffe was directly involved in the negotiations, which he conducted with an unnamed senior Russian intelligence official, the CIA said.",
      "The top level communication indicates a deepening of efforts by the Trump administration to improve ties with Moscow. Mr. Trump has been pushing both Russia and Ukraine to negotiate a peace agreement to end the three-year war sparked by Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of its neighbor.",
      "In exchange for Karelina, who lives in California, the CIA official confirmed that the U.S. had freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus 2023 at the request of U.S. authorities. According to the Journal, he was being held on allegations of exporting sensitive microelectronics.",
      "\"Much of the swap was negotiated by the U.S. government, with CIA playing a key role engaging with Russian intelligence,\" a CIA spokesperson said Thursday, adding, \"The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.\"",
      "Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in a Russian penal colony after pleading guilty to treason. She was arrested while on visit to Russia for donating about $51 to an American-based humanitarian group that was helping Ukrainians impacted by the war, according to Russian state media.",
      "Her lawyers said she acknowledged transferring the funds, though she did not admit she intentionally directed them to organizations that might have used the money for actions against Russia. She didn't expect that her donation would end up supporting anti-Russian activities, according to her lawyers.",
      "Van Heerden\u00a0told CBS News last year that she had made the small donation in 2022, \"exercising her First Amendment rights,\" adding that \"she has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Van Heerden said he was uneasy about Karelina's decision to return to Russia for a visit, given the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, but he said she \"had no worry in the world,\" and that she had assured him it would be safe since she was entering the country as a dual American-Russian citizen.",
      "\"She wanted to go home. She made it very clear that she wanted to go home,\" Van Heerden told Gayle King on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Wanting to fulfill her wish to visit home, Van Heerden said he bought her a plane ticket as a birthday gift, and the pair first traveled together to Istanbul. He had originally intended to travel with her to Russia from there, but he didn't feel comfortable, so she traveled alone to Russia, and he returned to Los Angeles.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of a Maryland man mistakenly deported from custody in El Salvador, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "In an unsigned decision, the high court acknowledged that a late Monday deadline set by the district court judge to secure the return to the U.S. of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, and paused by Chief Justice John Roberts had already passed, effectively granting in part the emergency relief sought by the Trump administration.",
      "But the court said that the district court's order \"properly requires the government to 'facilitate'\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and to \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "The Supreme Court went on to say that the intended scope of the term \"effectuate\" in the lower court's decision is unclear and may exceed its authority. The high court directed the district court to provide more clarification with the case sent back for further proceedings.",

Sotomayor said in a statement joined by Kagan and Jackson that there is agreement among the justices \"that the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the process to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador.\"",
      "\"As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs,\" a DOJ spokesperson said Thursday. \"By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked the Trump administration in a court filing to facilitate his release from the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison known as CECOT Thursday evening and to dispatch a plane to retrieve him. They cited the \"grave risk to his safety in El Salvador.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in after a federal district judge on Friday ordered it to take immediate action to return Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. The 29-year-old Salvadoran national was arrested by immigration authorities on March 15 and was among the more than 200 people sent on deportation flights to El Salvador last month.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case sparked backlash after a federal immigration official acknowledged in a court filing last week that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old and was arrested in 2019, according to court documents. During immigration proceedings, the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang MS-13, citing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie he was wearing and allegations from a confidential informant who said he belonged to a branch of MS-13 that operates on Long Island, New York, court records show.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he has never lived on Long Island and has no affiliation with MS-13. They also said he has no criminal history and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge detained Abrego Garcia after denying a request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board. But he was ultimately granted withholding of removal to El Salvador, a legal status that prohibits the government from returning him to his home country because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from custody following that decision and has lived for six years in Maryland with his wife and their children. He had regular check-ins with immigration authorities, according to court filings, but was arrested on March 12 after he was stopped by immigration agents while driving with his son in the back seat. Abrego Garcia was taken into custody and transported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Baltimore, Louisiana and Texas before he was flown to El Salvador, according to legal filings.",
      "After Abrego Garcia was sent to the Salvarodan prison last month, he and his wife, a U.S. citizen, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland alleging his removal violated federal immigration law and seeking an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted that request following a hearing Friday and directed the government to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to halt that order, and while its request was pending, asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The 4th Circuit then declined to pause the district court's decision.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the lower court order \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it interfered with President Trump's ability to conduct foreign diplomacy and set a tight timeline for compliance. He wrote that the U.S. cannot force the release of Abrego Garcia because he is now in the custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge's bidding,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sotomayor warned in her statement that the government's argument \"implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene.\"",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia called his case \"one of one,\" and argued in court papers that requiring the government to facilitate their client's return is \"not novel,\" because the district court's order just requires the Trump administration to correct its own error.",
      "\"The executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny,\" they wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team called the government's mistake in removing him \"Kafka-esque,\" and noted that he has lived in the U.S. for several years without any issues.",
      "\"The government offers no evidence that he has become a threat overnight,\" they wrote.",
      "Migrants removed from the U.S. are being housed in CECOT as a result of a temporary agreement the Trump administration reached with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, under which the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees for a year.",
      "Citing this arrangement, Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that the U.S. government \"functionally controls Abrego Garcia's detention \u2014 it has simply contracted with El Salvador to be the jailer.\"",
      "Lower courts also said that the government has control over Abrego Garcia, since he is being temporarily housed in CECOT at the Trump administration's request.",
      "\"The government's claim that it can remove an individual from the United States pursuant to such an agreement and thereby lose the ability to reclaim that individual and return him to the country for process (or for any other purpose) cannot stand,\" Judge Stephanie Thacker, who sits on the 4th Circuit, wrote in an opinion. She added that \"the government's actions in this case most assuredly violated the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"",
      "Thacker, who was joined by Judge Robert King, wrote that \"the government cannot escape its responsibility to return Abrego Garcia to the United States by claiming it now lacks authority to control El Salvador.\"",
      "While the Trump administration has acknowledged that it inadvertently sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the federal courts do not have the power to demand his return since he's no longer in U.S. custody. Administration officials have also claimed that he is an MS-13 \"leader,\" though they have not produced evidence to support the allegations.",
      "During last week's hearing before Xinis, Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni repeatedly struggled to answer the judge's questions but said he wasn't given sufficient information by the administration.",
      "\"The facts are conceded, plaintiff Abrego Garcia should not have been removed,\" Reuveni said.",
      "When questioned about why the government is not able to return Abrego Garcia, Reuveni said he \"asked the government the same question\" and did not receive an answer. The Justice Department lawyer said multiple times he was \"frustrated\" with the government's lack of cooperation in the case.",
      "Following Friday's argument, Reuveni was placed on administrative leave, and Sauer said in a filing that his statements were \"inappropriate\" and \"do not reflect the position of the United States.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News about Reuveni's employment status, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, \"At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\"",

    "story": [
      "An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan belonged to an enigmatic group of early human ancestors called Denisovans, scientists reported Thursday.",
      "Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and our own species, Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Denisovan fossils are very scarce,\" with only a few confirmed finds in East Asia, said study co-author Takumi Tsutaya at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan.",
      "So far, the only known Denisovan fossils include partial jawbones, a few teeth and part of a finger bone found in caves in Siberia and Tibet. Some scientists believe fossils found in a cave in Laos may also belong to Denisovans.",
      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",
      "At one time, at least three human ancestor groups - Denisovans, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens - coexisted in Eurasia and sometimes interbred, researchers say.",
      "\"We can identity Neanderthal elements and Denisovan elements\" in the DNA of some people alive today, said Tsutaya.",
      "Scientists still don't know exactly why Denisovans went extinct.",
      "\"We have so little archaeological and fossil information about Denisovans that we can only speculate as to why they disappeared,\" Welker told Reuters. \"A lasting legacy, though, is that some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry some Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.\"",

    "story": [
      "An altar from the Teotihuacan culture, at the pre-Hispanic heart of what became Mexico, was discovered in Tikal National Park in Guatemala, the center of Mayan culture, demonstrating the interaction between the two societies, Guatemala's Culture and Sports Ministry announced this week.",
      "The enormous city-state of Tikal, whose towering temples still stand in the jungle, battled for centuries with the Kaanul dynasty for dominance of the Maya world.",
      "Far to the north in Mexico, just outside present day Mexico City, Teotihuacan \u2014 \"the city of the gods\" or \"the place where men become gods\" \u2014 is best known for its twin Temples of the Sun and Moon. It was actually a large city that housed over 100,000 inhabitants and covered around 8 square miles.",
      "The still mysterious city was one of the largest in the world at its peak between 100 B.C. and A.D. 750. But it was abandoned before the rise of the Aztecs in the 14th century.",
      "Lorena Paiz, the archaeologist who led the discovery, said that the Teotihuacan altar was believed to have been used for sacrifices, \"especially of children.\"",
      "\"The remains of three children not older than 4 years were found on three sides of the altar,\" Paiz told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Teotihuacan were traders who traveled all over the country (Guatemala),\" Paiz said. \"The Teotihuacan residential complexes were houses with rooms and in the center altars; that's what the residence that was found is like, with an altar with the figure representing the Storm Goddess.\"",
      "Researchers posted video on social media showing aerial footage of the altar as well as detail of the structure's interior.",
      "\"It's something unique in Guatemala, nothing similar had been found,\" Paiz said in a statement.",
      "It took archaeologists 1\u00bd years to uncover the altar in a dwelling and analyze it before the announcement.",
      "Edwin Rom\u00e1n, who leads the South Tikal Archaeological Project within the park, said the discovery shows the sociopolitical and cultural interaction between the Maya of Tikal and Teotihuacan's elite between 300 and 500 A.D.",
      "Rom\u00e1n said the discovery also reinforces the idea that Tikal was a cosmopolitan center at that time, a place where people visited from other cultures, affirming its importance as a center of cultural convergence.",
      "Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n M\u00e9ndez, an archaeologist who was not involved with the project, said the discovery confirms \"that there has been an interconnection between both cultures and what their relationships with their gods and celestial bodies was like.\"",
      "\"We see how the issue of sacrifice exists in both cultures. It was a practice; it's not that they were violent, it was their way of connecting with the celestial bodies,\" she said.",
      "The altar is just over a yard wide from east to west and about 2 yards from north to south. It is about a yard tall and covered with limestone.",
      "The dwelling where it was found had anthropomorphic figures with tassels in red tones, a detail from the Teotihuacan culture, according to the ministry's statement.",
      "The\u00a0researchers published their findings in the archaeological journal Antiquity.",
      "The researchers made their announcement less than a year after a hidden Mayan city was\u00a0discovered in a dense Mexican jungle by a doctoral student who unknowingly drove past the site years ago on a visit to Mexico.",
      "Tikal National Park is about 325 miles north of Guatemala City, and the discovery site is guarded and there are no plans to open it to the public. Tikal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, reached its peak between 200 and 900 AD when Mayan culture encompassed parts of what are now Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras.",

    "story": [
      "For the first time ever, scientists say they have made a species de-extinct, bringing the dire wolf back into the world thousands of years after it died off.",
      "Colossal Biosciences, a company based in Dallas, says it successfully birthed three dire wolves \u2014 a species that once roamed North America but has been extinct for more than 12,500 years \u2014 using revolutionary science.",
      "Colossal CEO Ben Lamm said the team used DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull to analyze the full genome of the species and create three healthy dire wolf puppies, according to a news release.",
      "The Colossal website explains that many dire wolf fossils were preserved in the La Brea tar pits, in the Los Angeles area, but the species' DNA was not preserved in the tar.",
      "But using two dire wolf samples from an international study on the extinct species, Colossal was able to uncover more dire wolf DNA that ever previously found. Company scientists were eventually able to analyze the species' genome \u2014 or its entire DNA set.",
      "Then they used CRISPR, a gene-editing technology, to genetically modify cells from a living gray wolf. Usually, cloning relies on tissue samples, but Colossal was able to use these modified cells to create embryos, then transferred them to a surrogate (a domestic dog, The Associated Press reported) to grow.",
      "Three litters of dire wolf puppies yielded two males, named Romulus and Remus, and a female, named Khaleesi after the \"Game of Thrones\" character \u2014 a nod to the HBO fantasy drama that featured dire wolves.",

      "\"All you can do now is make something look superficially like something else,\" Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University at Buffalo who was not involved in the research, told the AP.",
      "\"Whatever ecological function the dire wolf performed before it went extinct, it can't perform those functions\" in today's environment, Lynch said.",
      "The company says the animals are being cared for on a 2,000-acre preserve, \"certified by the American Humane Society and registered with USDA,\" enclosed by a 10-foot-tall fence and perimeter security.",
      "Colossal was also able to create two litters of cloned red wolves, which are the most critically endangered wolf in the world.",
      "The company says its de-extinction process could help support conservation efforts globally. \"Preserving, expanding, and testing genetic diversity should be done well before important endangered animal species like the red wolf are lost,\" said Harvard geneticist and co-founder of Colossal, Dr. George Church.",
      "In 2021, Colossal announced plans to de-extinct the woolly mammoth \u2014 a concept Church had been developing for years. He told \"60 Minutes\" in 2019, \"I would say that probably in five years we'll know whether we can get this to work for mice, and maybe pigs and elephants. And then if we can get embryos to grow in the laboratory all the way to term, then it's probably a decade.\"",

After confirming the gene modification process works in mice, they planned on testing it with elephants, which are woolly mammoth's closest living relatives.

      "With veteran commander Sergey Ryzhikov, 50, at the controls, flanked on the left by rookie cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky, 32, and on the right by Kim, 41, the Soyuz MS-27/73S ferry ship rocketed away from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:47 a.m. EDT (10:47 a.m. local time).",
      "\"The crew is feeling good, everything is nominal,\" Ryzhikov periodically assured Russian flight controllers as the rocket climbed toward orbit.",
      "Eight minutes and 46 seconds later, the third stage engine of the Soyuz 2.1a rocket shut down and the crew ship was released to fly on its own, followed moments later by deployment of its two solar panels and navigation antennas.",
      "The ferry ship then carried out an automated rendezvous with the space station, moving in for docking at the multiport Prichal module at 4:57 a.m. as the two spacecraft sailed 260 miles above western Russia.",
      "\"Congratulations, Sergey, congratulations on your arrival at the International Space Station,\" Russian mission control radioed. After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",
      "Welcoming them aboard were Soyuz MS-26/72S crewmates Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, along with SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.",
      "\"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional postdocking video conference.",
      "Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are replacing Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit, who were launched to the ISS on Sept. 11 and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own Soyuz on April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space.",
      "The Crew 10 fliers, launched on March 14, replaced their Crew 9 predecessors \u2014 Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov and Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams \u2014 who returned to Earth on March 18.",
      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",
      "As such, Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are expected to return to Earth around Dec. 9.",
      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",

      "The program helps bring citizens to space in a reusable suborbital rocket system. Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, set the stage for future human spaceflights with the program when he lifted off on a capsule, named \"First Step,\" in 2021 with three crewmates.",
      "\"My expectations were high, and they were drastically exceeded. The zero G (gravity) piece may have been one of the biggest surprises because it felt so normal, it felt almost like humans evolved to be in that environment. ... It's a very pleasurable experience,\" Bezos told reporters\u00a0after the successful 2021 spaceflight.",

      "How long was Gayle King and the crew in space?",
      "The journey to space and back, from liftoff to landing, lasted for about 11 minutes. Nearly three minutes into liftoff, the crew capsule separated from the booster and eventually reached the apogee, or the highest point of the flight.",
      "They floated for about 4 minutes before they made their return to Earth. First, drogue parachutes deployed followed by the main parachutes, bringing the history-making crew back down to the ground. They landed at less than 15 miles per hour, astronaut Mae Jemison, the first woman of color to travel to space, explained to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.",
      "\"New Shepard astronauts ascend toward space at more than three times the speed of sound. They pass the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the internationally recognized boundary of space 62 miles above Earth, before unbuckling to float weightless and gaze at our planet.

      "Unique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft",
      "Blue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.",
      "The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.",
      "At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.",
      "About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.",
      "After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.",
      "\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.",
      "Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.",
      "The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.",
      "\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"",
      "The system is also designed to ensure a survivable landing even if two of the main parachutes fail to open and fully inflate.",

    "story": [
      "Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL, Harvard Medical School graduate and now a NASA astronaut, blasted off with two cosmonaut crewmates aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket early Tuesday, chased down the International Space Station and moved in for a picture-perfect docking three hours after liftoff.",
      "With veteran commander Sergey Ryzhikov, 50, at the controls, flanked on the left by rookie cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky, 32, and on the right by Kim, 41, the Soyuz MS-27/73S ferry ship rocketed away from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:47 a.m. EDT (10:47 a.m. local time).",
      "\"The crew is feeling good, everything is nominal,\" Ryzhikov periodically assured Russian flight controllers as the rocket climbed toward orbit.",
      "Eight minutes and 46 seconds later, the third stage engine of the Soyuz 2.1a rocket shut down and the crew ship was released to fly on its own, followed moments later by deployment of its two solar panels and navigation antennas.",
      "The ferry ship then carried out an automated rendezvous with the space station, moving in for docking at the multiport Prichal module at 4:57 a.m. as the two spacecraft sailed 260 miles above western Russia.",
      "\"Congratulations, Sergey, congratulations on your arrival at the International Space Station,\" Russian mission control radioed. After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",
      "Welcoming them aboard were Soyuz MS-26/72S crewmates Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, along with SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.",
      "\"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional postdocking video conference.",
      "Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are replacing Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit, who were launched to the ISS on Sept. 11 and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own Soyuz on April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space.",
      "The Crew 10 fliers, launched on March 14, replaced their Crew 9 predecessors \u2014 Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov and Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams \u2014 who returned to Earth on March 18.",
      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",
      "As such, Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are expected to return to Earth around Dec. 9.",
      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",

    "summary": "The nate app was not powered by advanced AI technology at all, but by human workers, according to the indictment.",
    "story": [
      "A fintech startup that raised $40 million based on the premise of its artificial intelligence capabilities was fueled by human labor, allegedly defrauding investors lured by the new technology of millions, federal prosecutors said this week in a statement.",
      "Albert Saniger, 35, the former CEO\u00a0 and founder of nate in 2018, who is from Barcelona, Spain, was indicted in the Southern District of New York for engaging in a scheme to allegedly defraud investors and making false statements about his company's AI capabilities.",
      "Nate, an e-commerce company, launched the nate app that claimed to streamline the online shopping checkout process via a single AI-powered tap option. But the app was not powered by advanced AI technology at all, according to the indictment.",
      "With the promise of custom-built \"deep learning models\" that would allow the app to directly purchase goods on product pages in fewer than three seconds, Saniger raised over $40 million. While instructing employees to keep nate's reliance on overseas workers secret, he pitched investors an AI-driven product capable of 10,000 daily transactions.",
      "Instead, the app allegedly relied heavily on overseas workers in two different countries who manually processed transactions, mimicking what users believed was being done by automation. Saniger, meanwhile, allegedly told investors and the public that the transactions were being completed by AI.",
      "\"Saniger allegedly abused the integrity associated with his former position as the CEO to perpetuate a scheme filled with smoke and mirrors,\" the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement.",
      "In the technology's absence, Saniger allegedly relied heavily on hundreds of workers at a call center in the Philippines, court documents said. When a deadly tropical storm struck the country in October 2021, the indictment said, nate established a new call center in Romania to handle the backlog of customer services. Investors were likely never exposed to the lull in transactions because Saniger directed that transactions by investors be prioritized to avoid suspicion.",
      "The aftermath of the company's fallout in 2023, left investors with near-total losses, the indictment said.",
      "U.S. private AI investment grew to $109.1 billion last year\u00a0\u2014 and the U.N. trade and development arm said market share is poised to climb to $4.8 trillion by 2033.",
      "AI is widely perceived as being free from human intervention but the reality paints a more complicated picture. Nate is not the only company that has capitalized on AI through cheap labor overseas.",

    "story": [
      "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams told senators in testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill that the social media company worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government to censor its platforms, among other allegations.",
      "\"I saw Meta executives repeatedly undermine U.S. national security and betray American values,\" Wynn-Williams said in her opening remarks, which were obtained by CBS News before the hearing.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism and led the bipartisan hearing, said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"made censorship his business model.\"",
      "\"The evidence that we have in black and white is a company and leadership that is willing to do anything, anything, work with America's chief competitor, work with our chief adversary,\" Hawley said.",
      "Hawley sent a letter to Zuckerberg Thursday requesting his testimony before the subcommittee, writing, \"The American people deserve to know the truth about your company.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",
      "Wynn-Williams described the use of a \"virality counter\" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a \"chief editor,\" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called \"an Orwellian censor.\" These \"virality counters\" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.",
      "Wynn-Williams also told senators Chinese officials could \"potentially access\" the data of American users. When Meta engineers expressed concern about data security, Wynn-Williams testified that Meta leadership, including Zuckerberg, were indifferent.",
      "Wynn-Williams testified Zuckerberg was \"personally invested\" in Meta's business relationship with China, claiming he committed to learning Mandarin and \"had weekly Mandarin sessions with employees.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams alleged Meta's artificial intelligence model known as \"Llama\" was used to help DeepSeek. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.",
      "In a statement last year on Llama, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, \"The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams encouraged senators to continue investigating Meta's role in the development of artificial intelligence in China, as they continue their probe into the social media company founded by Zuckerberg.",
      "\"The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn't offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there,\" she said.",
      "In response to her opening statement, a Meta spokesperson called Wynn-Williams' testimony \"divorced from reality and riddled with false claims.\"",
      "\"While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta, which changed its name from Facebook in 2021, operates some of the most popular social media platforms in the United States, including its previous namesake Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.",
      "Washington is taking a more aggressive posture toward China and its growing threat to American economic interests and national security. The Trump administration increased tariffs on imported goods from China to 125% Wednesday. The administration also continues to pursue the sale of TikTtok, a short-form video platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance, to an American buyer. And on Capitol Hill in 2023, the House of Representatives created the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party to investigate China's challenge to American global power.",

      "The technology giant has taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of President Trump's steep tariffs on China. That includes ramping up iPhone production in India, which is subject to far lower levies than China, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Apple continues to make most iPhones in China.",
      "Apple has added workers in its main India factory, extending shifts to reach its goal of ramping up production by 20%, Reuters reported.",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 27% tariff on India, which Mr. Trump on Wednesday\u00a0paused for 90 days\u00a0along with import taxes on dozens of other countries as the U.S. seeks to negotiate more favorable trade deals. By contrast, a 125% \"reciprocal tariff\" on China remains in effect.",
      "Apple chartered cargo flights to transport the smartphones to the U.S. because it \"wanted to beat the tariff,\" a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Apple reportedly spent eight months lobbying Indian airport authorities to cut the phones' customs clearance time down from 30 hours to six hours.

      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",

      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

      "Blue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.",
      "The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.",
      "At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.",
      "About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.",
      "After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.",
      "\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.",
      "Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.",
      "The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.",
      "\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"",
      "The system is also designed to ensure a survivable landing even if two of the main parachutes fail to open and fully inflate.",

    "story": [
      "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele says he won't return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, after Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters it's \"up to El Salvador\" whether the man mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison returns to the U.S.",
      "Bukele and Bondi made the comments in the Oval Office alongside President Trump, as the two world leaders meet. Over the weekend, the Justice Department said in court filings that they're willing to take \"all available steps to remove any domestic obstacles\" to facilitate his return.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\" Bukele asked the press. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United Sates? I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"",
      "Bondi, speaking before Bukele, said it's \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\" Bondi said that \"first and foremost, he was illegally in our country.\"",
      "\"That's not up to us,\" Bondi said. \"The Supreme Court ruled, President, that if El Salvador wants to return him ... we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.\"",
      "But the Supreme Court offered no qualifier of whether El Salvador wants to return Abrego Garcia. The court ruled that a lower court order properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release from El Salvador's custody. The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of the\u00a0Maryland man\u00a0from custody in El Salvador, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers insist he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador. The Trump administration acknowledged\u00a0that his deportation to the high-security prison in El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "\"It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,\" Michael G. Kozak, a senior State Department official, said in a Friday court filing. \"He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "The Trump administration sent deportation flights with scores of foreign nationals that they describe as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. Among them was Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children.",
      "Bukele, a tough-on-crime leader, said it was an \"honor to be here\" and \"we're very eager to help\" with stopping crime and terrorism. Bukele told Mr. Trump what he's doing with the border is \"remarkable,\" praising the plunge in crossings at the U.S. southern border. Under Bukele's tenure, El Salvador has seen a dramatic decrease in its crime rate.",
      "In announcing his meeting with Bukele, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post, that their nations \"are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity.\"",
      "\"President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation's custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government. They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\"",

      "In these photos taken last February, Monica Sementilli, 46, and Robert Baker, 55, are seen on the patio at a family memorial only days after the murder of Monica's husband, world-famous hairdresser Fabio Sementilli, 49. He had been brutally stabbed to death at his Los Angeles home while smoking a cigar on that same patio.",
      "Four months later, Monica Sementilli and Rob Baker were arrested, accused of being secret lovers who planned Fabio's killing.",

      "The felony complaint which charges Monica Sementilli and Baker with murder and conspiracy to commit murder states that \"while stabbing victim Fabio Sementill to death, defendant Robert Louis Baker cut his left index finger.\"",
      "The complaint explains that blood from that cut finger is what cracked the case.\u00a0 Police say Baker left blood and DNA at the scene of the murder, as well as in Fabio Sementilli's stolen Porsche, which the killers used as a getaway vehicle and discarded in a nearby part of Los Angeles four hours after the murder.",
      "The DNA led directly to Baker, who had a criminal record.",
      "While this secretly-snapped photo may well have been an enticing lead for detectives, LAPD never let on to friends and family, nor the suspects, that Baker was a suspect. Instead, they watched the couple under surveillance while carrying out a ruse aimed at lowering the guard of their suspects.",
      "LAPD detectives allowed the family to think that Fabio Sementilli's murder may have been part of a pernicious Los Angeles crime wave of what are called \"knock-knock burglaries.\"\u00a0 Skilled thieves target specific homes and literally knock on the door and otherwise check to find a time when nobody is home, then the crooks burglarize the home quickly looking for jewelry and cash.",
      "The knock-knock burglars hit expensive homes which usually have elaborate video surveillance systems so the crooks wear masks and hoodies to cover their identities.",
      "Even the local media reported that Fabio Sementilli might have been murdered by knock-knock burglars. These surveillance photos of two people who police say are Rob Baker and a male accomplice captured them entering the Sementilli home. Hiding their faces in hoodies, they bear an incredible similarity to many of the knock-knock burglars caught on tape.",

      "Police claim they learned that Monica Sementilli gave Baker the codes for remote access to her home security system and that each of them monitored it on the day of the murder to facilitate the crime.\u00a0 Sementilli's lawyers disputed this evidence in court and argued that her association with Baker did not constitute a conspiracy to commit murder.",
      "Fabio Sementilli's family continued to support his wife, unaware that police were methodically building a case against her as the alleged mastermind of the crime.",
      "Fabio and Monica Sementilli had moved to Los Angeles from Toronto, Canada.\u00a0 Fabio Sementilli had been promoted as an executive for the beauty giant Wella, based in Los Angeles.\u00a0 The Sementillis had two teenage daughters and lived in a million dollar home with a pool in the toney Woodland Hills neighborhood.",

Luigi offered to help, but Monica was arrested before the money was transferred.",
      "In court, Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman explained that Fabio Sementilli's $1.6 million life insurance policy was the motive for Monica Sementilli and Baker to kill Fabio.\u00a0 Although, Monica Sementilli's lawyers challenged this motive theory.",

      "In June, Monica Sementilli and Rota attended a national hairdresser convention in Toronto to jointly accept a posthumous lifetime achievement award for Fabio Sementilli. The two sisters-in-law were unaware that the LAPD was wrapping up their case against Monica Sementilli and Baker.",
      "Days after receiving the award and returning home to Los Angeles, Monica Sementilli and Baker were arrested.",
      "Rota says the family was blind-sided never imagining their sister-in-law could have been involved: \"I go to bed scared of nightmares. And I wake up trying to remember anything that could make any sense.\"",
      "Since June, Monica Sementilli and Baker have remained in custody in Los Angeles awaiting trial.\u00a0 The felony complaint charges them with murder and murder conspiracy, laying out 56 separate overt acts which DDA Silverman says constitute the murder conspiracy between the alleged lovers.",
      "Blair Berk, the Hollywood celebrity defense attorney who is representing Harvey Weinstein, is one of Monica Sementilli's lawyers.\u00a0 At a Feb. 27 hearing arguing to have the complaint dismissed against her client, Berk characterized evidence in the case as \"poppycock.\"",

      "\"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King took a historic trip to the edge of space on Monday alongside an all-women crew, whom she called fearless and inspiring.",
      "Journalist and philanthropist Lauren S\u00e1nchez led the all-female crew, an idea she pitched to her fianc\u00e9, Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, shortly after he completed his own trip to space. King and S\u00e1nchez were joined by pop star Katy Perry, aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist and astronaut Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.",
      "\"These women are so badass. \u2026They have such amazing life stories, all that they've accomplished,\" King said on \"CBS Mornings\" after her trip to space was first announced.",
      "Here's a look at the women who joined Blue Origin's mission.",
      "Gayle King",
      "King, who recently celebrated her 70th birthday, said she was welcoming the new decade by jumping on the rare opportunity to travel to space \u2014 as long as she had the blessing of her family and friends.",
      "\"I wanted to open myself up to new adventures and step out of my comfort zone,\" King explained.",
      "\"I've made no secret of the fact that I'm very nervous but also very excited,\" said King, requesting that people send good wishes and good thoughts moving forward if they see her ahead of the launch. \"I'm nervous enough.\"",
      "Katy Perry",
      "Perry told \"CBS Mornings\" she would sing a tribute to Earth during the journey. She explained that her song choice would reflect the transformative perspective she anticipates experiencing in orbit.",
      "\"I think the perspective that we're all going to walk away from is like, 'Oh, my gosh, we have to protect our mother,'\" Perry said.",
      "Perry wrote on social media\u00a0in February, \"If you had told me that I would be part of the first ever all-female crew in space, I would have believed you. Nothing was beyond my imagination as a child. Although we didn't grow up with much, I never stopped looking at the world with hopeful WONDER!\"",
      "Perry said she wants to be a role model for her daughter.",
      "\"I work hard to live my life that way still, and I am motivated more than ever to be an example for my daughter that women should take up space (pun intended). That's why this opportunity is so incredible \u2014 so that I can show all of the youngest & most vulnerable among us to reach for the stars, literally and figuratively. I am honored to be among this diverse group of celestial sisters,\" she added.",
      "Lauren S\u00e1nchez",
      "S\u00e1nchez said the idea of leading an all-women crew emerged shortly after Bezos' 2021 spaceflight.",
      "\"When Jeff went up and he came back down, I was so excited for him,\" S\u00e1nchez told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"Within 24 hours he's like, 'Would you ever go up?' I was like, 'What?' I was like, 'Yes, I would go up.'\"",
      "She recalled that in that moment, she proposed an all-women mission.",
      "\"In that exact moment, I said, 'Could I take all women up?'\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"And he goes, 'That's a great idea.\"",
      "According to S\u00e1nchez, Bezos immediately supported the concept, noting that he believed there had never been an all-female flight.",
      "Aisha Bowe",
      "Bowe became the first person of Bahamian heritage to travel to space when she boarded the Blue Origin flight. She said she had been been preparing for this moment her whole life.",
      "\"I mean, I started my career thinking I was allergic to math. ... And here I'm sitting here, and I'm just like, we are going to space,\" Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist and two-time tech company founder, told \"CBS Mornings\" in early April.",
      "She also gushed about her fellow crew members.",
      "\"This crew represents the best in the future of humanity. It's really space for the benefit of Earth,\" Bowe said.",
      "Bowe is excited for the endless possibilities awaiting future generations and is living proof that dreams can become reality.",
      "\"I did it because I saw all of you reach for the sky, and I knew it could, too,\" she said.",
      "Amanda Nguyen",
      "Nguyen, who transformed personal trauma into landmark legislation when she drafted the Sexual Assault Survivor Bill of Rights, made history as the first Vietnamese and Southeast Asian woman in space.",
      "\"What a historic crew. Each one of my crewmates represents a community. I'm so proud to be representing mine as the first Vietnamese woman in space,\" she told \"CBS Mornings\" in March.",
      "Nguyen discussed her plans to conduct two science experiments during the trip \u2014 one on plant pathology in partnership with the Vietnamese National Space Center and the second on women's health, focused specifically on menstruation.",
      "\"Women were barred from becoming astronauts at NASA early on because of menstruation. They didn't have the data to back that up,\" Nguyen, author of the newly released memoir \"Saving Five,\" explained.",
      "Kerianne Flynn",
      "Flynn, who grew up in Michigan, said she spent her childhood gazing at the stars with wonder but never imagined space travel would be in her future.",
      "\"This has been a dream of mine for a very long time,\" Flynn told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"It has felt mostly like a personal journey.\"",
      "Flynn reflected on meeting her fellow crew members on a video call in March on social media, writing that she was \"overwhelmed by profound joy and deep gratitude to be a part of this historic journey.\"",

      "Karenna Groff, a former MIT soccer player once named the NCAA woman of the year, was one of six people killed when a small plane carrying her family crashed in upstate New York Saturday afternoon.",
      "Groff, her parents, neuroscientist Dr. Michael Groff and urogynecologist Dr. Joy Saini, her brother Jared Groff, his partner Alexia Couyutas Duarte and Karenna's boyfriend James Santoro, all died when the twin-engine Mitsubishi MU-2B went down in a field in Copake, N.Y. just after noon.",

      "Rory McIlroy turned another major collapse into his grandest moment of all, hitting a wedge into 3 feet for birdie in a sudden-death playoff Sunday to finally win the Masters and take his place in golf history as the sixth player to claim the career Grand Slam.",
      "What should have been a coronation for McIlroy along the back nine at Augusta National turned into a heart-racing, lead-changing jaw-dropping finish at golf's greatest theater that ended with McIlroy on his knees sobbing with joy and disbelief.",
      "\"I started to wonder if it would ever be my time,\" McIlroy said in Butler Cabin before Scottie Scheffler helped him into the green jacket.",
      "It ended with more heartache for Justin Rose, who lost to Sergio Garcia in a playoff in 2017 and forced this one with a clutch 20-foot birdie on the 18th hole for a 6-under 66. He wound up joining Ben Hogan as the only players to lose twice in playoffs at Augusta National.",
      "McIlroy lost a two-shot lead in two holes at the start. He lost a four-shot lead on the back nine in a matter of three holes with shocking misses, one of them a wedge into the tributary of Rae's Creek on the par-5 13th.",
      "And right when it looked as though he would blow another major, McIlroy delivered two majestic shots when nothing less would do, two birdies that sent him to the 18th hole with a one-shot lead. That still wasn't enough. He missed a 5-foot par putt for a 1-over 73 and the first Masters playoff in eight years.",
      "McIlroy's wedge bounced onto the slope of the top shelf with enough spin to trickle down to 3 feet. And when Rose missed from 15 feet, McIlroy finally sealed it.",
      "McIlroy went 11 long years without a major, knowing the Masters green jacket was all that kept him from joining Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen as the only winners of golf's four professional majors.",
      "He raised both arms and let the putter fall behind him, and before long he was on his knees, then his forehead on the 18th green as his chest heaved with emotion.",
      "So ended one of the wildest Sundays at a major that is known for them. U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who beat McIlroy at Pinehurst No. 2 last June, had the lead after two holes when McIlroy opened with a double bogey.",
      "He crashed out with a pair of three-putts and two shots into the water on the back nine, closing with a 75.",
      "Ludvig Aberg, a runner-up in his Masters debut a year ago, suddenly had a share of the lead when McIlroy fell apart on the middle of the back nine. He missed a birdie putt from the fringe to take the lead, then finished bogey-triple bogey.",
      "Rose had every reason to believe he threw away his chances on Saturday with a 75 that put him seven shots behind, and then two bogeys on the front nine. Even as he steadied himself, he was four shots back and running out of time. He did his part in a 10-birdie round and that dynamic birdie putt to cap it off.",
      "McIlroy helped in a big way.",
      "Nothing was more shocking than the 13th. McIlroy played it safe, leaving himself a big target and a lob wedge. He missed his mark by some 20 yards, the ball disappearing into the tributary of Rae's Creek and leading to double bogey.",
      "Then came a tee shot into the pine straw that led to another bogey, and the lead was gone again. But he was resilient as ever \u2014   he's been like that his entire career. Seemingly in trouble left of the 15th fairway, McIlroy hit 7-iron around the trees and onto the green to 6 feet.",
      "He missed the eagle putt - the birdie still helped him regain a share of the lead. Two holes later, facing a semi-blind shot, he drilled 8-iron and chased after it, urging it to \"Go! Go! Go! Go!\" And it did, barely clearing the bunker and rolling out to 2 feet for birdie and a one-shot lead.",
      "Turns out that wasn't enough either. He hit into a bunker from the fairway. He missed the 5-foot putt for the win. There was more work to do. But the 35-year-old from Northern Ireland never wavered in what he came to Augusta National to do.",

      "U.S. trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer said Sunday that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping \"don't have any plans\" to speak amid an escalating trade war between the two countries.",
      "\"Since April 2, we have this at the leaders level, and at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them,\" Greer said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "In what Mr. Trump dubbed \"Liberation Day\" on April 2, the president announced that the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, along with higher, \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on U.S. exports. Then, shortly after the tariffs went into effect, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs after U.S. and global financial markets plunged. At the same time, the president said he would increase the tariff rate on goods imported from China to 125%. A 20% fentanyl tariff brings Mr. Trump's universal tariffs on China to a total of 145%.",
      "China said Friday that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125% in response, arguing in a statement that the U.S. imposition of the levies violates international economic and trade rules, while also calling the rising tariffs a \"joke.\"",
      "Despite questions swirling about how the lower the temperature between the two countries, Greer insisted that the president is working to reshore American manufacturing and trade as part of a broader global issue. Greer said \"the only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate.\"",
      "\"So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, 'we want to negotiate with the Americans,'\" Greer said. \"And the Chinese made a different decision \u2026 It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.\"",
      "The trade representative said when asked whether the U.S. is prepared for the possibility that China could sell assets it holds in the United States that the issue is \"we've become so dependent on China\" and haven't had fair market access for decades.",
      "\"We see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well. So it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves,\" Greer said, adding that \"we obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.\"",
      "When asked what happens after the 90-day pause, and whether the period given enough time to negotiate with 70 countries, Greer said conversations have been underway since before the tariffs were announced, \"because everyone knew tariffs were coming.\"",
      "\"The reality is, we're working around the clock, day and night, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States,\" Greer said.",

      "(CHEERING)",
      "ANNOUNCER: The 47th president of the United States!",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Despite backing off of what he called reciprocal tariffs against dozens of countries and announcing new exemptions on some key consumer products, the president is digging in on tariffs against China.",
      "We will discuss what's next with U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer.",
      "And we will get a read on the economic impact from the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari.",
      "Silicon Valley's congressman, Democrat Ro Khanna, will weigh in on how the trade war may impact big tech.",
      "Plus, we will have a new poll on how Americans think Trump is handling the economy.",
      "And, finally, an update on the measles outbreak with the former top vaccine regulator with the FDA Dr. Peter Marks.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Our new CBS poll shows President Trump's job approval rating has fallen to 47 percent. That's a three-point drop since President Trump announced his global tariff plan as part of what he called liberation day. That's a drop, but it is still a better approval rating than he ever saw in his first term. We will have more on that in just a few minutes.",
      "The president hiked tariffs on imports from China to 145 percent last week, and Beijing responded with a 125 percent tariff on American goods sold in China. Late Friday, President Trump changed course again, lifting some of those duties off of Chinese-made tech products, including smartphones, chips and computers.",
      "Speaking with reporters last night, the president said more details would be revealed Monday.",
      "For more, we go to United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Ambassador.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER (U.S. Trade Representative): Good morning, Margaret. How are you?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well.",
      "I'm hoping you can give us some news of movement on this clash. Is the Trump administration opening any kind of channel to Beijing right now? Are there any plans for presidents Trump and Xi to speak?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Right now, we don't have any plans on that. This issue is truly at the leaders level.",
      "Before April 2, I had a conversation with my counterpart, and others did since April 2. We have this at the leaders level. And, at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China holds about $1.5 trillion in assets in this country. About half of them are U.S. treasuries.",
      "In the past, you've talked \u2013 you've spoken about strategic decoupling from China and acknowledged it would cause some short-term pain. Are you trying to get China to sell some of those assets? Is that part of your goal as well?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's not part of this plan.",
      "President Trump has a global program to try to reshore American manufacturing and address the trade deficit. It's a global issue. The only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate. So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, we want to negotiate with the Americans.",
      "And the Chinese made a different decision. So, it's not a plan to do that. It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you prepared for China to consider selling assets it holds in the United States? And do you want that to happen?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, remember, China has been selling off treasuries for some time. It's not a \u2013 it's not a brand-new development.",
      "You know, the treasuries market will fluctuate. You know, I'm not the Treasury secretary, so I'm not the best poised to talk about that. But I think the issue is, we've become so dependent on China, and for so many decades, we haven't had fair market access. And so \u2013 so again, we see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well.",
      "So, it's not \u2013 it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves. We obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, last Friday, late in the day, the administration published some exceptions to the tariffs on countries including China with smartphones, computers, electronics and machines that make semiconductor computer chips.",
      "Last Sunday, on this program, the commerce secretary told us the tariffs are part of a strategy to bring high-tech factories to the U.S. Take a listen.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated. And great Americans, the tradecraft of America is going to fix them, is going to work on them.",
      "Our high school-educated Americans, the core to our work force, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But now those high-tech items are given these exceptions. So, is the goal still to move electronics manufacturing to the United States?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We certainly need to have semiconductors and the downstream electronics supply chain move to the United States.",
      "What happened is \u2013 it's not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it. What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime, where we have studies ongoing for pharmaceuticals, for semiconductors, metals, et cetera.",
      "So, it's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring. They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But those tariffs aren't in place?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they are exempt from them.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That is \u2013 that is subject to study by the Commerce Department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: For now, they're subject to a 20 percent tariff. They're subject to a 20 percent tariff that's on China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary was on another network this morning, and he said semiconductors are \u2013 quote \u2013 \"exempt from reciprocal tariffs, but that won't be a permanent sort of exemption.\"",
      "Here's what you told my colleague Nikole Killion April 8.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "NIKOLE KILLION: Why aren't there any exemptions with some of these tariffs, sir?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: The president decided that we're not going to have exemptions. We can't have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we're facing.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying the carve-outs are temporary, but isn't that still the Swiss cheese situation you said you were trying to avoid?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I would just disagree with that, Margaret.",
      "We have two different tariff programs. You have the global reciprocal tariff getting at the trade deficit, and you have critical sector national security tariffs, where we \u2013 we have tariffs in place on auto, steel and aluminum, and we have them coming on semiconductors in the supply chain, pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, et cetera.",
      "They're just different approaches to do it. We have to be much more deliberate about the semiconductor supply chain\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026 because we don't even import semiconductors, as such, that much, right? They go into downstream products. So, we have to be very careful. And we want the whole supply chain here, not just one product.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president said on Monday he'd be much more specific. Will we see those sectoral tariffs announced?",
      "I mean, he \u2013 he's saying he's already putting big tariffs on pharma. You're telling me that there's going to be an investigation into it. That's something that sounds like it's far in the future. What \u2013 what time frame are we talking about?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, you have \u2013 for the national security tariffs, you have to do an investigation in order to impose the tariffs. That's just legal process. That's \u2013 that's how we do it. That's how it's done for steel, aluminum, autos, et cetera.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you've decided the outcome.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026. investigations for those.",
      "No, we have not. We have not. That's why they're exempt. That's why they're \u2013 you know, they don't have a tariff covered right now, because you have to go through the investigation to determine the outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Is it\u2026",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff on that, but we have to go through the investigation, figure out what's appropriate. And that \u2013 and that's a Commerce Department function to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "I understand you and the Treasury secretary are going to be meeting on the 17th of \u2013 of the month with Japanese officials to talk about the potential of a trade deal. I have been told you've been looking at some of these non- tariff barrier issues that the United States sees problems with in current \u2013 including their currency.",
      "Are you asking governments to do things like that, not just, you know, to buy into America, but to actually change their own currency and change, like, their central bank policy?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So, our view, Margaret, is that currency manipulation or misalignment, whatever you want to call it, that can have a negative impact on U.S. exporters and unfairly advantage foreign exports into the United States.",
      "In the USMCA and in the Japan-China \u2013 the Japan-U.S. deal from the first Trump term, we had chapters with the parties committing not to do currency manipulation. You know, the Treasury Department has a statute to avoid that. So we certainly are in these kinds of discussions with these countries to see if they're willing to make these types of commitments as well, as have been done in other contexts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty big ask.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, the Japanese agreed to it in the first Trump term.",
      "The Canadians and the Mexicans agreed to it. This is something that periodically has \u2013 has happened over the years. Countries have had to revalue to make sure they aren't giving artificial competition \u2013 you know, artificial competitive advantage to their exports.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I mean, it's a big ask because we're in a \u2013 we're in a nefarious situation.",
      "We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit that Biden left us with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: It's the highest in human history. And currency is certainly part of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but \u2013 but I say it's a big ask because it takes time to negotiate. It could take you longer than 90 days, right?",
      "So, does that mean this 90-day reprieve could continue to be renewed? I mean, do you know what happens at the end of 90 days? Is that the amount of time you have to negotiate deals with the 70 countries the White House says are calling?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I'm \u2013 I'm considering that we have 90 days. Before April 2, we were already having many talks with other countries, because everyone knew tariffs were coming.",
      "This was \u2013 this was not some secret. Everyone knew. And so we already were in conversations with several countries. You know, it's going to be up to these countries to come to the table, continue coming to the table, and make these kinds of offers.",
      "I mean, the reality is, we're working around the clock day and night, you know, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But 90 days could be a rolling deadline, is what I hear you saying?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I \u2013 I would not say that. In the president's Cabinet meeting last week, he was asked about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And he said, well, we'll see.",
      "I mean, my goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And I think we're going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, the president \u2013 I know you were testifying on \u2013 on the Hill when the president changed the policy on reciprocal tariffs.",
      "He said later to reporters that he didn't have access to lawyers when he made the announcement of the change in policy \u2013 quote \u2013 \"We wrote it up from our hearts. It was written from the heart.\"",
      "He said that a few times. Why doesn't the president have access to trade lawyers when he's announcing policy? These are massive policy shifts. I'm sure there's somebody who could have taken a call.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So that type of \u2013 that type of discussion had been happening for \u2013 for several days. He's talking about drafting the tweets. He drafted the tweet from his heart.",
      "But that kind of policy, that was always a possibility, and the order was drafted by lawyers to ensure that the president could modify the policy to further the underlying goals of the order.",
      "So \u2013 so lawyer \u2013 you know, trade lawyers like \u2013 like myself and a huge staff that works for me, White House Counsel, et cetera, they've all been involved from day one to give the president the kind of flexibility he needs to address the emergency he's declared that's \u2013 forms the basis for these tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Greer, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be watching what you get done.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI (President, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like two billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China.",
      "Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that.",
      "I just heard from an ag leader two days ago in Minnesota, who said that, even if there's a 10 percent tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China, because it's a competitive global market. It's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else.",
      "And so, in many sectors, whether it's a 10 percent tariff or 50 percent or 100 percent tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil, so looking to other suppliers, potentially.",
      "I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest.",
      "What makes you say that?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit.",
      "It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is, interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy.",
      "So, now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is, we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up.",
      "It could be that investors are saying, hey, there are other places we also want to invest, that it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people typically think of U.S. treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.",
      "So when the president says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the U.S. and around the world are trying to determine, what is the new normal in America?",
      "You know, I saw an interview on Friday where BlackRock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10-year treasury would go to a 5 percent yield. He just offered it as a possibility.",
      "We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for, where are these trade negotiations going to end up? Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5 percent treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100 percent determined by trade policy and fiscal policy.",
      "And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see. And, at the Fed, our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what \u2013 yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries.",
      "And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what you \u2013 what concerned you?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern.",
      "It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So, we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near-term ups and downs in the economy. But, ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the Central Bank's control. We cannot affect that.",
      "All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building and a house, those may raise prices.",
      "Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If \u2013 what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated.",
      "The question is, is it a one-time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one-time adjustment in prices, and nothing longer-term than that.",
      "So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation, because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs and a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until, what, May 7?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet.",
      "But, yes, obviously, we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer.",
      "But, obviously, this is the biggest \u2013 in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I have been at the Fed, except for March of 2020, when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy.",
      "And we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45 percent chance of recession.",
      "Is the risk that high, in your estimate?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: You know, it's really going to be determined by, is \u2013 are there quick resolutions? To your prior guest, are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners?",
      "The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and, hopefully, those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation. If everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time, that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself, setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices.",
      "And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: They are.",
      "I mean, obviously, the market participants are trying to grasp for, where is this all going to settle? And that's causing volatility as they're \u2013 as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: But markets are functioning. Transactions are happening. And so I anticipate that's going to continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Neel Kashkari, always good to get your insights. Thank you for joining us.",
      "We'll be right back with more Face the Nation.",

      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For more on our latest poll on how Americans are reacting to the Trump economic agenda, we're joined now by our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, President Trump put tariffs at the center of his campaign. Now he's enacting them. Is there support for what he's doing?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Like a lot of the way people look at investments, it depends on what you see as your goals and your time horizon. By which I mean, in the immediate we see three quarters of Americans think that tariffs will raise prices. At least in the short term. And a lot think in the long term, too. Now, they're sensitive to that because, as we've discussed for many years, inflation and prices are top concerns right?",
      "The second thing we see is an increase in the number of people who think that Donald Trump's policies now are making them financially worse off. And it's not just that movement, but it's the setup against expectations. Back at the start of his term a few months ago, a lot of people thought that his policies would make them financially better off. So, that's a big change.",
      "But now let me talk about the time horizon, because this applies to his political base, to Republicans, many of whom say, hold on a second, you can't evaluate this right now. You have to give it six months. You have to give it a year to see how his tariff and trade policies are going to play out.",
      "So, with that, they're much more supportive of tariffs and of his approach. They also think that he is just using this as a negotiating tactic. Most of them think that he's going to ultimately remove those tariffs, maybe when he gets what he wants. And so that's why you still see a lot of Republican support for all of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House had said it's not up for negotiation, but then President Trump said there is a negotiation, and that's where there's some of the confusion right now.",
      "But you did indicate the approval rating itself is under pressure. Where is that pressure centered?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, more people say that they like his goals with trade and tariff policies than his approach. And that approach part is weighing on his ratings for handling the economy, which are down, his ratings for handling inflation, tied to what I described about prices, which are also down.",
      "But look, the market, in the public mind, is not the economy. There's a -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not. The stock market isn't.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a pricing mechanism of the future of the economy.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Exactly. And it is an indicator, especially for people who say they have money, not just in the market, but that their finances are sensitive to what happens in the market. They're much less approving of his approach right now.",
      "But having said that, consider also jobs. The public is mixed on whether Trump's approach is going to lead to more manufacturing jobs. Republicans think it will. But again, that's kind of a long-term issue.",
      "Back to the politics for a second. You know, people often ask, when does a president own the economy? And right now this looks like Donald Trump's economy. A majority of people say it's his policies that are responsible, either way, good or bad, for how it is, not Joe Biden's. And that, of course, sets things up going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, great insights. Thank you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from another state, Ohio.",
      "Good morning to you, Congressman.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to what's happening to Silicon Valley in just a moment on the trade and tech front. But, first off, I want to ask you, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, for any insight you might have on one of the announcements made late on Friday. The president authorized the U.S. military to take over a large swath of public land along the southern border, including in the state of California. And I understand that that means the Pentagon's budget can now be used for things like border security or potentially to even detain migrants in that area.",
      "Has Congress been briefed on these plans? Do you have any sense of what's happening?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We have not. And, Margaret, it's longstanding law that you can't use the military for domestic enforcement. It's a violation of the Constitution. I'm hopeful the Supreme Court would 9-0 rule that way, just like they've ruled that the deportation of Abrego (ph) was unconstitutional. But we have not heard any specifics of it, and it's blatantly against the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You there were talking about Maryland resident Abrego Garcia, who was detained and then sent to a prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court said that the Trump administration actually has to facilitate getting him back, but they didn't actually rule on whether he was a gang member or not. I mean the Justice Department can't substantiate it. But why did you bring up that specific case as proof of something?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it just shows that this administration is taking actions that are unconstitutional. Look, Vice President Vance said that the - Abrego was an M-13 gang member with no legal rights here. And the Supreme Court said, well, we don't know. And he does actually have legal rights.",
      "And so, similarly, you now have an administration that is using the military for domestic enforcement, which is illegal. And I believe that even this Supreme Court, a conservative Supreme Court, would rule it's unconstitutional.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Garcia, ICE said it was an administrative error that led to this man's arrest in the first place. It seems the Trump administration is saying it's now in the hands of the president of El Salvador, who will be at the White House this week. So, we will watch for developments on that space.",
      "But going back to the line of questioning here regarding Armed Services, we understand that the president sent his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to talk to Iranian officials over this past weekend. We don't know much, other than they're going to meet again. But in the meantime, the U.S. military has positioned as many as six B-2 bombers in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of aircraft that would carry a weapon that could be used to take out underground facilities for a nuclear program.",
      "Do you believe President Trump would need congressional approval to carry out a strike, even if it was just in support of Israel leading that attack on Iran?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Absolutely. And almost a third of our B-2 bombers are there.",
      "Look, it's unconstitutional what they're doing in Yemen. I said it was unconstitutional when Biden made those strikes. We - they need to come to Congress.",
      "And look, the president was elected by the American people to say, we don't want our tax dollars going for more bombing in the Middle East, for more wars in the Middle East. I think he's ignoring the base that actually elected him that does not want more of these strikes.",
      "In the case of Yemen, the Saudis had war there for almost ten years. And the - it didn't do anything to address the situation with the Houthis. The president campaigned on diplomacy. He hasn't seen that. And what we're seeing is escalation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see what the diplomacy he's attempting achieves in the near term.",
      "But let me ask you why you're out in Ohio talking to us this morning. I understand in the coming days you're also going to go to Connecticut, to Yale Law, on Tuesday. Are you trying to sort of troll Vice President Vance? And, if so, why?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, no. I mean the Cleveland City Club invited me to give a speech on the economy. And let's talk about these tariffs. I mean, they were chaotic and they were totally haphazard. So, you had Howard Lutnick on saying that we were going to bring manufacturing back, electronics manufacturing back to the United States. And they realized suddenly that that wasn't going to happen. Actually, the iPhone price would go up to $1,700 or $2,000. And, by the way, if that manufacturing moved, it would probably move to Malaysia or Vietnam.",
      "So, they suddenly reversed. They exempted all of electronics manufacturing, which is about a third of our trade deficit. And I'm here at the Cleveland City Club to say, if you want to have electronics manufacturing here, the way to do it is not blanket tariffs. You have to create an electronic manufacturing hub, the kind we did with the Chips Act. That means investing in tool engineering and workforce. It means having investment tax credits. It means having government buy things from the United States. The president has no plan of how to actually have high-end advance manufacturing in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the district you represent includes Silicon Valley. So, you must be hearing from some of these CEOs. Who are they lobbying, apparently successfully, to get these carve-outs?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think they're talking about sound economic policy. I mean it really would have been - they're talking to anyone they can at the White House. They're talking to anyone they can who has the president's ear. But what they're saying is pretty simple. First they're saying that Howard Lutnick, the screws and the screwing only is about 0.1 percent of an iPhone's cost. I mean you need to - the actual components are memory, are camera, are ram. I mean it's like you - I understand they have 19th century policies of McKinley, but they need to have a 21st century understanding of the economy.",
      "And then they're saying, OK, you really want to do this? The iPhone will cost $1,600 to $1,700 but we're not going to be able to bring it back to the United States. We'll go to India. We'll go to Malaysia. We'll go to Vietnam.",
      "And if you want to bring back the manufacturing to the United States, you have to invest in the workforce, you have to have some investment tax credit for the facilities, and you have to be able to buy the things we make in the United States.",
      "So, all I'm saying is, let's have sound economic policy. And, you know, I saw the poll earlier.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: This is not a hypothetical. This is not something the president will be able to spin. Either we're going to see new factories come, or we're not. And tariffs just aren't going to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we didn't get a clear answer on when these semiconductor tariffs are coming. But the administration argues they're in the pipeline and that, you know, China's not going to get a free pass when it comes to tech. What is that going to mean for your part of the country?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it's - again, they don't have any sense of when the tariff will come, when it won't come, and they're against the Chips Act. So, how are you going to - let's say you suddenly put tariffs on China. What it would mean is the production would move to other parts of the Asia. It still isn't going to come here unless you're financing those factories here, willing to buy here. Tariffs can be a tool used as a broader Hamiltonian industrial policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: And that's what I'm here in Ohio to talk about, which is, what is actually going to bring advanced manufacturing to this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "All right, Congressman Khanna, we'll be watching.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy claimed last week that the measles outbreak may be plateauing, but the highly contagious virus continues to spread mostly in unvaccinated people. And the CDC reports that the number of cases topped 700 in 2025 so far.",
      "The measles virus, which was once effectively eradicated here in America thanks to widespread vaccination, is now in two dozen states.",
      "We spoke Friday with Dr. Peter Marks, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine program, who was forced to resign last month as part of Kennedy's redesign of America's health policy. Our conversation began on the subject of the measles outbreak and the response by the Trump administration.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Kennedy spoke to my colleague, Dr. Jon LaPook, earlier this week following the death of a second unvaccinated child in Texas due to measles. Kennedy reiterated, people should get the MMR vaccine.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "DR. JON LAPOOK: What's the position, philosophically, of the federal government in terms of public health?",
      "ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (Health and Human Services Secretary): The federal's government's position, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But at - if - the - the government should not be mandating those.",
      "LAPOOK: Understand. But the -",
      "KENNEDY: You know, I've always said during my campaign and - and every part that - every public statement I've made, I'm not going to take people's vaccines away from them.",
      "LAPOOK: Right.",
      "KENNEDY: What I'm going to do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a sufficient endorsement?",
      "PETER MARKS (M.D., Former Director, FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research): As a public health professional, I'm going to tell you what an endorsement of the measles vaccine sounds like right now. If you can hear my voice right now and you have a child that is unvaccinated against measles, we have measles spreading it this country very significantly. You wouldn't put your child in a back seat of a car without being strapped into their car seat. You want to get your child vaccinated against measles so that they don't have a one in a thousand chance of dying from measles if they contract it. There is no reason to put your child at that risk because the vaccine does not cause death. It does not cause encephalitis. And it does not cause autism. So, that's what an endorsement sounds like. Just make the comparison.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That has to be extremely frustrating for you as someone who worked in the vaccine space for so long. You clearly feel that this is safe and effective and that not saying it clearly is endangering people. And I understand the frustration.",
      "PETER MARKS: Right. So, another way of - yes, no, exactly. Exactly. And - but - there's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks that to not use it is the equivalent of, again, throwing - I mean if you saw a child - if you saw a 15-month-old rolling around in the back seat of a car, you'd probably call child protective services.",
      "Now, I'm not saying we should have - we should order parents to do this because I don't want to get into the whole issue of mandates. But we should have a moral responsibility to protect our children against something that could potentially be life-threatening, particularly when it's spreading across the United States the way it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said there are people like you who can't speak freely. You can speak freely because you're no longer at the FDA?",
      "PETER MARKS: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying your former colleagues can't directly answer a question, they can't honestly answer a question and endorse a vaccine right now?",
      "PETER MARKS: I think it's challenging in this environment for some of them, but you'd have to ask them directly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "In your resignation letter you wrote of the measles outbreak, and what happens when confidence in science is undermined. You said it's clear truth and transparency are not desired by the secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.",
      "Did you ever speak to him about your concerns?",
      "PETER MARKS: So, just a matter of record, I never interacted with the secretary. I don't - I don't intend to engage on, you know, disputing any of that. If the administration can have me come and go, that's fine. The more important thing here is that we deal with the issue at hand, which is vaccine confidence is really important for this country and it's been undermined over and over again over the past years. And now we're seeing the result of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are saying here that the man running HHS doesn't take in information, wishes subservient confirmation of misinformation and lies. There's presumed outcomes, is what you're saying?",
      "PETER MARKS: I think that my words then spoke for itself. I don't need to belabor it here.",
      "You know, science is the pursuit of objective truth for the benefit of mankind. And those of us who believe in it, we - we take it very seriously. And it hurts us deeply when there are those who would undercut the name of science, undercut the very name of science because it's convenient for them to purvey lies.",
      "And that's just - it's not OK because at the end of the day I was so strongly affected by what happened last week with the death of a second child, that I actually - I actually used profanity with a reporter without - while - while I was on the record without realizing it, which is something I've never done. I really - I don't believe that we should be saying, well, these are people who believe that they shouldn't be vaccinated because my experience -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're from the Mennonite community.",
      "PETER MARKS: The Mennonite community.",
      "My experience is that if you meet people on their level, they generally will eventually come around.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Many parents probably know ASD diagnosis rates are on the increase in this country. The CDC says the current numbers are one in 36 American children. This is a huge - a very broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. There is no established cause.",
      "On Thursday, the HHS secretary, Kennedy, said he's got hundreds of scientists from around the world working on it, and he promised this.",
      "KENNEDY: By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be - we'll be able to eliminate those exposures.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That gives tremendous hope to a lot of people. Do you know anything about that ongoing research?",
      "PETER MARKS: I know a minimal amount of effort that's being - going on to try to relook at prior autism research. But I am not aware of what is being discussed there.",
      "I cared for leukemia patients for a significant number of years. Giving people false hope is something you should never do. It is absolutely - you could be incredibly supportive of people. But giving them false hope is wrong.",
      "If you just ask me, as a scientist, is it possible to get the answer to quickly? I don't see any possible way.",
      "And, remember, you're talking to the person who came up with Operation Warp Speed for vaccines. Autism is an incredibly complicated issue. So, we have the issue of diagnosis bias. We don't know how many of those cases are true, how much of this is true growth of autism, how much of this is just that we now have diagnostic criteria and we diagnose it more often.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of the United States said, something artificial is causing autism rates to go up. On Thursday he said, maybe you stop taking something. You stop eating something. Or maybe it's a shot. But something's causing it. Right after that, RFK appeared at - the HHS secretary appeared on Fox News and dismissed 14 studies that have shown no link between autism and vaccines. He said it is an epidemic.",
      "KENNEDY: Epidemics are not caused by genes. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So, we know that it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm. And we are going to identify it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there scientific evidence ruling out genetics as a cause of ASD?",
      "PETER MARKS: There is no - there's no scientific evidence ruling out genetics. In fact, there is data that had been published that say that genetics may contribute to autism. There are, obviously, data that can - that suggest that perhaps environmental factors may. But one has to be incredibly careful, incredibly careful about making associations between environmental factors and autism.",
      "There is a wonderful graphic that shows that Coca-Cola increase goes along with the increase in autism, but there's also a wonderful graphic that you can find online that shows that the increase in spending on organic food also goes along with the rise in autism false causality. Scientists do not want to find false causality. We want to find true causality.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It stood out to us that Secretary Kennedy has hired someone named David Geier to conduct analysis of the links between autism and vaccines. He was charged by the state of Maryland in 2011 with practicing medicine without a license. That was weeks after his father's medical license was suspended for putting autistic children at risk by giving them a hormone blocking agent.",
      "So, what should the public know or expect from the work that he will do for the U.S. government?",
      "PETER MARKS: So, all I can say is, I would not - he's - to the best of my knowledge, he's not had any training after college in any of the sciences that we value here.",
      "What I think we can expect is the expected, that there will be an association determined between vaccines and autism because it's already been determined. This is not how science is conducted.",

    "published": "Sun, 13 Apr 2025 14:36:57 -0400",
    "summary": "Dr. Peter Marks said that the deaths of unvaccinated children is \"just not acceptable.\"",
    "story": [
      "The former top vaccines official at the Food and Drug Administration criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for downplaying the deaths of unvaccinated children from measles, amid this year's record outbreak of the virus.",
      "\"To dismiss children's deaths due to infectious diseases that are preventable by vaccines as just expected or not a big deal, that's just not acceptable to me,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, in an interview airing Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Weekly measles cases have climbed to the highest levels seen in the U.S. since a 2019 wave of the virus, which had been the worst in decades. Three deaths have been linked to this year's measles outbreak, including two unvaccinated children in Texas.",
      "\"We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic,\" Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting.",
      "Kennedy also contrasted U.S. measles case numbers to Europe, where thousands more infections and dozens of deaths have been reported in recent months. Kennedy has also used the comparison as evidence that his response to the outbreak was a success.",
      "Marks criticized Kennedy's comparison, noting that Europe's figures \"includes Romania, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, other places that have less robust public health efforts than we do.\" He also said that \"even a single death in this country from measles, it's just\u2014 it's just not excusable.\"",
      "\"That's just not the right thing to do. We should be comparing our measles response now to what we accomplished during the first two decades of the 20th century, until the 2019 measles outbreak, which is, we shouldn't be having any deaths from measles,\" said Marks.",
      "Changes at the FDA",
      "Before he was ousted by Kennedy's aides, Marks was the director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which regulates vaccines and other medical products derived from living sources. He was also the architect of the Operation Warp Speed effort to speed the development of COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.",
      "He warned that it is now \"challenging in this environment\" for some of his former colleagues in the federal government to endorse vaccines.",
      "\"There's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks,\" Marks said.",
      "Days after Marks submitted his resignation letter, Kennedy implemented steep layoffs and forced resignations across the FDA, as part of a sweeping restructuring of the nation's health agencies.",
      "The cuts have forced federal health officials to confront difficult decisions, including over how to prioritize fewer food and drug safety inspections. Marks praised the remaining staff at the agency as \"heroes in public health\" who are \"struggling because there's a lot to be done.\"",
      "\"They keep tabs on the infections. They make sure that the vaccines that are coming in for approvals might work their way through. They make sure that outbreaks are investigated. Those people are continuing to do their job the best they possibly can,\" Marks said.",
      "Marks said the delay to an approval decision on Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to be greenlighted earlier this month by the FDA, was concerning. And he warned that his own ouster could signal a change to the agency's approach to vaccines.",
      "\"Why would you de-emphasize something that is so basic to public health,\" Marks said.",
      "\"Does a disservice to pseudoscience\"",
      "Marks said he never interacted directly with Kennedy as secretary. He also said he did not know much about the administration's efforts to reopen research into the repeatedly debunked theory that vaccines cause autism, amid broader plans to determine the cause of autism.",
      "Asked about Kennedy's claim that \"we know it is an environmental toxin\" causing autism, Marks said it was \"very rare for scientists to speak in absolutes.\" Kennedy has been criticized for years for claiming that vaccines cause autism, among a range of unfounded claims he has espoused about the danger posed by immunizations.",
      "\"Most things are not that black and white, and we don't speak in absolutes. Whereas pseudoscientists find it very easy to speak in absolutes because they're not actually looking to use science for the benefit of mankind, they're usually using science for their own benefit,\" he said.",
      "Marks said he was familiar with the past work of Dr. Mark Geier and his son, David Geier, who The Washington Post reported has been tasked by Kennedy this year to revisit a past Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"They have a firm and fixed notion that vaccines cause autism. So it's very hard for me to see how we're going to get to any other idea than vaccines cause autism,\" Marks said.",
      "Describing the work by Geier and his father as pseudoscience \"does a disservice to pseudoscience,\" Marks said.",
      "David Geier was fined by Maryland regulators for practicing medicine without a license, including for prescribing the drug Lupron to autistic children. Lupron is also used as a chemical castration drug for sex offenders.",
      "\"I don't know. I can't even conceive as a physician of how he thought that could be a good idea,\" said Marks.",

      "In the nearly three months since he has been back in office, Trump has launched a broad effort led by billionaire Elon Musk to shrink government by firing thousands of workers and cutting spending, tried unsuccessfully thus far to end Russia's war against Ukraine and impose tariffs against many countries, including close allies of the United States.",
      "Democrats, and even some Trump supporters, have criticized his early actions.",

      "\"Every one of them came up at the end, and they were great,\" Trump said. \"I mean, they're all warriors, modern-day warriors.\"",

    "story": [
      "Reginald Reed Jr., known as Reggie, spent more than two decades wondering who killed his mother, Selonia Reed, when he was only 6 years old. Selonia, a bank teller, was 26 when her body was found in her car in Hammond, Louisiana.",
      "One of the last memories Reggie has of that day is his mother buying him a chocolate chip cookie at the Hammond Square Mall. He also remembers her kissing him goodbye but everything else is a blur.",
      "\"48 Hours\" and contributor Vladimir Duthiers investigate what happened in the decades that followed in \"The Day My Mother Never Came Home.\" The episode is now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "It was a hot summer day in August 1987 when Selonia's body was found inside her blue Chevy Sprint in a parking area about one-and-a-half miles from the Reed home. Police said she had been bludgeoned, stabbed multiple times and stripped naked. It was clear, police said, that she was sexually assaulted.",
      "Selonia's husband Reginald Reed Sr. had reported her missing an hour or so before her body was found. Reginald told police on the morning of Aug. 23, 1987, that Selonia told him she was going out with a girlfriend the night before. That girlfriend later told police the two had \"no plans\" to go out that night, but Reginald stuck to his story.",
      "As the investigation unfolded, police learned that Selonia had told relatives that Reginald was physically abusive and had talked about getting a divorce. He became an early suspect, but none of that suspicion reached the ears of Reggie, who was only a child.",
      "Reggie was questioned by police after they received permission from his father. The police videotaped Reggie's interview with a police detective while his father sat next to him. He vouched for his father's version of events, saying the two of them spent the evening playing video games and sleeping in the same sofa bed. In effect, Reggie became his father's alibi. Years later, Reggie viewed that interview and became emotional when he saw his 6-year-old self crying that he wanted his \"mommy\" and \"daddy.\"",
      "\"I just can't imagine what it's like as a 6-year-old to have to sit there,\" said Duthiers.",
      "\"Looking at that, it's still hard to believe that that's me,\" said Reggie. \"Watching that video just brings back so \u2026 so many questions and \u2014 and pain because \u2026 I see me crying.\"",
      "Reggie wrote a memoir about his experiences titled, \"The Day My Mother Never Came Home.\"",
      "Reggie had no idea that his father was the prime suspect in the case until 25 years later in 2012 when a Texas Ranger showed up at his home. By then, Reggie was 31, had graduated college and was working for a pharmaceutical company near San Antonio.",
      "\"I was like, where's this coming from?\" Reggie told \"48 Hours.\" \"I remember asking, is there any new evidence that was surfaced?\"",
      "But over the next few years, the new lead investigator in the case, Lt. Barry Ward of the Louisiana State Police, was able to come up with new evidence. Eventually, it was enough that Reginald and an alleged accomplice were indicted for second-degree murder.",
      "The accomplice, a friend of Reginald named Jimmy Ray Barnes, agreed to testify against Reginald in exchange for a five-year prison sentence. In November 2022, Reginald Reed Sr. was found guilty of second-degree murder for killing Selonia Reed and was later sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Ward told Reggie that police believe Reginald likely murdered Selonia in their bedroom while Reggie slept. Detectives believe he then placed her body in her car and drove to the spot where it was found. Reginald's co-conspirator Jimmy Ray Barnes testified at trial that he met Reginald at the crime scene and saw Reginald in that car next to Selonia's body.",
      "To this day, Reggie continues to question his father's guilt.",
      "\"I want justice, but I didn't think justice was gonna come at the price of my dad going to prison for life,\" Reggie told Duthiers who asked: \"Do you believe that your father murdered your mother?\"",
      "\"I don't know \u2026 another question \u2014 do I think my dad had some involvement?\u202fMaybe. I don't know though. I don't know. So that's where I'm just, it's like a tug-of-war game.\"",
      "Reggie said he struggles to square what the state claims with the father he knew. Reggie appreciates that his father was loving to him, put him through private school and raised him to be the man he is today.",
      "\"Just knowing the type of father he is,\" Reggie said. \"I can't just turn a page and just look at my father as a complete monster.\"",

      "In 2012, with the help of the FBI, police determined that most of those calls connected to cell towers inside a small area of Massapequa Park, Long Island. They called this area \"the box.\" According to DA Tierney, \"the box\" consisted of a couple of blocks within Massapequa Park.",
      "A suspect in sight",
      "Armed with their small radius of \"the box\" and the description of an \"ogre-like\" man that drove a Chevrolet Avalanche, the task force now had a prime suspect. Police identified an architect named Rex Heuermann as the man they believed may have been responsible for the murders.",
      "And when they looked at Heuermann's personal cellphone records, they say that his phone was in the same area as those burner phones when they were used to contact victims. They also say that when the burner phones contacted victims, they were often in Massapequa Park, where Heuermann lived, or midtown Manhattan, where his architectural firm was located. In 2023, they noticed Heuermann going into a phone store to make a payment on a burner phone.",
      "A DNA hit",
      "Police began to tail Heuermann. When he threw out a pizza box into a trash can in midtown Manhattan, investigators found that Heuermann's DNA on the pizza crust was consistent with a DNA profile found on a male hair discovered with Megan Waterman's body. With DNA evidence, along with the cellphone records linking Heuermann to the burner phones, officers made an arrest.",
      "July 14, 2023: A suspect in custody",
      "Rex Heuermann, of Massapequa Park, Long Island,\u00a0 was\u00a0charged with multiple counts of murder\u00a0in the deaths of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. Heuermann is currently the prime suspect for the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, but he has not been charged with her death.",
      "When asked about Heuermann's innocence at a press conference, Heuerman's attorney Michael Brown said, \"What has my client told me? He told me he didn't do this.\"",
      "Digging for evidence",
      "Police spent 12 days looking through Heuermann's house, pulling guns out of the basement, and digging in the backyard. Another important piece of evidence taken into possession was a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche registered to Heuermann at the time of the murders. It was sitting on property he owns in South Carolina when they recovered it.",
      "An opportunity to kill?",
      "A married man, Heuermann has a daughter and stepson with his second wife, Asa Ellerup. Ellerup, who was born in Iceland, would take the children to see her family there in the summers. It was during these trips and others, police believe, that Heuermann killed the women.",
      "Heuermann pleaded not guilty",
      "Heuermann was arraigned in Suffolk County Court in Riverhead, New York. He pleaded not guilty to the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. The judge ordered that he be held without bail in a Suffolk County jail where he is currently awaiting trial.",
      "Remembering Amber, Melissa and Megan",
      "Investigators hope that the arrest can give victims' families a sense of peace. Police Commissioner Harrison told Erin Moriarty, \"He took away somebody's mother, somebody's daughter, somebody's sister, not just one person, multiple individuals.\"",
      "Other investigations?",
      "Investigations spread to South Carolina and Las Vegas where Heuermann owns property, with detectives there taking a fresh look at cases of missing women. Heuermann has not been charged in any additional investigations.",
      "As for the other bodies found near Gilgo Beach \u2013 Jessica Taylor, Valerie Mack, Karen Vergata, \"Peaches\", the toddler girl, and the Asian male \u2013 none of them have been linked to Heuermann.",
      "Prosecutors: Suspect's cheek swab matches pizza box DNA",
      "DNA from Heuermann's cheek swab matches the DNA that authorities had previously collected from a pizza crust and used to link Heuermann to one of the victims, according to prosecutors during a Sept. 27, 2023 court appearance. Heuermann's lawyer disputed the significance of the DNA sample.",
      "Jan. 16, 2024: Heuermann charged with fourth killing",
      "Six months after his arrest, Rex Heuermann was indicted in the death of a fourth alleged victim, Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Investigators said they linked Brainard-Barnes' murder to Heuermann via DNA from a female hair found in the buckle of a belt used to bind her ankles, feet and legs - eight trillion to one that it matched Heuermann's wife Asa Ellerup or daughter Victoria, who was tailed on a commuter train and threw out an energy drink, according to court documents. Prosecutors made it clear they believed all hair transfer were made from Heuermann to his alleged victims. The family was out of town for the murders of the Gilgo Beach Four. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to the murders.",
      "June 6, 2024: Two more cases linked to Heuermann",
      "Heuermann was charged with\u00a0killing two more women 10 years apart on Long Island \u2014 the 1993 murder of Sandra Costilla and the 2003 murder of Jessica Taylor. Costilla's death was not previously tied to the Gilgo case. The Suffolk County\u00a0district attorney's office says\u00a0DNA from hair found near Costilla and Taylor's remains and pick-up truck evidence connect Heuermann to their killings. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "Dec. 17, 2024: Heuermann charged with 7th killing",
      "Heuermann was charged with killing Valerie Mack, a 24-year-old from New Jersey who had been working as an escort in the Philadelphia area, in 2000. For years, she was known only as \"Jane Doe #6.\" Her partial remains were found in Manorville, Long Island, in 2000, and more of her remains were found on Gilgo Beach more than 10 years later.",

      "Dominick Varrone:\u00a0 Everyone assumed it was Shannan Gilbert.",
      "But it wasn't Shannan. Stunned searchers would go on to discover the remains of four other women. The women were identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. Like Shannan, all were in their 20s. All were online escorts. All petite. Three of the four were wrapped in burlap \u2014 the kind you can find in hunting stores. They became known as the Gilgo Four.",

It wasn't known then, but those two locations \u2013 Long Island and midtown Manhattan \u2013 would become important clues in the hunt for a serial killer.",

      "Ray Tierney: It's, you know, a couple of blocks within \u2014 within Massapequa Park.",

      "Rodney Harrison: Once we were able to attach the \u2026 Avalanche inside of that Massapequa box, which then attached to Rex Heuermann, that was a moment where we said, OK, there's something here.",
      "The task force now had a prime suspect. And when they looked at Heuermann's personal cellphone records, they found that his phone was in the same area as those burner phones when they were used to contact a victim in Massapequa Park or in midtown Manhattan.",

      "And according to court papers, the team also documented three email accounts using fake names, including John Springfield, Thomas Hawk and Hunter1903a3, and all linked to those burner numbers. And prosecutors say that Heuermann was using a burner phone to send these selfies to \"solicit and arrange for sexual activity.\"",
      "One of those accounts linked to Heuermann, prosecutors wrote, was used to conduct \"thousands of searches related to sex workers, sadistic, torture-related pornography and child pornography.\"",

      "The circumstantial evidence was building, but investigators also had physical evidence from the Gilgo Four\u2014including one male hair that was found in the burlap used to \"restrain and transport\" Megan Waterman's body. They wanted to see if they could link it to Heuermann.",
      "Police tailed Heuermann, and when he threw out a pizza box in a trash can in midtown Manhattan \u2014 they pounced.",
      "Ray Tierney: The pizza, which was \u2026 obviously very significant.",
      "Tierney says that Heuermann's DNA that was found on that pizza crust was consistent with a DNA profile from the hair found with Megan Waterman's body, and that DNA profile is only found in .04 percent of the population.",
      "Ray Tierney: That was a remarkable day. It was, you know, the weekend and, you know, you read, you get the report and you read it and then you read it again, and then you read it a third time and then you read it a fourth time, and then you start making calls.",
      "With the DNA, the search histories and the burner phone evidence, the team felt it was time.",
      "Ray Tierney: When we decided to take down the case, we, you know, it was a sudden decision. \u2026 We did see him contacting a number \u2014 of sex workers \u2026 using a burner phone, which obviously is concerning.",

      "After Rex Heuermann's arrest, his quiet neighborhood in Massapequa Park was overrun by investigators and media, focusing intense scrutiny on the ramshackle home and its remaining residents: his stepson, Christopher Sheridan; daughter, Victoria Heuermann, and his wife more than 25 years, Asa Ellerup.",
      "Bob Macedonio: So, their life going forward is always gonna be the wife or the children of (a) suspected serial killer. That's what it's gonna be from now on.",
      "Attorney Bob Macedonio represents Ellerup, who has since filed for divorce from Heuermann. He says she was as stunned as anyone by the accusations.",
      "Bob Macedonio: She had no idea any of this was going on \u2026 The allegations are shocking. Nobody wants to think that they've been living with, sleeping next to a serial killer for the past 25 years.",
      "As it turns out, Ellerup may have inadvertently helped focus the investigation on her husband. Investigators say they've identified strands of female hair that were found on two of the victims.",
      "D.A. Ray Tierney | Suffolk County: One hair on Waterman \u2026 comes back to his wife, or the DNA profiles are consistent. And then \u2026 the DNA profile from Costello is consistent with \u2026 the wife.",
      "Although prosecutors have evidence that Ellerup was out of town when those murders occurred, they will have to explain how those hairs got on the victims. Suffolk County D.A. Ray Tierney says it could be as simple as transfer.",
      "Ray Tierney: You live at home with a spouse a little bit of your hair falls on your shoulder, as well as your spouse's. Then you go out and you interact with the third party and that hair gets on them.",
      "Ellerup has not been charged or named a suspect in any of the murders.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You don't believe that Rex Heuermann's wife was involved in this in any way?",
      "Ray Tierney: There's no evidence to indicate that. No.",
      "Along with the public scrutiny of Ellerup, there has also been support from people that perhaps know all too well what she's going through. Kerri Rawson, the daughter of serial killer Dennis Rader, who named himself BTK, tweeted: \"Asa and her kids are also victims.\"",

It is money he says will largely go to medical bills \u2014 Asa is battling breast and skin cancer. And because Rex Heuermann was the sole provider for the family, Macedonio says she will soon lose her health insurance.",
      "BOB MACEDONIO (at news conference): Asa would like me to express her thanks for the support she has received. Um, she is going through a very difficult time.",
      "Ellerup's children have also paid a heavy price. Her daughter, Victoria, who worked for her father at the architectural consulting firm, and her son, Christopher, are both now unemployed. Ellerup struggles to support them, says Macedonio, while she's also trying to figure out how to start over.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How is she getting through every day?",
      "Bob Macedonio: Honestly?",
      "Erin Moriarty: Yeah.",
      "Bob Macedonio: Minute by minute. \u2026 She has no one else to turn into at this time. \u2026 Family and friends have been hesitant to have her come over because they don't want the media attention. She gets followed wherever she goes.",
      "For the moment, she and her children continue to live in the house in Massapequa Park, which the family says was excessively damaged during the police search. It's a daily reminder of the unimaginable crimes her estranged husband is charged with and the investigation that continues into what else he may have done.",
      "THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY?",
      "Rex Heuermann, awaiting trial, is locked inside a Suffolk County jail in a 60-square-foot cell. He denies killing Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello \u2014 their voices now silent as the sand where they had been ruthlessly discarded.",

And while \"48 Hours\" cannot substantiate her story, Brass claims she can't shake her memory of the night she says she was solicited for sex by Rex Heuermann, and says she fled the restaurant where they met.",
      "Nikkie Brass: I had never gone anywhere and like felt, fear. My gut was telling me I needed to get away and I never had that before.",
      "Brass says what she found most disturbing is that Heuermann himself brought up those bodies bound in burlap by Gilgo Beach.",
      "Nikkie Brass: He wanted to, like, really get into it. Like, he asked me how I thought they could get rid of the bodies without being caught in that area. And I said, like, I've never been over there. \u2026 I've never even seen Gilgo Beach. \u2026 And his response was, well, it's really dark and desolate.",

      "Rodney Harrison: It's an unfortunate incident, but right now we believe that she just ran into the marsh and unfortunately drowned.",
      "A former investigator told us that he believes Shannan was high on drugs that night and says her death was an accident \u2014 something John Ray just can't believe. While he doesn't think Shannan was a victim of Heuermann, he does believe she was murdered and points to that 911 call.",
      "John Ray (December 2013): It makes absolutely no sense that she's found where she is, except that someone else put her there, or killed her there.",
      "While questions remain about Shannan's last hours, there's no question she's the reason so many families may finally be getting answers they have long waited for. \"48 Hours\" spoke to her sister, Sherre Gilbert, in 2011.",

Some of those policies were taken out the same month that Selonia was murdered.",
      "Ward wanted to reinterview Reggie Jr. in 2012. Reggie was 31 years old and living in Texas. Ward sent a Texas Ranger to begin the questioning.",
      "Reggie Reed: \u2026 he told me why he was here, and it was to \u2026 discuss \u2026 my mother's murder.",
      "And the Ranger then told Reggie something he said he'd never heard before.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: He was not aware that his father was a suspect in the murder of his mother.",
      "Reggie Reed: But I was like, where's this coming from? Like, it's been over three decades \u2026\u00a0 You're talking about my dad like killed my mom, like, seriously \u2026 I remember asking, \"is there any new evidence that was surfaced?\" \u2026 And it was nothing new.",
      "It's true that the insurance policies had been discovered by the original detectives, but Ward had organized them in a way that he felt was damning. The Texas Ranger asked Reggie about those policies.",
      "Reggie Reed: He showed me a graph, a timeline \u2026 it showed each insurance policy that were taken out close to her death.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: Did you all of a sudden say, I need to get to the bottom of this or what?",
      "Reggie Reed: It was eye-opening \u2026 cause I'm like, well, that doesn't look good \u2026 I got to learn what, like what's all this?",
      "Reggie struggled to make sense of it all.",
      "Reggie Reed: I did talk to my dad about it over the phone, and his response was \u2026 he -- he took out policies on everyone.",
      "Reggie said he finds it hard to square what the investigation revealed with the loving father who raised him.",
      "Reggie Reed: I look back, I'm like, man, he really -- he really did do some great stuff for me. He was a great provider.",
      "Ward took a deep dive into the case file and focused on that Winston cigarette butt found in Selonia's car. He sent it out for DNA testing, something that was not widely available in 1987. There was a match in the national crime DNA database CODIS, but not to Jimmy Ray.",
      "Barry Ward: It came back to \u2026 a man by the name of Billy Ray Barnes.",
      "Billy Ray was Jimmy Ray's identical twin brother, and the DNA supervisor had another surprise.",
      "Barry Ward: He let me know that identical twins share identical DNA.",
      "Ward decided he had to interview Jimmy Ray and it turned out that Jimmy Ray had been holding onto some key information all these years.",
      "Barry Ward: Jimmy Ray Barnes did tell me \u2026 that Reginald Reed offered him $50,000 to, quote-unquote, knock off his wife.",
      "NEW EVIDENCE HEATS UP A DECADES-OLD COLD CASE",
      "In July 2012, Lt. Barry Ward went on the hunt for Jimmy Ray Barnes, who had become a prime suspect in the Selonia Reed murder case after his DNA was linked to the crime scene.",
      "Ward found Jimmy Ray Barnes in the Atlanta area where he said Jimmy Ray told him he'd fled Hammond because he was afraid of Reginald Reed. Jimmy Ray Barnes said back then, he'd been shot at three times and hit once in the neck. He suspected the shooter was Reginald Sr. but had no proof.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: Jimmy said he was known to carry a gun. But you fast forward \u2026 25, now 30 years \u2026 Reginald Reed was now an old man.",
      "Barnes was ready to talk about Reed without a lawyer.",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: I ain't got nothing to hide.",

      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: Right. Right.",
      "LT. BARRY WARD: What was your response to that?",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: Hell, no.",
      "LT. BARRY WARD: Did he discuss any money with you?",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: Yeah, he has. He discussed money.",
      "Ward pressed Barnes to tell him how much money.",
      "LT. BARRY WARD: More than $5,000?",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: Yeah.",
      "BARRY WARD: More than $10,000?",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: Yeah.",

      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: Yeah.",
      "BARRY WARD: \u2026 is that a guess or is that the amount he offered?",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: That was the amount he offered.",
      "But Barnes told Ward that he would not repeat the story in court.",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: \u2026 I don't trust the law no more.",
      "Ward confronted Barnes about that polygraph test from the original case file. Barnes allegedly had passed that polygraph, but Ward suspected Jimmy Ray secretly had asked his identical twin Billy Ray to take that test.",
      "LT. BARRY WARD: I talked to Billy \u2026 and he said he took that polygraph test \u2026 And if Billy looked like you and was questioned over a murder that you took part in and he doesn't know anything about it, he's probably going to pass that polygraph test. Would that be fair to say?",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES: I don't know. I'm not going to answer that cause I -- I know I'm the one who took the polygraph test.",
      "Ward believed he had a solid case to finally bring charges. He had Jimmy Ray's DNA connected to the crime scene and his videotaped statement about Reginald offering him $50,000 to kill Selonia. But, Ward said, prosecutors always wanted more.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: I would get phone calls through the years from \u2026 prosecutors \u2026 who had asked me to reinterview family members \u2026 find out additional information, test more evidence \u2026 it was busy work.",
      "Then, in 2018, a newly hired prosecutor, Taylor Anthony, got assigned the case.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: Why reopen a 35-year-old case? What was the trigger?",
      "Taylor Anthony: Well, why reopen it? It's an interesting question \u2026 this was a case to me right away when I looked at it \u2026 that there was a story to be told.",
      "Anthony was impressed by all the investigative work done by Ward, so he reached out, but Ward told Anthony he was too busy and that he felt he'd been let down by other prosecutors.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: My initial response was to just get this guy off the phone.",
      "Taylor Anthony: He said, look, I've already poured hundreds of man hours into that case \u2026 and y'all, didn't do anything and \u2026 He said \u2026 You're wasting your time, kid \u2026 have a nice life, basically.",
      "But Anthony was undeterred and promised Ward that, this time, things would be different.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: I think he saw what I saw \u2026 I think that made all the difference in the world \u2026",
      "Like Ward, Anthony was sure Jimmy Ray Barnes knew a lot more, so he and Ward took a road trip to Atlanta.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: And we were able to locate Jimmy. He was staying in a camper at his employer's place.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: We pulled up early in the morning when the sun was coming up and he was coming out of this camper \u2026 putting a belt in his pants. \u2026 And he said, uh, hey, \"who y'all looking for?\" \u2026 I said, \"you, Jimmy.\" And he goes, \"Oh, you, again.\"",
      "But this time the new prosecutor had with him an agreement, approved by a judge, giving Barnes complete immunity if he testified to everything he knew about Selonia's murder.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: So to the layperson, you offered him a deal?",
      "Taylor Anthony: So, I offered him what I would say would be the golden ticket.",
      "But Barnes rejected the offer.",
      "Taylor Anthony: He did not trust me. He did not believe me. He did not want to talk to us.",
      "Ward and Anthony were about to drive back to Louisiana when Barnes said something that took them by surprise.",
      "Taylor Anthony: \u2026 as Barry and I were \u2026 getting back in the car, Jimmy Ray Barnes came over to us and he said, I want you boys to know that I'm the key to it all. And he said \u2026 if you think you can indict me for murder, then do it.",
      "Anthony was quick to take him up on that challenge.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: A couple of weeks later \u2026 a grand jury in Tangipahoa Parish returned second-degree murder indictments for both Reginald Reed and Jimmy Ray Barnes. \u2026 immediately \u2026 we went to Reginald's home \u2026 I knocked on the door, identified who I was and that I had an arrest warrant for him for the murder of his wife \u2026 He \u2026 really had no emotion.",
      "The date was June 21, 2019, more than 30 years after Selonia's murder.",
      "Gwen Smith: \u2026 when Reginald was arrested \u2026 it was like, it was like a burden just got my chest, like a burden was lifted off.",
      "Reggie Reed: I got a call \u2026 that my father was indicted for second-degree murder and conspiracy, along with a co-defendant for my mother's murder.",
      "Reggie Jr. put up his father's $250,000 bail bond.",
      "Reggie Reed: \u2026 my dad being my rock for so many years, I felt the need to try to help him.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: Now that you are both adults \u2026 did you ever ask him those questions that you have that you're questioning even now as we sit here?",
      "Reggie Reed: Yeah. I asked him -- I asked him. And he -- he -- he maintains his innocence.",
      "Sitting in another Hammond jail cell was Jimmy Ray Barnes. He now had a lawyer and asked to speak with Det. Barry Ward and Taylor Anthony.",
      "Taylor Anthony: So, Barry and I went and met with him again. \u2026 And in exchange for him telling us everything he knew \u2026 he was offered a deal to plead to accessory after the fact to murder and was given a five-year prison sentence.",
      "The homicide trial of Reginald Reed Sr. was scheduled for November 2022 and Jimmy Ray Barnes had agreed to testify. Reggie hoped to hear never-before-revealed details of what had happened to his mother.",
      "Reggie Reed: I want to know what happened.",
      "WHY WAS SELONIA REED MURDERED?",
      "In November 2022, the murder trial of Reginald Reed Sr. began in Amite, Louisiana. He was represented by the mother and daughter defense team of Vanessa Williams and LaToia Williams-Simon.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: What makes you think \u2026 that he did not murder Selonia?",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: Their entire case is circumstantial.",
      "Williams-Simon says the state's case was weak: there was no murder weapon, no fingerprints or DNA tying Reed to Selonia's homicide.",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: I was confused as to how they were really gonna prove their case. \u2026 There's no direct evidence.",
      "But prosecutor Taylor Anthony believed his prosecution would deliver justice to Selonia.",
      "Taylor Anthony: The reason I became a prosecutor is to fight for people like this \u2026 I see a woman \u2026 whose body has been desecrated, violated, mutilated, and nobody spoke up for her and fought for her. And there is a quote that I love, and it goes \u2026 \"The dead cannot cry out for justice. It is the duty of the living to do so for them.\" \u2026 And that's my job.",
      "Anthony told jurors about the $700,000 from the insurance policies on Selonia's life.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: So, what was your theory once you put all these pieces together?",
      "Taylor Anthony: My theory was that \u2026 Selonia and Reginald were in a marriage that was about to come to an end \u2026 there was a history of abuse and that Selonia was tired of it and she was ready to leave Reginald. ... I think \u2026 he was angry and he saw an opportunity for some money. \u2026 I think that's why he killed this woman.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: The case that they're presenting, which is this man takes out all these life insurance policies on a young, healthy 26-year-old woman \u2026 what is his rationale for having done that?",
      "Vanessa Williams: But they're missing the biggest part of it.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: Which is?",
      "Vanessa Williams: It wasn't just on her. It was on himself. It was on the child. \u2026 It was family policies. So, it's not like he just went and took out policies on Selonia only.",
      "Prosecutor Anthony was frank with jurors, telling them that the state would not produce a murder weapon or the exact location where Selonia was stabbed. He focused on what the prosecution did have, including that white lotion found on Selonia's body.",
      "Taylor Anthony: \u2026 later police were able to find a bottle of lotion in the Reed household that matched that type of lotion that was on her body.",
      "The prosecutor also showed jurors a photograph of some scratches on Reginald Reed Sr.'s neck taken on the day Selonia's body was found.",
      "Taylor Anthony: They wanted to take photographs of his neck, and he was very hesitant \u2026",
      "Anthony said Reed told police two different stories about how he got those scratches but after forensic testing, it was determined that none of Reginald's DNA was found under Selonia's fingernails.",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: They believe that the killer is Mr. Reginald Reed. So, anything that goes to contradict that they're gonna completely block out.",
      "Williams-Simon pointed to Jimmy Ray Barnes' long criminal record of arrests.",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: It couldn't be introduced at trial.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: Because?",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: And the reason why his criminal rap sheet couldn't be introduced at trial is because these aren't convictions \u2026",
      "But Williams-Simon says Jimmy Ray's arrests were for violent crimes.",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: False imprisonment and aggravated assault, aggravated battery with a dangerous weapon, murder \u2026 These are things that the jury had a right to know, but because of the law, they didn't find out.",
      "Jimmy Ray Barnes ultimately took the stand as part of his plea agreement. There were no cameras in the courtroom. In a recording taken from Barnes' police interview conducted by Ward before the trial, he told the same story as when he testified:",
      "On the night of the murder, Barnes said he promised to meet Reginald Reed Sr. in the parking area outside John's Curb Market where Selonia's body had been found.",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES (recorded interview): When I got there, he was getting out of the little blue car. The little blue car was parked there.",
      "Barnes said Reginald Sr. asked for his help in moving Selonia's body.",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES (recorded interview): I said no, I wasn't, I wasn't getting involved in that. He wanted me to move the body, and I didn't want to move, and I didn't move the body.",
      "Barnes says that Selonia was fully clothed when he saw her, and sitting in the passenger seat.",
      "JIMMY RAY BARNES (recorded interview): I did see the body in there. And uh, I panicked ...",
      "Taylor Anthony: My understanding after the fact is that Jimmy Ray Barnes talked to Reggie [Sr.] and said, \"where is the money? You told me $50,000.\" \u2026 he says he never got a penny of it.",
      "Prosecutor Anthony contends that, after the men drove away, Reginald Reed Sr. returned and \"staged\" the crime scene, stripping off Selonia's clothes, covering her with that white lotion, and leaving other evidence to make it appear as a sex crime.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: And what does your dad say to that?",
      "Reggie Reed: He says it's completely BS. He says \u2026 it's no way. We were at home playing Nintendo.",
      "Williams-Simon had her own theory of what happened that night.",
      "LaToia Williams-Simon: All of the information that we've received about Jimmy Ray Barnes is that \u2026 he was borderline obsessed with Selonia \u2026 I believe that maybe he encountered her, tried to make a pass at her that was \u2026 rejected, and that's where you see that anger, that rage, that hatred.",
      "Sitting through the trial, Reggie admitted that the relentless focus on his mother's murder was upsetting, especially as he watched that crime scene video which he had never seen before.",
      "Reggie Reed: \u2026 and it really struck a chord \u2026 by just seeing my mother there, um, (crying) lifeless, and just alone, and dead.",
      "Reginald Reed Sr. never took the stand and after less than a week of testimony, the case went to the jury. Reggie Jr. braced for the verdict.",
      "AFTER THE VERDICT, REGGIE REED JR. STILL CRIES OUT FOR HIS FATHER",
      "Taylor Anthony: \u2026 as a prosecutor, \u00a0when the jury deliberates \u2026 it's painstaking. You're just \u2026 waiting and waiting and waiting.",
      "Some of Reginald Reed's brothers and sisters -- Kennedy Reed, Belinda Reed Cox, and Claude Reed -- were waiting as well.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: Claude, you don't believe your brother murdered Selonia.",
      "Claude Reed: No, I don't. I don't believe Reggie (Sr.) did that.",
      "Belinda Reed Cox: My brother's not a murderer. He's not.",
      "But on Nov. 18, 2022, Reginald Reed Sr. was found guilty of second-degree murder after the jury deliberated for just over three hours.",
      "Reggie Reed: \u2026 when he was found guilty, I feel like he died without dying (crying). \u2026 And I saw myself as that same 6-year-old crying out for my dad as I did in that [1987 police interview] video.",
      "Reggie Reed: And I just want it to end.",
      "Reggie tried to recapture the moment his father was found guilty in his book.",
      "Reggie Reed (reading from book): My father grabbed me up into a big hug. \u2026 I wanted to stay there forever \u2026 he pulled back for a moment, looked me in the eyes and kissed me on the forehead. \u2026 We embraced once more, and then, they took him away from me.",
      "Taylor Anthony: I wanted to \u2026 tell him, I'm sorry \u2026 for the loss of your mother. I'm sorry for your father going to prison \u2026 I can't even imagine the grieving process that he's got to be going through.",
      "Reggie says sitting through the trial was excruciating. But when it was over, he still wanted answers.",
      "Reggie Reed: This is my parents' room.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: Lieutenant Ward has told you that one of his theories is that your mother may have been killed in this room.",
      "Reggie Reed: In this room \u2026 I just go back thinking of the manner in the way, which she was killed. If she was killed here, how is that possible that they couldn't find anything?",
      "In light of Lt. Ward's information, Reggie now wonders if his father killed his mother while he was asleep in the next room.",
      "Reggie Reed: \u2026 Where was I? \u2026 did you leave the house after I fell asleep \u2026?",
      "Questions Reggie cannot answer because he simply does not remember.",
      "On Jan. 30, 2023, everyone piled back into the same courtroom where Reginald was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He did not offer any kind of explanation or statement and said nothing.",
      "Reggie Reed: You know I want justice, but I didn't think justice was gonna come at the price of my dad going to prison for life.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: So, my question is, do you believe that your father murdered your mother?",
      "Reggie Reed: I don't know.",
      "Reggie Reed: Another question, do I think my dad had some involvement? \u2026 Maybe. I don't know though. I don't know. \u2026 So that's where I'm just, it's like a tug-of-war game.",
      "Reggie Reed: \u2026 just knowing the type of father he is \u2026 I can't just turn a page and just look at my father as a complete monster \u2026",
      "Selonia's sister Gwen Smith always believed Reginald was Selonia's killer. Although she and Reggie Jr. are estranged, she still worries about him.",
      "Gwen Smith: I just kind of felt bad for him, you know, because \u2026 his mom was taken away from him when he was a little boy.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: What do you want people to know about this case \u2026 if you could sum it up for me.",
      "Kennedy Reed: I know one thing; my brother did not commit this murder \u2026",
      "For Ward, who worked on the Selonia Reed case for a decade, the conviction was just, and he appreciates that Jimmy Ray Barnes agreed to testify.",
      "Lt. Barry Ward: Jimmy Ray Barnes was the key.",
      "Barnes served his sentence for being an accessory after the fact to murder. He was freed from prison and, shortly after, on Jan. 27, 2024, he was killed in a car accident. He was in Hammond to attend the funeral of his identical twin.",
      "Charles Muse: There are several cases throughout my career that stick out to me. And this is probably the -- the main one.",
      "Charles Muse, the Hammond police officer who found Selonia's body, is pleased he got to see the outcome of the case.",
      "Charles Muse: I mean her death, you know, didn't just go in vain. \u2026 I find some peace in that.",
      "Vladimir Duthiers: You say that you wish you would've gotten to know her better, but then you realize too, you must, that she's living through you that she's here because you're here.",
      "Reggie Reed: Absolutely \u2026 And I think about that she's in a place where she's consistently \u2026 watching over me.",

    "story": [
      "Antoni Gaudi, the designer of Barcelona's famous Sagrada Familia basilica, has been put on the path to sainthood by the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced Monday.",
      "Gaudi, nicknamed \"God's architect\" for his stunning work designing the unfinished Sagrada Familia, was recognized by Pope Francis for his \"heroic virtues\" and authorized a decree declaring him \"venerable,\" the Vatican said in a statement.",
      "This acknowledgment comes before beatification, and the next step after that is sainthood.",
      "Beatification is reserved for three categories of people: martyrs, those who have lived a life of heroic values and others with a clear saintly reputation.",
      "Candidates must also be credited with a miracle after their death, at which point they can move toward becoming saints.",
      "The Catholic Church began in 2003 to vet Gaudi, a visionary and pious Catalan architect who died in 1926.",
      "Two decades later, in 2023, Cardinal Juan Jose Omella, Archbishop of Barcelona, commissioned a group of religious and lay people to press his cause.",
      "Gaudi, who was born in 1852, was a prolific architect whose distinctive style was characterized by freedom of form, color and texture. He worked almost entirely in or near Barcelona. Seven properties built by Gaudi, including Parque G\u00fcell, Palacio G\u00fcell and the Sagrada Familia are named in\u00a0UNESCO's World Heritage List.",
      "Gaudi was a devout Catholic and believed the church's construction was his way to make amends with God for the sins of the modern world, \"60 Minutes\" reported. Construction of the basilica is expected to be\u00a0completed in 2026, after more than a century.",
      "The Sagrada Familia was consecrated in 2010 by Pope Benedict XVI, paving the way for its use as a place of worship.",
      "At the time, Benedict praised \"the genius of Antoni Gaudi.... (who), inspired by the ardor of his Christian faith, succeeded in transforming this church into a praise to God made of stone.\"",
      "The signing of the decree was the first official appointment on Francis's agenda since the 88-year-old was discharged on March 23 following five weeks in hospital battling life-threatening pneumonia.",

      "Belief in witchcraft remains common in many rural communities along the west African coast, including Ghana, and elsewhere in the continent. Earlier this year, two men in Zambia were charged with practicing witchcraft and possessing charms intended to harm the country's president.",
      "People accused of witchcraft are usually banished from their home areas and in Ghana they seek refuge in camps run by traditional priests \"where they remain until they die or a family member or another community accepts them,\" the rights monitor said.",
      "Amnesty said Ghana had not done enough to protect victims, stressing the need for a sensitization campaign in vulnerable areas.",

      "\"These talks will be held at a location planned by the Omani host, with representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States seated in the halls and sides, conveying their points of view and positions to each other through the Omani Foreign Minister,\" Baghaei wrote.",
      "About an hour later, Baghaei appeared on Iranian state television and acknowledged the talks had been going on all that time.",
      "\"The objective of the Islamic Republic of Iran is very clear \u2014 we have only one goal, and that is to safeguard Iran's national interests,\" he said. \"We are giving a genuine and honest opportunity to diplomacy, so that through dialogue, we can move forward on the nuclear issue on one hand, and more importantly for us, the lifting of sanctions.\"",
      "Baghaei added: \"Look, this is just a beginning. So it is natural that, at this stage, both sides will present their foundational positions through the Omani mediator. Therefore, we do not expect this round of negotiations to be lengthy.\"",

      "\"If there is sufficient will on both sides, we will decide on a timetable. But it is still too early to talk about that,\" Araghchi said, in an audio clip published by IRNA. \"What is clear now is that the negotiations are indirect, and in our view only on the nuclear issue, and will be conducted with the necessary will to reach an agreement that is on an equal footing and leads to securing the national interests of the Iranian people.\"",
      "Trump and Witkoff both had described the talks as being \"direct.\"",
      "\"I think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today,\" Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal before his trip. \"That doesn't mean, by the way, that at the margin we're not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.\"",
      "He added: \"Where our red line will be, there can't be weaponization of your nuclear capability,\"",
      "Sanctions relief and enrichment remain top issues",
      "While the U.S. side can offer sanctions relief for Iran's beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, Tehran's stockpile could allow it to build multiple nuclear weapons if it so chooses and it has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Judging from negotiations since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%.",
      "One thing it won't do is give up its program entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution \u2014 \"you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution\" \u2014 unworkable.",

      "The Rapid Support Forces and allied militias launched an offensive on the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk camps and the nearby city of el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur province, on Friday, said U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami.",
      "El-Fasher is under the control of the military, which has fought the RSF since Sudan descended into civil war two years ago, killing more than 24,000 people, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is likely far higher.",
      "The camps were attacked again on Saturday, Nkweta-Salami said in a statement. She said that nine aid workers were killed \"while operating one of the very few remaining health posts still operational\" in Zamzam camp.",

They include Dr. Mahmoud Babaker Idris, a physician at the hospital, and Adam Babaker Abdallah, head of the group in the region, the union said. It blamed the RSF for \"this criminal and barbaric act.\"",
      "In a statement Saturday evening, Relief International mourned the death of its nine workers, saying they were killed the previous day in a \"targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region,\" including the group's clinic.",
      "The group said the central market in Zamzam along with hundreds of makeshift homes in the camp were destroyed in the attack.",
      "The offensive forced about 2,400 people to flee the camps and el-Fasher, according to the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees, a local group in Darfur.",
      "Zamzam and Abu Shouk shelter more than 700,000 people who have been forced to flee their homes across Darfur during past bouts of fighting in the region, Nkweta-Salami said.",
      "Late last month, the Sudanese military regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war. But the RSF still controls most of Darfur and some other areas.",
      "The two camps are among five areas in Sudan where famine was detected by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, IPC, a global hunger monitoring group.

    "summary": "Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan belonged to an enigmatic group of early human ancestors called Denisovans, scientists reported Thursday.",
      "Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and our own species, Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Denisovan fossils are very scarce,\" with only a few confirmed finds in East Asia, said study co-author Takumi Tsutaya at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan.",
      "So far, the only known Denisovan fossils include partial jawbones, a few teeth and part of a finger bone found in caves in Siberia and Tibet. Some scientists believe fossils found in a cave in Laos may also belong to Denisovans.",
      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",
      "At one time, at least three human ancestor groups - Denisovans, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens - coexisted in Eurasia and sometimes interbred, researchers say.",
      "\"We can identity Neanderthal elements and Denisovan elements\" in the DNA of some people alive today, said Tsutaya.",
      "Scientists still don't know exactly why Denisovans went extinct.",
      "\"We have so little archaeological and fossil information about Denisovans that we can only speculate as to why they disappeared,\" Welker told Reuters. \"A lasting legacy, though, is that some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry some Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. and Russian intelligence agencies negotiated an agreement to free American Ksenia Karelina in exchange for a Russian detainee.",
    "story": [
      "Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason in August last year, in a new prison swap on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed her release in a social media post early Thursday, but offered no information about the terms of her release.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported\u00a0Karelina's release, saying she was freed in a swap arranged by the two countries' intelligence agencies, and a CIA official later told CBS News that the agency had played a central role in the deal on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"American Ksenia Karelina is on a plane back home to the United States,\" Rubio said in his post. \"She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release.\"",
      "The plane landed around 11 p.m. EDT at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where she was greeted by several people including her boyfriend, professional boxer Chris van Heerden. In a touching moment, Karelina and van Heerden had a long embrace.",
      "In a statement first published by the Journal and later provided to CBS News, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said, \"President Trump brought home another wrongfully detained American from Russia,\" and added his praise for \"the CIA officers who worked tirelessly to support this effort\" and for the United Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which he said had enabled the exchange. The swap of the two detainees was carried out in Abu Dhabi.",
      "Ratcliffe was directly involved in the negotiations, which he conducted with an unnamed senior Russian intelligence official, the CIA said.",
      "The top level communication indicates a deepening of efforts by the Trump administration to improve ties with Moscow. Mr. Trump has been pushing both Russia and Ukraine to negotiate a peace agreement to end the three-year war sparked by Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of its neighbor.",
      "In exchange for Karelina, who lives in California, the CIA official confirmed that the U.S. had freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus 2023 at the request of U.S. authorities. According to the Journal, he was being held on allegations of exporting sensitive microelectronics.",
      "\"Much of the swap was negotiated by the U.S. government, with CIA playing a key role engaging with Russian intelligence,\" a CIA spokesperson said Thursday, adding, \"The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.\"",
      "Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in a Russian penal colony after pleading guilty to treason. She was arrested while on visit to Russia for donating about $51 to an American-based humanitarian group that was helping Ukrainians impacted by the war, according to Russian state media.",
      "Her lawyers said she acknowledged transferring the funds, though she did not admit she intentionally directed them to organizations that might have used the money for actions against Russia. She didn't expect that her donation would end up supporting anti-Russian activities, according to her lawyers.",
      "Van Heerden\u00a0told CBS News last year that she had made the small donation in 2022, \"exercising her First Amendment rights,\" adding that \"she has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Van Heerden said he was uneasy about Karelina's decision to return to Russia for a visit, given the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, but he said she \"had no worry in the world,\" and that she had assured him it would be safe since she was entering the country as a dual American-Russian citizen.",
      "\"She wanted to go home. She made it very clear that she wanted to go home,\" Van Heerden told Gayle King on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Wanting to fulfill her wish to visit home, Van Heerden said he bought her a plane ticket as a birthday gift, and the pair first traveled together to Istanbul. He had originally intended to travel with her to Russia from there, but he didn't feel comfortable, so she traveled alone to Russia, and he returned to Los Angeles.",
      "Russia imprisoned a number of Americans as tension with Washington soared amid the build up to, and eventually the full-scale war in Ukraine. Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u00a0and teacher\u00a0Marc Fogel\u00a0were all designated wrongfully detained like Karelina and freed in previous prisoner swaps with Moscow.",

      "He said that the movie educates children \"on two levels: You're teaching them not only about the faith that you adhere to, but you're weaving in this incredible, iconic novelist that you're introducing them to on some level, and it just becomes a frame of reference for families.\"",

      "Mel Gibson proved 20 years ago that faith-based movies can be successful \"when Hollywood kind of turned its back on this audience and Gibson put his own money\" towards \"The Passion of the Christ,\" and \"took a chance on a narrative that was, you know, set in a foreign tongue, you know, 2,000-year-old stories set in foreign tongue and broke box office records,\" Arroyo said.",

    "summary": "Garth Brooks details his 2014 comeback to country music and the way technology &quot;gutted&quot; the music industry in his new book, &quot;The Anthology Part V.&quot;",
    "story": [
      "The country music couple posed Monday in front of Trisha Yearwood's Hollywood star.",
      "In 2014, when Garth Brooks made the decision to return to country music after leaving the industry for 14 years to raise his children, he found a remarkably different world than the one he'd known.",
      "The singer-songwriter announced his retirement in 2000 when he was at the top of his game, having released mega-hits like \"Friends in Low Places\" and \"The River\" during the '90s. After several years out of the spotlight spent taking care of his three daughters in his home state of Oklahoma, Brooks moved to Nashville after his youngest child made the decision to attend Belmont University in the city.",
      "When he arrived, he found that Music City had turned into a \"gutted town.\"",
      "GARTH BROOKS GAVE UP BEING \u2018BIGGEST SUPERSTAR ON PLANET\u2019 TO RAISE KIDS IN OKLAHOMA",
      "Garth Brooks performs at the ASCAP Centennial Awards at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City on Nov. 17, 2014. (Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for ASCAP)",
      "As Brooks wrote in his new book, \"The Anthology Part V,\" after he and his wife, fellow country superstar Trisha Yearwood, made the move back to Nashville, \"I saw that we'd lost over 80 percent of our songwriters. They were gone.\"",
      "He continued, \"It was a gutted town when it came to songwriters. And, I'm sorry, try and feed the world without farmers. The songwriters? They're the farmers that feed music, and they were gone. So you kind of said, okay, you're getting back into this thing. But there's a lot I am not happy about that's happened in the last fourteen years. \u2026 It created a mood. Things got darker.\"",
      "\"As much as I love songwriting, and as much as I love the publishers that independently push their songs, what's happened to the songwriter is technology.\"",
      "Brooks touched on the same topic again in another portion of the book, once again saying that Nashville had been \"gutted\" when he returned from Oklahoma. He wrote that he'd seen before \"how songwriters made a living and how dreams come true,\" but in 2014, all he could see \"was all we had lost.\"",
      "Garth Brooks performs for the Parade of Pennies in Nashville, Tennessee, on Jan. 1, 1989. (Beth Gwinn/Getty Images)",
      "Later in the book, when discussing his comeback album and its title track, \"Man Against Machine,\" Brooks explained more about what had changed in the 14 years he'd been gone: technology.",
      "\"As much as I love songwriting, and as much as I love the publishers that independently push their songs, what's happened to the songwriter is technology,\" the singer-songwriter explained. \"For fourteen years I watched from the sidelines as music fell a victim to technology.\"",
      "\"The iPod comes out, which leads to the smartphone. And music made the mistake of backing down to technology, because the threat that technology made to music was this: \u2018If you\u2019re not going to play our game, then all the iPods and smartphones will be filled with illegally downloaded stuff. And there's nothing we can do about that.'\"",
      "He added, \"Music blinked, and bam!, they let technology price their product. And all I can say is, can you believe \u2018Hotel California\u2019 is worth only 99 cents? \u2026 We understood that technology was taking over music, would eventually choke and damn near kill music while the technology prospered.\"",

      "Brooks struggled with navigating the change in the music industry as he also dealt with all the changes in his personal life \u2014 the move from Oklahoma to Tennessee and his last child leaving home (he admitted that \"the empty nest hit me a lot harder than I ever dreamed it would\") \u2014 but he said that the idea of streaming music \"might have been the hardest to get my head around.\"",
      "Coming from a time when fans had to buy physical copies of albums and singles and entering into a new era when so much was focused on digital products was something that he admitted he \"wasn't seeing a way through.\"",
      "To combat the issues he saw with digital music, Brooks launched GhostTunes in September 2014, his own digital music store, with the intent of giving a greater portion of money from the sales of the music to songwriters and artists. In 2017, GhostTunes was absorbed into Amazon Music, but as he wrote in \"The Anthology Part V,\" he doesn't consider it a failed business venture.",
      "Garth Brooks talks to the media during his World Tour Press Conference at Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois, on Sept. 4, 2014. (David Banks/Getty Images)",
      "\"Anybody that calls GhostTunes a mistake can't see the writing on the wall, that technology is f---ing music over. The genie is so far out of the bottle at this point. I never want to offend anyone. With that said, my opinion is technology has no love for art. None whatsoever. It just has a love for something that can sell its hardware and software,\" he explained.",
      "GARTH BROOKS LEADS DOLLY PARTON, ED SHEERAN AS HOLLYWOOD STARS SHUN TECHNOLOGY",
      "Also in September 2014, Brooks kicked off The Garth Brooks World Tour \u2014 his first since his previous world tour wrapped in 1998. He recalled being \"scared s---less that no one would show up\" when he first announced new concerts, and when a ticket queue was set up for the first show, which took place in Chicago, he told his team that he'd be happy to see 100,000 people waiting online to buy tickets.",

      "Brooks added shows to meet the demand, eventually performing 11 concerts in Chicago alone. As for the decision to kick off the tour in the city, Marci Braun, a program director for US99, a Chicago radio station that helped promote the tour, explained, \"Put Garth's first comeback show in Nashville, and it's a country story. Put it in Oklahoma, it's a Garth story. Put it in Chicago? It's an American story.\"",
      "In the end, the comeback tour went on for three years, concluding with seven Nashville shows in December 2017. Randy Bernard, one of Brooks' managers, said, \"Garth came back bigger than when he left. It made a difference for country music as a whole, just like what he did in the '90s made a difference. \u2026 There was no one in the world doing the numbers he was doing.\"",

      "In 2016, Brooks won the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year award \u2014 something he'd won four times before in the '90s, but that he pushed for in 2016 for the sake of his band and crew, who he said \"were doing something nobody had done before. They were killing it. I mean killing it. Three-hundred-ninenty-one shows in something like seventy-two cities. It was absolutely nuts.\"",
      "Brooks won the award again in 2017 and 2019. In 2020, he announced that he no longer wanted to be considered for the honor.",
      "Garth Brooks won the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year award a record-setting seven times before removing himself from consideration for the award permanently. (Getty Images)",
      "Brooks believes that, being an entertainer, the work he and his team did during that lengthy comeback tour is what ultimately made his return to music such a big success story.",
      "\"The one thing that no one can take away, that nobody rules but you, is live,\" he shared. \"The live show, that's when it's just you and the people that determine whether your stuff is a success or a failure. \u2026 It's about passion. It's all on the line every time. You're just going straight to the people.\"",
      "Brooks continued: \"Live music was there before radio, before records, probably goes back further than any of us might even believe. One person throwing down a melody and rhythm for another: I'm guessing that if there was love \u2014 and surely if there was sex! \u2014 there had to have been music. Something like the age of streaming will never be powerful enough to take that away. Live music will win every time. When I think about this, really think about it, I stop worrying about the future of the music business.\"",

      "LOW-CARB KETO DIET MAY NOT RAISE HEART DISEASE RISK, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "This new research confirmed earlier findings showing that the experimental drug \u2014 lepodisiran, made by Eli Lilly, who funded the study \u2014 can \"silence\" the main gene responsible for synthesizing Lp(a).",
      "(Other experimental gene therapies with a similar mechanism of action are also in development, according to Cleveland Clinic.)",
      "Researchers have discovered an experimental medication that significantly reduces a cholesterol-like particle that can increase the risk of\u00a0heart attacks and strokes. (iStock)",
      "The findings were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and were also presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology on March 30.",
      "What to know about Lp(a)",
      "Lipoprotein(a) levels are elevated in approximately 20-25% of people worldwide, according to the American Heart Association.",
      "This equates to approximately 64 million people in the U.S. and 1.4 billion people globally.",
      "Lp(a) shares similarities with another lipoprotein that doctors target to reduce the risk of heart disease, known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \u2013 often referred to as \"bad cholesterol.\"",
      "HEART DISEASE RISK HIGHER FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE THESE UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE HABITS",
      "But lipoprotein(a) is more prone to plaque buildup and clots in the arteries than LDL, according to lead author Steven Nissen, M.D., chief academic officer of the Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic.",
      "\"Lipoprotein(a) is an independent risk factor for heart disease that is largely determined by genetics \u2014 that is, it is inherited,\" added Dr. Deepak L. Bhatt, director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, told Fox News Digital. (He was not part of the study.)",
      "Lipoprotein(a) levels are elevated in approximately 20-25% of people worldwide, according to the American Heart Association.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Lp(a) is primarily determined by differences in one gene, while LDL cholesterol levels are influenced by multiple genes.",
      "\"That's a very big difference, and LDL has a much larger environmental component,\" Nissen noted.",
      "\"Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for heart disease that is largely determined by genetics.\"",
      "Diet, exercise and weight loss can help decrease LDL levels, but they do not have an impact on Lp(a) levels, experts say.",
      "And unlike LDL, which can be reduced with medications like statins, there are currently no approved drug treatments that lower Lp(a).",
      "\"There is no approved pharmacotherapy for lipoprotein(a) by regulatory authorities in any country in the world,\" Nissen confirmed.",
      "Study design",
      "The researchers performed a clinical trial of 320 individuals from Argentina, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the U.S. from Nov. 11, 2022, to April 17, 2023.",
      "The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or one or two subcutaneous injections of lepodisiran.",
      "Diet, exercise and weight loss can help decrease LDL levels, but they do not have an impact on Lp(a) levels, experts say. (iStock)",
      "The normal level of Lp(a) is less than 75 nanomoles per liter and the average level for people in the trial was about 250 nanomoles per liter, Nissen told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"They were very high \u2014 more than three times the upper limit of normal,\" he added.",
      "WHEN MEASURING HEART ATTACK RISK, ONE IMPORTANT RED FLAG IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED, DOCTORS SAY",
      "After one injection of the highest dose, participants showed a nearly 100% reduction in levels of lipoprotein(a) at six months.",
      "Those who received a second dose at six months maintained an almost 100% reduction at the one-year mark.",
      "In other words, the therapy removed virtually all lipoprotein(a) from the blood, according to Nissen.",
      "Unlike traditional cholesterol, which doctors typically monitor over time, lipoprotein(a) only needs to be checked once in a lifetime. (iStock)",
      "Cardiologists say these findings may ultimately help treat millions of Americans who have elevated levels of Lp(a).",
      "\"The results are very impressive,\" Bhatt said.",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The researchers noted that there were no major safety concerns, but 12% of participants reported mild reactions at the injection site.",
      "The study had only a few Black participants \u2014 a population that needs more research, as they are more likely to have elevated lipoprotein(a) concentrations than White persons, according to previous studies.",
      "(To address this concern, the researchers are enrolling many more Black patients in their larger phase 3 clinical trial.)",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Another limitation was that only two doses of lepodisiran were administered in the trial, so the effect of more doses is not known.",
      "The study also did not show that reducing Lp(a) levels also reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes, outside experts noted.",
      "The European Society of Cardiology and the National Lipid Association in the U.S. both recommend that all adults check their Lp(a) levels. (iStock)",
      "\"A phase 3 trial testing the clinical impact of this drug is needed to see if the large reduction of Lp(a) translates into lower rates of heart attack,\" Bhatt said.",

      "\"Most important of all being the Transportation Freedom Act,\" Moreno explained. \"The auto industry is right now in a really, really critical juncture. Because of Joe Biden and California lunatics, there's a lot of standards that are just not going to be able to be met.\"",
      "\"The car companies are trying to figure out what kind of cars to make. So what our bill basically does is say, 'Hey look, here's one set of standards. It's one set of standards for the entire country and then, most importantly, set those standards for 10 years,'\" Moreno continued. \"So if you're Ford or GM or any other car company, you know, what kind of cars to make for the next decade. That's huge. That will lower the price of automobiles.\"",
      "Continuing to address illegal immigration is going to be a priority over the next few months, according to Moreno, who said he hopes his Rules Act addressing the broken asylum system will be passed, calling it a \"low hanging fruit\" and an \"80-20 issue\" Republicans can win on.",

      "\"I think my opponent, the guy who I replaced, Sherrod Brown, was emblematic of the kind of politicians people hate and basically just go down there for the paycheck and don't ever accomplish anything,\" Moreno told Fox News Digital. \"I think he passed like six bills that named post offices. That was his 30-year career high. So we just want to get stuff done. I'm not gonna be there forever. I'm gonna be there one or two terms. The second one is up to the voters of Ohio.

      "\"I want to make sure we get a good reconciliation bill that preserves Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits but lowers the cost because of technology that we put in place in sort of state-directed work mandates for able-bodied Americans,\" Moreno said. \"I think most people expect that.\"",
      "Moreno also spoke about the need to cut funding to USAID.",
      "\"We can't afford 40-50 billion dollars in USAID-type programs, some of which are completely insane, and we need that money here in America to help Americans. Preserving Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid benefits, making the 2017 tax reform permanent so we don't see a four-and-a-half trillion dollar tax increase.\"",
      "Additionally, Moreno said it is a priority to \"codify\" DOGE cuts into law so that the cuts are \"in there forever.\"",
      "\"I think if we can accomplish all that, combined with what President Trump's already done with tariffs and trade and peace and the border, we will see the golden age of America by the end of the year in a way we've never seen.\"",

Despite a record $190 billion in federal aid since the pandemic, students' academic performance has seen little improvement. An analysis by The New York Times in March found that, since the pandemic, students have fallen behind by more than half a year in math and also struggled in reading and science.",

      "Kawasaki's CORLEO is a hydrogen-powered, AI-driven rideable robot. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on this new way of thinking about off-road transportation.",
      "What if your next off-road ride wasn\u2019t on a motorcycle or ATV but on a robot that moves like a wolf? Kawasaki Heavy Industries has introduced something that feels straight out of a video game: CORLEO, a hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot prototype designed to be ridden by humans. Unveiled at the Osaka-Kansai Expo 2025, this futuristic machine is built to handle rugged terrain with ease, combining cutting-edge robotics and sustainable energy.",
      "Let\u2019s take a closer look at what makes CORLEO so cutting-edge.",

      "Hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot concept (Kawasaki Heavy Industries) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A new way to explore the outdoors",
      "CORLEO isn\u2019t your typical off-road vehicle. Instead of wheels, it has four robotic legs that move independently, allowing it to handle uneven ground like rocks, grass and steep inclines. Kawasaki says the design was inspired by the skeletal structure of lions. The name CORLEO is derived from Cor Leonis, the brightest star in the constellation Leo. Riders mount it like they would a horse, but instead of gripping handlebars or using pedals, you control CORLEO with your body. Lean forward, and it moves ahead. Shift your weight to the side, and it adjusts its steps accordingly.",
      "CORLEO is also environmentally friendly. It uses a battery paired with a 150cc hydrogen engine. The hydrogen engine generates electricity, which is stored in the battery. Kawasaki has been pushing hydrogen-powered vehicles for years, and CORLEO is their latest effort to combine sustainability with innovation.",

      "What makes CORLEO special?",
      "CORLEO isn\u2019t just about getting from point A to point B. It\u2019s packed with advanced features that make it feel like something out of the future.",
      "AI-powered navigation: The robot uses artificial intelligence to stay balanced and adapt its movements in real time. Whether you\u2019re on rocky trails or steep hills, CORLEO adjusts to keep you stable.Body movement control: No buttons or levers here. CORLEO responds directly to how you shift your weight. It\u2019s designed to feel natural and intuitive, even for beginners.Heads-up display: A small screen gives you all the info you need while riding, like how much hydrogen fuel is left, navigation tips and even details about weight distribution.Slip-resistant hooves: Instead of wheels, each leg ends in rubber hooves that grip different surfaces securely. This makes it perfect for exploring areas where traditional vehicles might struggle.",

      "Right now, CORLEO is still in the prototype phase, so there are some unanswered questions, like how fast it can go or how far it can travel on a full tank of hydrogen. And while the idea of riding a robotic wolf sounds amazing, we\u2019ll have to wait a while before it becomes available. Kawasaki estimates it could take up to 25 years before something like CORLEO hits the market.",
      "Still, this concept shows where off-road vehicles could be headed in the future. Kawasaki sees CORLEO as an alternative to traditional motorcycles or ATVs, something that could make exploring tough terrains safer, easier and more sustainable.",

      "Tech expert Kurt \u2018CyberGuy\u2019 Knutsson says a tech support scam used a fake Windows Defender pop-up, tricking the victim to call and download software.",
      "All Windows PCs come with a built-in security feature called Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC), which helps prevent unauthorized software from running by allowing only trusted applications.",
      "However, despite its purpose, hackers have discovered several ways to bypass WDAC, exposing systems to malware, ransomware and other cyber threats.",
      "As a result, what was once considered a strong layer of defense may now serve as a potential vulnerability if not properly managed.",

      "What is Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) bypass?",
      "Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) is a security feature in Windows that enforces strict rules about which applications can run. It helps block unauthorized software, but researchers have found ways to bypass these protections.",
      "Bobby Cooke, a red team operator at IBM X-Force Red,\u00a0confirmed that Microsoft Teams could be used as a WDAC bypass. He explained that during Red Team Operations, they were able to get around WDAC and execute their Stage 2 Command and Control payload.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To find and fix these security gaps, Microsoft runs a bug bounty program that rewards researchers for reporting vulnerabilities in WDAC and other security components. However, some bypass techniques go unpatched for long periods.",

      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "How hackers bypass Windows Defender Application Control",
      "One of the key ways attackers get around WDAC is by using Living-off-the-Land Binaries, or LOLBins. These are legitimate system tools that come pre-installed with Windows, but hackers can repurpose them to execute unauthorized code while avoiding security detection. Since these tools are trusted by the system, they provide an easy way to slip past defenses.",
      "Some bypass techniques involve DLL sideloading, where attackers trick legitimate applications into loading malicious DLLs instead of the intended ones. Additionally, if WDAC policies are not enforced properly, attackers can modify execution rules to allow unauthorized software to run.",
      "Hackers also use unsigned or loosely signed binaries. WDAC relies on code signing to verify an application\u2019s authenticity. However, attackers sometimes exploit misconfigurations where loosely signed or unsigned binaries are mistakenly allowed, letting them execute malicious payloads.",
      "Once an attacker bypasses WDAC, they can execute payloads without being flagged by traditional security solutions. This means they can deploy ransomware, install backdoors, or move laterally within a network without triggering immediate suspicion. Since many of these attacks use built-in Windows tools, detecting malicious activity becomes even more difficult.",

      "3 ways you can protect your PC from WDAC hackers",
      "Since this attack exploits a vulnerability within WDAC, there is little you can do to fully protect yourself. It is up to Microsoft to fix the issue. However, here are three best practices you can follow to reduce your risk.",
      "1. Keep Windows updated:\u00a0Microsoft regularly releases security updates that patch vulnerabilities, including those related to WDAC. Keeping Windows and Microsoft Defender up to date ensures you have the latest protection against known threats. If you\u2019re not sure how to do that, see my\u00a0guide on how to keep all your devices and apps updated.",
      "2. Be cautious with software downloads:\u00a0Only install applications from trusted sources like the Microsoft Store or official vendor websites. Avoid pirated software, as it can come bundled with malicious code that bypasses security protections like WDAC.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Based on the report, it does not appear that hackers require user interaction to bypass WDAC. The methods described suggest that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities without direct user input, especially if they already have some level of access to the system.",
      "However, in real-world scenarios, attackers often combine such exploits with social engineering or phishing to gain initial access. For example, if an attacker gains access through a phishing attack, they might then use WDAC bypass methods to execute further malicious payloads.",
      "So, while direct user input may not be necessary for some bypass techniques, attackers often use user actions as an entry point before exploiting WDAC vulnerabilities. The best way to avoid becoming a victim is to have a strong antivirus software installed.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) offers a valuable layer of security, it isn\u2019t foolproof. Hackers are actively developing and using WDAC bypass techniques to exploit gaps in system defenses. Understanding how WDAC bypass works is essential to protecting your devices. By keeping your software up to date, using trusted applications, and relying on reputable security tools, you can significantly lower your risk.",

      "At just 13, Clara began experiencing uncontrollable seizures that baffled doctors. Initially misdiagnosed with anxiety and gallbladder issues, she even underwent unnecessary surgery before doctors finally identified the real culprit: epilepsy. But this wasn\u2019t just any epilepsy; Clara had multifocal epilepsy, a rare and severe form that resists all medication.",
      "\"Every night I would have seizures, up to 10, and it was just miserable,\" Clara said, recalling the years lost to her condition.",

The device, known as the\u00a0NeuroOne OneRF Ablation System, is the first of its kind FDA-cleared technology designed for both diagnosing and treating neurological disorders in one procedure.",
      "\"It took them maybe 30 minutes, and the longest part was setting up,\" Clara said about the procedure that transformed her life.",
      "Dr. Brin Freund, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, explained Clara\u2019s case in more detail:",
      "\"Clara has had a history of seizures that, unfortunately, were uncontrolled with medications. In these cases, surgery may be the only option to reduce and potentially cure the seizure disorder. After a thorough diagnostic evaluation, our group at Mayo Clinic Florida recommended implantation of electrodes (stereoelectroencephalography, or stereo EEG) in the brain to determine where her seizures were originating, in order to develop a surgical plan to treat them.",
      "\"Clara and her family were very much in agreement with this plan, given how debilitating her seizures had been and the failure to control her seizures with medications. Clara underwent implantation of NeuroOne electrodes in order to record seizure activity to determine where her seizures were arising from and then to potentially treat them by performing radiofrequency ablation in these areas.\"",

      "HOW ELON MUSK\u2019S NEURALINK BRAIN CHIP WORKS",
      "How NeuroOne\u2019s dual-function system works",
      "The NeuroOne system uses ultra-thin electrodes to pinpoint the exact source of seizures in the brain. Once identified, it employs radiofrequency energy to disrupt abnormal electrical signals in problematic brain tissue without permanently damaging surrounding areas. This dual functionality, diagnostic and therapeutic, is what sets it apart from traditional methods that require two separate surgeries.",
      "NeuroOne CEO Dave Rosa explained:",
      "\"What separates our technology from others is that our device can be used for both the diagnostic part \u2013 finding the area of the brain \u2013 and then ablating or destroying that tissue, all in the same hospitalization.\"",
      "He added that this approach minimizes patient risk by reducing the number of procedures and hospitalizations required.",
      "Freund emphasized this advantage:",
      "\"Stereo EEG electrodes provide the ability to localize seizure onset with excellent precision as long as the electrode implantation is planned thoroughly and accurately. With regards to the NeuroOne electrodes, they allow for radiofrequency ablation to be performed while the electrodes are still implanted without having to remove them. We can therefore not only localize the seizure onset but provide a surgical treatment and potentially avoid a second and potentially more extensive or invasive procedure such as a craniotomy and resection of brain tissue.",
      "\"The NeuroOne electrodes allow us to control the conditions of the ablative procedure. They also provide us more confidence that the electrodes will withstand the duration of the implantation, which would include recording seizure data, performing the ablation and then recording more data after the ablation to ensure that the treatment achieved the intended goal.\"",
      "Brain implant patient Clara Fuller (NeuroOne)",
      "THIS MIND-READING TECH USING AI CAN CONVERT BRAIN ACTIVITY INTO TEXT",
      "The results",
      "The results have been nothing short of life-changing for Clara. Since undergoing the procedure, she has been completely seizure-free. She\u2019s now back to enjoying school, sports and uninterrupted sleep \u2013 things most people take for granted but were once unimaginable for her.",
      "According to Freund:",
      "\"Regarding the implantation itself, she did very well and there were no adverse effects. The first ablation did not cause any acute complications. We then performed a second ablation a few days later after data was recorded from the electrodes demonstrating ongoing seizure activity to ensure that her seizures would not recur. This was also well-tolerated without complications. We have now followed up months after the electrodes were removed and there have been no signs of ill effects due to the implantation or the ablations. She has been seizure-free since the ablation and has done amazingly well.\"",
      "Clara\u2019s story offers hope for others living with drug-resistant epilepsy, which affects about one-third of the 3 million Americans with epilepsy. According to Rosa, \"The desire to expand ablation therapy to patients suffering from seizures that do not respond to drug therapy was our driving force.\"",
      "NeuroOne One RF Ablation System (NeuroOne)",
      "A broader impact on medicine",
      "NeuroOne\u2019s innovative technology isn\u2019t just limited to epilepsy treatment. The company plans to expand its applications to other areas, such as pain management for facial pain and lower back pain, using the same RF ablation technology. Rosa also sees potential for treating neurological conditions beyond epilepsy:\u00a0\"Pain management appears to be the largest opportunity outside of brain ablation.\"",
      "Dr. Freund believes this technology could dramatically improve long-term care for pediatric epilepsy patients like Clara:",
      "\"This technology could allow for limiting the number of procedures that are required to treat drug-resistant focal epilepsy and also provide immediate feedback as to whether or not a surgical treatment was effective. This could potentially reduce the risk of adverse events by limiting the number of times that a brain surgery would be needed. This technology also allows us to access deeper parts of the brain to provide surgical treatment.\"",
      "He added that the impact may soon be widespread:",
      "\"In our practice, we are now using these electrodes in every case that requires Stereo EEG for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. I think as these types of electrodes are used at more centers and they get more experience, there would be no reason not to use them.\"",

      "Illustration of a crook stealing credit card info (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How it happens",
      "Even if a new credit card hasn\u2019t arrived yet, it may already be vulnerable. In many cases, the issue isn\u2019t about the card being physically stolen but about someone gaining access to your information digitally. Criminals can exploit online account features, mobile wallets or leaked personal data to start using your card before you\u2019ve even opened the envelope. Below are some of the most common ways this type of fraud happens.",
      "If a scammer already has access to your account, either through stolen login credentials, a hacked email or\u00a0malware, they can view the newly issued card number in the online dashboard or mobile app. Many credit card companies now allow instant access to digital card numbers for use in Apple Pay, Google Wallet or online purchases. This means that as soon as a new card is issued, it may be visible digitally before the physical card is even shipped. If a fraudster has access to your account, they can add the number to a digital wallet and begin spending before the envelope ever hits your mailbox.",
      "Some card issuers allow you to add your credit card to mobile wallets instantly, even before the physical card arrives. While this feature is convenient, it can also expose you to specific security risks tied to mobile wallet activation. Criminals may exploit this process by using stolen personal information to bypass security checks and add your card to their own Apple Pay or Google Wallet accounts. They might pose as you to request a new card, intercept or reroute the digital activation process, or even start making fraudulent purchases immediately. This type of fraud can be hard to detect, especially if you're not expecting a new card or if unauthorized charges blend in with legitimate transactions.",
      "Illustration of someone using their digital wallet (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THIS IS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT AND BANK CARDS FROM GETTING HACKED",
      "Another common scenario involves your personal information being compromised in a\u00a0phishing attack or large-scale\u00a0data breach. Thieves use this stolen data, such as your name, Social Security number, address and security question answers, to impersonate you and gain access to your account dashboard or reset login credentials. Once inside, they can retrieve new card details directly from the source or request a replacement card. Phishing scams often trick victims into revealing sensitive information through fake emails or websites, while data breaches expose vast amounts of personal data that criminals can exploit for fraudulent activities.",
      "Although charges made before a new credit card is received are rarely due to mail theft, this type of traditional fraud still poses a risk. Criminals may intercept your mail to steal sensitive documents, including credit cards, which can then be used for unauthorized purchases. To reduce this risk, avoid leaving important mail unattended in your mailbox. Consider using\u00a0Informed Delivery by USPS to track incoming mail or request that your credit card be delivered to a secure location, such as a P.O. box or directly to your bank branch.",

To protect yourself, install strong antivirus software on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA): Add\u00a0MFA to all accounts tied to your financial information. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step (e.g., a code sent to your phone) before accessing sensitive accounts.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4.\u00a0Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using a personal data removal service to reduce your online exposure. These services continuously monitor and remove your sensitive information from data brokers and websites that could be exploited by criminals. This lowers the chances of your data being used in phishing scams or other fraudulent activities. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Ask your credit card company to investigate:\u00a0Contact your credit card provider directly and request a full investigation. Ask if there was any suspicious account activity, such as a login from a new device, before the fraudulent charges occurred. They may be able to trace when and how your account was accessed. Most card issuers will reverse fraudulent charges and can reissue a new card with a different number.",
      "7. Notify law enforcement:\u00a0File a report with the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. If necessary, a police report should also be filed to document the fraud. This can be helpful for disputing charges and clearing your record.",
      "DON\u2019T LET THIS CREDIT CARD FRAUD NIGHTMARE HAPPEN TO YOU",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "So, we've uncovered how those sneaky credit card charges can surface even before you've held the card in your hands. It's a reflection of the increasingly digital world we live in, where our personal information can be vulnerable in surprising ways. Remember, use strong antivirus software and consider a personal data removal service to minimize your online footprint. If you find yourself in this situation, act fast by changing your passwords, enabling multifactor authentication and reporting the issue to your card company.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk announces his platform X is experiencing a major coordinated cyberattack.",
      "X, formerly known as Twitter, has been making headlines recently, with Elon Musk claiming that hackers have been trying to disrupt the platform. However, the most recent news involving the social media site is particularly alarming and puts its users at serious risk.",
      "Earlier this month, reports emerged of a major data breach involving X, after a self-proclaimed data enthusiast known as \"ThinkingOne\" claimed to have released a database containing over 200 million user records on a popular hacker forum. The leaked data includes names, email addresses and nearly everything else associated with a user\u2019s X profile.",

      "X app on an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The X data leak is believed to stem from a combination of breaches, including a massive one that allegedly occurred in January 2025 and another in 2023. The leaked dataset, reportedly a 34 GB CSV file, contains 201,186,753 entries with information such as X screen names, user IDs, full names, locations, email addresses (from the 2023 breach), follower counts, profile data, time zones and profile images.",
      "ThinkingOne claimed that the data was cross-referenced from a larger breach involving 2.8 billion unique Twitter IDs and screen names. This breach may have been linked to an insider job during layoffs at X, although the company has not verified this claim. Cybersecurity researchers, including those from\u00a0Safety Detectives, partially confirmed the authenticity of the data by matching a sample with public X profiles and verifying some email addresses. However, they were not able to fully confirm ownership.",
      "The breach appears to trace back to a vulnerability identified in January 2022 through Twitter\u2019s bug bounty program. This flaw allowed attackers to access user data using only an email address or phone number. Although the vulnerability was patched, the compromised data seems to have resurfaced in later leaks.",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "The data breach puts X users at risk",
      "The 2025 incident alone does not include passwords or financial information, but when combined with the email addresses from the 2023 leak, it significantly increases the risk of phishing and social engineering attacks. X has not officially acknowledged this specific breach at the time of writing, although it previously downplayed the 2023 incident by claiming it involved mostly public data.",
      "The total of 2.8 billion records far exceeds X\u2019s estimated 335 to 600 million active users, suggesting that the dataset may include inactive accounts, bots or historical data. While the full scope and impact of the breach remain unclear, the incident highlights ongoing security challenges for the platform, especially following its acquisition by xAI in late March 2025.",

      "7 ways you can stay safe from the X data breach",
      "If you have an account on X or think your data may have been part of the breach, here are seven important steps you can take to protect yourself.",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software",
      "This breach included email addresses linked to X accounts, prime fuel for phishing attacks. Hackers may now send emails that look like they\u2019re from X, Musk or support, asking you to \"verify your account\" or \"reset your password.\" These often contain links or attachments that can install malware or steal personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Remove your personal data from the internet",
      "Since this X leak exposed full names, email addresses and other public-facing profile details, hackers can easily cross-reference it with other data broker sites to build a full profile on you. This could lead to impersonation or spear-phishing.",
      "To reduce your exposure, use a trusted data removal service that scans data broker websites and requests the deletion of your personal information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Change your X account password",
      "Even though this particular breach may not have included passwords, there\u2019s still a significant risk, especially if you use the same password across multiple platforms. Once attackers have your email, they often try using it with common or previously leaked passwords to break into accounts.",
      "To change your X account password, go to Settings and privacy from your profile menu, then select\u00a0Your account and tap on\u00a0Change your password. Enter your current password, set a new strong password and confirm the change. You can do this via the mobile app or by logging in through the web. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Make your X profile more private to reduce future risk",
      "Adjust your X account's privacy settings to limit the visibility of personal information, such as making your profile private. Ensure that only necessary information is publicly visible. Information that seems harmless, like your location, job title or birthday, can be used by cybercriminals to impersonate you or guess your login credentials. If your X profile includes any personal details that aren\u2019t necessary, now is the time to remove them.",
      "Keeping your profile minimal not only protects your privacy but also makes it harder for scammers to craft convincing phishing messages or social engineering attacks. Think twice before posting personal updates or details publicly, especially if they can be used to guess passwords or verify your identity.",
      "Go to\u00a0Settings > Privacy and safety and lock down your account visibility.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your X and email accounts",
      "If hackers got your email from the X breach, they may try to reset your password.\u00a02FA helps stop this by requiring a second code to log in:",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be interceptedSecure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be intercepted",
      "Secure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "6) Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi",
      "Protect your data when accessing X or other platforms on public networks by using a VPN to encrypt your connection. This will help safeguard your information from being intercepted by malicious actors. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Sign up for identity theft protection to catch if your X-linked info is abused",
      "With 200-plus million names and email addresses exposed, scammers may try opening accounts in your name or use your email in fraud attempts. Good identity protection can alert you if your info is being sold on the dark web. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my\u00a0tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The X breach is yet another reminder that patching a vulnerability is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. The persistence of leaked data \u2013 years after the original flaw was disclosed and fixed \u2013 highlights the long tail of exposure that comes with large-scale breaches. Even when credentials aren\u2019t involved, the combination of identifiers like email addresses, names and social connections can be weaponized through correlation attacks, data enrichment and AI-assisted social engineering.",

      "If you're concerned about Google's data collection and want to keep your personal information safe, here are four steps you can take.",
      "1) Limit app permissions: Regularly\u00a0review and restrict app permissions, especially for access to your camera, microphone, storage or location. If an app doesn\u2019t need access, revoke it in your device settings.",
      "2) Disable background data and tracking: Prevent unnecessary tracking by turning off background data for apps that don\u2019t require constant internet access. You can also\u00a0disable location tracking and opt out of Google\u2019s personalized ads in your account settings.",
      "3) Use a VPN for secure browsing:\u00a0A VPN (virtual private network) encrypts your internet traffic, preventing your ISP, Google or other entities from tracking your online activity. Privacy-focused VPNs are great options that do not log user data.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Regularly clear personal data:\u00a0Delete unnecessary stored data such as search history, location history and cached files. You can do this in your Google Account settings and within individual apps to minimize your digital footprint.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "SafetyCore is an interesting addition to Android, offering on-device content filtering with machine learning. While it aims to enhance privacy and security, some users might have questions about its presence and functionality. Whether you decide to keep it or explore disabling it, staying informed about your device's features is always a good idea.

      "Hydrogen trucks debut in Georgia, sparking debates on costs and green freight gains. Kurt Knutsson comments on this promising chapter in green logistics evolution.",
      "Imagine a future where trucks zip along highways without leaving a trail of pollution behind them. That future is becoming a reality, thanks to Benore Logistic Systems Inc., which has just added 14 Hyundai Xcient hydrogen-powered trucks to its fleet in Savannah, Georgia. This move showcases Benore's commitment to sustainability and also positions the company as a trailblazer in the adoption of green technologies for freight transportation.",

      "Hyundai Xcient hydrogen-powered trucks (Benore Logistic Systems) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A bold step toward sustainability",
      "Benore Logistic Systems' journey into hydrogen-powered logistics began with a small but significant step in 2022, when it rolled out its first four fuel cell trucks. Building on that success, the company has now expanded its fleet with these additional 14 trucks. They're operating on dedicated routes in Savannah, serving the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America, a facility that's all about clean logistics operations. These trucks offer an impressive all-electric range of nearly 450 miles, marking a significant leap forward in sustainable transportation.",
      "Dennis Kunz, vice president of revenue strategy and operation development at Benore, highlighted the importance of this initiative:\u00a0\"These hydrogen fuel cell trucks represent a significant step forward for Benore and our ability to deliver innovative, sustainable logistics solutions.\"",
      "It's clear that Benore is serious about making a positive impact on the environment.",
      "EXPLORING HYDROGEN-POWERED VEHICLES FOR THE FUTURE OF TRANSPORTATION",
      "Strategic partnerships driving innovation",
      "The deployment of these trucks is part of a broader collaboration between Benore, Hyundai Motor Group and HTWO Logistics, a joint venture between Hyundai and Glovis America. Hyundai manufactures the trucks, HTWO oversees deployment, and Benore manages daily logistics to ensure seamless operations for the Glovis EV contract. This partnership shows just how committed Benore is to delivering innovative, sustainable solutions that align with its Just-In-Time and Just-In-Sequence operations.",

      "HYDROGEN-POWERED RESCUE TRUCK JUST SMASHED A WORLD RECORD AND IT ONLY SPITS OUT WATER",
      "Infrastructure supporting hydrogen logistics",
      "To support this initiative, HydroFleet has invested $33 million in a hydrogen production and refueling hub near Savannah\u2019s busy container port. This facility will initially refuel up to 21 trucks daily and can scale up to over 300 trucks per day in the future. Such infrastructure investments are crucial for expanding hydrogen-powered freight solutions across the region.",
      "Industry trends and challenges",
      "Benore's adoption of hydrogen-powered trucks aligns with a growing industry trend, joining other major players like Werner and DHL Supply Chain in embracing this clean technology.

The increasing interest in hydrogen technology stems from its substantial potential to reduce emissions, with each Class 8 truck capable of eliminating over 400 metric tons of CO2 annually.",
      "However, the transition to hydrogen fuel cell trucks is not without its hurdles. High initial costs pose a significant barrier, particularly for smaller companies, due to expensive fuel cell technology and specialized hydrogen storage systems. The slow development of hydrogen fueling infrastructure remains a critical challenge, impeding widespread adoption. Additionally, the current hydrogen production landscape, dominated by methane-based processes, falls short of the desired environmental benefits.",
      "Technological refinement is ongoing, with continued testing needed to verify range estimates, assess performance across various conditions, and address maintenance issues affecting fueling station uptime. Achieving cost parity with diesel fuel is crucial for mass adoption, with estimates suggesting hydrogen needs to reach $4-$5 per kilogram to compete with diesel at $3-$4 per gallon.",
      "Despite these obstacles, the potential for significant emissions reduction continues to drive interest and investment in hydrogen fuel cell technology for the trucking industry. As companies like Benore lead the way, the sector watches closely to see how these early adopters navigate the challenges and pave the way for a cleaner future in heavy-duty transportation.",

So it's really just this growing problem that we've seen take off in the last three years in this country.\"",
      "The California Department of Insurance echoed the NICB warning and added that it has seen an uptick happening where some tow truck companies are targeting drivers involved in crashes by picking up their cars and then holding them hostage for large amounts of money.",

      "\"These task forces work up these crimes, present the case to the district attorney\u2019s offices for filing criminal charges, and arrest the suspects. Additionally, we work with other state agencies, such as the Bureau of Automotive Repair, to refer cases for administrative sanctions,\" the agency said.",

They have laws that require transparency around fee schedules, but there are many cities and states that don't,\" Stroisch explained. \"So I think that from an NICB standpoint, we would recommend all lawmakers at every level, work together to put measures in place to help prevent this.\"",
      "Stroisch suggested that banning accident scene solicitations is one example of how predatory towing can be thwarted.",
      "\"That's where a lot of this is occurring. These tow truck companies that just show up on scene, so ban accident scene solicitation in the first place. So we are really encouraging lawmakers to work together to pass legislation.",

      "\"What people outside our region or outside of law enforcement often don\u2019t understand is that border security\u2014or any type of perimeter security\u2014is a lot like a tube of toothpaste: if you apply pressure in one area, such as the southern border, the threat simply shifts to another part of the perimeter,\" he said.",
      "\"So, as we\u2014rightfully, in my view\u2014reinforce our southern border, which has proven to be significantly lax, bad actors looking to smuggle terrorists, humans, fentanyl, or other contraband will likely redirect their efforts to our northern border.\"",

      "\"To work on a U.S. vessel, officers must be U.S. citizens and most crew must be at least green card holders, with limits on how many non-citizens can be on board. In contrast, Canada allows sailors and officers from a wide range of countries, including the Philippines, Jamaica and Ukraine.\"",
      "\"Canadian companies can also issue pilotage endorsements, unlike the U.S., where it's tightly regulated by the U.S. Coast Guard. That means a Canadian vessel, even on Lake Michigan\u2014where there's no Canadian border\u2014could be operated by foreign nationals with minimal oversight. They also carry fewer pilots and use cheaper, Chinese-subsidized ships, which further lowers their costs.",
      "Weakley argued that the standards are a national security risk and a major reason why Canada dominates 90% of the cross-lake shipping market, putting U.S. carriers at a disadvantage.",

      "\"The vastness of the Great Lakes makes border security and law enforcement far more complex, especially when the Canadians aren\u2019t pulling their weight,\" he said. \"In fact, I don\u2019t believe they have any law enforcement presence on the Great Lakes during the winter.\"",

      "WLAB stated in its audit of University of Wisconsin institutions that it estimates the system spent $12.5 million on salaries for employees with job titles relating to DEI. Additionally, WLAB estimated the university spent $40.2 million \"on offices with duties pertaining to diversity, equity, and inclusion.\" However, WLAB clarified that not all of those funds were specifically dedicated to DEI.",

When the deal was struck, the university had 123 full-time positions to DEI. Auditors found that the number had dropped to 110 by May 2024 and now sits at 60.",

      "In its audits of state agencies, WLAB found that 12 agencies spent about $2.2 million on salaries for 47 positions pertaining to DEI. WLAB also estimates 23 agencies spent approximately $705,300 on salary costs for \"time spent attending diversity, equity, and inclusion training required by Executive Order 59 or DOA in 2023.\"",

However, simultaneously, the DOA did not consistently require the agencies to take action on such issues.

      "President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meet at the White House amid reciprocal tariffs uproar, and the president addresses a wide range of questions.",
      "Nearly a month into Israel\u2019s renewed ground operation, U.S. backing appears to be shaping the conflict on multiple levels\u2014militarily, diplomatically and politically. Israeli officials have suggested the chances of a hostage deal have significantly increased, with some anticipating developments within the next two weeks.",
      "On Monday, sitting beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump told reporters, \"We are trying very hard to get the hostages out. We're looking at another ceasefire. We'll see what happens.\" The remarks highlighted Trump\u2019s dual-track approach: continued diplomatic pressure on Iran and direct support for Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza.",
      "With what Israeli officials describe as a \"free hand\" to operate, Israel has expanded its offensive into Rafah and the strategically significant Morag Corridor. The stated aim is to increase pressure on Hamas and help secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages.",
      "ISRAEL LAUNCHES NEW GROUND OPERATION IN GAZA",
      "A senior Israeli security official told Fox News Digital that the campaign is being carried out in close coordination with the United States. \"Everything is coordinated with the Americans \u2014 both the negotiations and the operational activity. The goal is to bring the hostages home. We now have a free hand to act, and no longer facing the threat of a veto at the UN Security Council, unlike during the previous administration.\"",
      "The same official pointed to a shift in humanitarian policy that, in their view, has enhanced Israeli leverage. \"Unlike the previous administration, the U.S. is not forcing 350 aid trucks into Gaza every day. That gives us leverage,\" the official said, adding that limiting aid reduces Hamas\u2019s ability to control the population.",
      "On Saturday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced the IDF had completed the takeover of the Morag Axis. The Morag Corridor \u2014 which separates Rafah from Khan Younis \u2014 is part of an effort to establish a new buffer zone and degrade Hamas\u2019s operational capabilities. \"The logic is that the more territory Hamas loses, the more likely it will be to compromise on a hostage deal,\" the official said.",
      "IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir reinforced that strategy during a visit to front-line units this week. \"I expect you to defeat the Rafah Brigade and lead to victory wherever you are fighting,\" he told troops. The IDF had previously declared the Rafah Brigade dismantled in September, but forces have returned to key strongholds, where tunnel networks remain.",

      "Activity of troops of the 36th Division in the Rafah area on April 5th, 2025.\u00a0 (IDF)",
      "In the same statement on Saturday, Katz warned Gazans, \"Hamas is unable to protect the residents or the territory. Hamas leaders are hiding in tunnels with their families or living in luxury hotels abroad, with billions in bank accounts, using you as human shields. Now is the time to rise up, to get rid of Hamas, and to release all the Israeli hostages \u2014 that is the only way to stop the war.\"",
      "In their Oval Office meeting, Trump and Netanyahu reiterated their alignment on core issues. Netanyahu stated that Gazans should be \"free to choose to go wherever they want,\" in what some analysts view as a reference to renewed discussions about third-country resettlement. Trump went further, floating the idea of a U.S. presence in the Strip, noting, \"Gaza is an incredible piece of important real estate. Having a peace force like the United States there, controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing.\"",
      "Javed Ali, a former senior director at the U.S. National Security Council and now a professor at the University of Michigan, offered a more measured view of the current military strategy. \"Now that we're almost a full month into the resumption of high-intensity IDF operations in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, Israel's military strategy appears to be focused on clearing and holding remaining pockets of known Hamas elements, which at the same time is displacing Palestinians throughout the territory.\"",
      "CEASEFIRE OVER AS ISRAEL STRIKES GAZA AFTER HAMAS REFUSED TO RELEASE HOSTAGES, OFFICIALS SAY",
      "Israeli forces establish the Morag Corridor in Gaza. (IDF)",
      "Ali said it remains unclear how Israel intends to manage or govern areas it clears. He drew comparisons to the U.S. experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"The U.S. encountered its own challenges in the post-9/11 wars with similar 'clear and hold' approaches, since insurgent and jihadist elements in both conflicts utilized guerrilla warfare tactics and terrorist attacks.\"",
      "While the Biden administration had previously emphasized humanitarian access, Ali noted that the current White House has not publicly pressed Israel to scale back its operations. \"That could change,\" he said, particularly as humanitarian conditions worsen or if negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program progress. \"If those talks gain momentum, Iran may pressure the U.S. to rein in Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas to preserve what remains of the group. Whether the U.S. team, led by Steve Witkoff, entertains such demands will be a key regional development to watch.\"",
      "On the ground, Israel has moved to reshape the humanitarian landscape in Gaza. The decision to restrict Hamas\u2019s access to aid reflects a broader policy shift under IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who reversed his predecessor's stance and authorized the military to directly oversee the distribution of supplies. \"Hamas will not regain control over the aid, because that was its lifeline,\" an Israeli security official explained. \"It\u2019s what allowed it to maintain control over the territory throughout this period. People in Gaza know that Hamas controls the aid; if they realize that Hamas no longer does, its control within the Strip becomes ineffective.\"",
      "Israeli troops deployed to Gaza. (IDF)",
      "Humanitarian organizations and international leaders continue to condemn Israel. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, speaking on April 8, condemned the ongoing blockade of aid. \"More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. Gaza is a killing field \u2014 and civilians are in an endless death loop,\" he said.",
      "Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, strongly rejected the Secretary-General\u2019s claims. \"As always, you don\u2019t let the facts get in the way when spreading slander against Israel,\" he posted on X. \"There is no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip \u2014 over 25,000 aid trucks have entered during the 42 days of the ceasefire. Hamas used this aid to rebuild its war machine. Yet, not a word in your statement about the imperative for Hamas to leave Gaza. The people of Gaza are braver than you \u2014 they\u2019re calling, loud and clear, on Hamas to leave and stop abusing them.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Defense Minister Israel Katz (Israeli PM)",
      "Eugene Kontorovich, a senior legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital: \"One doesn\u2019t need the Israeli Supreme Court to say there is no starvation in Gaza \u2014 this was admitted by the UN\u2019s own Food Security Phase Classification, which in June found that prior UN reports were inaccurate and that there is no famine. There is no serious evidence of starvation in Gaza, and what food scarcity does exist can be attributed to Hamas pillaging and hoarding aid. As the truth comes out, it becomes clear that the starvation claims were designed to halt Israel\u2019s legitimate self-defense against a genocidal attack.\"",

      "\"For the White House, the desire to be seen as having direct talks with the Islamic Republic is high,\" he said, pointing to the lack of direct engagement between Washington and Tehran dating back to his first term and the regime\u2019s deep disdain for the president, as witnessed in an apparent assassination attempt.",

      "\"Trump is a very bitter pill to swallow, and I think the supreme leader of Iran once said that the shoe of Qasem Soleimani has more honor than the head of Trump,\" Ben Taleblu said. \"Being seen as directly negotiating with someone [like that] would be making the Islamic Republic look like a supplicant.",

      "Tehran\u2019s chief advantage is the fact that, despite severe U.S. sanctions and geopolitical attempts to halt its development of a nuclear weapon, it has made serious gains in its enrichment of uranium to near-weapons-grade quality, as well as with its missile program, a critical component in being able to actually fire a nuclear warhead.",
      "It also has drastically closer ties with chief U.S. adversarial superpowers like Russia and China, whose position and involvement in countering Western attempts to disarm a nuclear Iran remains an unknown at this point.",
      "While Iran holds significant leverage when it comes to negotiating with the Trump administration on its nuclear program, Washington has a plethora of levers it can use to either incentivize or coerce Tehran into adhering to international calls for the end of its nuclear program.",

      "TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO STOP IRAN FROM MAKING NUCLEAR BOMB: 'DANGEROUS TERRITORY'",
      "\"The regime has its back against the wall,\" Ben Taleblu said. \"A military option, given what has been happening in the Middle East since Oct. 7, 2023, is an increasingly credible option against the Islamic Republic of Iran.\"",
      "\"And the regime is engaging, now, to delay and prevent a military option from ever materializing,\" he added. \"They are hoping to use talks with the Americans as a human shield against the Israelis.\"",
      "\"So long as you're talking to America, the Israelis aren't shooting at you,\" Ben Taleblu continued.",

      "\"Pursuing wholesale disarmament of the Islamic Republic of Iran is incredibly risky, and it doesn't have a great track record of succeeding,\" Ben Taleblu said.",

      "\"What the Islamic Republic would always want is to have you focus on the fire and not on the arsonist, and the arsonist is quite literally a regime that has tried to kill this president,\" Ben Taleblu said.",

    "summary": "A San Diego summit offered treatments that promised to help heal autism, a condition the attendees believe is caused by vaccines, though science says otherwise.",
    "story": [
      "SAN DIEGO \u2014 The attendees of the second-annual Autism Health Summit had already sat through hours of presentations about treatments that promise miracles to help heal the condition \u2014 water filters and electromagnetic gadgets, supplements, stem cell treatments only available in Europe, and fecal transplants here in the U.S.",
      "Of all the speakers at the conference, the one who got the biggest round of applause wasn\u2019t even in the room.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former fixture at this kind of gathering, addressed the audience in a short, prerecorded video \u2014 not as the anti-vaccine lawyer and activist as he had so many times before, but as a member of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, the secretary of Health and Human Services.",
      "And from that seat of power, Kennedy affirmed he was still their man, praising summit organizers Tracey and Steve Slepcevic as \u201cdear friends\u201d who had \u201cgiven their lives in service to the autistic and their families.\"",
      "\u201cYour issue is no longer on the fringe,\u201d he said, finishing with a promise of a future \u201cwhere autism is once again, very rare, where families with autism are well supported, where people on the spectrum are valued for the unique gifts they have to offer in our society.\u201d",
      "These types of gatherings are on the rise. While they may advertise different themes, there\u2019s a shared belief system among them: a rejection of mainstream science, skepticism about the government and loud complaints that the powerful are hiding something from the everyday American.",
      "With Kennedy now in Washington, and the president himself suggesting there\u2019s merit to those claims, the gatherings are becoming less fringe and more politically relevant.",
      "The conference room at the Town and Country hotel was already abuzz with Kennedy\u2019s latest bombshell. While rattling off his department\u2019s early endeavors at a televised Cabinet meeting last week \u2014 they included getting \u201cbad chemicals\u201d out of food and \u201cgood food\u201d into school lunches \u2014 he stated plainly that he would, in five months, discover the cause of autism.",
      "\u201cBy September,\u201d he had said to the president, \u201cwe will know what has caused the autism epidemic. And we\u2019ll be able to eliminate those exposures.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat would be so big,\u201d Trump replied.",
      "And it would \u2014 if it weren\u2019t so unlikely. Kennedy later told Fox News that National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya had only just begun soliciting proposals from scientists around the world, and HHS hasn\u2019t said more about the timeline. Even if they handed out grants immediately, it would give them barely more than a season to solve a puzzle that has preoccupied researchers for over 80 years.",
      "Since Austrian-American psychiatrist Dr. Leo Kanner first gave it a name in 1943, doctors, scientists, parents, and people with autism have sought answers to the complex set of conditions that vary widely in presentation and severity. About 1 out of 36 children has been identified as having an autism spectrum disorder, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Research points to genetics as the primary factor, likely in combination with certain environmental and developmental influences that scientists are still researching.",
      "But the extensively studied and disproven theory that vaccines are to blame for autism has been embraced by parents and groups like those at the summit. The condition generally emerges during childhood, around when routine immunizations are administered. To this group, it\u2019s no coincidence.",
      "Science isn\u2019t built to prove a universal negative. Every variable cannot be tested in every circumstance across all time. So it is that despite large, peer-reviewed studies in the U.S., Japan, Denmark, and elsewhere showing no causal link between vaccines and autism, it\u2019s never been proven to the satisfaction of the anti-vaccine community.",
      "The question has also been litigated, and claims have fallen short against the overwhelming evidence presented by doctors and scientists. Still, because there\u2019s always a sliver of possibility \u2014 however remote \u2014 that something could be true somewhere, somehow, the theory persists.",
      "Before his autism announcement, Kennedy\u2019s short tenure as HHS secretary had already stirred condemnation among public health experts who said that his anti-vaccine views undermined trust in science.",
      "Author James Terence Fisher, who has an autistic son, said in an op-ed in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Kennedy\u2019s rise to power had \u201cre-traumatized\u201d many autism families and warned that the administration could make people like his son \u201cguinea pigs for experiments and treatments based on conspiratorial and money-making theories that have frequently led to abusive and ineffective treatments.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s happened before, he wrote. Andrew Wakefield, the British former physician whose retracted 1998 study in The Lancet helped launch the modern anti-vaccine movement, used \u201cinvasive and demeaning techniques,\u201d Fischer wrote, adding that Wakefield had paid children at his own child\u2019s birthday party for blood samples.",
      "Kennedy's faithful bristled when he recently recommended that children in Texas get vaccinated to protect against measles, after an outbreak there sickened hundreds and killed at least two. To them, the guidance was a betrayal of a movement he helped create.",
      "But with Kennedy's promise to root out and eliminate by this fall the specific environmental causes of autism \u2014 whether in food, water or, as Trump suggested at the Cabinet meeting, \u201cthe shots\u201d\u2014 Kennedy offered a return to the foundational myth of the modern anti-vaccine movement.",
      "The crowd at the Autism Health Summit heard him loud and clear, and now they were on their feet.",
      "The three-day summit didn\u2019t have an option for press coverage on its website, so I paid the $395 for a ticket using my name and work email. I wore my name badge and introduced myself as a journalist, handing out my business card to everyone I spoke with. Photos and videos were permitted, and the event was livestreamed to remote attendees.",
      "Advertised as a \u201cjourney to wellness,\u201d the Autism Health Summit was one of several anti-vaccine-adjacent events to take place in recent weeks. The Summit for Truth & Wellness was held at the end of March in Rochester, New York. Drs. Pierre Kory and Mary Talley Bowden, both known for prescribing Ivermectin for Covid-19 and long Covid despite a lack of evidence, shared a stage with the writer and conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf and Mary Holland, president of the Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group Kennedy once chaired.",
      "Earlier this month, a hotel in Atlanta hosted Honest Medicine: Redefining Health, a conference organized by the Independent Medical Alliance \u2014 formerly the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, a group whose doctors prescribe anti-viral medications that go against medical consensus. Some of their doctors have been disciplined by medical boards for spreading misinformation.",
      "There used to be just one such marquee gathering. AutismOne, held annually by a nonprofit of the same name in a Chicago hotel near the airport, was the flagship convention for self-described Autism Moms and Dads. But with the growth of other anti-vaccine groups that thrived during the pandemic \u2014 including Kennedy\u2019s own Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 and the ease of online organizing, AutismOne\u2019s funding dried up. It quietly dissolved in January.",
      "Into that void stepped Tracy Slepcevic, an Air Force veteran and author of the book \"Warrior Mom\" (not to be confused with former anti-vaccine spokeswoman Jenny McCarthy\u2019s \"Mother Warriors\"). Slepcevic supported Kennedy\u2019s failed run for president in 2024 and registered Autism Health Inc. as a nonprofit last year. She currently coaches other parents on how to \u201cheal\u201d their autistic kids.",
      "She said she tried hyperbaric oxygen, special diets, stem cell therapy and \u201ceverything but the kitchen sink\u201d to \u201cheal\u201d her now-adult son\u2019s autism, which she believes was caused by vaccines.",
      "Slepcevic told the crowd that she spent all the money she had, even short-selling her house to pay for the treatments.",
      "\u201cIf anyone says, \u2018I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019 I\u2019m not going to feel sorry for you,\u201d Slepcevic said from the stage.",
      "After a song performed by movement stalwarts Geoff and Simone Sewell, Slepcevic called up a couple to the stage \u2014 her new clients, she explained.",
      "The father told the crowd that after just two weeks of following Slepcevic\u2019s advice restricting dairy and cutting out apple juice, their 6-year-old son had seemed to improve.",
      "He spoke of how they had been lost and hopeless and sad. They were depressed, just like many in the crowd, he suspected. But now, they were optimistic.",
      "They were going to do whatever it takes, he said.",
      "They were going to be warrior parents.",
      "Outside the ballroom were the vendors, about 50 tables packed together, all offering the same message: healing was possible \u2014 for a price.",
      "Each table pushed a product or service promising some pathway to wellness. There were water filters \u2014 one to detoxify, another to \u201calkalize\u201d\u2014 and a nearly $6,000 electromagnetic gadget that claimed to improve circulation.",
      "Contraptions emitted infrared light or pulsed electromagnetic fields. Supplement kits promised to flush out mold, heavy metals and microplastics. Vibrating plates were pitched as neurological reset tools. And there were countless devices \u2014 necklaces, patches, laptop shields, pet collars and full-body blankets \u2014 meant to block 5G, electromagnetic fields and radiation, including the Wi-Fi all around us.",
      "Alongside the gadgets were services, too \u2014 nutritionists offering on-the-spot consultations, sessions in a hyperbaric chamber and one vendor advertising something described as a \u201cblood oil change.\u201d"

The announcement\u00a0also noted\u00a0that \u201cfunding has been coming in well below expectations,\u201d leaving Pride St. Louis more than $150,000 short of last year\u2019s total Pride budget, which organizers told NBC News was about $480,000.",
      "However, on Wednesday, Pride St. Louis\u2019 DEI and outreach director, Jordan Braxton, said the organization made up almost all of that deficit with an outpouring of individual donations. The loss of the Anheuser-Busch partnership is still \u201cdevastating,\u201d Braxton said, because it sends a hurtful message to the community that the company\u2019s support is dependent on who is president.",
      "Anheuser-Busch did not return requests for comment.",
      "The organizers of several of the country\u2019s premier Pride celebrations told NBC News they have also lost funding from corporate sponsors this year, to the tune of $200,000 to $350,000 each. For some larger organizations \u2014 like those in New York City and San Francisco \u2014 the shortage makes up about 10% of their total Pride event budget, while for others, like St. Pete Pride in Florida, it could be about half.",
      "Some organizers said past sponsors that are not returning or are reducing their sponsorship amounts this year have cited the political climate and the Trump administration\u2019s hostility toward DEI and the LGBTQ community, while others have cited fear of an economic recession. Some didn\u2019t provide any reasons at all, organizers said.",
      "Bob Witeck, president of Witeck Communications, a firm specializing in LGBTQ marketing, said he isn\u2019t surprised that corporations are reducing or withdrawing Pride sponsorships this year, because many of them are feeling vulnerable to \u201cunfair and uninvited attacks.\u201d He said publicly regulated businesses and those that work directly with federal agencies and under contracts \u201care more vulnerable to possible litigation as well as facing potential losses.\u201d",
      "Ford\u00a0said several companies that had agreed to sponsor this year\u2019s San Francisco Pride march had withdrawn: Anheuser-Busch, Comcast, Diageo and Nissan. Those sponsorships add up to about $300,000, Ford estimated.",
      "The total budget for this year\u2019s celebration, she said, is $3.2 million, and the nonprofit had hoped to raise about $2.3 million of that through corporate sponsorships, with the remainder coming from individual donations, beverage sales and other means. So far, corporate sponsors have committed $1.25 million, Ford said, adding that San Francisco Pride is still waiting to hear back from several large companies that have sponsored in the past.",
      "Lloryn Love-Carter, a spokesperson for Nissan, said the company is \u201ccurrently reviewing all marketing and sales spending, including auto shows, sports properties and other entertainment activations, to maximize both efficiency and breakthrough effectiveness.\u201d Love-Carter added that \u201cNissan remains committed to promoting an inclusive culture for employees, consumers, dealers and other key stakeholders.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Diageo said there were some changes to the company\u2019s sponsorships budget in California, but that the company was still going to be active around San Francisco for Pride Month in June and would be involved in Pride events around the country through its Smirnoff vodka brand.",
      "A spokesperson for Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, the parent company of NBC News, declined to comment on why the company isn't sponsoring San Francisco Pride this year. The spokesperson said local teams make their own sponsorship decisions and noted the company's California team is sponsoring other Pride celebrations in the state including Silicon Valley Pride, Oakland Pride and events associated with San Francisco Pride that are hosted by other nonprofits.",
      "Navigating a political and economic \u2018tightrope\u2019",
      "Corporations began increasingly supporting Pride festivities in the years following the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision in favor of same-sex marriage. A few years ago, large companies had become so ubiquitous at major Pride events \u2014 with their logos emblazoned on everything from floats to paper fans \u2014 that some revelers began to lament the so-called corporatization of Pride, or what became known as \u201crainbow capitalism.\u201d",
      "However, over the last two years \u2014 as dozens of states have passed legislation restricting LGBTQ rights and conservative influencers have targeted pro-LGBTQ companies \u2014 the landscape has shifted, and some companies are leaning away from publicly supporting the community.",
      "Anheuser-Busch and Target faced particularly intense conservative pressure in 2023: Anheuser-Busch for its Bud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, and Target for some of the offerings in its annual Pride collection.",
      "President Donald Trump further fueled the corporate retreat from Pride initiatives with a series of executive orders from his first day in office. In one order, Trump declared DEI initiatives \u201cillegal and immoral\u201d and barred the government from funding them. In another, he prohibited federal funds from promoting \u201cgender ideology,\u201d which has become a right-wing term to refer to transgender people and their rights.",
      "At the same time, many big corporations are facing economic headwinds, including the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to reduce government spending and the implementation of tariffs that have roiled the markets.",
      "Byron Green, the board president of St. Pete Pride in St. Petersburg, Florida, said no sponsors have officially pulled their support for the annual event, though he hasn\u2019t yet heard from many of them. Some have had to significantly reduce their sponsorships, Green said, including one major donor who previously gave $40,000 to $60,000 and is only donating about $10,000 this year.",
      "\u201cThey have all said, \u2018We get government funding, and we have to be very careful, because we don\u2019t know if that funding is going to go away,\u2019\u201d Green said, adding that companies are worried about being able to pay their staff.",
      "In the past, the nonprofit has relied entirely on corporate sponsors to cover the $600,000-$700,000 budget for Pride events held throughout the month of June, including its annual parade, which draws hundreds of thousands of attendees. So far, the nonprofit has received about half of that, according to Green.",
      "\u201cWe are navigating what feels like a tightrope,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we create the experience that is the largest Pride in the state of Florida and one of the largest in the Southeast and the pace of dollars coming in is drastically less than it has been in the past?\u201d",
      "Ryan Bos is the executive director of Capital Pride Alliance, which organizes annual Pride celebrations in Washington, D.C., and will host this year\u2019s WorldPride, an international celebration that is held in a new location every two years. Bos said the nonprofit was in talks with Target \u2014 which sponsored WorldPride in New York City in 2019 and has sponsored D.C.\u2019s Capital Pride march in the past \u2014 but the company ultimately decided to pass.",
      "Bos said other sponsors, like Wegmans Food Markets, have recommitted and increased their support for the festivities, which will take place from May 23 to June 8.",
      "Kevin Kilbride, the media marketing manager of NYC Pride, said the budget for the organization\u2019s annual Pride events in June is usually between $3 million and $6 million. Last year\u2019s budget was $4.6 million, and this year\u2019s will be about $3.5 million, he said.",
      "Kilbride said about two-thirds of the organization\u2019s previous sponsors have reaffirmed their support for this year\u2019s events, which include one of the largest LGBTQ Pride marches in the world.\u00a0As of\u00a0Thursday, he said, one-third of the organization\u2019s total partners had either pulled, scaled back or not yet finalized their funding commitments.\u00a0As a result,\u00a0NYC Pride is looking at a $350,000 dip in sponsorship funding, he said.",
      "\u201cA lot of it still is in the air at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cFolks are just moving a little bit more strategically and slowly than usual ... and I think it\u2019s a combination of the political environment, folks not sure what the repercussions would be, if any, but also the economy as well.\u201d",
      "Target is still sponsoring New York City\u2019s annual LGBTQ Pride march, Kilbride said, though he noted the company has \u201cchosen to take a silent partnership role,\u201d and as a result is not listed as a sponsor on its website.",
      "Target declined to comment on its decision not to sponsor WorldPride and on its partnership with NYC Pride.",
      "Some brands face a \u2018chilly environment\u2019",
      "Several Pride organizers \u2014 including those in Seattle, Boston and Minnesota\u2019s Twin Cities \u2014 said they are being more selective about which sponsors they work with to ensure the companies\u2019 policies align with their values.",
      "Philadelphia Pride made the decision in 2022 not to work with corporations at all as a response to the community conversation about rainbow capitalism.",
      "Twin Cities Pride, which draws about half a million people to its annual parade, announced earlier this year that it would not be partnering with Target as a sponsor for this year\u2019s events after the Minneapolis-based retailer told employees in January that it would roll back DEI initiatives.",

      "Andi Otto, the executive director of Twin Cities Pride, said he chose to turn down the company\u2019s $50,000 sponsorship because he didn\u2019t like the message it was sending to the LGBTQ community and communities of color. After Twin Cities Pride announced it wouldn\u2019t partner with Target, Otto said, he launched a fundraiser that ended up doubling Target\u2019s planned sponsorship.",

      "\u201cCommunity leaders have long opposed forms of \u2018rainbow-washing\u2019 if it\u2019s felt the company has demonstrated weak or faltering loyalty,\u201d he said, using a term similar to rainbow capitalism.",
      "Pride celebrations \u2018not going away\u2019",
      "Pride organizers have said the effects of losing major sponsors could vary widely, though none of the organizers who spoke with NBC News said they are scaling back security \u2014 and many, in fact, have said they\u2019re increasing it.",
      "NYC\u2019s Kilbride said that as a result of having fewer committed sponsors and a reduced budget this year, three dance parties will not return for this year\u2019s NYC Pride slate.",
      "\u201cWe just have fewer options with a lower budget as far as what we can do, what kind of spaces we can provide for this community at a time that it\u2019s obviously, in my opinion, more important than ever for these spaces to exist,\u201d Kilbride said.",
      "Otto said Twin Cities Pride, which typically spends about $800,000 on its annual Pride festival, is currently short about $200,000. In addition to declining Target\u2019s donation, Otto said the organization had one big sponsor back out of negotiations and has not heard from several of its past sponsors yet. As a result, he said, this year\u2019s festival will feature three stages for performances instead of its usual four.",
      "The organizers of San Francisco Pride, which hosts a concert, parade and street fair the last weekend of June, usually start planning the three-day event nearly a year in advance, Ford said. As a result, she said, any potential funding shortage won\u2019t affect this year\u2019s events.",
      "While many Pride organizers are making due with fewer corporate sponsors and lower budgets this year, Keller said the important thing to remember is Pride is \u201cnot going away.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to see even more people show up and need to find a safe space and find community and find where they can be their authentic selves, and that\u2019s going to be at the Pride parade,\u201d she said."

      "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk said she was held overnight in Vermont before being transported to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Louisiana. She alleged that while being held in Vermont, the officers asked her \u201cabout wanting to apply for asylum and if I was a member of a terrorist organization.\u201d",
      "The ordeal caused \u00d6zt\u00fcrk to have an asthma attack during her transport to Louisiana, the declaration says. \u201cI asked for the medication I am prescribed to treat asthma but I was told that there was no place to buy it and that I would get it at my final destination,\u201d it says. \u201cMy asthma finally passed after I used my emergency inhaler twice but it took some time and I was in pain.\u201d",
      "She said during the first week in the Louisiana detention center she was not allowed to go outside, and that during the first two weeks \u201caccess to food and supplies was very limited because of their systems to request these items,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "She said she has had multiple asthma attacks at the Louisiana facility. During one attack, \u00d6zt\u00fcrk said she was taken to the medical center for treatment and the nurse allegedly took her temperature, told her \u201cyou need to take that thing off your head\u201d and then took off \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s hijab without asking her permission.",

      "U.S. Judge William K. Sessions III said to the government: \u201cThe only remedy she\u2019s seeking is release, and you are suggesting that the court has no power to release her because she has a removal proceeding in which she has been ordered detained by immigration authorities.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the court found that there was a constitutional violation, I would turn to you and say, \u2018Well, of course, she is to be released.\u2019 And if the government then says, \u2018Oh no, she can\u2019t be released because we have a detention order in immigration, which is inviolate, and she\u2019s not going to be released, then we\u2019re in a constitutional crisis.\u2019\u201d",
      "Michael Drescher, an attorney for the Justice Department, said \u00d6zt\u00fcrk shouldn\u2019t be released and argued that habeas relief is not available to a detainee already in removal proceedings at the discretion of the executive branch.",
      "\u201cShe is in custody because she is in removal proceedings. She was taken into custody because of her absence of status. It is conceptually impossible to separate her request to be released from custody from the fact that she is in custody because the Attorney General has initiated removal proceedings,\u201d Drescher argued. \u201cShe has detained her in her discretion and has detained her as part of those removal proceedings.\u201d",

      "Craig Williams was one of several people who had been investigated for cashing in on insider knowledge on the date then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak would call the election. Other members of the Conservative Party that controlled government at the time and a police officer were among those facing chares that carry a potential two-year prison term, if convicted.",
      "It\u2019s legal for politicians to wager on elections, but the investigation was about whether they used inside information to gain an unfair advantage. One of the popular bets at the time was to wager on the date the prime minister would call an election.",
      "At the time, the conventional wisdom was that Sunak would call an election in the fall, but he surprised people in May when he set the election date for July 4th. The announcement was a disaster as Sunak was drenched in pouring rain outside his residence and word quickly spread that a handful of people with connections to the party had placed suspiciously timed bets.",

    "story": [
      "SAN DIEGO \u2014 The attendees of the second-annual Autism Health Summit had already sat through hours of presentations about treatments that promise miracles to help heal the condition \u2014 water filters and electromagnetic gadgets, supplements, stem cell treatments only available in Europe, and fecal transplants here in the U.S.",
      "Of all the speakers at the conference, the one who got the biggest round of applause wasn\u2019t even in the room.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former fixture at this kind of gathering, addressed the audience in a short, prerecorded video \u2014 not as the anti-vaccine lawyer and activist as he had so many times before, but as a member of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, the secretary of Health and Human Services.",
      "And from that seat of power, Kennedy affirmed he was still their man, praising summit organizers Tracey and Steve Slepcevic as \u201cdear friends\u201d who had \u201cgiven their lives in service to the autistic and their families.\"",
      "\u201cYour issue is no longer on the fringe,\u201d he said, finishing with a promise of a future \u201cwhere autism is once again, very rare, where families with autism are well supported, where people on the spectrum are valued for the unique gifts they have to offer in our society.\u201d",
      "These types of gatherings are on the rise. While they may advertise different themes, there\u2019s a shared belief system among them: a rejection of mainstream science, skepticism about the government and loud complaints that the powerful are hiding something from the everyday American.",
      "With Kennedy now in Washington, and the president himself suggesting there\u2019s merit to those claims, the gatherings are becoming less fringe and more politically relevant.",
      "The conference room at the Town and Country hotel was already abuzz with Kennedy\u2019s latest bombshell. While rattling off his department\u2019s early endeavors at a televised Cabinet meeting last week \u2014 they included getting \u201cbad chemicals\u201d out of food and \u201cgood food\u201d into school lunches \u2014 he stated plainly that he would, in five months, discover the cause of autism.",
      "\u201cBy September,\u201d he had said to the president, \u201cwe will know what has caused the autism epidemic. And we\u2019ll be able to eliminate those exposures.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat would be so big,\u201d Trump replied.",
      "And it would \u2014 if it weren\u2019t so unlikely. Kennedy later told Fox News that National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya had only just begun soliciting proposals from scientists around the world, and HHS hasn\u2019t said more about the timeline. Even if they handed out grants immediately, it would give them barely more than a season to solve a puzzle that has preoccupied researchers for over 80 years.",
      "Since Austrian-American psychiatrist Dr. Leo Kanner first gave it a name in 1943, doctors, scientists, parents, and people with autism have sought answers to the complex set of conditions that vary widely in presentation and severity. About 1 out of 36 children has been identified as having an autism spectrum disorder, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Research points to genetics as the primary factor, likely in combination with certain environmental and developmental influences that scientists are still researching.",
      "But the extensively studied and disproven theory that vaccines are to blame for autism has been embraced by parents and groups like those at the summit. The condition generally emerges during childhood, around when routine immunizations are administered. To this group, it\u2019s no coincidence.",
      "Science isn\u2019t built to prove a universal negative. Every variable cannot be tested in every circumstance across all time. So it is that despite large, peer-reviewed studies in the U.S., Japan, Denmark, and elsewhere showing no causal link between vaccines and autism, it\u2019s never been proven to the satisfaction of the anti-vaccine community.",
      "The question has also been litigated, and claims have fallen short against the overwhelming evidence presented by doctors and scientists. Still, because there\u2019s always a sliver of possibility \u2014 however remote \u2014 that something could be true somewhere, somehow, the theory persists.",
      "Before his autism announcement, Kennedy\u2019s short tenure as HHS secretary had already stirred condemnation among public health experts who said that his anti-vaccine views undermined trust in science.",
      "Author James Terence Fisher, who has an autistic son, said in an op-ed in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Kennedy\u2019s rise to power had \u201cre-traumatized\u201d many autism families and warned that the administration could make people like his son \u201cguinea pigs for experiments and treatments based on conspiratorial and money-making theories that have frequently led to abusive and ineffective treatments.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s happened before, he wrote. Andrew Wakefield, the British former physician whose retracted 1998 study in The Lancet helped launch the modern anti-vaccine movement, used \u201cinvasive and demeaning techniques,\u201d Fischer wrote, adding that Wakefield had paid children at his own child\u2019s birthday party for blood samples.",
      "Kennedy's faithful bristled when he recently recommended that children in Texas get vaccinated to protect against measles, after an outbreak there sickened hundreds and killed at least two. To them, the guidance was a betrayal of a movement he helped create.",
      "But with Kennedy's promise to root out and eliminate by this fall the specific environmental causes of autism \u2014 whether in food, water or, as Trump suggested at the Cabinet meeting, \u201cthe shots\u201d\u2014 Kennedy offered a return to the foundational myth of the modern anti-vaccine movement.",
      "The crowd at the Autism Health Summit heard him loud and clear, and now they were on their feet.",
      "The three-day summit didn\u2019t have an option for press coverage on its website, so I paid the $395 for a ticket using my name and work email. I wore my name badge and introduced myself as a journalist, handing out my business card to everyone I spoke with. Photos and videos were permitted, and the event was livestreamed to remote attendees.",
      "Advertised as a \u201cjourney to wellness,\u201d the Autism Health Summit was one of several anti-vaccine-adjacent events to take place in recent weeks. The Summit for Truth & Wellness was held at the end of March in Rochester, New York. Drs. Pierre Kory and Mary Talley Bowden, both known for prescribing Ivermectin for Covid-19 and long Covid despite a lack of evidence, shared a stage with the writer and conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf and Mary Holland, president of the Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group Kennedy once chaired.",
      "Earlier this month, a hotel in Atlanta hosted Honest Medicine: Redefining Health, a conference organized by the Independent Medical Alliance \u2014 formerly the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, a group whose doctors prescribe anti-viral medications that go against medical consensus. Some of their doctors have been disciplined by medical boards for spreading misinformation.",
      "There used to be just one such marquee gathering. AutismOne, held annually by a nonprofit of the same name in a Chicago hotel near the airport, was the flagship convention for self-described Autism Moms and Dads. But with the growth of other anti-vaccine groups that thrived during the pandemic \u2014 including Kennedy\u2019s own Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 and the ease of online organizing, AutismOne\u2019s funding dried up. It quietly dissolved in January.",
      "Into that void stepped Tracy Slepcevic, an Air Force veteran and author of the book \"Warrior Mom\" (not to be confused with former anti-vaccine spokeswoman Jenny McCarthy\u2019s \"Mother Warriors\"). Slepcevic supported Kennedy\u2019s failed run for president in 2024 and registered Autism Health Inc. as a nonprofit last year. She currently coaches other parents on how to \u201cheal\u201d their autistic kids.",
      "She said she tried hyperbaric oxygen, special diets, stem cell therapy and \u201ceverything but the kitchen sink\u201d to \u201cheal\u201d her now-adult son\u2019s autism, which she believes was caused by vaccines.",
      "Slepcevic told the crowd that she spent all the money she had, even short-selling her house to pay for the treatments.",
      "\u201cIf anyone says, \u2018I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019 I\u2019m not going to feel sorry for you,\u201d Slepcevic said from the stage.",
      "After a song performed by movement stalwarts Geoff and Simone Sewell, Slepcevic called up a couple to the stage \u2014 her new clients, she explained.",
      "The father told the crowd that after just two weeks of following Slepcevic\u2019s advice restricting dairy and cutting out apple juice, their 6-year-old son had seemed to improve.",
      "He spoke of how they had been lost and hopeless and sad. They were depressed, just like many in the crowd, he suspected. But now, they were optimistic.",
      "They were going to do whatever it takes, he said.",
      "They were going to be warrior parents.",
      "Outside the ballroom were the vendors, about 50 tables packed together, all offering the same message: healing was possible \u2014 for a price.",
      "Each table pushed a product or service promising some pathway to wellness. There were water filters \u2014 one to detoxify, another to \u201calkalize\u201d\u2014 and a nearly $6,000 electromagnetic gadget that claimed to improve circulation.",
      "Contraptions emitted infrared light or pulsed electromagnetic fields. Supplement kits promised to flush out mold, heavy metals and microplastics. Vibrating plates were pitched as neurological reset tools. And there were countless devices \u2014 necklaces, patches, laptop shields, pet collars and full-body blankets \u2014 meant to block 5G, electromagnetic fields and radiation, including the Wi-Fi all around us.",
      "Alongside the gadgets were services, too \u2014 nutritionists offering on-the-spot consultations, sessions in a hyperbaric chamber and one vendor advertising something described as a \u201cblood oil change.\u201d"

      "Nvidia is planning to produce AI supercomputer chips entirely in the U.S. for the first time.",
      "The semiconductor maker said in a Monday blog post that it had commissioned more than 1 million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test its Blackwell chips in Phoenix, Arizona, and is building supercomputer plants in Houston and Dallas. Nvidia said it would take at least a year to reach mass production scale at both plants.",
      "At the same time, Nvidia said its Blackwell chips have already started production at Phoenix chip plants run by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, a major semiconductor foundry.",
      "The announcement comes after the company signaled plans last month to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years, part of a broader stateside development push among semiconductor giants including Foxconn and TSMC.",
      "\u201cThe engines of the world\u2019s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. \u201cAdding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.\u201d",

However, he has also called to repeal the bipartisan CHIPS Act, a law signed in 2022 by then-President Joe Biden in that authorized $280 billion in new funding for the domestic semiconductor industry. Congressional Republicans haven't shown much interest in scrapping the measure.",
      "Huang reportedly attended a $1 million-per-person dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida resort, earlier this month. Nvidia promised the Trump administration a fresh commitment of U.S. investment, NPR reported, and the White House reversed course on a plan to bar U.S. chipmakers from selling Nvidia\u2019s popular H20 AI chips to China."

    "story": [
      "A pill developed by GSK was found to be safe and effective in treating gonorrhea in a late-stage clinical trial, according to a study published Monday in\u00a0The Lancet. If approved, it would become the first new class of antibiotic for the sexually transmitted infection in more than two decades.",
      "The pill, called gepotidacin, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and girls 12 and up \u2014 the most common type of infection in women. The drug is sold under the name Blujepa.",
      "A new treatment option is important, experts say, because bacteria that commonly cause STIs are\u00a0increasingly becoming resistant to the standard antibiotics, making treatment more difficult.",
      "There are an estimated 82 million new cases of gonorrhea globally each year, according to GSK. In the United States, rates of reported gonorrhea have increased 118% from 2009 to 2021,\u00a0with more than 640,000 cases being reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2022.",
      "Gonorrhea has developed resistance to nearly all the antibiotics used for its treatment, according to the CDC.",
      "If left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to serious health complications, including swollen and painful joints, liver inflammation, and heart and brain damage. It can also increase the risk of infertility in women.",
      "Gepotidacin is part of a new class of antibiotics called triazaacenaphthylenes, which work by targeting two key enzymes that gonorrhea needs to copy itself and survive.",
      "In a Phase 3 clinical trial of more than 600 adults and teens, gepotidacin was shown to successfully treat about 92% of patients when taken twice daily, compared with about 91% in a group of patients who got a standard treatment.",
      "The most common side effect was gastrointestinal issues, with almost all reported being \u201cmild or moderate.\u201d",
      "Crucially, the study authors wrote, the pill was effective against strains of gonorrhea bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics.",
      "Dr. Sovrin Shah, an associate professor of urology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who was not involved in the study, called the GSK pill \u201ca welcome addition.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "BUDAPEST \u2014 Hungarian lawmakers are preparing to vote on a constitutional amendment viewed by many critics as both a crackdown on the freedoms of assembly and expression and the most recent move by the populist government to restrict the rights of LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "The amendment, which will almost certainly be passed Monday by the two-thirds majority of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s nationalist Fidesz party, would permanently codify a ban on public events held by LGBTQ+ communities \u2014 including the popular Pride event that draws thousands annually in the capital, Budapest.",
      "It will also provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities or sexual characteristics of minority groups, and allow for some Hungarians to have their citizenship suspended if they are deemed to pose a threat to Hungary\u2019s security or sovereignty.",
      "Here\u2019s what the amendment will do, what it entails for LGBTQ+ Hungarians, and for some of the basic rights of all citizens in the Central European nation.",
      "Ban on LGBTQ+ events?",
      "The amendment, the 15th to Hungary\u2019s constitution since it was unilaterally authored and approved by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition in 2011, gives legal support to a law fast-tracked in March that made it an offense to hold or attend events that violate the country\u2019s contentious \u201cchild protection\u201d legislation, which prohibits the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.",
      "That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify individuals that attend prohibited events \u2014 such as Budapest Pride \u2014 and can come with fines for violators of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).",
      "Some legal experts have argued that such a restriction on assembly rights violates Hungary\u2019s constitution. In order to bring the Pride ban in line with constitutional protections, the amendment declares that children\u2019s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any other fundamental right other than the right to life \u2014 including that to peacefully assemble.",
      "The amendment also declares that \u201ca person\u2019s sex at birth is a biological characteristic and can be either male or female\u201d \u2014 an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.",
      "This declaration will provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals, who are born with atypical sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.",
      "The human rights agency of the United Nations has written that up to 1.7% of the global population is born with intersex traits.",
      "The amendment, as well as previous legislation targeting LGBTQ+ communities, is reminiscent of similar restrictions against sexual minorities in Russia. Orb\u00e1n, seen as Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest ally in the European Union, has in recent years prohibited same-sex adoption and banned any LGBTQ+ content including in television, films, advertisements and literature that is available to minors.",
      "His government argues that its policies are designed to protect children from \u201csexual propaganda,\u201d but critics view them as part of a broader effort to scapegoat sexual minorities and mobilize his conservative base.",
      "Citizenship could be suspended",
      "Hungary has taken vigorous steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government.",
      "The self-described \u201cilliberal\u201d leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary\u2019s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.",
      "In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orb\u00e1n compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to \u201celiminate the entire shadow army\u201d of foreign-funded \u201cpoliticians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.\u201d",
      "As part of the government\u2019s sovereignty protection efforts, the newest constitutional amendment will make it possible to suspend the Hungarians\u2019 citizenship if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.",
      "Such suspensions would apply to Hungarian citizens who also hold citizenship of another country that is not a member of the EU or European Economic Area. Such suspensions may last for a maximum of 10 years.",
      "\u2018This is fascism\u2019",
      "The passage of the law banning Pride set off a wave of protests in Hungary with thousands taking to the streets to demand the restoration of assembly rights. Demonstrators employed the tactic of blocking bridges and major thoroughfares in Budapest, something Orb\u00e1n later said would be prohibited by new legislation.",
      "Reacting to the ban on Pride, local organizers wrote: \u201cThis is not child protection, this is fascism.\u201d",
      "On Monday, when lawmakers vote to approve the constitutional amendment, the opposition Momentum party will attempt to blockade the parliament and prevent the vote from taking place. The party accused Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government of being an \u201cintimidating and cowardly power,\u201d writing on social media: \u201cLet\u2019s collectively prevent them from leading us down the Putin road and depriving us of our freedom.\u201d",
      "Another protest is expected after the passage of the amendment."

      "Members of Congress are back in their districts for a two-week recess, potentially bracing for more anger from constituents.",
      "But voters in Republican districts might not have much of a chance to question their representatives.",
      "Weeks after Rep. Richard Hudson, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, advised Republican members of Congress not to hold in-person town halls, it appears that most of them are heeding his advice.",
      "According to press releases and publicly posted event notices, the majority of town halls and town hall-style events taking place over the congressional recess will be hosted by Democrats.",
      "The few Republicans who have publicly advised that they\u2019ll be holding town halls include Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Byron Donalds of Florida. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who just launched his 45th annual 99-county tour of Iowa, will also be holding a public town hall in his state.",
      "Greene and Donalds, who is running for governor in Florida, each restricted registration for their upcoming town halls to residents of their respective districts.",
      "The move comes after several of their colleagues have faced public ire at town halls in recent months over the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to the federal workforce and a House Republican budget blueprint that could lead to Medicaid cuts.",
      "Since the last recess, Republican members of the House and Senate voted on a new blueprint that directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, to identify over $800 billion in spending cuts in areas of their jurisdiction.",
      "Before Hudson\u2019s March directive to avoid in-person town halls, videos of several Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, and Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., facing angry constituents at local events went viral.",
      "And after Hudson\u2019s advice went public, Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., dealt with angry constituents inside and outside of his town hall event in western North Carolina last month, and Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., was jeered and booed at a town hall she hosted for constituents.",
      "A source close to Hudson told NBC News that the NRCC chairman has not mentioned anything about town halls to GOP lawmakers since his advice in March.",
      "Over a dozen Democratic lawmakers are still planning to hold their own events in their districts this month, but they\u2019ve also had frustrated attendees at town halls, particularly after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., last month led Democrats to support a President Donald Trump-backed bill to fund the government.",
      "The anger Democrats are facing at in-person events from members of their own party tracks with national polling numbers that say rank-and-file Democrats are seeking a stronger reaction to Trump from their elected leaders. A March NBC News poll found that nearly two-thirds \u2014 65% \u2014 of the party\u2019s voters want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions even if that risks sacrificing bipartisan progress with the president.",

Juan Ciscomani; Pennsylvania\u2019s 8th District, which is represented by Rep. Rob Bresnahan; Colorado\u2019s 8th District, which is represented by GOP Rep. Gabe Evans; North Carolina\u2019s 9th District, which is represented by Hudson; and Missouri\u2019s 2nd District, which is represented by GOP Rep. Ann Wagner.",
      "In a statement announcing the upcoming town halls, which follow an original slate of town hall events Democrats hosted in GOP-held districts last month, Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Republicans\u2019 constituents are \u201csick and tired of being ignored by House Republicans who refuse to do their jobs.\u201d",
      "She added that \u201cvulnerable Republicans continue to run scared because they\u2019re voting to raise costs, gut Medicaid, and threaten working families livelihoods.\u201d",
      "In a separate series of town halls that began a few weeks ago \u2014 dubbed the \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., drew crowds of tens of thousands of people as they denounced Trump, congressional Republicans and congressional Democrats, whom Ocasio-Cortez urged to \u201cfight harder.\u201d",
      "They held a rally in Los Angeles on Saturday, which Sanders\u2019 communications director Anna Bahr said drew 36,000 people and was the senator\u2019s largest ever.",

      "He was a prolific author and essayist with such celebrated novels as \u201cThe Time of the Hero\u201d (La Ciudad y los Perros) and \u201cFeast of the Goat,\u201d and won myriad prizes, including the 2010 Nobel.",

      "\u201cHis departure will sadden his relatives, his friends and his readers around the world, but we hope that they will find comfort, as we do, in the fact that he enjoyed a long, adventurous and fruitful life, and leaves behind him a body of work that will outlive him,\u201d they added.",
      "The author\u2019s lawyer and close friend, Enrique Ghersi, confirmed the death to The Associated Press and recalled the writer\u2019s last birthday on March 28 at the home of his daughter, Morgana. \u201cHe spent it happy; his close friends surrounded him, he ate his cake, we joked that day that there were still 89 more years to go, he had a long, fruitful, and free life,\u201d Ghersi said.",
      "Latin America\u2019s new wave",
      "Vargas Llosa published his first collection of stories \u201cThe Cubs and Other Stories\u201d (Los Jefes) in 1959. But he burst onto the literary stage in 1963 with his groundbreaking debut \u201cThe Time of the Hero,\u201d a novel that drew on his experiences at a Peruvian military academy and angered the country\u2019s military. A thousand copies were burned by military authorities, with some generals calling the book false and Vargas Llosa a communist.",
      "That, and subsequent novels such as \u201cConversation in the Cathedral,\u201d (Conversaci\u00f3n en la Catedral) in 1969, quickly established Vargas Llosa as one of the leaders of the so-called \u201cBoom,\u201d or new wave of Latin American writers of the 1960s and 1970s, alongside Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Carlos Fuentes.",
      "Vargas Llosa started writing early, and at 15 was a part-time crime reporter for La Cr\u00f3nica newspaper. According to his official website, other jobs he had included revising names on cemetery tombs in Peru, working as a teacher in the Berlitz school in Paris and briefly on the Spanish desk at Agence France-Presse in Paris.",
      "He continued publishing articles in the press for most of his life, most notably in a twice-monthly political opinion column titled \u201cPiedra de Toque\u201d (Touchstones) that was printed in several newspapers.",
      "Vargas Llosa came to be a fierce defender of personal and economic liberties, gradually edging away from his communism-linked past, and regularly attacked Latin American leftist leaders he viewed as dictators.",
      "Although an early supporter of the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro, he later grew disillusioned and denounced Castro\u2019s Cuba. By 1980, he said he no longer believed in socialism as a solution for developing nations.",
      "In a famous incident in Mexico City in 1976, Vargas Llosa punched fellow Nobel Prize winner and ex-friend Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, whom he later ridiculed as \u201cCastro\u2019s courtesan.\u201d It was never clear whether the fight was over politics or a personal dispute, as neither writer ever wanted to discuss it publicly.",
      "As he slowly turned his political trajectory toward free-market conservatism, Vargas Llosa lost the support of many of his Latin American literary contemporaries and attracted much criticism even from admirers of his work.",
      "Pampered early life",
      "Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa was born March 28, 1936, in Peru\u2019s southern city of Arequipa, high in the Andes at the foot of the Misti volcano.",
      "His father, Ernesto Vargas Maldonado, left the family before he was born. To avoid public scandal, his mother, Dora Llosa Ureta, took her child to Bolivia, where her father was the Peruvian consul in Cochabamba.",
      "Vargas Llosa said his early life was \u201csomewhat traumatic,\u201d pampered by his mother and grandmother in a large house with servants, his every whim granted.",
      "It was not until he was 10, after the family had moved to Peru\u2019s coastal city of Piura, that he learned his father was alive. His parents reconciled and the family moved to Peru\u2019s capital, Lima.",
      "Vargas Llosa described his father as a disciplinarian who viewed his son\u2019s love of Jules Verne and writing poetry as surefire routes to starvation, and feared for his \u201cmanhood,\u201d believing that \u201cpoets are always homosexuals.\u201d",
      "After failing to get the boy enrolled in a naval academy because he was underage, Vargas Llosa\u2019s father sent him to Leoncio Prado Military Academy \u2014 an experience that was to stay with Vargas Llosa and led to \u201cThe Time of the Hero.\u201d The book won the Spanish Critics Award.",
      "The military academy \u201cwas like discovering hell,\u201d Vargas Llosa said later.",
      "He entered Peru\u2019s San Marcos University to study literature and law, \u201cthe former as a calling and the latter to please my family, which believed, not without certain cause, that writers usually die of hunger.\u201d",
      "After earning his literature degree in 1958 \u2014 he didn\u2019t bother submitting his final law thesis \u2014 Vargas Llosa won a scholarship to pursue a doctorate in Madrid.",
      "Vargas Llosa drew much of his inspiration from his Peruvian homeland, but preferred to live abroad, residing for spells each year in Madrid, New York and Paris.",
      "His early novels revealed a Peruvian world of military arrogance and brutality, of aristocratic decadence, and of Stone Age Amazon Indians existing simultaneously with 20th-century urban blight.",
      "\u201cPeru is a kind of incurable illness and my relationship to it is intense, harsh and full of the violence of passion,\u201d Vargas Llosa wrote in 1983.",
      "After 16 years in Europe, he returned in 1974 to a Peru then ruled by a left-wing military dictatorship. \u201cI realized I was losing touch with the reality of my country, and above all its language, which for a writer can be deadly,\u201d he said.",
      "In 1990, he ran for the presidency of Peru, a reluctant candidate in a nation torn apart by a messianic Maoist guerrilla insurgency and a basket-case, hyperinflation economy.",
      "But he was defeated by a then-unknown university rector, Alberto Fujimori, who resolved much of the political and economic chaos but went on to become a corrupt and authoritarian leader in the process.",
      "Cuban writer Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Vargas Llosa\u2019s longtime friend, later confessed that he had rooted against the writer\u2019s candidacy, observing: \u201cPeru\u2019s uncertain gain would be literature\u2019s loss. Literature is eternity, politics mere history.\u201d",
      "Vargas Llosa also used his literary talents to write several successful novels about the lives of real people, including French Post-Impressionist artist Paul Gauguin and his grandmother, Flora Tristan, in \u201cThe Way to Paradise\u201d in 2003 and 19th-century Irish nationalist and diplomat Sir Roger Casement in \u201cThe Dream of the Celt\u201d in 2010. His last published novel was \u201cHarsh Times\u201d (Tiempos Recios) in 2019 about a U.S.-backed coup d\u2019etat in Guatemala in 1954.",
      "He became a member of the Royal Spanish Academy in 1994 and held visiting professor and resident writer posts in more than a dozen colleges and universities across the world.",
      "In his teens, Vargas Llosa joined a communist cell and eloped with and later married a 33-year-old Bolivian, Julia Urquidi \u2014 the sister-in-law of his uncle. He later drew inspiration from their nine-year marriage to write the hit comic novel \u201cAunt Julia and the Scriptwriter\u201d (La T\u00eda Julia y el Escribidor).",
      "In 1965, he married his first cousin, Patricia Llosa, 10 years his junior, and together they had three children. They divorced 50 years later, and he started a relationship with Spanish society figure Isabel Preysler, former wife of singer Julio Iglesias and mother of singer Enrique Iglesias. They separated in 2022.",
      "Vargas Llosa is survived by his children.",
      "Their letter announcing his death said his remains will be cremated and there won\u2019t be any public ceremony."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has moved quickly on his far-reaching agenda, but his administration has frequently changed both its messaging and its course.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As he prepared to take office for a second time, Donald Trump made it clear to his economic team that his tariffs needed to be imposed quickly.",
      "One candidate for a top position suggested to him during the transition that it might be a better idea to move more deliberately. He didn\u2019t get the job, a person briefed on the matter said.",
      "\u201cHe [Trump] was not very sympathetic\u201d to those advising a go-slow approach, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "The president is in a hurry. Executive orders, tariffs, mass firings \u2014 all are happening at a speed that has made it hard for the nation to keep up. And tough for Trump to carry out.",
      "The chaotic start of his presidency has been characterized by a rash of reversals and retreats as he hastens to execute his agenda while his party controls both houses of Congress and his political capital is at its peak.",
      "His advisers are well aware of a looming deadline: the midterm congressional elections a year and a half from now. If Republicans lose control of Congress, the Trump presidency could well be over for practical purposes. Democratic majorities would surely block any ambitious legislative initiatives, and, armed with subpoena power, they could paralyze the back half of his presidency through investigative hearings.",
      "\u201cTrump has hindsight from the first term that if he doesn\u2019t get things done now, he won\u2019t ever get them done,\u201d John McLaughlin, a Trump pollster, said in an interview. \u201cAnd he realizes, too, from his first term that if he doesn\u2019t get things done and he loses the House and the Senate in the midterms, he\u2019ll get impeached again.\"",
      "Investors and everyday Americans alike seem anxious about what\u2019s to come. A closely watched consumer confidence report from the University of Michigan found that sentiment this month had fallen 11% from March and 34% from a year before. The share of consumers who believe that unemployment will rise over the next year is at its highest level since 2009, during the global financial crisis.",
      "Another measure that tracks expectations of how markets will fluctuate over the coming month \u2014 dubbed the \u201cfear\u201d or \u201cpanic\u201d index \u2014 reached its highest point last week since the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "'Move fast and break things'",
      "A cost of moving so fast has been collective confusion over what Trump has done thus far and whether his actions have actually stuck.",
      "The administration\u2019s aggressive effort to deport undocumented immigrants deemed threats to the country has collided with court rulings that insist on due process.",
      "By its own admission, the administration mistakenly deported a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to a notorious prison in El Salvador in its haste to rid the United States of alleged Venezuelan gang members. The Supreme Court ruled last week that the Trump administration must \u201cfacilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s return.",
      "Under billionaire mogul Elon Musk, the administration has moved swiftly to shrink the government, firing thousands of probationary employees and others deemed expendable. The effort has upended the lives of government workers who\u2019ve abruptly found themselves out of jobs \u2014 or rehired later, in some cases.",
      "The Trump administration has full authority to downsize the pool of probationary employees. No judge has said otherwise. It\u2019s how the administration has gone about it that has confounded the judiciary.",
      "\u201cMove fast and break things,\u201d U.S. District Judge James Bredar said at a hearing in Maryland about the government\u2019s attempts to fire workers across the country. \u201cMove fast, fine. Break things? If that involves breaking the law, then that becomes problematic.\u201d",
      "A typical reduction-in-force calls for ranking personnel based on factors that include job performance and military service. Once that review is finished, employees are supposed to get 60 days\u2019 notice. The process normally takes about a year. At some agencies, it was compressed into a weekend, with employees learning of their dismissals through mass emails.",
      "A byproduct of the downsizing is disruption in government services that many Americans take for granted.",
      "At the Social Security Administration, the agency that provides benefits to nearly 70 million people each month, more than 28% of customers got busy signals when they phoned in March \u2014 up from 1.5% from the month before. Only 39% managed to reach agents by phone last month, compared with 71% last May.",
      "\u201cOur worst enemies could not design a better way to harm our government than what is going on right now,\u201d said Max Stier, founding president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that aims to make government more effective.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff policy is now something of a \u201cRed Rover\u201d game, with Trump inviting scores of countries that had been hit with tariffs to come over and negotiate trade deals he finds palatable. He set a 90-day reduction in tariffs he announced this month while the talks unfold.",
      "Watching from up north, Canada was confused about Trump\u2019s abrupt announcement and struggled to sort out which tariffs still applied, a Canadian official told NBC News.",
      "\u201cAs far as Canada is concerned, it wasn\u2019t entirely clear to us exactly which of the tariffs he had put on and which were taken off,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThere were competing explanations as to what was happening. It would appear that the steel and aluminum tariffs are still on, which is very expensive for us and for the Americans.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no real method to it, and there\u2019s no geopolitical connection,\" the official added. \"It\u2019s all quite strange.\u201d",
      "New trade agreements take time. In Trump\u2019s first term, it took years for him to implement a trade deal with just two countries, Mexico and Canada.",
      "Lengthy negotiations with European and Asian trading partners could prolong the uncertainty over tariffs that tend to raise consumer prices. And failure to reach a deal could trigger more of the stock market declines that caused 401(k) retirement savings to plummet this month.",
      "China is an even tougher proposition. Trump went ahead with tariffs on China last week, opting to raise them to 145%. China retaliated in kind, touching off a trade war with no end in sight.",
      "Another puzzling development came this weekend. Late Friday, the Trump administration sent a notice that appeared to withhold tariffs on laptops, smartphones and other tech products made in China, making them more affordable. But on Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said those items would be covered in an upcoming round of tariffs.",
      "Bob Davis, a journalist who co-wrote a history of Trump\u2019s first trade war with China in the book \u201cSuperpower Showdown,\u201d said that in the first term, the talks with China proceeded in a more orderly fashion than is happening now.",
      "Back then, there were public hearings to ensure that American firms didn\u2019t get hurt by tariffs more than China. While Trump made the final decisions, he followed the advice of seasoned trade officials like Robert Lighthizer, Davis said.",
      "\u201cThis time,\u201d Davis continued, Trump imposed \u201cenormous tariffs\u201d and left \u201cno time to negotiate and no process for U.S. firms to argue that they would be hurt more by U.S. tariffs than China or other trading partners.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment, Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said: \u201cThe only interest guiding President Trump\u2019s decision making is the best interest of the American people. President Trump hiked tariffs on China and paused other reciprocal tariffs for 90 days after he and his economic team received good-faith commitments from a majority of our trading partners willing to strike favorable trade deals.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to using every tool at our disposal to address the national emergency posed by chronic trade deficits \u2014 including both tariffs and negotiations,\" he added.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Mark Overbay and his wife are founders of Big Spoon Roasters, a small-batch food business in Hillsborough, North Carolina. The company employs 15 people full time and makes specialty nut butters: cashew butter with coconut nectar, carrot cake almond and walnut butter, and almond butter with wildflower honey, among them.",
      "Because certain spices and cashews aren\u2019t grown in the United States, Overbay gets them primarily from Vietnam and other countries. And because the glass jars he needs to package his products aren\u2019t made in the United States, he gets them from China. Trump\u2019s tariffs threaten to raise his costs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no magic switch we can flip that will bring to life this dormant American glass container industry that just doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "After Trump announced the tariffs on what he called \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d April 2, some suppliers that import cashews sent notifications that they\u2019d be raising prices. What\u2019s more, Overbay said, the back-and-forth announcements on tariffs have made it hard to for him to give retailers the required notice of any price or specification changes in the product.",
      "\u201cIf we change jars or size of anything that changes the customer experience, they need notice,\u201d Overbay said. \u201cSo we\u2019re constantly behind, trying to keep up with the tariff news. It\u2019s hard to follow.",
      "\u201cWe would love to see more clarity around the long-term plan in terms of how this is going to help American businesses of all sizes,\u201d he continued. \u201cA lot of communities depend on the kind of stability and predictability and reliability that consumers need in order to plan their budgets and shop for goods and service. What\u2019s the long-term plan that will secure economic stability and protect American small business in relation to these tariffs?\u201d",
      "So much to explain",
      "Every president has a preferred method of communicating complex policy. During the Depression, Franklin Roosevelt helped restore confidence in the U.S. economy through fireside chats that went out over the radio.",
      "John F. Kennedy used a televised Oval Office address to warn Americans of the mortal threat posed by Russia\u2019s installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba. Barack Obama preferred set speeches that may have been nuanced and analytical to a fault.",
      "Trump largely speaks to the country through all-caps social media posts that go viral and freewheeling exchanges with the news media. No one can argue that his methods helped him win the nation's highest office. But at this moment, he\u2019s attempting so much so quickly that he's testing the limits of what a distracted American public can absorb.",
      "A scorecard of Trump's first 100 days shows that he's trying to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear weapons program, rebuild the American manufacturing base, acquire Canada and Greenland, avenge the mistreatment he believes he was shown subjected to during his first term and turn the war-ravaged Gaza Strip into a high-end resort destination.",
      "All at once.",
      "\"The challenge that Trump has is that\u2019s he\u2019s trying to solve so many important\u00a0issues all at once, and a lot of them are very difficult,\" said McLaughlin, the Trump pollster. \"They\u2019re hard, and they take time.\"",
      "That having been said, Trump wouldn't want to scale back his ambitions.",
      "\"That\u2019s not his personality,\" McLaughlin said. \"That\u2019s not his nature.\""

      "\u201cThe Last of Us\u201d started as a video game series in 2013. (There\u2019s a \u201cLast of Us: Left Behind,\u201d \u201cLast of Us Part II,\u201d and a remake of the first one called \u201cLast of Us Part 1,\u201d too.)",

      "In \u201cPart II,\u201d Eugene was a friend of Tommy\u2019s (Joel\u2019s brother), a former Firefly-turned-patrolman living in Jackson, Wyoming. He\u2019d left his wife Claire and a daughter to fight in the rebellion, which left him lonely as he grew older.",
      "While in Jackson, Eugene became close friends with Dina (played by Isabela Merced in the show); in the game she says he taught her about things like electronics.",

      "Who is Eugene in \u2018The Last of Us\u2019 TV show?",
      "Eugene gets a much bigger part in Season 2, taking these bare bone details and expanding them \u2014 like it did with Bill and Frank in the \u201cLong, Long Time\u201d bottle episode from Season 1, which won episode star Nick Offerman an Emmy.",
      "He's first mentioned when Joel goes to Gail for their therapy session. He pays her in marijuana, and she remarks that Eugene could grow weed no matter what the month of the year was. Then she notes, \u201cIt\u2019s my first birthday without my husband in 41 years.\u201d",
      "Now, \u201cLast of Us\u201d Season 2 has jumped ahead more than five years from Season 1. That means that if Gail is correct in accusing Joel of killing Eugene, he\u2019s done it between seasons \u2014 and it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen.",

And yes, I know you had no choice. I know that. I know I should forgive you. Well I\u2019ve tried, and I can\u2019t. Because of how you did it.

Joel, played by Pedro Pascal, is tasked with escorting 14-year-old Ellie, played by Ramsey, who is immune to the Cordyceps infection, across the devastated U.S. He must deliver her to the revolutionary militia group the Fireflies, who believe she may be the key to a cure.",

Then Anna gives birth. In hopes of saving her baby from an infection, she quickly cuts the baby\u2019s umbilical cord. Anna names the baby Ellie.",
      "Anna is then found by her close friend, Fireflies leader Marlene. As the infection begins to spread, Anna asks Marlene to kill her before it takes over her body. She tells Marlene she cut the baby\u2019s umbilical cord before she was bitten, but viewers know that\u2019s not true.

By the end of the episode, Daly met his (well-deserved) end, the crew was finally free. The \u201cInfinity\u201d game\u2019s universe was at their disposal.",

      "The only problem? The only people who could access the source code, Daly and clone Walton, are dead. Or so they think.",
      "Clone Walton has a room aboard the Callister, which should not have spawned since he died before the ship reset itself and the rooms are assigned to players who are alive. Clone Nanette and Dudani believe that a small part of Walton must have survived, so he\u2019s alive in the game on a planet that spawned at the same time he died. Real Nanette has the same idea.

The catch? She can only choose one: go back to her old life, but the ship and the crew is wiped, or go with the original plan and save them all.",
      "Clone Nanette chooses to save them all, and clone Daly reveals there was always a choice to do them both; it was just a test of nobility based on an episode of \u201cSpace Fleet.\u201d Clone Daly begins the universe transfer, but he wants to \u201ccopy and paste\u201d instead of \u201ccut and paste\u201d so another copy of clone Nanette could stay with him.",

You would understand why it would drive Daly mad and it\u2019s something that Walton would completely do.\u201d",

Now the sequel is essential viewing.\u201d",

      "The five-some spoke on a panel Saturday moderated by Josh Horowitz. The actors walked onstage altogether in a line, set to the \"Colonel Bogey March,\" which their characters memorably whistled in sync in one scene from the film.",
      "During the panel, they discussed the experience of reuniting, stories from their time shooting the film and memories of writer and director John Hughes.",
      "\"I feel really, very emotional and moved to have us all together. This is the first time that Emilio has joined us. We don't have to use the cardboard cutout anymore because he's here,\" Molly Ringwald joked.",
      "When asked why it took Estevez so long to attend a reunion event, he told Horowitz, \u201cI skipped all of my high school reunions, so this just was something that finally I felt I needed to do just for myself.",
      "\u201cBut Josh, this one felt special. It\u2019s here in Chicago, where we made the film, and obviously the 40th anniversary, and it just felt like it was time,\u201d he added.",
      "Members of the \"Breakfast Club\" group have publicly appeared together in various combinations but not all together \u2014\u00a0until Saturday. For example, to mark the 30th anniversary of the film in 2015, Sheedy and Ringwald attended a screening of the movie at South by Southwest.",
      "In 2024, Sheedy and Estevez appeared in Andrew McCarthy's \"Brats\" documentary, which saw McCarthy caught up with fellow members of the Brat Pack, or the term coined in 1985 for the then up-and-coming stars of movies like \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" Ringwald and Nelson had turned down requests to participate in the documentary, McCarthy said amid the film's premiere."

The stakes become immediately very high.\u201d",
      "What's the premise of 'Drop'?",
      "Single, widowed mom Violet (Fahy) finally decides to go on a first date, hinting that her last relationship \u2014 which resulted in the birth of her son Toby (Jacob Robinson) \u2014 wasn\u2019t healthy.",
      "With her sister, Jen (Violett Beane), babysitting Toby for the night at Violet\u2019s house, Violet embarks on her date at The Palate, an upscale restaurant on the top floor of a tall building.",

There, she meets friendly bartender Cara (Gabrielle Ryan), flirty pianist Phil (Ed Weeks) and Richard (Reed Diamond) \u2014 a nervous man waiting for his blind date to arrive.",

      "The two are seated and begin their date, with Violet explaining that she needs to keep her phone on the table in case Jen or Toby needs anything from her. Henry is completely fine with this, even giving her a hockey puck he bought as a gift for Toby.",
      "Their date goes smoothly, until Violet starts receiving multiple Digi Drops that get darker and darker in their content. She brings her concerns to Henry, but he says it's probably someone just pranking her. He explains you have to be within 50 feet of someone to send them a Digi Drop so he walks around the restaurant, measuring how far the prankster could be. He concludes that they must be in the dining room with them.",
      "Despite this, the date remains in good spirits until Violet gets a message over Digi Drop from an unknown user called \"Let's Play.\" They tell her to check her security cameras, which she does, seeing that there's a masked man in her home with a gun and a silencer.",
      "She then gets a text from Let's Play telling her to keep her mouth shut and that her phone is cloned so they can see everything she does. They tell her if she calls the cops, Toby dies.",

Before she does, however, she sees some of the photos stored on it, which are of politicians and wire transfer statements.",
      "Then, she's given a much harder task: she's instructed to kill Henry if she wants Toby to live. Let's Play secretly stashed a vial of poison in the bathroom for her to use, which they explain will kill Henry \"quickly and painlessly.\"",
      "When Violet says she can\u2019t kill someone, Let\u2019s Play responds that she\u2019s killed someone before \u2014 she can do it again.",
      "Very aware of all the cameras on her and the bugs at her table and in the bathroom, she tries to determine who in the restaurant it could be, but to no avail. During all of this, Henry senses something is wrong and tries to leave the date. After being informed that Toby will die if Henry leaves, she convinces him to stay with a kiss.",
      "Henry stays and, despite the life-or-death situation going on, they are able to bond, with Henry sharing that he's worked for the mayor for five years \u2014 although he doesn't seem happy about it.",
      "When Henry asks her why she's a therapist, Violet explains that she works with abuse survivors as she's a survivor herself and wants to help others now. She says the trauma of abuse rears its head at different times, explaining away some of her weird behavior that evening.",
      "Over the course of the date, Violet struggles with the ethics of killing Henry, trying different tricks to secretly let others know her son is in danger \u2014 including secretly informing Phil, but this only gets him killed too.",
      "In response, Let's Play has the masked man in her home attack Jen, knocking her out with the butt of his gun. The masked man then picks Toby up and locks him in his room.",

      "There, Henry confronts her about the watch that fell out of her purse, asking her why she's lying to him. The two have a heartfelt conversation about being honest and genuine. Violet admits to staying in an abusive relationship even after her son was born. She says she is still stuck in it at times, revealing she once watched Blake almost kill Toby as she just sat there.",
      "\"And that's the kind of mother I am,\" she says, to which Henry confides that in the past, he's found himself in a messed-up situation that hurt good people for a long time and he still feels the guilt.",
      "Henry tells Violet that abusive people will make you feel guilty, even if they are dead. Violet tells Henry he's a good guy, but still pretends she forgot the limes for their shots. When Henry goes to grab them, she poisons his shot.",
      "Henry asks if they can toast to \"hope,\" which they do. The poisoned shot is on his lips, but Violet has a change of heart. She spills her red wine all over him so he won't take the shot.",
      "\"That wasn't smart,\" Let's Play texts Violet as Henry goes to clean up in the bathroom.",
      "Cara approaches Violet, saying she can tell she's been acting weird all night and offering to help get her out of a bad date. Then she gives away the clue that puts the pieces together for Violet.",
      "Cara tells her that Richard has been staring at Violet all night and is seated at a table another regular normally requests.",
      "Violet pieces together that Richard must be Let's Play as he's been watching her all night and Violet knew that whoever Let's Play was called ahead and requested her table and their own.",

      "He makes her drink one of the shots she brought over (non-poisoned) as he explains that the table he's sitting at is situated in the blind spot of the cameras. He explains that people hired him to get rid of Henry and the SD card as those were the final two loose ends left for covering up the mayor's fraud. He also reveals that Henry is an FBI informant.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with President Donald Trump to visit his country to \u201cunderstand what Putin did\u201d after two Russian ballistic missiles tore into a city, killing 34 people and injuring 119 others Sunday.",
      "\"Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,\u201d Zelenskyy said, referring to Trump, in a CBS News interview broadcast Sunday.",
      "He also referred to his catastrophic White House meeting with Trump and Vice President JD Vance in February that unraveled into a live-on-air clash, with Vance leading some of the strongest attacks on Zelenskyy during the extraordinary exchange.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the vice president is somehow justifying Putin\u2019s actions,\u201d he said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cI tried to explain, \u2018You can\u2019t look for something in the middle. There is an aggressor and there is a victim. The Russians are the aggressor, and we are the victim.\u2019\u201d",
      "Trump previously blamed Ukraine for Russia\u2019s invasion\u00a0and said the country \u201cshould have never started it\u201d while falsely accusing Zelenskyy\u00a0of being a\u00a0\u201cdictator.\u201d",
      "\u201cRussian narratives are prevailing in the U.S.,\u201d and that led to \u201ca shift in tone, a shift in reality,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "On Sunday, two Russian missiles struck Sumy, a city close to the Russian border, as many residents were attending church on Palm Sunday. It was the deadliest Russian strike so far this year.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the Russian\u00a0missiles contained cluster munitions \u2014 tiny explosive bomblets launched from a rocket or missile that are scattered over a wide area and make the bombs deadlier.",
      "Trump called the attack \u201cterrible,\u201d and said that Russian forces had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d without elaborating what that mistake was.",
      "Asked about the use of ballistic missiles, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a regular news briefing, \u201cI can only repeat and remind you of the repeated statements of both our president and our military representatives that our military strikes exclusively military and near-military targets.\u201d",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that more than 60 Ukrainian\u00a0troops had been killed by \u201ctwo Iskander-M tactical missiles.\u201d The Iskander-M is a surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missile, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that advocates for the development and deployment of missile defense for the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The strikes coincided with ongoing diplomatic efforts by the U.S. to broker a ceasefire between\u00a0Moscow and Kyiv. On Friday, Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff,\u00a0and Putin met in St. Petersburg.",
      "Neither Moscow nor Witkoff commented on what was said at the meeting, which did not include representatives from Ukraine.",
      "Inside Russia, prominent pro-Kremlin commentators called on the government to issue condolences on the deaths of civilians in Sumy, some of whom were killed in a spot where people had gathered for an award ceremony for the Ukrainian military.",
      "\u201cIt would be right for Russia to officially express its condolences now in light of the large number of civilian casualties in Sumy and at the same time to call on Zelensky and the Armed Forces of Ukraine to stop gathering children, and civilians in general, for military events.,\u201d Russian expert Sergei Markov said in a post on Telegram.",
      "The attack on Sumy sparked widespread condemnation elsewhere, including from some Trump officials and foreign leaders.",
      "The U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said Sunday the attack had crossed \u201cany line of decency\u201d while Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. \u201cextends our deepest condolences to the victims of today\u2019s horrifying Russian missile attack,\u201d while adding that it was a \u201ctragic reminder\u201d of Trump\u2019s time and effort to end the war.",
      "In Germany, the chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, while speaking to German broadcaster ARD on Sunday called the attack \u201ca perfidious act \u2026 and it is a serious war crime, deliberate and intended,\u201d while British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was \u201cappalled at Russia\u2019s horrific attacks.\""

    "summary": "Former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove says that if President Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize he should hold off negotiating a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 If President Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, he should hold off negotiating a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, Britain\u2019s former top spy told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Richard Dearlove, the ex-head of British intelligence agency MI6, said that rushing a truce \u2014 and giving too many concessions to the Kremlin \u2014 could encourage President Vladimir Putin to launch other hostile forays into Europe.",
      "The Russians badly need a ceasefire, said Dearlove, citing waning Kremlin cash reserves and the falling price of crude oil, which Moscow exports to fund its war machine.",
      "\u201cUkraine is pretty close to a tipping point,\u201d he said in a wide-ranging interview. \u201cBut the worry at the moment is that Trump will do a premature deal with the Russians\u201d and make too many concessions.",
      "The \u201chighly undesirable\u201d consequences would be to \u201cembolden the Russians, over time, to be more aggressive and assertive in Europe,\u201d said Dearlove over a coffee at one of London\u2019s historic private members clubs.",
      "His remarks come as Ukraine\u2019s military chief said Russia had launched a new offensive in the Eastern European country.",
      "While often less critical of Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach than many other foreign policy experts, Dearlove said he finds Trump\u2019s general \u201clack of grace\u201d and \u201clack of decent behavior\u201d to be \u201cvery disconcerting\u201d \u2014 specifically his Oval Office bust-up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",
      "\u201cMy general view of Americans is they\u2019re gracious and they behave very respectfully,\u201d said a gently amused Dearlove, 80, an Olympic rower\u2019s son who spent a year at Connecticut\u2019s preparatory Kent School before gaining his degree back in Britain at the University of Cambridge. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary the way that Trump has blown up all of that.\u201d",
      "The jovial, outspoken grandee of the British foreign policy establishment joined MI6 in 1966 and served as its chief \u2014 code-named \u201cC\u201d \u2014 between 1999 and 2004. He now co-hosts the \u201cOne Decision\u201d podcast, covering global news, alongside former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.",
      "He says he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the American president\u2019s campaign to pressure European allies to spend more on defense, decrying the imbalance of Europe enjoying a relatively generous health care and benefits system while letting the U.S. foot the bill for Western defense.",
      "\u201cWhy should American taxpayers pay for indulgent social security programs in countries like Germany, France and Italy?\u201d he said.",
      "He dismisses \u201cSignalgate\u201d \u2014 in which Trump\u2019s team discussed bombing Yemen on the messaging app Signal \u2014 as a \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201csilly mistake\u201d that showed \u201ca degree of amateurism.\u201d And he said it wouldn\u2019t have a long-term impact on Western intelligence sharing.",
      "Reached for comment on Dearlove\u2019s remarks, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said, \u201cPresident Trump is a master negotiator who has done more to bring about world peace during his tenure than any president in modern history.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s Peace Through Strength agenda has delivered historic achievements across the globe and restored American dominance on the world stage,\u201d Fields added. \u201cThe \u2018experts\u2019 have been wrong for decades, and doing the same thing while expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.\u201d",
      "The ex-MI6 head says his biggest short-term worry revolves around Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine, which has involved parallel talks with both Kyiv and Moscow and has been lambasted by Trump\u2019s critics in the West as being too favorable to the latter.",
      "\u201cIf you want to get the Nobel Peace Prize, don\u2019t do a premature deal with Ukraine \u2014 wait,\u201d Dearlove said. (According to former aides, the president still covets the landmark award won by four of his predecessors, and for which Trump has been nominated at least twice before.)",
      "Dearlove believes the Russians are on the back foot and will only come under more pressure to accept terms. \u201cThe Russians themselves badly need a ceasefire, but Putin is incapable of seeking one because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a reverse gear,\u201d Dearlove said.",
      "On Iran, responding to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will hold direct talks with Tehran over its nuclear program, Dearlove says he believes the administration will \u201cdemand a very high price\u201d \u2014 namely that Iran give up its entire nuclear program, both for energy and weapons.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bottom line for Trump and Israel that Iran must not have nuclear capability,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that if Iran were to try to weaponize or if the intelligence suggests that they are weaponized, then there would be a joint Israeli-American attack.\u201d",
      "Trump didn\u2019t rule out military action if the talks don\u2019t succeed, saying Tehran would have a \u201cvery bad day\u201d if diplomacy failed.",
      "Dearlove agreed: \u201cIf the Iranians don\u2019t negotiate, or if they mislead, which they\u2019re quite capable of doing, they\u2019re ones heading for a crisis.\u201d",
      "Dearlove was head of MI6 when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, and was later criticized by a public inquiry for his handling of intelligence alleging that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a key argument steering Britain into the war alongside Washington. At the inquiry in 2017, he described claims he was too close to the British government as \u201ccomplete rubbish.\u201d And, according to a BBC interview in 2023, he is among a minority of people who believe that Iraq did have some kind of weapons program, but that its components may have been moved into neighboring Syria.",
      "Looking ahead, Dearlove believes by far the biggest issue is how the West deals with China.",
      "\u201cPax Americana\u201d \u2014 the \u201cAmerican peace\u201d that has largely held since 1945 and is a byword for Washington\u2019s postwar global dominance \u2014 has \u201cdefinitively disintegrated,\u201d he said. In its stead, there has to be \u201csome sort of understanding between the United States and China,\u201d whose President Xi Jinping \u201cwants to create a world by 2050 which is aligned with China\u2019s value system,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cChina and the West are intimately intertwined: You can\u2019t take them apart, you can\u2019t disentangle them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s totally opposed to the Western value system.\u201d",
      "He characterizes Xi\u2019s Chinese Communist Party as \u201ctalking about global domination\u201d \u2014 something vehemently rejected by Beijing.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some sort of international agreement which accommodates what I would describe as the two spheres of influence,\u201d he said. Otherwise, China is \u201cgoing to end up in a confrontation with the United States at some point in the 21st century.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "BUDAPEST \u2014 Hungarian lawmakers are preparing to vote on a constitutional amendment viewed by many critics as both a crackdown on the freedoms of assembly and expression and the most recent move by the populist government to restrict the rights of LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "The amendment, which will almost certainly be passed Monday by the two-thirds majority of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s nationalist Fidesz party, would permanently codify a ban on public events held by LGBTQ+ communities \u2014 including the popular Pride event that draws thousands annually in the capital, Budapest.",
      "It will also provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities or sexual characteristics of minority groups, and allow for some Hungarians to have their citizenship suspended if they are deemed to pose a threat to Hungary\u2019s security or sovereignty.",
      "Here\u2019s what the amendment will do, what it entails for LGBTQ+ Hungarians, and for some of the basic rights of all citizens in the Central European nation.",
      "Ban on LGBTQ+ events?",
      "The amendment, the 15th to Hungary\u2019s constitution since it was unilaterally authored and approved by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition in 2011, gives legal support to a law fast-tracked in March that made it an offense to hold or attend events that violate the country\u2019s contentious \u201cchild protection\u201d legislation, which prohibits the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.",
      "That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify individuals that attend prohibited events \u2014 such as Budapest Pride \u2014 and can come with fines for violators of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).",
      "Some legal experts have argued that such a restriction on assembly rights violates Hungary\u2019s constitution. In order to bring the Pride ban in line with constitutional protections, the amendment declares that children\u2019s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any other fundamental right other than the right to life \u2014 including that to peacefully assemble.",
      "The amendment also declares that \u201ca person\u2019s sex at birth is a biological characteristic and can be either male or female\u201d \u2014 an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.",
      "This declaration will provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals, who are born with atypical sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.",
      "The human rights agency of the United Nations has written that up to 1.7% of the global population is born with intersex traits.",
      "The amendment, as well as previous legislation targeting LGBTQ+ communities, is reminiscent of similar restrictions against sexual minorities in Russia. Orb\u00e1n, seen as Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest ally in the European Union, has in recent years prohibited same-sex adoption and banned any LGBTQ+ content including in television, films, advertisements and literature that is available to minors.",
      "His government argues that its policies are designed to protect children from \u201csexual propaganda,\u201d but critics view them as part of a broader effort to scapegoat sexual minorities and mobilize his conservative base.",
      "Citizenship could be suspended",
      "Hungary has taken vigorous steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government.",
      "The self-described \u201cilliberal\u201d leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary\u2019s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.",
      "In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orb\u00e1n compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to \u201celiminate the entire shadow army\u201d of foreign-funded \u201cpoliticians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.\u201d",
      "As part of the government\u2019s sovereignty protection efforts, the newest constitutional amendment will make it possible to suspend the Hungarians\u2019 citizenship if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.",
      "Such suspensions would apply to Hungarian citizens who also hold citizenship of another country that is not a member of the EU or European Economic Area. Such suspensions may last for a maximum of 10 years.",
      "\u2018This is fascism\u2019",
      "The passage of the law banning Pride set off a wave of protests in Hungary with thousands taking to the streets to demand the restoration of assembly rights. Demonstrators employed the tactic of blocking bridges and major thoroughfares in Budapest, something Orb\u00e1n later said would be prohibited by new legislation.",
      "Reacting to the ban on Pride, local organizers wrote: \u201cThis is not child protection, this is fascism.\u201d",
      "On Monday, when lawmakers vote to approve the constitutional amendment, the opposition Momentum party will attempt to blockade the parliament and prevent the vote from taking place. The party accused Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government of being an \u201cintimidating and cowardly power,\u201d writing on social media: \u201cLet\u2019s collectively prevent them from leading us down the Putin road and depriving us of our freedom.\u201d",
      "Another protest is expected after the passage of the amendment."

      "Bolsonaro was hospitalized Friday morning while traveling in northeastern Brazil. The pain was caused by a bowel obstruction and was related to long-term effects of being stabbed in the abdomen in September 2018, his doctors said.",
      "Bolsonaro has been in and out of hospitals since the attack at a campaign event before Brazil\u2019s 2018 presidential election. The conservative leader underwent several surgeries during his presidency from 2019-2022.",
      "\u201cAfter so many similar episodes over the past few years, I had gotten used to the pain and discomfort. But this time, even the doctors were surprised,\u201d he said in a social media post Saturday, adding that a longtime physician told him it was \u201cthe most serious case since the attack.\u201d",
      "Bolsonaro also said he would likely undergo another surgery. Earlier on Saturday, doctors at Rio Grande Hospital in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte told journalists he was stable and not in need of emergency surgery, said further procedures would depend on his recovery.",
      "Doctors also that the transfer to Brasilia was requested by his family and would happen Saturday afternoon.",
      "The far-right leader was admitted to a hospital in Santa Cruz, a small city in Rio Grande do Norte, and later transferred to a hospital in the state\u2019s capital, Natal.",
      "Bolsonaro was set to start a trip across the region to promote his party\u2019s right-wing agenda, eyeing next year\u2019s presidential election, though he himself is barred from running.",
      "A panel of judges banned Bolsonaro from running for office again until 2030 after a panel of judges concluded that he abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the country\u2019s\u00a0electronic voting system. He has also been charged in connection to an alleged coup attempt to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat.",
      "Bolsonaro's alleged coup attempt included plans to poison and kill his political rival, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, prosecutors said."

      "Many in the crowd reached out to touch Francis\u2019 hand or garments as he was brought in a wheelchair down a ramp to the main altar, where he issued his brief greeting into a microphone. The 88-year-old pope was not wearing nasal tubes for supplemental oxygen, as he had during a\u00a0similar appearance last Sunday.",
      "On his way back to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica from where he had emerged, Francis stopped to bless a rosary, and offered candy to a boy who greeted him.",
      "The 88-year-old Francis is entering his fourth week of convalescence during which doctors have advised him to avoid crowds. While Francis is clearly eager to show he is feeling better, he has not spoken more than a few words in public as he recovers from a severe respiratory crisis. The Vatican said it was waiting to advise on what role he may play in upcoming Holy Week events leading up to Easter Sunday.",
      "It was his second in St. Peter\u2019s Square before a crowd, following last Sunday\u2019s unexpected appearance that thrilled the faithful. He also met privately with\u00a0King Charles III and Queen Camilla\u00a0this week, and made an impromptu tour of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, stopping to pray, and to thank a pair of restorers for their work on the basilica\u2019s masterpieces.",
      "On Saturday, the eve of Holy Week, Francis went to the St. Mary Major Basilica in central Rome to pray privately before a favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, Salus Populi Romani. The basilica, which he typically visits before and after his foreign trips, was also his first stop after leaving the Gemelli Hospital on March 23.",
      "In the traditional Sunday blessing, the pontiff thanked the faithful for their prayers. \u201cAt this time of physical weakness, they help me to feel God\u2019s closeness, compassion and tenderness even more.\u201d For the ninth week, including his five-week hospitalization starting Feb. 14, the blessing was delivered as a text.",
      "The pope offered prayers for those suffering in the conflict in Sudan, which marks its second anniversary on Tuesday, and for Lebanon, where civil war began 50 years ago, as well as for peace in Ukraine, the Middle East, Congo, Myanmar and South Sudan.",
      "In a prepared Palm Sunday homily read by a top Vatican cardinal, Francis urged the faithful to carry the cross \u201cof those who suffer around us\u201d to mark the start of the solemn Holy Week.",
      "Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, vice dean of the College of Cardinals, led the celebrations, leading a procession of cardinals around the piazza\u2019s central obelisk carrying an ornately braided palm that recalls Jesus\u2019 triumphant entrance into Jerusalem, when crowds waved palm branches to honor him.",
      "The initial welcome contrasts with the suffering that follows, leading up to his crucifixion, which Christians observe on Good Friday, followed by his resurrection, celebrated on Easter Sunday.",
      "The faithful emerged from St. Peter\u2019s Square carrying blessed palm fronds or olive branches to mark the occasion."

      "The bid to end Iran's nuclear program is one that Trump has resumed from his first term, when he pulled the U.S. out of the landmark 2015 Iranian nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Under the JCPOA, Iran agreed to dismantle much of its nuclear program and allow inspections of its facilities in exchange for sanctions relief.",
      "Trump withdrew from the JCPOA because, he said, it was a \"horrible one-sided deal\" that did not address Tehran's ballistic missile program nor its network of proxies throughout the region. The U.S. move infuriated the Iranian government after it had adhered to the terms the agreement signed with the Obama administration and five other world powers.",

      "'Very high price'",
      "Richard Dearlove, former head of the  British intelligence agency MI6, told NBC News in an interview Thursday he believed the Trump administration would \u201cdemand a very high price\u201d \u2014 that Iran give up its entire nuclear program, both for energy and weapons.",

      "\u201cIran definitely is in a different situation from where it was, say, back in 2016 or even 2023,\u201d Tabrizi said, noting that \u201ca lot has happened over the past year and a half\u201d alone, with the weakening of Tehran\u2019s proxies.",
      "Mousavian agreed, saying both sides will be using the indirect talks as an opportunity to \u201cassess each other and the intentions of the other side.\u201d",

      "Israeli forces have completed the encirclement of Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah, the military said on Saturday, part of an announced plan to seize more areas of the enclave, accompanied by large-scale evacuations of the population.",
      "The military has issued repeated evacuation warnings to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians across Rafah since it resumed operations in Gaza on March 18, forcing them into a diminishing space limited by the sea.",
      "Israel\u00a0said on April 2\u00a0that troops had begun seizing an area it called the Morag Axis, a reference to a former Israeli settlement once located between the cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have\u00a0since fled\u00a0Rafah, a 60 square km area that borders Egypt to the south.",
      "\u201cOver the past 24 hours, the 36th Division\u2019s troops completed the establishment of the Morag route, separating Rafah and Khan Younis,\u201d the military said on Saturday.",
      "The\u00a0Israeli offensive\u00a0in Gaza was launched after Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, according to Israeli tallies.",
      "More than 50,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the offensive, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave. Most of the population has been displaced and much of Gaza is in ruins.",
      "Israel restarted the offensive in March after effectively abandoning a ceasefire in place since January. The campaign will continue, it says, until the remaining 59 hostages are freed and Hamas is stamped out of Gaza.",
      "Hamas says it will free hostages only as part of a deal that will end the war and has rejected demands to lay down its arms. A Hamas delegation was expected in Cairo over the weekend to discuss new truce proposals, according to a source in the group."
