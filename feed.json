      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- The mayor of Miami Beach, Florida, wants to terminate a lease and cut financial support for an independent film theater that screened an Oscar-winning documentary about the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.",
      "Mayor Steven Meiner introduced a resolution describing the film \u201cNo Other Land\u201d as antisemitic. City commissioners will discuss the resolution Wednesday during their next meeting.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d opened last Friday at O Cinema, located at the Miami Beach Historic City Hall. Meiner had reached out several days before the premiere to discourage O Cinema CEO Vivian Marthell from showing the film.",
      "\u201cThe City of Miami Beach has one of the highest concentrations of Jewish residents in the United States,\u201d Meiner said in his letter to Marthell. \u201cThe \u2018No Other Land\u2019 film is a one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.\u201d",
      "Marthell initially agreed not to screen the movie in a response to Meiner, but the showing went on as scheduled.",
      "\u201cMy initial reaction to Mayor Meiner\u2019s threats was made under duress,\u201d Marthell said in a email Thursday. \u201cAfter reflecting on the broader implications for free speech and O Cinema\u2019s mission, I (along with the O Cinema board and staff members) agreed it was critical to screen this acclaimed film.\u201d",
      "O Cinema has always been committed to sharing films that not only entertain, but also challenge, educate and inspire meaningful dialogue, Marthell said.",
      "\u201cWe understand the power of cinema to tell stories that matter, and we recognize that some stories \u2014 especially those rooted in real-world conflicts \u2014 can evoke strong feelings and passionate reactions. As they should,\u201d Marthell said. \u201cOur decision to screen \u2018No Other Land\u2019 is not a declaration of political alignment. It is a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard.\u201d",
      "In December and January, the city of Miami Beach executed two grants worth about $80,000 for O Cinema, according to the mayor's proposed resolution. About half the money has already been paid, but the resolution would stop the rest. The city began leasing space to O Cinema in 2019 with the ability to terminate the contract with 180 days of notice, which is what Meiner is seeking to do.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which was shot between 2019 and 2023 and released last year, was directed by a group of Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers: Basel Adra, Hamdan Ballal, Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.",
      "\u201cWhen the mayor uses the word antisemitism to silence Palestinians and Israelis who proudly oppose occupation and apartheid together, fighting for justice and equality, he is emptying it out of meaning,\u201d Abraham said in an email. \u201cI find that to be very dangerous.\u201d",
      "The film documents the destruction of Palestinian villages in the West Bank by the Israeli military. It won the Academy Award for best documentary feature as well as earlier awards.",
      "While the film has earned wide praise from film critics, it has also drawn controversy.",
      "\u201cFreedom of expression is an important value, but defamation of Israel into a tool for international promotion is not art,\u201d Israeli culture minister Miki Zohar said in a social media post."

      "A beloved reindeer in Alaska's biggest city is fighting for his life after falling mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An iconic reindeer so beloved that he has been in parades, featured on reality TV shows and visited by schoolchildren on field trips in Alaska's largest city is fighting for his life after mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen.",
      "Ever since, 8-year-old Star has had pneumonia, digestion issues and rapid weight loss. Star's owner, Albert Whitehead, has taken him to a veterinarian every other day to receive care and in hopes of finding a cause for the issues.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve done everything possible for him,\u201d Whitehead said. Veterinarian Sabrieta Holland said she the reindeer's prognosis is \u201cguarded.\u201d",
      "Star lives in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house at the edge of downtown Anchorage. It\u2019s been over 20 years since someone last tried to tamper with the enclosure where reindeer named Star have been kept for the last seven decades. Star is the seventh in a line of reindeer to carry that name.",
      "In early January, someone cut a huge hole in the fencing to gain entrance, spending about five minutes inside with Star before taking off. What the person did in the pen is unknown, but Star began having stomach issues and dropping weight shortly after.",
      "Then, on Feb. 20, Anchorage police found the friendly and trusting reindeer wandering around downtown and returned him home.",
      "When Whitehead reviewed his security cameras, he found someone had used bolt cutters to remove padlocks off Star\u2019s pen and an alley gate. Star followed the man out into the neighborhood, and the reindeer wound up alone downtown, familiar streets because that's where Whitehead walks him.",
      "The next night, the situation turned more serious.",
      "Whitehead was watching the video feed when a man wearing a scarf over his face sprayed something from two different cans into Star\u2019s pen and twice hit the reindeer in the face with an unknown substance.",
      "Whitehead rushed outside to confront the man.",
      "\u201cI yelled at him to stop, \u2018What the hell are you doing? What are you spraying on the animal? Don\u2019t do that, quit that!\u2019\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "The man replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to help Star.\"",
      "\u201cI have no idea what he meant by that,\u201d said Whitehead, who suspects \u2014 based on the smells \u2014 that the sprays could have been a disinfectant and deodorizer.",
      "Whitehead and police believe it was the same man from the prior night. It\u2019s not known if the January tampering involved the same person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the individual wanted to harm Star, but by his actions, he did,\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "Anchorage police posted the surveillance video on social media in hopes it would lead to the suspect\u2019s identity. So far, no viable tips have come in, spokesperson Christopher Barraza said in an email.",
      "Star's pneumonia worsened, and a cough leads Whitehead to believe Star ate something harmful, perhaps while loose.",
      "The pneumonia is likely due to him accidentally inhaling the chronic reflux or regurgitation of the contents in the largest of the reindeers\u2019 four stomachs, Holland said. The sprays possibly also contributed.",
      "It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a blockage, but the largest stomach of a reindeer is quite big and not easily obstructed, Holland said. However, ingested plastic bags causing chronic weight loss and indigestion problems are the most common foreign objects she's seen in reindeer.",
      "The next option would be surgery to look at the reindeer's abdomen and possibly remove any blockage, but it\u2019s generally a poor outcome, even in healthy deer, she said.",
      "The bond between Whitehead and Star is \u201cquite significant and precious,\" Holland said.",
      "\"Albert\u2019s daily life and reason for getting out for walks and such all are because of Star. And Star is really fond of Albert, too,\u201d Holland said in a text. \u201cIt will be quite devastating for him if he loses Star.\u201d",
      "Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart started the reindeer tradition, bringing the deer they received from an Alaska Native herder to Anchorage in the 1950s. Whitehead took over as caretaker from his friends in 2002.",
      "The average lifespan of a reindeer is about 15 years, but some Stars had long lives, like the first who lived to 23. Others didn't live as long, including the second Star, who was stolen, beaten to death and then butchered by a known Fairbanks meat thief. The third Star died after eating a plastic bag."

      "Holmes was first to the finish line in the Gold Rush town of Nome, on the Bering Sea coast. The race began March 3 in Fairbanks after a lack of snow forced changes to the route and starting point.",
      "That made the normally 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race a staggering 1,129 miles (1,817 kilometers) across the Alaska wilderness. Holmes finished in 10 days, 14 hours, 55 minutes and 41 seconds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s a magical feeling,\" Holmes said shortly after crossing the finish line. \u201cIt\u2019s not about this moment now. It\u2019s about all those moments along the trail.\u201d",
      "Holmes, who was competing for the eighth time, previously finished in the top 10 five times, including third last year and in 2022. In his first Iditarod, in 2018, his seventh-place finish earned him Rookie of the Year honors.",
      "Born and raised in Alabama, Holmes left at age 18 and worked as a carpenter in Montana for three years. He arrived in Alaska in 2004 and found adventure running dogs on a remote location of the Yukon River.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a truly amazing 10 days and I soaked in every part of it \u2014 the lows, the highs, the in-betweens. ... I\u2019m really proud of these dogs and I love them. And they did it. They deserve all the credit,\" Holmes said.",
      "He gave a special salute to his two lead canines, Hercules, his half-sprint dog, and Polar, saying, \u201cHe's the brains behind the operation.\u201d",
      "Holmes now lives in Nenana, where he works as a carpenter and lives a subsistence lifestyle. From 2015 through 2023, he was a cast member of \u201cLife Below Zero,\u201d a National Geographic program that documents the struggles of Alaskans living in remote parts of the state.",
      "Besides the lack of snow north of the Alaska Range that forced the change of starting point to Fairbanks, race organizers also had to make changes to the ceremonial start in Anchorage.",
      "With snow trucked in to cover streets in the state\u2019s largest city, the usual parade route there was shortened from 11 miles to under 2 miles (from about 18 kilometers to under 3.2 kilometers), and the number of dogs was reduced.",
      "Only 33 mushers started in Fairbanks, tied with 2023 for the smallest field ever. The drop in participants has raised concerns about the viability of the race, which has had to contend with inflation, climate change and pressure from animal rights groups.",
      "One dog died in this year\u2019s Iditarod: a pregnant female on the team of musher Daniel Klein, who under race rules scratched due to the death.",
      "Nearly a third of the mushers quit early, including eight who scratched and two who were withdrawn for not being competitive."

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- A representative for the estate of actor Gene Hackman is seeking to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports, especially photographs and police body-camera video, related to the recent deaths of Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa after their partially mummified bodies were discovered at their New Mexico home in February.",
      "Authorities last week announced Hackman died at age 95 of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease as much as a week after a rare, rodent-borne disease \u2014 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome \u2014 took the life of his 65-year-old wife.",
      "Hackman\u2019s pacemaker last showed signs of activity on Feb. 18, indicating an abnormal heart rhythm on the day he likely died. The couple's bodies weren't discovered until Feb. 26 when maintenance and security workers showed up at the Santa Fe home and alerted police, leaving a mystery for law enforcement and medical investigators to unravel.",
      "Julia Peters, a representative for the estate of Hackman and Arakawa, urged a state district court in Santa Fe to seal records in the cases to protect the family's right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media.",
      "The request, filed Tuesday, also described the couple's discrete lifestyle in Santa Fe since Hackman's retirement. The state capital city is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.",
      "The couple \"lived an exemplary private life for over thirty years in Santa Fe, New Mexico and did not showcase their lifestyle,\u201d the petition said.",
      "New Mexico's open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of people who are deceased, said Amanda Lavin, legal director at the nonprofit New Mexico Foundation for Open Government.

      "It's been two years since we last heard from Ted Lasso but the show is officially set to return for a fourth season",
      "Jason Sudeikis' mustache is making a comeback. \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d the dramedy about a fiercely optimistic American soccer coach in London, is set to return for a fourth season, Apple TV+ announced Friday.",
      "The streamer did not say when the new episodes would become available or where they are in the production process. In a statement, Sudeikis, the show's star and an executive producer, hinted the new episodes would be about taking chances.",
      "\u201cIn season four, the folks at AFC Richmond learn to LEAP BEFORE THEY LOOK, discovering that wherever they land, it\u2019s exactly where they\u2019re meant to be.\u201d",
      "Ted Lasso the character was first introduced by Sudeikis in 2013 to promote NBC Sports' coverage of the England Premier League. In a short film, Lasso was the coach of London's Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. It was quickly clear that he knew little \u2014 if anything \u2014 about soccer.",
      "\u201cThey're gonna play hard for all four quarters,\u201d Lasso said of the players in a mock press conference. \u201cDo we have any goals this season? Absolutely. We're gonna win a lot of games and we're gonna get in the playoffs.\" \u201cThere's no playoffs\u201d a reporter corrected from the audience. The bit was so popular that Sudeikis was tapped to reprise the character again the following year.",
      "The idea came up to write a show around the character but it didn't come to fruition until Bill Lawrence (\"Scrubs,\" \u201cCougar Town\u201d) helped get it picked up by Apple TV+. \u201cTed Lasso\u201d debuted in August 2020, in the middle of the pandemic lockdown. This version of Lasso was the new coach of a fictional soccer team in London called AFC Richmond. Lasso's cheery disposition allowed him to win over even the surliest of soccer fans, not to mention viewers tired of staying indoors.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the version of me that I wish I could be,\u201d Sudeikis told the AP ahead of its debut. \u201cHe has highs and lows like anyone. But he\u2019s eternally optimistic and hopeful and sincere.\u201d",
      "\u201cTed Lasso\u201d has won seven Primetime Emmy Awards, including outstanding comedy series for its first two seasons. It made stars out of its supporting cast, including Brett Goldstein, Hannah Waddingham and Juno Temple."

      "Who killed Donald Goines",
      "DETROIT -- Who killed Donald Goines?",
      "Producers of a documentary on the life of the prisoner-turned urban fiction writer of novels about the violence, drugs and prostitution that he surrounded himself with in Detroit are hoping the answer hasn't been lost to time \u2014 or the streets.",
      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",
      "\u201cWe might find nothing. We might solve the murder,\u201d he said."

      "If you ask Brian Tyree Henry about taking time off, he bursts out laughing.",
      "Since breaking out as rapper Paper Boi in the FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d he's become one of the busiest actors in Hollywood. He's worked consistently \u2014 with directors including Barry Jenkins, Steve McQueen and Chloe Zhao and big-name actors like Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Hemsworth and Melissa McCarthy. Henry's been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award and an Oscar.",
      "His latest role is in the limited series \u201cDope Thief\" for Apple TV+ premiering Friday. Henry and Wagner Moura play Ray and Manny, two longtime friends in Philadelphia who pose as federal agents, conducting fake raids to steal drugs and money. It's a series of easy scores until they rob the wrong people and become targets themselves. Soon they're hiding out from the real DEA and a drug kingpin while trying to keep their family safe.",
      "\u201cThe minute that Wagner and I met each other, it was an instant electricity... We just felt like we knew each other all our lives,\" said Henry. \"That is exactly what you needed for Ray and Manny.\u201d",
      "The first episode was directed by Ridley Scott, and the series was created and written by Peter Craig, adapted from a novel by Dennis Tafoya.",
      "Craig describes Henry's versatility as an actor as \"like a jazz musician... It\u2019s fantastic for a writer, because you can throw him all kinds of added moments, and he\u2019ll incorporate and use them all.\u201d",
      "When the opportunity to star in \u201cDope Thief\u201d came about, Henry was ready for that long-awaited break \u2014 from TV. He wrapped \u201cAtlanta\u201d and had \u201cabout two days off\u201d before going into another FX show, \u201cClass of \u201809,\u201d where he played a character\u2019s past, present and future, and he was exhausted.",
      "\u201cTelevision is hard, you know? Like, I hear myself complaining about it; I know it\u2019s a first world problem, but you get very attached when you\u2019re doing a series. You're living with the character for quite a long time.\"",
      "So, there Henry was at 3 a.m. on a night shoot of \u201cClass of \u201809,\" wearing prosthetics as his character\u2019s future self, when his manager presented him with the script for \u201cDope Thief.\u201d \u201cWithin the first 10 pages I was incredibly attracted to Ray and also the bond he has with Manny.\u201d",
      "Time off otherwise really hasn't been his thing (hence the laughter), but Henry is quick to remind that he\u2019s had two long breaks from acting. One was during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, and the other was during the Hollywood strikes.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a person that\u2019s constantly on the move and the universe tells you to sit your (expletive) down, you kind of have to listen,\u201d said Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have stopped had the universe not said stop.\u201d",
      "Production was underway on \u201cDope Thief\u201d when the Hollywood guild strikes were called in 2023. Henry opted to stay in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t go anywhere. I made sure to be there just in case,\" said Henry, who for the first time was an executive producer on the project. He wanted to be close in proximity to his local crew. They had a cookout with bouncy castles. \u201cI would explore, or we'd go tubing and I would drive to this little town called New Hope that has a wonderful ice cream shop called Moo Hope. It was truly amazing to be present and experience that part of life for myself.\u201d",
      "Henry doesn't just bond with the crew on his sets but actors too, often walking away with new friends who happen to be very famous, like, say, Julia Roberts \u2014 whom he's currently filming a movie with in London. \u201cShe's somebody I truly cherish,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never going to stop being weird to me,\" Henry admits. \u201cThe part that is really hard for me \u2014 that I\u2019m still fighting with \u2014 is when they tell me they\u2019re fans of my stuff and I\u2019m just like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 I literally say it to their face.\u201d",
      "The biggest revelation about working alongside these accomplished actors is that Henry is now one of them.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, now, these are my peers, these are my contemporaries, and I can\u2019t continue to act like they\u2019re not. I can\u2019t continue to act like I have to shrink myself to fit in these spaces. I no longer have to do that. And what I also love is that they\u2019ll reaffirm that for me, too ... and that's the great part.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the first case.",
      "But at a key pretrial hearing Wednesday, the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers cautioned that because Weinstein\u2019s 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction was overturned, the past isn't prologue \u2014 it's almost entirely irrelevant.",
      "\u201cWe can take that transcript and all the judge\u2019s rulings and throw them in the garbage,\" Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, argued. \u201cThat trial was declared illegal by the highest court in this state.\"",
      "New York\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction last year, setting the stage for a retrial starting April 15 in state court in Manhattan. Prosecutors say it could take about five weeks.",
      "How the retrial will play out began to take shape Wednesday as Judge Curtis Farber ruled on a number of outstanding issues, including expert testimony and the language used to describe the accusers.",
      "Farber granted a prosecution request to call a psychologist, Dawn Hughes, as an expert witness on the psychological and traumatic effects of rape and sexual assault. Hughes previously testified for actor Amber Heard at Johnny Depp\u2019s libel trial against Heard in 2022 and as a prosecution witness in singer R. Kelly\u2019s federal sex trafficking trial in Brooklyn in 2021.",
      "The judge also granted a defense request to preclude the term \u201csurvivor\u201d from being used to describe Weinstein\u2019s accusers. He told prosecutors to instruct any police officers who testify to refer to the women as \u201ccomplaining witnesses\" instead.",
      "While Weinstein\u2019s convictions from the first trial were thrown out, his acquittals on the most serious charges \u2014 two counts of predatory sexual assault and first-degree, or forcible, rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Given that, Farber ordered prosecutors to instruct one of the accusers testifying at the retrial not to used the word \u201cforce\u201d when describing her alleged assault.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office had wanted to exclude any mention of Weinstein\u2019s acquittals and vacated conviction, but Farber said he could be obligated to clue them in depending on how the accuser testifies.",
      "\u201cDoes she have to use the word force? She can describe what happened and let the jury draw its own conclusions?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cI am not asking her to change her testimony from the first trial. I am asking her to refrain from using the word force.\"",
      "Other decisions were made behind closed doors as Farber met with the prosecution and defense for more than an hour in his chambers to discuss matters still under seal.",
      "They included a prosecution request that two of the three accusers in the case be allowed to testify about other alleged encounters with Weinstein. They also discussed evidence of the accusers' sexual history, which prosecutors say should be barred under New York's Rape Shield Law.",
      "Weinstein, 72, was in court for Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, arriving from jail in a wheelchair and suit and holding a stack of documents. Before the public portion of his hearing began, the ex-studio boss watched as Farber spent a few minutes resolving another matter that had been delayed by their closed-door discussions.",
      "At his last court appearance in January, Weinstein had implored Farber to start the retrial sooner.",
      "He told the judge \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on\u201d with cancer, heart issues and harsh conditions at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, where he is locked up. Farber said he may hold jury selection a few days sooner if a murder trial he's overseeing wraps up ahead of schedule.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. The additional charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors said in court papers that the woman, who has not been identified publicly, came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison, but they revisited them and secured a new indictment after his conviction was thrown out.",
      "Farber ruled in October to combine the new indictment and existing charges into one trial.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors prejudiced him by waiting nearly five years to bring the additional charge, suggesting they had elected not to include the allegation in his first trial so they could use it later if his conviction were reversed.",
      "Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
      "In vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench and such testimony won't be part of the retrial.",
      "Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.",

      "The Russo brothers bring Simon St\u00e5lenhag's illustrated novel \u201cThe Electric State\u201d to life in the new big budget Netflix film",
      "If an algorithm designed a classic, big-screen spectacle for the small-screen age, \u201cThe Electric State\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t be too far off the mark.",
      "This is an Amblin-inspired, big-budget adventure with dystopian, science-fiction wonder, nostalgic callbacks, well-liked stars (Chris Pratt! Millie Bobby Brown! Stanley Tucci! Giancarlo Esposito! Ke Huy Quan!) and the directors ( Joe and Anthony Russo ) behind some of the highest-earning movies of all time.",
      "In theory, it should work. A kid on a dangerous, cross-country journey with a robot that may or may not be her brother whom she thought was dead? A reluctant, jaded adult companion who\u2019s quick with a one-liner? \u201cThe Electric State\u201d should be some future Spielberg\u2019s new favorite movie, the one that they\u2019ll reference in their Oscars speech as the thing that made them want to make movies. And yet it\u2019s lacking a spark and a soul that might distinguish it as memorable or special. Worse, considering everything it has going for it (including a reported budget that may have exceeded $300 million), \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is kind of dull.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was loosely based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag that was released in 2018 and quickly scooped up for movie adaptation purposes with Marvel veterans Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely writing the script. Set in the early 1990s, this is a world in which service robots have risen up and demanded rights and freedom. The humans respond by going to war.",
      "This four-year war is skimmed over in a montage at the start of the film and, by 1994, Mr. Peanut (Woody Harrelson) is signing a peace treaty with Bill Clinton and the remaining robots are exiled to rot in the desert. The human victory was attributed to the drone creations of a Steve Jobs-ian tech billionaire Ethan Skate (Tucci), who is soon hawking his \u201cNeurocasters\u201d to the public. They scoop it up and soon society is just a bleak wasteland of screen zombies content to let their avatars work while they relax and fantasize a way out of their downtrodden existence.",
      "There are shades of \u201cThe Creator,\u201d \u201cWALL-E,\u201d \u201cReady Player One\u201d and many, many more films in here. But no one gets mad that something is derivative if it\u2019s also good. It\u2019s only when the kitchen sink references are so clear and come up so short that it becomes a real problem.",
      "Brown plays Michelle, an angry, orphaned teenager who lost her entire family not in the war, but in a car wreck. The one she misses the most is her little brother Christopher (Woody Norman, giving the best, most emotionally authentic performance in the film), a reluctant child prodigy. One day, a robot of a cartoon character they used to watch together turns up at her foster home, speaking only in the character\u2019s catchphrases. But after some gestures toward a photograph, she starts to believe that this robot is, somehow, Christopher, or at least someone who can lead her to the real Christopher. And thus starts their journey across America, and into the robot \u201cexclusion zone\u201d to figure out this puzzle. They soon team up with a war veteran/smuggler Keats (Pratt) and his snarky robot sidekick (Anthony Mackie, for your Marvel bingo card) and try to evade Esposito\u2019s robot bounty hunter.",
      "The robots they find in the exclusion zone are voiced by an army of celebrities you\u2019ll go insane trying to place before angrily resorting to IMDb, including Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Brian Cox and Jenny Slate. Their designs are thoughtful and remarkable and should evoke a sense of awe in the viewer at the sheer ingenuity behind this film, where many of the most impressive shots seem to be the recreations of St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s illustrations of dismantled, decaying robots. The action, however, gets mind-numbingly repetitive by the end of the bloated runtime.",
      "Pratt and Brown, while fine individually, don\u2019t really find their groove as partners on this journey either. Pratt is kind of just doing his thing and gets the few clever one-liners in the script. Brown, meanwhile, seems a little bored by yet another teen adventure role. And both ultimately look like movie stars in '90s cosplay, which might be a metaphor for the larger failure of the movie.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was, of course, not made by algorithm, which is an admittedly cheap shot for a Netflix original. Unfortunately, it just feels that way.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State,\u201d a Netflix release streaming Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csci-fi violence/action, language and some thematic material.\u201d Running time: 128 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "President Donald Trump's team is looking at locations for a post-administration presidential library, and Florida may take that spot",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump's team is already looking for locations for his presidential library, and Florida may be a top contender.",
      "A Florida legislator said Monday that the state has a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of getting its first presidential library.",
      "Presidential libraries are significant for post-administration historical archives depicting materials from a former president's term. They require years of planning and don't use federal funding.",
      "Here are a few things to know about a potential Trump presidential library:",
      "The state Senate Rules Committee on Wednesday unanimously backed Sen. Jason Brodeur's bill that he said would \u201cprevent any municipality or county from imposing frivolous obstacles to the establishment of a presidential library within the state.\u201d",
      "Brodeur said other states that built presidential libraries had construction roadmaps created to follow state and local laws, and Florida would need the same. He also said all former presidents are welcome to put a presidential library in Florida, not just Trump.",
      "\u201cI anticipate that this will be a pretty popular attraction. It is somebody who\u2019s likely even the most famous developer in the world right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Brodeur's bill comes as Trump's team is looking at several South Florida universities \u2014 including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University \u2014 as potential spots for a presidential library.",
      "A secretary at the FAU president\u2019s office said she had not heard of any plans for a presidential library and declined to comment further. Spokespeople for FAU and FIU, and the White House press office didn't immediately respond to messages about possible plans for a presidential library.",
      "Traditionally, such libraries are built in the state where a president was born or grew up. Trump, though, was born in New York, which voted against him in three straight presidential elections and which made him the first former president to be convicted of felonies last year.",
      "Trump now primarily lives in Florida, and he's filled his administration's ranks with politicians and others from the Sunshine State.",
      "Democrats raised concerns in committee hearings about whether local residents would bear the costs of the library's construction. Brodeur said all costs of building the library, including the planning costs, would fall to the president and library archives.",
      "In December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit. In the agreement, ABC News described the payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution\u201d to an escrow account being managed by Trump's attorney.",
      "That's would amount to a small fraction of the overall cost of building the library. For example, former President Barack Obama\u2019s library in Chicago was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Little is known about what would be in a Trump presidential library, but materials in these libraries usually include documents, artifacts or items significant to a president\u2019s administration.",
      "Earlier this month the Justice Department returned the boxes coming from the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home in 2022 for classified documents. Trump said in a Truth Social post that these boxes were being sent to Florida, where they \u201cwill someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library.\u201d"

      "There's a crackling patter to \u201cBlack Bag\u201d \u2014 Steven Soderbergh\u2019s marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller",
      "If you\u2019re hosting a dinner for half a dozen British intelligence agents with the aim of ferreting out a mole, what should you cook?",
      "For George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender), who's preparing for four colleagues, plus himself and his wife, Kathryn St. Jean (Cate Blanchett), who, like him, is a high-level operative, it\u2019s chana masala with a few drops of truth serum.",
      "\u201cWill there be any mess to clean up?\u201d Kathryn asks her husband as they\u2019re getting ready.",
      "\u201cWith any luck,\u201d he responds.",
      "So goes much of the crackling patter of \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d Steven Soderbergh\u2019s delicious marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller. Lean and taut, the 93-minute \u201cBlack Bag\u201d is more a sizzling amuse-bouche than full-course meal, but it\u2019s simmered to perfection.",
      "George and Kathryn, as fellow agents at London\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, don\u2019t seemingly have what you might call a traditional marriage. Each has their own secret ops, leaving large swaths of their lives off limits to the other. When George asks where Kathryn is flying off to on Wednesday, she shrugs with a smile, \u201cBlack bag.\u201d",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening scene \u2013 a slinky tracking shot that trails George into and out of a nightclub \u2013 an agent named Meacham (Gustaf Skarsgard) gives him the assignment to track down the mole, with the added wrinkle that Kathryn can\u2019t be dismissed as a possible suspect. A cyber-worm device called Severus that\u2019s capable of hacking into nuclear facilities has gone missing. The fate of the world, as it so often is, is said to be at stake.",
      "But, really, the state of George and Kathryn\u2019s marriage is what interests us. Extreme though their situation is, their union is one that, like any couple, is built on trust and devotion, even if their professional lives demand the inverse. When George, lying on top of Kathryn tells her he\u2019d do anything for her, she coos, \u201cWould you kill?\u201d It's a fair-enough test to the bounds of wedded bliss, sure, but her second question matters even more. \u201cWould you lie?\u201d",
      "Over that dinner \u2013 a scintillating set piece around a darkened dinner table inside their London town house \u2013 we can quickly gather just how much the truth means to George. He\u2019s renown for his powers with a polygraph. As a youngster, he even brought down his own father, uncovering his affair. \u201cI don\u2019t like liars,\u201d George says through clenched teeth.",
      "They\u2019re joined by Colonel James Stokes (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page); the in-house psychologist Dr. Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris); the carousing spy Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke); and the newest NCSC recruit, cyber specialist Clarissa (Marisa Abela). Both are paired off in clandestine relationships that quickly emerge, among other secrets. More than state secrets, infidelity dominates the conversation.",
      "Fassbender\u2019s spook is an agent of precision. He wears gleaming black-framed glasses. When only a few drops of sauce land on his cuff, he immediately withdraws to change his shirt. Hard as it would seem, Fassbender has found a character almost as dispassionate and monotone as his methodical assassin in David Fincher\u2019s \u201cThe Killer.\u201d",
      "This time, though, he's not a loner. Blanchett\u2019s Kathryn is kept more at a remove from us. She\u2019s mysterious and aloof \u2013 a femme fatale, maybe, we\u2019re led to wonder. An \u201caroma of hostility\u201d accompanies her, Zoe tells her in a psych evaluation. Is she the mole?",
      "This is an insular film, taking place mainly in crisply composed interiors, aside from the lake George occasionally fishes for bass in. There, in a fitting encapsulation of a movie full of smooth surfaces with currents twisting underneath, the camera gently rests on the water's surface.",
      "\u201cBlack Bag\u201d follows a run of agilely directed thrillers by Soderbergh made with screenwriter David Koepp ( \u201cPresence,\u201d \u201cKimi\u201d). They are both at the height of their almost-too-easy powers; the script, especially, is peppered with delectable dialogue. Their movie adopts the air of menace and suspicion of a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel, yet hinges on the sturdiness of its married couple, like a super spy version of Nick and Nora from \u201cThe Thin Man\" or a more cerebral \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith.\u201d",
      "All of the supporting players \u2013 while they make up a fine ensemble \u2013 are ultimately playthings in their game of love. In a casting coup, a former James Bond \u2013 Pierce Brosnan \u2013 drops in late in the film as Arthur Stheiglitz, the head of NCSC. In his handful of scenes, Brosnan is rageful and ferocious, chomping into both Ikizukuri (prepared live fish) and the scenery.",
      "His presence both enlivens a movie already humming with the uber-cool chemistry of Blanchett and Fassbender while transforming \u201cBlack Bag\u201d into a twisty rejoinder to that notoriously skirt-chasing spy. Here, Mr. Bond, is how sexy monogamy can be.",
      "While directing a satellite to peer down upon his wife on some unknown mission in Europe, George explains their mystifying dynamic to Clarissa: \u201cI watch her, and she watches me. If she gets into trouble, I will do everything in my power to extricate her.\u201d",
      "In her response, Clarissa speaks for everyone: \u201cThat\u2019s so hot.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack Bag,\u201d a Focus Features release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language including some sexual references, and some violence. Running time: 93 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "The hero at the heart of \u201cNovocaine\u201d can't feel pain",
      "Nathan Caine may not be able to feel pain, as the tagline for the new action-comedy \u201cNovocaine\u201d reads, but the same does not apply to audiences.",
      "Although he doesn\u2019t scream when his leg is impaled with an arrow or when he sticks his hand in a vat of frying oil, you might. I certainly did. Out loud. In a theater. With other people. There may have been some phrases uttered entirely involuntarily too. Were other people reacting in the same way, I wonder? I couldn\u2019t hear them over my own groans. Hooray for the communal experience, I guess?",
      "This is, in some ways, a film for people who thought John Wick wasn\u2019t stabby enough. It delights in the relentless mutilation of its hero, a regular guy (played by Jack Quaid ) with a rare condition that has rendered him immune from feeling any sort of discomfort to bodily harm. Unlike such high concept premises as \u201cCrank,\u201d congenital insensitivity to pain analgesia (or CIPA) is actually real. But it\u2019s not exactly a superpower, Nate explains. He can still die; it just might be because he hasn\u2019t emptied his bladder in many hours. Or because he's accidentally bitten his tongue off eating a sandwich. These are real concerns of his.",
      "His entire existence is devoted to preventing these kinds of crises, mostly through tried-and-true baby proofing techniques like using tennis balls on sharp corners. Like Kelly Ripa before a show, he only consumes \u201cnon-chewing food.\u201d",
      "Work is stable and dull as an assistant manager at a bank. And dating is out of the question; He spends most of his free time playing online video games. Quaid, even with his two movie star parents, is somehow believable as this cautious introvert, though everything is played with a light touch and a wink. The movie, written by Lars Jacobson and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, even begins with the mournful R.E.M. anthem \u201cEverybody Hurts.\u201d",
      "Then Nate\u2019s life is changed one day when a pretty teller at the bank, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), asks him out to lunch, then to drinks and even spends the night. The next morning, things get even crazier: Sherry is taken hostage after a violent robbery at the bank. These guys are capital B bad (led by fellow nepo spawn Ray Nicholson) killing both the bank manager the cops outside. So what does Nate do? He steals a cop car and attempts to save her himself.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d pleads an injured cop as Nate hesitates before apprehending the car. It\u2019s hard to argue with the cop: Why not just let the professionals handle it, understaffed though they may be over the Christmas holiday? It would be a rather short and pointless movie if he did just leave it to the cops, but the impetus for this quest is a stretch to say the least. The conceit is missing some extra justification of why he felt like he was the only one who could do it, especially once he actually talks to said cops (Betty Gabriel and Matt Walsh).",

      "LONDON -- Manchester United unveiled plans on Tuesday to build the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest\" soccer stadium.",
      "A proposed 100,000-seater arena would surpass Wembley as the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Under the plans, the 20-time English champion said it would build next to its iconic Old Trafford ground, likely meaning it would not need to relocate during the construction process.",
      "\u201cOur current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport,\u201d part owner Jim Ratcliffe said. \u201cBy building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience only footsteps from our historic home.\u201d",
      "United did not say how much the stadium would cost or reveal a timeline for its completion, but architect Norman Foster said building work would take five years.",
      "British billionaire Ratcliffe paid $1.3 billion for an initial 25% stake in United last year and made a new stadium one of his priorities.",
      "The possibility of redeveloping Old Trafford, one of the most iconic stadiums in soccer, was considered but an entirely new construction was the preferred option.",
      "\u201cToday marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world\u2019s greatest football stadium,\u201d Ratcliffe said.",
      "United wants the venue to be part of a wider project to regenerate the surrounding Old Trafford area, which it said would be worth 7.3 billion pounds ($9.4 billion) to the U.K. economy. The U.K. government has already voiced its support for the project, although the specifics of how it would be funded are not known.",
      "Wembley is currently the biggest stadium in the U.K., with a capacity of 90,000, and is home to England\u2019s national soccer team.",
      "Twickenham, which is home to the national rugby team, holds 82,500.",
      "Old Trafford is the country\u2019s biggest dedicated soccer stadium with a capacity of just over 74,000, but is dated in comparison to the likes of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, which regularly hosts NFL games.",
      "\u201cOur long-term objective as a club is to have the world\u2019s best football team playing in the world\u2019s best stadium,\" United chief executive Omar Berrada said.",
      "Managerial great Alex Ferguson said the club \"must be brave and seize this opportunity to build a new home, fit for the future, where new history can be made.\"",
      "The announcement came days after thousands of United fans marched in protest against the club's ownership in the face of cost cuts, ticket price rises and ongoing failure on the field.",
      "United is majority owned by the American Glazer family, which also owns the NFL\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Upon investing, Ratcliffe vowed to return the once-dominant club back to the summit of European soccer after more than a decade since it last won the Premier League.",
      "But his first year in charge of soccer operations has been turbulent. United endured its worst-ever Premier League season last year and is on course to set a new low this term, with the team currently languishing in the bottom half of the standings.",

      "Aid agencies distributing U.S. food aid in Ethiopia's war-affected Tigray region say they have had to stop feeding millions of people because of the Trump administration's restrictions on foreign aid",
      "MEKELE, Ethiopia -- As a displaced person in Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region, 76-year-old Haile Tsege is no stranger to hunger.",
      "During its war with Tigray fighters that devastated the region in 2020-2022, Ethiopian government restrictions on the rebellious region reduced aid flows to a trickle. Then in 2023, U.S. and U.N. aid distributions of grain were halted for months over a corruption scandal.",
      "Now the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, has again halted food deliveries to a sprawling camp of over 20,000 people outside Tigray\u2019s regional capital, Mekele.",
      "\u201cWe will just die in silence,\u201d said Tsege, one of the 2.4 million people in Tigray who depend on humanitarian grain, most of it provided by the U.S.",
      "Ethiopia with its over 125 million people had been the biggest beneficiary of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa, receiving $1.8 billion in the 2023 financial year. In addition to life-saving food, the funds were spent on HIV medications, vaccines, literacy programs and jobs creation, as well as services for 1 million refugees hosted by Ethiopia.",
      "Most of these programs have been stopped. The USAID staffers who oversaw them have been placed on administrative leave and told not to work, as they face the threat of termination. The U.S. Embassy didn't respond to questions.",
      "Emergency food was exempted from President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, signed on his first day in office, suspending foreign aid during a 90-day review amid the administration's allegations of waste.",
      "Aid agencies in Ethiopia had to apply to USAID for waivers to continue handing out U.S. grain. These have been secured, but USAID\u2019s payments system is still not functioning.",
      "As a result, a consortium of aid agencies in Tigray has had to stop distributions to the over 1 million people it has been responsible for feeding with U.S.-provided grain. It has no money to pay for fuel, trucks and drivers to distribute existing food stockpiles.",
      "That includes 5,000 metric tons of sorghum \u2013 enough to feed 300,000 people for a month \u2013 stuck in a storage facility in Mekele that could rot before it reaches those in need.",
      "\u201cThis is just one warehouse. There are several others across the region,\u201d said Teklewoini Assefa, head of the Relief Society of Tigray, part of the consortium. \u201cThis will create malnutrition, disease. If this situation continues, what follows? Death.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cEverything boils down to the payment system.\u201d",
      "The effects of the aid cuts are widespread, with many USAID contracts terminated. Already, Ethiopia has been forced to lay off 5,000 local healthcare workers who were working on its HIV response.",
      "Tigray relied heavily on U.S. funds. More than two years after the war killed hundreds of thousands, full-scale recovery efforts are yet to start. The region\u2019s health system is in ruins and hundreds of schools remain closed.",
      "In 2024, child malnutrition stood at 21% in some areas, according to a survey reviewed by The Associated Press \u2014 far above the World Health Organization\u2019s threshold of 15% at which a situation is classified as an emergency.",
      "Now, aid workers say many programs to improve nutrition have halted. Projects to deliver medicines and vaccines have stopped. Dozens of camps for displaced people have had water sources cut off.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been huge,\u201d said Ashenafi Asmelash, executive director of Mums for Mums, which has had two USAID- funded programs terminated. One helped build long-term resilience among farmers. The other helped improve the nutrition of children and new mothers.",
      "Management Sciences for Health, another Tigray organization, has halted a project to combat tuberculosis and told its staff to expect mass layoffs in March, according to a senior executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "Efforts to assist thousands of women who were raped during the war have been derailed, said Rigat Bishaw at Ayder Hospital, Tigray\u2019s biggest healthcare facility.",
      "This includes counseling and physiotherapy sessions for survivors run by the U.S.-based Center for Victims of Torture, which received a stop-work order from the Trump administration in February and furloughed its staff.",
      "CVT also halted a program to train health workers to recognize sexual abuse cases and refer survivors to appropriate health services.",
      "\u201cThis sudden disruption is having a huge impact on the healing of traumatized people,\u201d said Yohannes Fisseha, a CVT manager.",
      "Major projects to support people living with HIV, improve access to life-saving nutrition services and improve relations between war-affected communities have also been cut off, said Yirga Gebregziabher, the Tigray branch manager of an Ethiopian organization called OSSHD, which helped implement the projects.",
      "The organization has been forced to fire dozens of expert staff.",
      "\u201cOur picture of America was as a protector of rights, a positive force in the world,\u201d Yigra said. \u201cThat image has now been broken. If there was a process, maybe the shock would have been less. But there was no consultation, no engagement.\u201d",

The aid cuts, which affect governments and their partners in the non-governmental sector, have shut down or disrupted projects tackling diseases ranging from malaria to AIDS.",

      "The Connecticut Supreme Court has upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in 2015, in a case that drew widespread attention because of evidence from the victim's Fitbit exercise activity tracker",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Despite finding \u201cimproprieties\u201d were committed by a prosecutor, the Connecticut Supreme Court on Monday upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in a case that drew wide attention because the victim's Fitbit exercise tracker contradicted his statements to police.",
      "The justices ruled in a 6-0 decision that Richard Dabate was not deprived of a fair trial because of four missteps by the prosecutor they called \u201ctroubling,\u201d including referring to one of Connecticut's most notorious crimes while cross-examining the man.",
      "Dabate, 48, was convicted of murder and other charges in the fatal shooting of Connie Dabate, 39, at the couple's home in Ellington two days before Christmas in 2015 while their two young sons were in school. He's serving a 65-year prison sentence.",
      "Prosecutors said Dabate wanted his wife dead, in part, because he had a yearslong affair with another woman who was pregnant at the time of the killing and later gave birth to their child.",
      "Dabate staged a phony crime scene, including tying himself up loosely with zip ties and stabbing himself with a box cutter, and told police an unknown intruder in camouflage broke into their home, killed his wife and assaulted him, authorities said.",
      "State police said Dabate gave them a timeline of events that conflicted with data on his wife\u2019s Fitbit, which showed she was moving around for about an hour after the time Dabate said she was shot.",
      "Dabate testified in his defense and maintained his innocence, saying a large masked man with a voice like actor Vin Diesel was the killer.",
      "Part of Dabate's appeal questioned the reliability of the Fitbit evidence and whether the trial judge was wrong to have allowed it, but the Supreme Court upheld the data and its use.",
      "Dabate also accused Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky of multiple instances of impropriety, including Gedansky mentioning a notorious home invasion in Cheshire in 2007 while cross-examining Dabate. The home invaders killed a woman and her two daughters, ages 11 and 17, after terrorizing them for hours, while the woman's husband survived a vicious beating.",
      "Gedansky asked Dabate if he was trying to create a \u201clittle mini-Cheshire scene\u201d in his own home. The trial judge upheld an objection by Dabate's lawyer and asked Gedansky to rephrase the question, but Gedansky asked nearly the same exact question. The Supreme Court found Gedansky violated the judge's order to rephrase.",
      "\u201cIn referring to a \u2018mini Cheshire,\u2019 the prosecutor\u2019s question was unnecessarily inflammatory because it compared the defendant to other notorious offenders or infamous figures,\u201d Justice Joan Alexander wrote in the decision.",
      "Gedansky and Dabate's lawyer, Trent LaLima, did not immediately return email messages seeking comment Monday.",
      "The Supreme Court also found that Gedansky committed three other improprieties, including suggesting that the jury would have to be unintelligent or lazy to agree with the defense theory of the case.",
      "\u201cWe disapprove of the improprieties committed by the prosecutor during the trial of this case in strong and unqualified terms and expect our message to be taken with the utmost seriousness by prosecutors,\u201d the decision said.",
      "The court said it agreed with Dabate that \u201cthe prosecutor engaged in multiple acts of impropriety at trial that we consider troubling.\u201d",
      "Justices, however, said the state's case was very strong and Gedansky's missteps did not overshadow testimony by 130 witnesses and the 600 exhibits presented during the five-week trial."

      "The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld the state law. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has struck down local local bans in Florida.",
      "In 2023, the court had turned away a similar challenge, despite a split among federal appeals courts that had weighed state bans and come to differing decisions.",
      "At the time, three justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, said they would have taken on the issue. It takes four justices to grant review. The nine-member court does not typically reveal how justices vote at this stage of a case so it\u2019s unclear who might have provided the fourth vote.",

      "The ban comes weeks after federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cIt's not a bill I care that much about,\u201d Cox added, \u201cbut it's a bill I will sign.\u201d",
      "Utah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Its Republican sponsor, Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of \u201cindividual choice\u201d to not have it in the water.",
      "Cox said that like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his own children in a community that doesn\u2019t have fluoridated water \u2014 or what he called a \u201cnatural experiment.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou would think you would see drastically different outcomes with half the state not getting it. We haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Cox said in a weekend interview with ABC4 in Salt Lake City. \u201cSo it\u2019s got to be a really high bar for me if we\u2019re going to require people to be medicated by their government.\u201d",
      "Already, some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "A Utah teenager who urged lawmakers to pass the bill described suffering a medical emergency when the fluoride pump in Sandy, Utah, malfunctioned in 2019, releasing an excessive amount of the mineral into the drinking water. The fluoride sickened hundreds of residents and led many in Utah to push for its removal.",
      "It\u2019s rare to find high levels of fluoridation in water, according to the National Institutes of Health. The agency said it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose of fluoride from water with standard levels of the mineral.",
      "Kessler said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water have been reduced over time and are below levels considered problematic.",
      "\u201cThe science proves that it is effective at reducing cavities with little to no risk of other problems,\u201d he said.",
      "He added that a ban in Utah could have a domino effect with other legislatures being encouraged to follow suit with fluoride bans in their states.",
      "Opponents warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.",
      "Fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "Utah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "In February, the city council in Riverton, a Salt Lake City suburb, unanimously passed a resolution to remove fluoride from the city\u2019s public water systems. Voters in Brigham City, 59 miles (95 kilometers) north of the capital city, struck down by a large margin a measure in 2023 that would have removed the mineral from its public water supply.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state\u2019s biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "Rodney Thornell, president of the Utah Dental Association, began practicing dentistry in a Salt Lake City suburb before the city added fluoride to its water. His adult patients who grew up locally continue to get lots of cavities but younger patients who grew up with fluoride in the water get fewer, he said.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re going to keep eating sugar, we need fluoride.\u201d Thornell said, noting that Utah residents consume more than the national average of candy and sugary drinks.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump Administration's quest to \u201cMake America Health Again\u201d is targeting ultraprocessed foods",
      "In the Trump administration\u2019s quest to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d there may be no bigger target than ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s new health secretary, has cited \u201chighly chemically processed foods\u201d as a chief culprit behind an epidemic of chronic disease in the U.S., including ailments such as obesity, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.",
      "Such foods are \u201cpoisoning\u201d people, particularly children, Kennedy said during Senate confirmation hearings. He has vowed to work to remove such foods from federal programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "\u201cI will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\u201d he told lawmakers.",
      "Key to that goal, however, could be making sure that consumers understand basic facts about ultraprocessed foods and the role they play in daily meals.",
      "From sugary cereals at breakfast to frozen pizzas at dinner, plus in-between snacks of potato chips, sodas and ice cream, ultraprocessed foods make up about 60% of the U.S. diet. For kids and teens, it\u2019s even higher \u2014 about two-thirds of what they eat.",
      "That\u2019s concerning because ultraprocessed foods have been linked to a host of negative health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. One recent study suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of early death.",
      "Nutrition science is tricky, though, and most research so far has found connections, not proof, regarding the health consequences of these foods.",
      "Food manufacturers argue that processing boosts food safety and supplies and offers a cheap, convenient way to provide a diverse and nutritious diet.",
      "Even if the science were clear, it\u2019s hard to know what practical advice to give when ultraprocessed foods account for what one study estimates is more than 70% of the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Associated Press asked several nutrition experts and here\u2019s what they said:",
      "Most foods are processed, whether it\u2019s by freezing, grinding, fermentation, pasteurization or other means. In 2009, Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro and colleagues first proposed a system that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo, not by nutrient content.",
      "At the top of the four-tier scale are foods created through industrial processes and with ingredients such as additives, colors and preservatives that you couldn\u2019t duplicate in a home kitchen, said Kevin Hall, a researcher who focuses on metabolism and diet at the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cThese are most, but not all, of the packaged foods you see,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Such foods are often made to be both cheap and irresistibly delicious, said Dr. Neena Prasad, director of the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 Food Policy Program.",
      "\u201cThey have just the right combination of sugar, salt and fat and you just can\u2019t stop eating them,\u201d Prasad said",
      "However, the level of processing alone doesn\u2019t determine whether a food is unhealthy or not, Hall noted. Whole-grain bread, yogurt, tofu and infant formula are all highly processed, for instance, but they\u2019re also nutritious.",
      "Here\u2019s the tricky part. Many studies suggest that diets high in such foods are linked to negative health outcomes. But these kinds of studies can\u2019t say whether the foods themselves are the cause of the negative effects \u2014 or whether there\u2019s something else about the people who eat these foods that might be responsible.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods, as a group, tend to have higher amounts of sodium, saturated fat and sugar, and tend to be lower in fiber and protein. It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s just these nutrients that are driving the effects.",
      "Hall and his colleagues were the first to conduct a small but influential experiment that directly compared the results of eating similar diets made of ultraprocessed versus unprocessed foods.",
      "Published in 2019, the research included 20 adults who went to live at an NIH center for a month. They received diets of ultraprocessed and unprocessed foods matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients for two weeks each and were told to eat as much as they liked.",
      "When participants ate the diet of ultraprocessed foods, they consumed about 500 calories per day more than when they ate unprocessed foods, researchers found \u2014 and they gained an average of about 2 pounds (1 kilogram) during the study period. When they ate only unprocessed foods for the same amount of time, they lost about 2 pounds (1 kilogram).",
      "Hall is conducting a more detailed study now, but the process is slow and costly and results aren\u2019t expected until late next year. He and others argue that such definitive research is needed to determine exactly how ultraprocessed foods affect consumption.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better to understand the mechanisms by which they drive the deleterious health consequences, if they\u2019re driving them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some advocates, like Prasad, argue that the large body of research linking ultraprocessed foods to poor health should be more than enough to spur government and industry to change policies. She calls for actions such as increased taxes on sugary drinks, stricter sodium restrictions for manufacturers and cracking down on marketing of such foods to children.",
      "\u201cDo we want to risk our kids getting sicker while we wait for this perfect evidence to emerge?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Last year, former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf broached the subject, telling a conference of food policy experts that ultraprocessed foods are \u201cone of the most complex things I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201d",
      "But, he concluded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the scientific basis and then we\u2019ve got to follow through.\u201d",
      "In countries like the U.S., it\u2019s hard to avoid highly processed foods \u2014 and it's not clear which ones should be targeted, said Aviva Musicus, science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates for food policies.",
      "\u201cThe range of ultraprocessed foods is just so wide,\u201d she said.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s better to be mindful of the ingredients in foods. Check the labels and make choices that align with the current dietary guidelines, she suggested.",
      "\u201cWe have really good evidence that added sugar is not great for us. We have evidence that high-sodium foods are not great for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have great evidence that fruits and vegetables which are minimally processed are really good for us.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s important not to vilify certain foods, she added. Many consumers don\u2019t have the time or money to cook most meals from scratch.",
      "\u201cFoods should be joyous and delicious and shouldn\u2019t involve moral judgment,\u201d Musicus said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Dr. David Weldon had been out of the national spotlight for more than 15 years when he was nominated to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many anti-vaccine advocates knew him well.",
      "\u201cHe is one of us!! Since before our movement had momentum,\u201d the co-director of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights wrote on Facebook. And on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Autism Action Network credited the former congressman with introducing legislation two decades ago \u201cto stop the vaccine pedocide.\u201d",
      "Weldon, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can lead the nation\u2019s top public health agency. His confirmation hearing is to be held Thursday.",
      "The 71-year-old retired Florida congressman is considered to be closely aligned with his presumptive boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who for years has been one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials declined to make Weldon or Kennedy available for an Associated Press interview.",
      "When he made the nomination announcement, Trump said Weldon \u201cwill proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",
      "Today, the Atlanta-based agency has a more than $9 billion core budget. It had about 13,000 employees when Trump took office, but more than 500 were fired as part of a dramatic \u2014 and continuing \u2014 push by the president and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk to cut staffing across federal agencies.",
      "Weldon has no experience in federal public heath, but that isn't unusual. The last few presidential administrations \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 have appointed outsiders with no CDC experience.",
      "Unlike Weldon, however, those outsiders had been public health researchers or had run state health departments. He is an Army veteran and internal medicine doctor whose main claim to fame was representing a central Florida district in Congress from 1995 to 2009.",
      "After he left Congress, Weldon practiced medicine in Florida, taught at the Florida Institute of Technology, served as board chairman for the Israel Allies Foundation and made unsuccessful runs at federal and state elected office. In a March 1 letter to HHS, Weldon said that if confirmed he will resign from the foundation and from two Florida health-care organizations. He also promised to sell his holdings in funds investing in energy, pharmaceutical and health-care companies.",
      "Weldon was a leader of a Congressional push for research into autism\u2019s causes, which began around 2000. It was fueled by a controversial \u2014 and ultimately discredited \u2014 study by British researcher Dr. Andrew Wakefield that claimed to find a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism.",
      "The action in Congress was driven largely by U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican whose grandson had autism. Weldon was a prominent voice in Burton\u2019s hearings and co-sponsored a bill that would give responsibility for the nation\u2019s vaccine safety to an independent agency within HHS \u2014 an idea that not everyone in public health opposes.",
      "But Weldon also rejected studies that found no causal link between childhood vaccines and autism, and accused the CDC of short-circuiting research that might show otherwise.",
      "Meanwhile, Weldon was a friend to practitioners of fringe medicine. When Weldon invited Wakefield to testify before Congress, he also brought in Dr. James \u201cJeff\u201d Bradstreet, who used alternative medicine to try to treat autistic children. Bradstreet died in 2015, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raided his office, of a gunshot wound that police labeled a suicide.",
      "Weldon later appeared in \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,\u201d a 2016 documentary directed by Wakefield and produced by Del Bigtree, an activist who later became the manager of Kennedy\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. In the movie, Weldon repeated suspicions and accusations about CDC that he\u2019d made as a congressman.",
      "Kennedy has argued that experts who advise the CDC on vaccine policy have conflicts from working with, or receiving money from, pharmaceutical companies. Those advisers routinely disclose conflicts in public meetings, but the CDC last week launched a web tool \u201cto increase the transparency of conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Democrats are likely to press Weldon on his vaccine views and his plans for the agency under a health secretary who has shown disdain for it.",
      "Dr. Anne Schuchat worked at the CDC for 33 years before retiring in 2021, and twice served as acting director. She said she doesn\u2019t know Weldon, but that agency directors gradually develop an appreciation and respect for its work.",
      "If Weldon follows a similar pattern, she said, he could be a great asset: His Capitol Hill experience could help CDC secure funding and political support.",
      "\u201cWith an optimistic view, there\u2019s lot you can build on, with what he has on paper,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a pessimistic view, if he wants the job to tear the place down, that would be disappointing \u2014 and dangerous.\u201d",

      "Tensions have been running high ahead of the demonstrations with Vucic repeatedly warning of alleged plans for unrest while threatening arrests and harsh sentences for any incidents.",
      "Fueling fears of clashes, Vucic's supporters have been camping in central Belgrade in front of his headquarters. The crowd included ex-members of a dreaded paramilitary unit involved in the assassination in 2003 of Serbia's first democratic Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, as well as soccer hooligans who are known for causing violence.",

      "HONG KONG -- Chinese food and beverage brands are gaining ground across Southeast Asia, offering alternatives to big name American chains and expanding Beijing\u2019s commercial and cultural influence in neighboring economies.",
      "The Chinese beverage giant Mixue Group has become the world\u2019s largest F&B chain by number of outlets, overtaking Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s.",
      "The company, whose brand name Mixue Bingcheng means \u201cHoney Snow Ice City,\u201d in Chinese, is capitalizing on the region-wide sweet tooth with affordable offerings of ice cream, coffee and bubble tea drinks.",
      "\u201cEven on social media like TikTok and others, there is a joke that any empty shophouse would soon turn into a Mixue store,\u201d Rahma Yuliana said, referring to a popular saying in Indonesia, where Mixue has more than 2,600 outlets.",
      "The single mother, who runs an online business, takes her daughter for afterschool treats that won't drain her wallet, such as a cup of brown sugar milk tea that costs $1.10, about one-third cheaper than similar offerings by rival Taiwanese tea chain Chatime. An ice cream sells for as little as 50 cents, undercutting McDonald\u2019s.",
      "As of September, Mixue Group had over 45,000 stores carrying its Mixue tea drinks, ice creams and Lucky Cup coffee products, more than the store numbers of Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s, industry analysts reported. About 40,000 of those are in China.",
      "More broadly, by December, Chinese F&B brands had opened over 6,100 outlets in Southeast Asia, Singapore-headquartered research firm Momentum Works reported. India and Vietnam account for roughly two-thirds, while there are relatively more Chinese brands in Singapore and Malaysia, which have sizable Chinese-speaking populations.",
      "Nearly all of Mixue's stores are franchises that the company supplies with ingredients for drinks like Creamy Mango Boba, Mango Oats Jasmine Tea and Coconut Jelly Milk Tea.",
      "Apart from Mixue, other market stars include hotpot giant Haidilao, Fish With You sauerkraut fish restaurants, and well-known beverage brands such as Luckin Coffee, Heytea and Chagee.",

      "Momentum Works CEO Jianggan Li said Chinese businesses are actively seeking new growth in Southeast Asia after facing fierce competition in their home market.",
      "The push by food and drink retailers has raised awareness that China has more to offer than just cheap electronics.",
      "The companies are well-equipped, using automation to enhance their efficiency, and adept at online marketing, Li said. Big Western brands sometimes take a long time to find local partners and develop long-term plans. The Chinese F&B companies are \u201cmuch more impatient,\" he said.",
      "In Thailand\u2019s capital Bangkok, Chinese entrepreneur Siya Han has invested over $1.37 million in 12 Mixue stores and about 10 other outlets selling spicy broth bowls, sauerkraut fish and fried chicken steaks in about six years. Outlets in shopping malls take time to recover costs due to huge rent deposits, she said, but her other outlets typically break even within six months to a year, excluding their lease guarantees.",
      "\u201cIf you open Chinese restaurants slowly, you can't survive,\u201d she said.",
      "In the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, Chinese sauerkraut fish chain Fish With You vice president Liu Liujun also spotted opportunity in Southeast Asia\u2019s large ethnic Chinese population and growing economies.",
      "The brand\u2019s $235,000 investment in one of its Malaysian outlets paid off in just nine months, with lines out the door almost daily, said Liu, who oversees the company's overseas expansion across the region.",
      "A customer, Victoria Kovalan said the new Chinese brands made it easier for her to try new cuisines. \u201cIt\u2019s opened up our palates,\u201d she said, referring to the popularity of Sichuan hotpots, known for their spicy flavors.",
      "Vietnamese student Nguyen Thu Ho\u00e0i in Hanoi initially was skeptical about Mixue as a Chinese brand but has become a regular customer, she said, won over by its affordability and better-than-expected quality.",
      "The expansion of Chinese food and beverage brands is part of a broader trend where Chinese goods are no longer seen as merely cheap but as having real value, said Gordon Mathews, a professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.",
      "Recalling the cultural influence from McDonald\u2019s global expansion, Mathews said he visited its first outlet in southern China\u2019s economic hub of Guangzhou in the 1990s, where a clerk told him, \u201cI want to go to America.\u201d",
      "If Chinese food brands exploded worldwide, they might have that influence, though the impact remains to be seen, he said.",

      "\u201cWe reaffirm that our basic policies on Taiwan remain unchanged and emphasize the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to international security and prosperity,\u201d the statement said, referring to the crucial waterway separating China from the self-governing island republic it claims as its own territory.",
      "In the response issued through its embassy in Canada, where the two-day G7 meeting was held in La Malbaie, Quebec, China said the statement \u201crepeated the same old rhetoric, ignored facts and China\u2019s solemn position, grossly interfered in China\u2019s internal affairs, and blatantly smeared China.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe statements are filled with arrogance, prejudice and malicious intentions to suppress and attack China. China strongly deplores and opposes\u2002this and has lodged solemn representations with the Canadian side,\u201d the statement said.",
      "China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, through which passes around $5 trillion in global trade. It has dismissed and occasionally clashed with other countries that claim parts of the sea, especially the Philippines, a U.S. treaty partner.",
      "China is not a member of the G7 but closely follows all comments and references to its international status made by international organizations or in foreign countries, responding to criticism with caustic language.",
      "China has firmly rejected a U.N.-affiliated court's ruling that invalidated most of its claims to the South China Sea and says its claim to Taiwan is non-negotiable, even if China has to use force against the island.",
      "China routinely sends ships and warplanes into airspace and waters near Taiwan, built military bases on human-made islands in the South China Sea and recently staged surprise live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand for which it gave no advance notice.",
      "Australia's aviation authority said it learned of the drills just 30 minutes before they began, not from Beijing but from a pilot flying in the area, and 49 commercial flights were forced to alter their flight paths in response.",
      "The G7 did not mention the drills in its statement.",
      "\u201cWe share a growing concern at recent, unjustifiable efforts to restrict such freedom and to expand jurisdiction through use of force and other forms of coercion, including across the Taiwan Strait, and in the South China Sea, the Red Sea, and the Black Sea,\u201d the G7 said.",
      "China has the world's largest navy, including three aircraft carriers, with a fourth on the way. It has a base in Sheikhdom of Djibouti in the Horn of Africa and consistently has expanded the range of the force."

      "The crowds waved Syrian flags and chanted in celebration of the rebel victory that ended the Assad family's five-decade rule in rallies in the capital, Damascus, the country\u2019s largest city of Aleppo in the north, and Idlib, where the rebels launched their offensive in November.",
      "\u201c15/3/2025 same date but we are now victorious,\u201d read a poster carried by a man at Damascus\u2019 Umayyad Square, as helicopter gunships dropped flowers on the gathering.",

      "In November, insurgent groups led by the Islamist Islamic Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, began a ground offensive that within days captured the country\u2019s four largest cities starting with Aleppo in the north, then Hama and Homs in central Syria.

As the Kashmiri tailor stitches, the machine crackles for a moment before Ghulam Ahmad Sofi's otherworldly voice fills his shop with verses about divine love and the pain of separation from the beloved creator of the universe.",
      "Shaksaaz, a tailor in the Kashmiri city of Srinagar, inherited his passion for local Sufi music from his grandfather along with a meticulously preserved collection of audio cassette tapes from the 1970s, which he often listens to as he works.",
      "He's part of a small, dedicated community that believes cassette tapes are the best way to listen to and archive the Sufi music of Indian-controlled Kashmir, where music inspired by local and central Asian Muslim saints has long been a deep expression of spirituality and emotion. Many people turn to the music for spiritual guidance, or seeking an escape from the region\u2019s long periods of street battles, shutdowns and security clampdowns.",
      "For decades, cassette players have carried the soul-stirring poetry of Sufi saints and the mystical melodies of Kashmiri instruments like the sarangi and santoor, and it's long been a local ritual for families to gather around the warm hum of a tape player. Even today, the region\u2019s traditional Sufi music gatherings are often recorded only on the disappearing audio format, which was widely used from the 1970s to the 1990s.",
      "While the music is increasingly available on digital formats, many Kashmiris say that it's best heard on cassette tapes.",
      "\u201cThere is something unique about this machine that for me plays recordings of spiritual guides,\u201d said Abdul Ahad, a carpet weaver. \u201cIt is a sacred ritual in itself to press the play button of a cassette player to listen to a song on spiritual moorings.\u201d",
      "Many of the most beloved albums were released by local record labels during the heyday of the audio cassette, but dedicated devotees of the genre are still bringing tape recorders to gatherings. Digital recorders are often unwelcome at these nightly music sessions, as Sufi music lovers say they blur together the distinct sounds of the different instruments.",
      "\u201cIt is a different experience to listen to music on a tape recorder,\" said Abdul Hamid Khan. \"Tapes are smooth and you can feel the sound of every instrument, you don\u2019t get that feel in these new players.\u201d",

      "Many families have been forced to part with their players due to mechanical failures, while others struggle to preserve their cherished cassette collections, some of which hold rare and irreplaceable recordings passed down through generations. Some collectors have turned to digitizing their old recordings to safeguard them for future generations.",
      "Only a few shops in Srinagar, the region\u2019s main city, sell tape recorders or blank tapes, and the availability of spare parts and skilled repair technicians has drastically dwindled.",
      "A handful of mechanics in the Kashmir Valley still cater to a dedicated population of Sufi music lovers, painstakingly restoring machines made by beloved Japanese brands like Sharp and Kenwood in the last century.",
      "Mohammad Ashraf Matoo, a self-taught mechanic, has spent years keeping decades-old cassette players running even as spare parts become increasingly scarce. He purchases non-functional recorders to extract usable components, and manufactures some parts himself to keep his customers' devices going. Once repaired, a well-functioning tape recorder is sold for a price between $150 and $850, depending on its brand and condition.",
      "Shaksaaz, a lifelong Sufi music devotee, called it a \u201cpersonal mission\u201d to preserve the legacy of cassette tapes.",
      "\u201cIt is a bridge to the past, a way to remain connected to our spiritual and cultural roots in this ever modernizing and digital world,\u201d he said."

      "BANGKOK -- An elevated road being built in Thailand\u2019s capital Bangkok collapsed, killing at least five people, officials said.",
      "The collapse, which happened in the early morning in southwestern Bangkok, also injured 24 other people at the construction site, said Transport Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit.",
      "Suriya offered his condolences and said victims would be compensated by contractors and relevant agencies. He said four workers and an engineer were killed, and no road users were affected as traffic lanes near the construction were closed at the time.",
      "Bangkok police commander Siam Boonsom said authorities were still investigating to determine the cause of the collapse and that they would pursue legal actions against those found responsible.",
      "Photos from the site showed that large metal and concrete structures fell on the ground and completely blocked the road.",
      "The construction of the 5-kilometer (3-mile) elevated road started in 2022, according to project information published on the website of the Expressway Authority of Thailand.",
      "Surachet Laophulsuk, governor of the agency, said they were working to clear the debris as quickly as they could, but he said it might take a week. He added that the contractors working on the project were ordered suspended for 14 days pending the investigation.",
      "Road and construction safety is a major problem in Thailand. The site of Saturday\u2019s collapse is a part of a major road connecting Bangkok to Thailand\u2019s south, which has been a subject of controversy over its prolonged construction and frequent fatal accidents.",
      "Suriya said the transportation ministry is in the process of issuing new regulations that would suspend contractors found liable for construction accidents and blacklist them from bidding on future government projects."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's sweeping cuts in foreign aid have impacted programs in northern Ivory Coast to counter the spread of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group",
      "KIMBIRILA-NORD, Ivory Coast -- With its tomato patches and grazing cattle, the Ivory Coast village of Kimbirila-Nord hardly looks like a front line of the global fight against extremism. But after jihadis attacked a nearby community in Mali five years ago and set up a base in a forest straddling the border, the U.S. committed to spending $20 million to counter the spread of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group here and in dozens of other villages.",
      "The Trump administration's sweeping foreign aid cuts mean that support is now gone, even as violence in Mali and other countries in the Sahel region south of the Sahara has reached record levels and sent tens of thousands refugees streaming into northern Ivory Coast.",
      "Locals worry they have been abandoned. Diplomats and aid officials said the termination of aid jeopardizes counterterrorism efforts and weakens U.S. influence in a part of the world where some countries have turned to Russian mercenaries for help.",
      "In Kimbirila-Nord, U.S. funding, among other things, helped young people get job training, built parks for cattle to graze so they are no longer stolen by jihadis on Malian territory, and helped establish an information-sharing system so residents can flag violent encounters to each other and state services.",
      "\u201cWhat attracts young people to extremists is poverty and hunger,\u201d said Yacouba Doumbia, 78-year-old chief of Kimbirila-Nord. \u201cThere was a very dangerous moment in 2020. The project came at the right time, and allowed us to protect ourselves.\u201d",
      "Over the last decade, West Africa has been shaken by extremist uprisings and military coups. Groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have conquered large areas and killed thousands in the Sahel and have been spreading into wealthier West African coastal states, such as Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo.",
      "In 2019, President Donald Trump signed the Global Fragility Act that led to the initiatives in northern Ivory Coast. The U.S. goal in this area was to \u201cseize a narrowing prevention window,\u201d according to this year\u2019s congressional report about the implementation of the bipartisan legislation.",
      "Experts say local concerns help drive the popularity of extremist groups: competition for land and resources, exclusion, marginalization and lack of economic opportunities. Across the region, Islamic extremists have recruited among groups marginalized and neglected by central governments.",
      "\u201cIvory Coast is one of the few countries that still resist the terrorist threat in the Sahel,\u201d said a U.N. official working in the country who was not authorized to speak on the matter publicly. \u201cIf we do not continue to support border communities, a minor issue could send them into the arms of extremists.\u201d",
      "Trump issued an executive order in January directing a freeze on foreign assistance and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad. He charged that much of foreign aid was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.",
      "In 2020, when the jihadis struck a Malian village 10 kilometers (6 miles) away, Kimbirila-Nord in many ways fit the description of a community susceptible to extremism.",
      "The lives of Malians and Ivorians were intertwined. People crossed the border freely, making it easy for extremists, who like residents spoke Bambara, to access Kimbirila-Nord. Many residents did not have identity cards and few spoke French, leaving them with no access to states services or official information. Different ethnic groups lived next to each other but were divided by conflicts over scarce natural resources and suspicions toward the state. And young people did not have opportunities to make money.",
      "\u201cWe were very scared\u201d when the extremists attacked, said Aminata Doumbia, the head of the village's female farmers cooperative. \u201cEveryone was just looking out for themselves.\u201d",
      "The Ivorian government runs a program that provides professional training, grants and microloans. But access is difficult in villages such as Kimbirila-Nord.",
      "Kimbirila-Nord is home to refugees from Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea. Sifata Berte, 23, fled there with his family two years ago from Mali. He is not eligible for the government-run program, but got training through the project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and now works as an apprentice in an iron workshop.",
      "Other things the USAID-funded project set up included a network of community radios in local languages, so people could get access to information. It also used mobile government trucks to help tens of thousands of people across the region get their identity documents. And it brought people together with microcredit cooperatives and with a special committee of ranchers and farmers that helps resolve tensions over land.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s thanks to the project that we can sleep at night,\u201d Doumbia, the village chief, said. \u201cWe learned how to be together.\u201d",
      "Equal Access International, an international nonprofit, designed and implemented the U.S.-funded project.",
      "The USAID project also has been the only direct source of information on the ground in northern Ivory Coast on violent events for the U.S.-based Armed Conflict and Location & Event Data Project, the main provider of data on violence in the Sahel.",
      "Ivory Coast became known as a target for extremists in 2016, when an attack on the seaside resort of Grand Bassam killed tourists. In 2021, a string of attacks occurred near the country's northern border, but the violence has been largely contained after Ivorian authorities, Western governments and aid groups rushed into this impoverished and isolated part of the country with military build up and development projects.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. Africa Command provided over $65 million to projects in Ivory Coast, most of which \"focused on counterterrorism and border security\" in the northern part of the country, according to the group's website. The Pentagon said in a statement that it was \u201cnot aware of any budget cuts that have undermined counterterrorism training or partnership programs in Africa.\u201d",
      "Ivory Coast has the second-highest GDP per capita in West Africa, but according to the U.N. it remains one of the world\u2019s least developed countries. Many in remote villages like Kimbirila-Nord do not have access to running water.",
      "\u201cAt first we thought that we only had to solve these problems with a military solution,\u201d Famy Rene, the prefect of Korhogo, the region\u2019s capital, said. \u201cBut we saw that this was not enough. We had to put in place programs that strengthen the resilience of the population.\u201d",
      "Residents of Kimbirila-Nord had big plans before the U.S. froze aid. The U.S. was supposed to finance the first well in the village, help create a collective farm, and expand vocational training,",
      "Now they fear they have been left alone to deal with extremists.",
      "\u201cIf you forget, they will come back,\u201d said Doumbia, the village chief. \u201cAs long as there is war on the other side of the border, we must remain on a high alert.\u201d",

      "The Vatican announced Friday that it would provide medical updates less frequently, in what it called a positive development. It also has ceased issuing brief morning advisories that the pope had slept well and was starting his day.",
      "Doctors this week said the 88-year-old pope was no longer in critical, life-threatening condition, but have continued to emphasize that his condition remained complex due to his age, lack of mobility and the loss of part of a lung as a young man.",
      "Francis was admitted to the hospital on Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis that made it difficult for him to speak. Doctors soon added a diagnosis of double pneumonia and a polymicrobial (bacterial, viral and fungal) infection.",
      "The first three weeks of his hospitalization were marked by a rollercoaster of setbacks, including respiratory crises, mild kidney failure and a severe coughing fit.",
      "But medical updates this week have focused on his continued physical and respiratory therapy, as well as the rotation from high-flow oxygen through nostril tubes during the day and a non-invasive ventilation mask at night to help ensure his rest. An X-ray this week confirmed that the infection was clearing.",
      "With little more to report, doctors on Friday canceled a planned medical update. The next is to be issued later Saturday. Doctors have not indicated how much longer Francis will be hospitalized.",
      "The pope this week participated in Lenten spiritual exercises from the hospital, which Vatican officials have said implied a lighter workload. He received a cake and hundreds of messages wishing him well on the 12th anniversary of his papacy Thursday.",
      "The only public sign of life from the pope since his hospitalization was a recorded audio message thanking people for their prayers for his recovery in a weak and labored voice. It was played in St. Peter's Square for the faithful gathered for a nightly recitation of the rosary prayer.",
      "For the last four Sundays, the traditional blessing that the pope delivers from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square has been released as a text."

      "The Trump administration\u2019s references to the Afrikaner people \u2014 who are descendants of Dutch and other European settlers \u2014 have also elevated previous claims made by Trump's South African-born advisor Elon Musk and some conservative U.S. commentators that the South African government is allowing attacks on white farmers in what amounts to a genocide.",
      "That has been disputed by experts in South Africa, who say there is no evidence of whites being targeted, although farmers of all races are victims of violent home invasions in a country that suffers from a very high crime rate.",
      "The issue of land in South Africa is highly emotive given that more than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule, whites still own most of the good commercial farming land despite making up just 7% of the population. The South African government says the expropriation law aims to address those historic inequalities but is not \u201ca confiscation tool\u201d and will target unused land.",
      "Trump has offered Afrikaner farmers refugee status in the U.S. and a fast track to citizenship, but groups representing them say they want to stay in South Africa.",
      "Trump\u2019s sanctioning of South Africa also cited the country\u2019s case at the United Nations\u2019 top court accusing U.S. ally Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "During arguments in that ongoing and highly controversial case, Israel accused South Africa of acting as a proxy for Hamas. Trump has repeated that, questioning South Africa\u2019s motives and accusing it of an anti-American foreign policy that supports Hamas, Iran, China and Russia.",
      "South Africa\u2019s post-apartheid government has long been a supporter of the Palestinian cause, going back to the time of Nelson Mandela, its first Black president. It compares the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank to the experiences of Black South Africans who were confined to certain areas during apartheid.",
      "Rasool, the South African ambassador, comes from a Muslim community in South Africa that has been a center of support for Palestinians. The Breitbart writer whose story was cited by Rubio \u2014 senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak \u2014 was also born in South Africa and is Jewish. His story cast Rasool as a Hamas supporter.",
      "Pollak has other connections to the U.S.-South Africa situation after recently meeting with a lobby group representing Afrikaners. South African media have reported that Pollak is a contender to be Trump\u2019s pick for U.S. ambassador to South Africa.",
      "The U.S. criticism of South Africa has extended to its presidency this year of the Group of 20, a bloc of major economies that aims to bring the developed and developing world together. Rubio skipped a meeting of G20 foreign ministers in South Africa last month and said he would boycott the G20 summit in South Africa in November.",
      "He said he had a problem with South Africa's theme for its G20 presidency, which is \u201csolidarity, equality and sustainability.\u201d Rubio, in a post on X, dismissed that as \u201cDEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) and climate change\u201d and said he would not waste taxpayer money on it.",
      "The South African government has expressed surprise at Trump's sanctions and says it wants to fix its relationship with the U.S. \u201cSouth Africa remains committed to building a mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d said a statement from the office of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday in response to Rasool's expulsion.",
      "But U.S.-South Africa ties were strained even before Trump. The Biden administration accused South Africa of supporting Russia in the war in Ukraine while claiming a neutral stance. Like with the Palestinians, South Africa has historic ties to Russia, which supported the fight against apartheid.",
      "While Ramaphosa has repeatedly said he wants to engage in talks with the Trump administration, his African National Congress party has at times been defiant. The ANC recently invited the Iranian ambassador to its headquarters in Johannesburg and said it wouldn't hide its friends."

      "Since the mid-1980s, a number of organizations, primarily in northern Mexico, have launched informational campaigns and community-oriented interventions aimed at addressing drug use from a public health and social justice perspective, rather than a sec...",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Under warm strobe lights and pulsing house beats, a recent festival in Mexico City offered more than music, food and booze. Amidst the usual festival fare, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing.",
      "The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), is one of several recent efforts by Mexican civil society to reduce risk among people taking drugs. Spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization, it aims to address drug use from a public health and social justice perspective, rather than a security one.",
      "In a well-lit corner of the festival, members of the Instituto RIA used reagents and laboratory porcelain plates to test substances that some of the partygoers planned to use and recorded the data. Their analysis uses color changes to indicate what\u2019s in the drug: It can reveal the presence of adulterants but not their exact proportion.",
      "They also offered test strips that can detect the presence of fentanyl and nasal sprays of naloxone, a medication designed to rapidly reverse opioid overdose.",
      "Also available were informational flyers detailing the effects of various psychoactive substances and what to do to reduce the risks associated with using them, including simple but critical measures like staying hydrated and eating well.",
      "While some partygoers seemed wary of the initiative, others approached it with curiosity.",
      "\u201c(There is) amazement, but also a little bit of fear, because there is a whole context of criminalization,\u201d said social psychology student Jessica Reyes Moreno, 27, a volunteer with Checa tu Sustancia.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users receive detailed information on what they are, about their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "When people understand that the focus is not on prohibiting but on offering information and safe, non-judgmental spaces where they can be heard, trust is built, said Reyes Moreno.",
      "\"I think it\u2019s information we should have. Because (drug use) is taboo, and if we're uninformed, we can overdose,\u201d said a 34-year-old Mexican partygoer, who requested anonymity due to his use of illicit substances.",
      "He said he feels there isn't enough information about illegal drugs in Mexico, and when there is, it's either confusing or all stigma. \"It\u2019s just \u2018Don\u2019t do it,\u2019 but there\u2019s no such thing as \u2018If you do it, take this precaution.\u2019\u201d",
      "The \u201cdon\u2019t do it\u201d approach sees abstinence as the solution. In contrast, harm reduction, as defined by Harm Reduction International, aims to minimize the negative health, social and legal effects of substance use by working with people without judgment or requiring them to stop using drugs.",
      "The approach focuses more on people \u2014 and their communities\u2014 than on the substance.",
      "\u201cWe never say, \u2018you shouldn\u2019t consume this,\u2019\u201d said Zara Snapp, a political scientist and director of the Instituto RIA. \u201cThe best way to reduce your risks is not to consume at all. But if you have made the decision to consume, we want you to have as much information as possible so you can take care of yourself.\u201d",
      "The prohibitionist, hardline approach of the war on drugs in Mexico has led to the perception of the user as someone who is necessarily associated with drug trafficking or criminal activities.",
      "Earlier this year, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum unveiled her government\u2019s latest anti-drug campaign, \u201cStay away from drugs. Fentanyl kills,\u201d which centers on the synthetic opioid responsible in its deadliest year for more than 70,000 overdose deaths each year in the U.S. \u2014 now down to an estimated 52,000 deaths a year.",
      "Aimed at young Mexicans, the campaign frames drug use as a public health issue, but some of the videos and glowing neon billboards show scenarios in which death and loneliness (drug use) are contrasted with life and family (not using drugs). They read, \u201cChoose to be happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that if I use drugs I won\u2019t be happy, or if I stop using drugs I\u2019ll be happy,\u201d said Lilia Pacheco, operational director of PrevenCasa A.C., a Tijuana-based organization that runs harm-reduction initiatives for opioid users, mostly deportees from the United States who report that they started using in that country.",
      "\u201cHow can we say that to someone who is using because they are cold, hungry or in withdrawal?\u201d she said.",
      "Mexico's health department did not immediately respond to inquiries regarding concerns that its latest campaign stigmatizes drug use.",
      "Dr. Carlos Magis, a professor at Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University\u2019s medical school and member of a working group on opioids, said that stigma poses serious challenges. He cited examples of health workers refusing treatment without abstinence, limited access to naloxone or the scarcity of public methadone clinics.",
      "A recent report by the Mexican Observatory of Mental Health and Drug Use, found that between 2013 and 2024, 5,901 people in Mexico were treated for emergencies related to opioid use, with it trending up.",
      "PrevenCasa reduces harm not by asking users to stop using, but by showing that their lives matter by providing them with safe injection equipment, showers, toiletries and social events like Friday movie nights.",
      "\u201cThese interventions improve quality of life, unlike a sign that says \u2018fentanyl kills you,\u2019\" said Pacheco. \u201cThe right to health should be universal.\u201d",
      "Both Pacheco and Snapp emphasized that collective care is at the heart of harm reduction efforts. Whether practiced in the facilities of organizations working on the border or at electronic music festivals, the goal is to break down social isolation and fear in concrete ways.",
      "\u201cThis is a service that will save lives...it\u2019s very forward-thinking,\u201d said a 43-year-old man, who requested anonymity because he is a user of illicit substances, after members of Instituto RIA tested his ecstasy at a recent festival.",
      "He said that drug testing kits are available in the United States, where he\u2019s from, but that in his experience so far, it\u2019s something people mostly do on their own or behind closed doors.",
      "The visibility and organization of Checa tu Sustancia was a surprise to him.",
      "\u201cI feel good that I\u2019m not doing anything wrong. I\u2019m just here to have fun, but now with peace of mind,\u201d he said with a smile. He then rejoined his friends and disappeared into the dancing crowd.",

      "An opposition group in military-ruled Myanmar says an airstrike on a central village under the control of a pro-democracy resistance group has killed at least 27 civilians and injured 30 others",
      "BANGKOK -- An airstrike by Myanmar\u2019s military on a central village under the control of a pro-democracy resistance group has killed at least 27 civilians and injured 30 others, an opposition group and Myanmar\u2019s online media said Saturday.",
      "The attack occurred Friday at 3 p.m. in Let Pan Hla village in Singu township, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Mandalay, the country\u2019s second-largest city, a spokesperson for the Mandalay People\u2019s Defence Force said.",
      "The military did not comment on Saturday.",
      "Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, 2021, triggering widespread popular opposition. After peaceful demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms, and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict.",
      "The military government has stepped up airstrikes against the armed pro-democracy People's Defense Force and ethnic minority guerrilla groups that have been fighting for greater autonomy for decades. The two groups sometimes carry out joint operations against the army. The resistance forces have no defense against air attacks.",
      "The town of Singu was seized by the Mandalay People\u2019s Defence Force (MDY-PDF), which supports Myanmar\u2019s main opposition, in July last year.",
      "The group's statement released Saturday on its Telegram social media channel said six children were among the 27 killed in the airstrike that targeted crowded market stalls in Let Pan Hla village.",
      "Osmond, the group's spokesperson, told The Associated Press that about 10 houses near the village market were destroyed by bombs.",
      "\u201cThis airstrike was not aimed at a military target, but rather at the market area, where civilians visit daily,\u201d Osmond said in a message.",
      "The situation in the village could not be independently confirmed, with access to the internet and cellphone service in the area mostly cut off.",
      "The independent Myanmar Now online media reported that the death toll from the airstrike that hit a tea shop near the village market had reached 30 and seven were in critical condition.",
      "A report issued last month by Nyan Lynn Thit Analytica, a Myanmar research and advocacy organization, said that since the military\u2019s 2021 takeover, 2,224 civilian had been killed and 3,466 wounded in 4,157 airstrikes."

      "Romania\u2019s electoral body has rejected the candidacy of controversial far-right politician Diana Sosoaca in the presidential election rerun in May, but approved George Simion, the leader of the country\u2019s most popular far-right party",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania\u2019s electoral body Saturday rejected the candidacy of a controversial far-right politician in the presidential election rerun in May, but approved George Simion, the leader of the country\u2019s most popular far-right party.",
      "The Central Election Bureau, or BEC, rejected Diana Sosoaca's bid, which was filed on Thursday in the capital, Bucharest. She said she will appeal the bureau\u2019s decision, which has to be submitted to the Constitutional Court within 24 hours.",
      "The bureau said in its decision that it barred the pro-Russia Sosoaca, a former lawyer and leader of the far-right nationalist S.O.S. Romania party, from entering the race on the same grounds that she was excluded from last year's annulled election. The CCR argued that her public discourse, including opposition to Romania\u2019s European Union and NATO memberships, made her unfit to uphold the constitutional obligations of the presidency.",
      "In a public letter posted online and addressed to U.S. President Donald Trump after the bureau's decision, Sosoaca, 49, claimed that \u201cthe democratic system has been destroyed and that the elections have already been rigged.\u201d",
      "The court\u2019s decision to bar her from last year's race drew strong criticism from some civil rights groups and politicians, who denounced it as undermining democracy or politically motivated.",
      "However, on Saturday, the election bureau validated the candidacy of Simion, who leads the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, which is Romania's second biggest party in the legislature.",
      "Simion, 38, who is under criminal investigation for inciting violence after last year\u2019s first-round winner Calin Georgescu was barred this week from entering the May rerun, has expressed concerns that he could also be excluded from the upcoming race.",
      "\u201cNow let\u2019s see if we can pass the CCR and return to democracy,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. Simion \u2014 who came fourth in the first round of last year\u2019s race with 13.8% of the vote \u2014 has denied any wrongdoing and claimed the investigation is politically motivated.",
      "\u201cI risk being subjected to the same abusive treatment \u2026 If they eliminated two, they think they can eliminate a third,\u201d he told a news conference Friday after filing his candidacy.",
      "Simion has stirred controversy on occasion. He campaigned for reunification with neighboring Moldova, which has barred him from entering the country. He is also banned from neighboring Ukraine, where authorities cited security concerns.",
      "The Constitutional Court annulled last year\u2019s election two days before the Dec. 8 runoff, after allegations emerged that Russia had run a coordinated online campaign to promote far-right Georgescu, who ran as an independent. Moscow has denied meddling in the election.",
      "The court\u2019s unprecedented decision last year plunged the European Union and NATO member country into a protracted political crisis and has drawn criticism from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and Moscow.",
      "Like other countries in Europe, the far-right vote has gained momentum in Romania in recent years.",
      "In 2020, Simion\u2019s AUR party \u2014 which proclaims to stand for \u201cfamily, nation, faith, and freedom\u201d \u2014 doubled its support in a parliamentary election on Dec. 1 with 18.2%, up from 9% four years earlier.",
      "On Saturday, thousands of demonstrators gathered in central Bucharest waved European Union and Romanian flags at a pro-EU rally to counter what the organizers described as a \u201cwave of sovereignism and ultranationalism\u201d that \u201cthreatens our unity.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are here to encourage each other because it is a very troubled period in Europe, the extremes are on the rise, especially the far right,\" Mihai Calin, an actor at the National Theatre Bucharest, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe impairment of Europe is underway. ... People are in danger of discouragement, disappointment. So we need to gather together to reunite.\u201d",
      "The BEC also approved the candidacy of pro-Western Elena Lasconi, leader of the Save Romania Union party, who was set to face Georgescu in the scheduled runoff last year.",
      "The first round of the presidential rerun is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the ballots, a runoff will he held May 18. The deadline for presidential candidacy bids closes at midnight on Saturday.",

      "Five months after the assault, she lay on a mat in a displacement camp in South Sudan's capital, rubbing her swollen belly. \u201cI felt like I wasn't heard ... and now I'm pregnant,\u201d she said. The Associated Press does not identify people who have been raped.",
      "Sexual assault is a constant risk for many women in South Sudan. Now one aid group is trying to bridge the gap with technology, to find and help survivors more quickly. But it's not easy in a country with low connectivity, high illiteracy and wariness about how information is used.",
      "Five months ago, an Israel-based organization in South Sudan piloted a chatbot it created on WhatsApp. It prompts questions for its staff to ask survivors of sexual assault to anonymously share their experiences. The information is put into the phone while speaking to the person and the bot immediately notifies a social worker there's a case, providing help to the person within hours.",
      "IsraAID said the technology improves communication. Papers can get misplaced and information can go missing, said Rodah Nyaduel, a psychologist with the group. When colleagues document an incident, she's notified by phone and told what type of case it is.",
      "Tech experts said technology can reduce human error and manual file keeping, but organizations need to ensure data privacy.",
      "\u201cHow do they intend to utilize that information, does it get circulated to law enforcement, does that information cross borders. Groups need to do certain things to guarantee how to safeguard that information and demonstrate that,\u201d said Gerardo Rodriguez Phillip, an AI and technology innovation consultant in Britain.",
      "IsraAID said its data is encrypted and anonymized. It automatically deletes from staffers' phones. In the chatbot's first three months in late 2024, it was used to report 135 cases.",
      "When the 28-year-old was raped, she knew she had just a few days to take medicine to help prevent disease and pregnancy, she said.",
      "One aid group she approached scribbled her information on a piece of paper and told her to return later to speak with a social worker. When she did, they said they were busy. After 72 hours, she assumed it was pointless. Weeks later, she found she was pregnant.",
      "IsraAID found her while doing door-to-door visits in her area. At first, she was afraid to let them put her information into their phone, worried it would be broadcast on social media. But she felt more comfortable knowing the phones were not personal devices, thinking she could hold the organization accountable if there were problems.",
      "She's one of tens of thousands of people still living in displacement sites in the capital, Juba, despite a peace deal ending civil war in 2018. Some are afraid to leave or have no homes to return to.",
      "The fear of rape remains for women who leave the camps for firewood or other needs. Some told the AP about being sexually assaulted. They said there are few services in the camp because of reduced assistance by international aid groups and scant government investment in health. Many can't afford taxis to a hospital in town.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order to freeze USAID funding during a 90-day review period is exacerbating the challenges. Aid groups have closed some services including psychological support for women, affecting tens of thousands of people.",
      "Technology isn't widely used by aid groups focused on gender-based violence in South Sudan. Some organizations say that, based on survivors' feedback, the ideal app would allow people to get help remotely.",
      "Stigma surrounding sexual assault further complicates efforts to get help in South Sudan. It\u2019s especially hard for young girls who need to get permission to leave their homes, said Mercy Lwambi, gender-based violence lead at the International Rescue Committee.",
      "\"They want to talk to someone faster than a physical meeting,\u201d she said.",
      "But South Sudan has one of the lowest rates of mobile access and connectivity in the world, with less than 25% of market penetration, according to a report by GSMA, a global network of mobile operators. People with phones don't always have internet access, and many are illiterate.",
      "\"You have to be thinking, will this work in a low-tech environment? What are the literacy rates? Do they have access to devices? If so, what kind? Will they find it engaging, will they trust it, is it safe?\u201d said Kirsten Pontalti, a senior associate at Proteknon Foundation for Innovation and Learning, an international organization focused on advancing child protection.",
      "Pontalti has piloted two chatbots, one to help youth and parents better access information about sexual reproductive health and the other for frontline workers focused on child protection during COVID.",

      "Some survivors of sexual assault say they just want to be heard, whether by phone or in person.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis continues his recovery from double pneumonia at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital with the Vatican expected to issue the traditional Sunday Angelus prayer as a written text for the fifth straight week.",
      "The pope typically delivers the Angelus from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square to the gathered faithful, who have grown more numerous due to the Jubilee year that Francis inaugurated in December.",
      "Along with a stop at St. Peter\u2019s to seek indulgences by walking through the basilica\u2019s Holy Door, pilgrims are now also adding a stop at Gemelli, a 15-minute train ride from the Vatican.",
      "Doctors this week said the 88-year-old pontiff was no longer in critical, life-threatening condition, but have continued to emphasize that his condition remained complex due to his age, lack of mobility and the loss of part of a lung as a young man.",
      "Still, they are issuing fewer medical bulletins as the pontiff has been on an upward trajectory. An X-ray this week confirmed that the infection was clearing.",
      "Francis has not been seen publicly since he was admitted to the hospital Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis that made it difficult for him to speak. Doctors soon added a diagnosis of double pneumonia and a polymicrobial (bacterial, viral and fungal) infection.",
      "The first three weeks of his hospitalization were marked by a rollercoaster of setbacks, including respiratory crises, mild kidney failure and a severe coughing fit.",
      "Doctors in the most recent medical update on Saturday said they were working to reduce the pope\u2019s nighttime reliance on the non-invasive ventilation mask, which will allow his lungs to work more.",
      "Doctors underlined that while the pope\u2019s condition is stable, he still requires hospitalization for both physical and respiratory therapy, which are \"showing further gradual improvements,\u201d the Vatican said Saturday in the first medical update in three days.",
      "The next update won\u2019t be issued until the middle of next week, the Vatican said."

      "Iran has once again denied aiding Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels after the United States launched a wave of airstrikes against them",
      "CAIRO -- Iran on Sunday once again denied aiding Yemen's Houthi rebels after the United States launched a wave of airstrikes against them and President Donald Trump warned that Tehran would be held \u201cfully accountable\u201d for their actions.",
      "The Houthi-run Health Ministry said the strikes killed at least 31 people, including women and children, and wounded over 100. The rebels said one strike hit two homes in northern Saada province, killing four children and a woman. The rebel-run Al-Masirah TV showed images of what it said were the bodies.",
      "The Houthis have repeatedly targeted international shipping in the Red Sea and launched missiles and drones at Israel in what the rebels said were acts of solidarity with the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, where Israel has been at war with Hamas, another Iranian ally.",
      "The attacks stopped when a fragile Israel-Hamas ceasefire took hold in Gaza in January, but the Houthis had threatened to renew them after Israel cut off the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza this month.",
      "The U.S. and others have long accused Iran of providing military aid to the Houthis and the U.S. Navy has seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weaponry it said were bound for the militant group, which controls Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and the country's north.",
      "Gen. Hossein Salami, head of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, denied his country was involved in the Houthis' attacks, saying it \u201cplays no role in setting the national or operational policies\u201d of the militant groups it is allied with across the region, according to state-run TV.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in a post on X, urged the U.S. to halt the strikes and said Washington cannot dictate Iran's foreign policy.",
      "Trump on Saturday had vowed to use \u201coverwhelming lethal force\u201d until the Houthis cease their attacks on shipping along the vital maritime corridor.",
      "The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel\u2019s latest blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.",
      "The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023 and January of this year, when the ceasefire in Gaza took effect.",
      "The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but Saturday\u2019s operation was conducted solely by the U.S. It was the first strike on the Houthis under the second Trump administration.",

    "summary": "The spill happened on Feb. 18.",
    "story": [
      "The spill happened on Feb. 18.",
      "KITWE, Zambia -- Authorities and environmentalists in Zambia fear the long-term impact of an acid spill at a Chinese-owned mine that contaminated a major river and could potentially affect millions of people after signs of pollution were detected at least 100 kilometers (60 miles) downstream.",
      "The spill happened on Feb. 18 when a tailings dam that holds acidic waste from a copper mine in the north of the country collapsed, according to investigators from the Engineering Institution of Zambia.",
      "The collapse allowed some 50 million liters of waste containing concentrated acid, dissolved solids and heavy metals to flow into a stream that links to the Kafue River, Zambia\u2019s most important waterway, the engineering institution said.",
      "\u201cIt is an environmental disaster really of catastrophic consequences,\u201d said Chilekwa Mumba, an environmental activist who works in Zambia's Copperbelt Province.",
      "China is the dominant player in copper mining in Zambia, a southern African nation which is among the world\u2019s top 10 producers of copper, a key component in smartphones and other technology.",
      "Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema called for help from experts and said the leak is a crisis that threatens people and wildlife along the Kafue, which runs for more than 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) through the heart of Zambia.",
      "Authorities are still investigating the extent of the environmental damage.",
      "An Associated Press reporter visited parts of the Kafue River, where dead fish could be seen washing up on the banks about 100 kilometers (60 miles) downstream from the mine run by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, which is majority owned by the state-run China Nonferrous Metals Industry Group.",
      "The Ministry of Water Development and Sanitation said the \"devastating consequences\" also included the destruction of crops along the river's banks. Authorities are concerned that ground water will be contaminated as the mining waste seeps into the earth or is carried to other areas.",
      "\u201cPrior to the 18th of February this was a vibrant and alive river,\u201d said Sean Cornelius, who lives near the Kafue and said fish died and birdlife near him disappeared almost immediately. \u201cNow everything is dead, it's like a totally dead river. Unbelievable. Overnight, this river died.\u201d",
      "About 60% of Zambia's 20 million people live in the Kafue River basin and depend on it in some way as a source of fishing, irrigation for agriculture and water for industry. The river supplies drinking water to about five million people, including in the capital, Lusaka.",
      "The acid leak at the mine caused a complete shutdown of the water supply to the nearby city of Kitwe, home to an estimated 700,000 people.",
      "The Zambian government has deployed the air force to drop hundreds of tons of lime into the river in an attempt to counteract the acid and roll back the damage. Speed boats have also been used to ride up and down the river, applying lime.",
      "Government spokesperson Cornelius Mweetwa said the situation was very serious and Sino-Metals Leach Zambia would bear the costs of the cleanup operation.",
      "Zhang Peiwen, the chairman of Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, met with government ministers this week and apologized for the acid spill, according to a transcript of his speech at the meeting released by his company.",
      "\u201cThis disaster has rung a big alarm for Sino-Metals Leach and the mining industry,\u201d he said. He said it \u201cwill go all out to restore the affected environment as quickly as possible.\"",
      "The environmental impact of China's large mining interests in mineral-rich parts of Africa, which include Zambia's neighbors Congo and Zimbabwe, has often been criticized, even as the minerals are crucial to the countries' economies.",
      "Chinese-owned copper mines have been accused of ignoring safety, labor and other regulations in Zambia as they strive to control its supply of the critical mineral, leading to some discontent with their presence. Zambia is also burdened with more than $4 billion in debt to China and had to restructure some of its loans from China and other nations after defaulting on repayments in 2020.",
      "A smaller acid waste leak from another Chinese-owned mine in Zambia's copper belt was discovered days after the Sino-Metals accident, and authorities have accused the smaller mine of attempting to hide it.",
      "Local police said a mine worker died at that second mine after falling into acid and alleged that the mine continued to operate after being instructed to stop its operations by authorities. Two Chinese mine managers have been arrested, police said.",
      "Both mines have now halted their operations after orders from Zambian authorities, while many Zambians are angry.",
      "\u201cIt really just brings out the negligence that some investors actually have when it comes to environmental protection,\u201d said Mweene Himwinga, an environmental engineer who attended the meeting involving Zhang, government ministers, and others. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to have any concern at all, any regard at all. And I think it\u2019s really worrying because at the end of the day, we as Zambian people, (it's) the only land we have.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has signed into law legislation funding the government through the end of September, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown and capping off a struggle in Congress that deeply divided Democrats.",
      "Harrison Fields, White House principal deputy press secretary, said in a post on X that Trump signed the continuing resolution Saturday.",
      "The bill largely keeps government funding at levels set during Joe Biden's presidency, though with changes. It trims non-defense spending by about $13 billion from the previous year and increases defense spending by about $6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly $1.7 trillion.",
      "The Senate cleared the legislation on Friday in a 54-46 party line vote, with 10 members of the Senate Democratic caucus helping the bill advance to passage despite opposition from within their party \u2014 most vocally from colleagues in the House, who exhorted them to reject the bill out of hand.",
      "Senate Democrats argued for days over whether to force a shutdown, livid that Republicans in the House had drafted and passed the spending measure without their input. Democrats said the legislation shortchanges health care, housing and other priorities and gives Trump wide leeway to redirect federal spending even as his administration and the Department of Government Efficiency rapidly dismantle congressionally approved agencies and programs.",
      "In the end, enough of the Democratic senators decided a government shutdown would be even worse than letting the funding bill pass.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a shutdown would have given the Trump administration the ability to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel non-essential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired.",
      "\u201cA shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cDonald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.\u201d",
      "Passage of the funding bill through the House earlier in the week was a victory for Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who managed to hold Republicans together and muscle the bill to passage without support from Democrats \u2014 something they've rarely been able to achieve in the past."

      "U.S. President Donald Trump threw a curve ball at China by linking the fentanyl issue to his tariffs on imports",
      "BEIJING -- U.S. President Donald Trump threw a curve ball at China by linking the fentanyl issue to his tariffs on imports. The Chinese government is swinging back.",
      "First it issued a report detailing its efforts to control the illegal trade in fentanyl, specifically the ingredients for the opioid that are made in China. Then, the Chinese foreign minister blasted the U.S. for responding to Beijing's goodwill with tariffs. And this week, Chinese officials expressed their indignation at a rare background briefing with journalists.",
      "\u201cIn the spirit of humanity, China assisted the U.S. in various ways,\u201d Foreign Minister Wang Yi told journalists last week in an annual appearance before the media. \"The U.S. should not meet good with evil or even impose arbitrary tariffs. No responsible major country should do that.\u201d",
      "Trump cited the fentanyl issue as the reason for imposing a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports in early February, on top of any existing duties. He doubled that to 20% earlier this month. He also has cited fentanyl, along with other reasons, for imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico.",
      "In his executive order on the first 10% tariff, Trump accused China of subsidizing chemical companies to export fentanyl and related \u201cprecursor chemicals\u201d and of providing a safe haven for Chinese criminal organizations that launder the revenues from the opioid trade.",
      "It's not unusual for the Chinese government to subsidize industries, and the precursor chemicals are also used to make legal painkillers. But some of the production finds it way to Mexican drug cartels who make fentanyl and send it to the United States.",
      "\u201cDespite multiple attempts to resolve this crisis at its root source through bilateral dialogue, PRC officials have failed to follow through with the decisive actions needed to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels,\u201d the statement said, referring to China by the acronym for the People\u2019s Republic of China, its official name.",
      "The Chinese government hit back both times Trump imposed tariffs with its own duties on selected U.S. products and other measures aimed at American companies. Analysts have described the response as a measured one designed to try to avoid an escalation of the trade war, which could deal a blow to an already sluggish Chinese economy.",
      "The government's report on its fentanyl-related actions said that China and the U.S. have held multiple high-level meetings since early last year to promote cooperation, and that its Narcotics Control Bureau holds regular exchanges with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.",
      "China is committed to cooperation, the report said, \u201cbut firmly opposes the U.S. imposition of unlawful sanctions and unreasonable pressure on China on the pretext of responding to fentanyl-related issues.\"",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, cooperation on fentanyl was relaunched in early 2024 after falling victim to geopolitics in 2022. In August of that year, a visit to Taiwan by a top U.S. legislator, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, angered China, and the government responded by cutting off talks on a range of issues including drug control.",
      "A rapprochement in late 2023, negotiated over several months, led to a meeting on fentanyl in January of last year.

      "Now, safety experts and family members who lost loved ones in the Jan. 29 crash are asking why no one acted in the face of what appeared to be a looming disaster.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said airplane pilots were alerted to take evasive action to avoid hitting helicopters at least once a month from 2011 through 2024, citing data compiled by the Federal Aviation Administration, and that there were 85 near misses when aircraft were within a few hundred feet (meters) of each other during recent years.",
      "\u201cHow does that happen in this day and age and somebody doesn\u2019t do something about it?\u201d asked Doug Lane, whose wife, Christine Conrad Lane, and their 16-year-old son, Spencer, died in the crash.",
      "Pilots have long worried about the congested and complex airspace around the airport near the heart of the capital, where flights must maneuver around military aircraft and restricted areas. It was no secret there had been previous close calls, but the numbers found by the NTSB were alarming.",
      "\u201cWhy someone was not paying attention to those numbers and those events are questions yet to be answered,\u201d said James Hall, a former NTSB chair during the Clinton administration.",
      "\u201cWhat not to do is to ignore that many incidents,\u201d he said.",
      "FAA officials have not yet addressed whether they knew there were so many encounters between planes and helicopters at Reagan National. Messages seeking comment were not immediately returned Thursday.",
      "Current NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who oversees the FAA, both said they were angry that the number of close calls were not recognized earlier by the FAA.",
      "\u201cIf someone was paying attention, someone was on the job, they would have seen this,\u201d Duffy said. He also announced he will move forward with banning some helicopter flights around the airport, a move that was temporarily made after the crash.",
      "Safety advocate Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the U.S. Transportation Department, said that while there was plenty of blame to go around for the midair collision, the FAA was shockingly complacent.",
      "\u201cThey literally wait for a disaster,\u201d she said. \u201dI can\u2019t even fathom how the families of those lost in this crash can even deal with this. I mean this would be so maddening to hear.\u201d",
      "The crowded airspace around Washington drew attention last year when Congress debated an aviation safety bill that allowed 10 more flights a day at Reagan National, despite strong objections from Virginia\u2019s Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner.",
      "Kaine, during a speech on the Senate floor, didn't mention specific concerns about encounters between airliners and helicopters or cite any statistics, but he did say the congestion was \u201ca problem waiting to happen.\u201d",
      "While Congress did OK the extra flights, they had not started as of the deadly January collision.",
      "The FAA limits arrival and departure slots at three of the nation\u2019s busiest airports, where demand exceeds the airport\u2019s capacity: Reagan National and New York City's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International airports.",
      "But Congress has a history of directing the FAA to add slots at Reagan, even though Washington\u2019s other international airport, Dulles, has capacity to handle them. Reagan is closer to the capital and most federal departments and therefore more convenient, particularly for lawmakers.",
      "Mike McCormick, coordinator of the Air Traffic Management program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said the congestion at Reagan National clearly contributed to the midair collision because the American Airlines jetliner, which was on a newly added route from Wichita, Kansas, was diverted to a different runway closer to the helicopter flights.",
      "\u201cIn this instance, the sole reason for doing it was because they were too busy,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cThis is something that controller has probably done thousands of times.\u201d",
      "The flight from Wichita to Washington began operating in early 2024, with the backing of Kansas lawmakers who said it was a \u201cvital\u201d to link the nation\u2019s capital with the city, which has a long history as an aircraft manufacturing hub.",

      "A groundbreaking climate lawsuit heads to trial in Germany next week, as Peruvian farmer Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya challenges German energy giant RWE",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- As a crucial climate lawsuit heads to trial in Germany next week, experts say the case brought by Peruvian farmer Saul Luciano Lliuya against German energy giant RWE could set a significant precedent in the fight to hold major polluters accountable for climate change.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the first cases of its kind \u2014 a case brought by someone directly affected by climate change against a major greenhouse gas emitter \u2014 that has made it all the way to trial,\u201d said Noah Walker-Crawford, a research fellow at the London School of Economics and an adviser to the non-profit Germanwatch, which has been advising Lliuya.",
      "Lliuya\u2019s lawsuit against RWE argues that the company\u2019s historical greenhouse gas emissions have fueled global warming, accelerating glacial melt above his hometown of Huaraz, Peru. As a result, Lake Palcacocha has swelled to dangerous levels, threatening the community with the risk of catastrophic flooding.",
      "RWE, which has never operated in Peru, denies legal responsibility, arguing that climate change is a global issue caused by many contributors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and painful to see the glaciers melting,\u201d Lliuya, 45, told Associated Press in a video call from Germany. \u201cThere is a lot of concern from people in my community about the future, about the issue of water, because all the rivers that come down from the mountains are used for farming.\u201d",
      "Walker-Crawford said of all these cases around the world, this is the one that\u2019s gone the furthest.",
      "\u201cIt has already set a partial precedent in that the courts found it admissible in 2017, which means that the judges said the case is solid in legal terms,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, the court is hearing evidence, and we\u2019ll see whether the company\u2019s responsibility can be proven in this specific case.\u201d",
      "Sebastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, says the reason why the case is so significant is not the decision itself or the amount of damages sought, but the precedent it would set.",
      "\u201cIf we could use tort law to say that any fossil fuel corporation that has contributed significantly to climate change can be held liable for climate-related costs in proportion to their emissions, it could open the door for many similar cases worldwide,\u201d he said.",
      "The case could be \u201ca game changer\u201d, according to Murray Worthy, from Zero Carbon Analytics, a research group on climate change.",
      "\u201cThis case is absolutely crucial,\" Worthy said. \u201cWhile this is just one case focused on this one place in Peru, the wider implications are huge. The costs and damages from climate change could run to tens of trillions of dollars a year, and if fossil fuel companies at large are found to be responsible for those and need to pay those costs, it would completely change the finances and outlook for the entire fossil fuel industry.\u201d",
      "RWE is one of Germany\u2019s largest energy companies, historically recognized as a major producer of electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "RWE says the lawsuit is legally inadmissible and that it sets a dangerous precedent by holding individual emitters accountable for global climate change.",
      "\u201cIn our view, there is no legal basis for holding individual issuers liable for global phenomena such as climate change. Due to the large number of global emissions of greenhouse gases from both natural and human sources, as well as the complexity of the climate, it is not possible, in our opinion, to legally attribute specific effects of climate change to a single issuer,\u201d the company said in response to questions posed by AP.",
      "The company insists climate solutions should be addressed through state and international policies, not the courts.",
      "Walker-Crawford said the court is entering the evidence-gathering phase, examining whether Lliuya's home actually faces a significant risk of flooding.",
      "\u201cIf the court decides that the risk is high enough, it will then assess whether RWE\u2019s emissions can be scientifically linked to that risk,\u201d he said.",
      "Regardless of the case\u2019s final outcome, Walker-Crawford said it\u2019s likely to reinforce the legal foundation for future lawsuits.",
      "\u201cEven if the specific risk in this case isn\u2019t deemed high enough, the precedent that companies can be held liable for their climate impacts would still stand,\u201d he said.",
      "The case\u2019s outcome could also have financial repercussions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already starting to see the impact of climate litigation on financial markets,\u201d Walker-Crawford said. \u201cResearch has shown that when climate cases against corporations move past major hurdles, it negatively affects the stock market value of the companies being sued. Investors are starting to take note of the significant financial liability climate litigation can pose.\u201d",
      "Lliuya, who also works as a mountain guide for tourists, said he started the lawsuit with little hope. Ten years on, that hope has grown.",
      "\u201cWhen the German judges visited my home and the lake in 2022, it gave me hope \u2014 hope that our voices were being heard and that justice might be possible,\" he said. \u201cWhatever the outcome, we have come a long way and I feel good about that,\u201d he said.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Donatella Versace has been replaced as creative director of the fashion house founded by her late brother Gianni Versace, assuming the new role of chief brand ambassador, Versace\u2019s U.S. owner Capri Holdings announced on Thursday.",
      "Versace will be replaced by Dario Vitale, who most recently was design director at the Miu Miu brand owned by the Prada Group. His appointment is effective on April 1.",
      "The creative shift comes amid speculation that the Prada Group is in talks to buy Versace from Capri Holdings, which paid 2 billion euros (currently $2.2 billion) for the fashion house in 2018. The U.S. group also owns Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.",
      "Miuccia Prada acknowledged interest in the brand on the sidelines of Milan Fashion Week last month, while Versace made no comment at what was to be her last runway show. Versace, 69, took over as creative director in 1997, after her brother\u2019s murder in Miami.",
      "Capri Holding\u2019s statement made no mention of any plans to sell Versace, but the arrival of a designer from Miu Miu is only likely to fuel speculation of a possible deal.",
      "Versace CEO John D. Idol said in a statement that the creative shift was \u201cpart of a thoughtful succession plan for Versace.\u201d He called Vitale \u201ca strong leader,\u2019\u2019 and expressed confidence that \u201chis talent and vision will be instrumental to Versace\u2019s future growth.\u201d",
      "As chief brand ambassador, Versace \u201cwill continue to champion the Versace brand and its values,\u2019\u2019 Idol said.",
      "Versace said she was \u201cthrilled\u201d as a champion of the next generation of designers that Vitale would join Versace and that she was \u201cexcited'' to see the brand her brother founded in 1978 \"through new eyes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to carry on my brother Gianni\u2019s legacy. He was the true genius, but I hope to have some of his spirit and tenacity,\u2019\u2019 she said in a statement. \u201cIn my new role as chief brand ambassador, I will remain Versace\u2019s most passionate supporter. Versace is in my DNA and always in my heart.\u2019\u2019",
      "Versace represented 20% of Capri Holdings 2024 revenue of 5.2 billion euros. Capri recently laid out strategic plans to rebalance the Versace portfolio to return the brand to its more daring roots, increase sales of accessories and win back entry-level consumers put off by a post-pandemic focus on higher net-worth clients."

      "Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection",
      "NEW YORK -- Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection.",
      "The budget airline \u2014 known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes \u2014 said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,\u201d CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.",
      "The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.",
      "Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "Whether Spirit will continue as a standalone airline has also been up in the air, although takeover attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier have proven to be unsuccessful before and during the bankruptcy process. Spirit rejected a third bid from Frontier last month.",
      "While future merger proposals may not be entirely off the table, Spirit signaled Wednesday that it would continue to focus its own growth and offerings. Christie noted that the airline would be \"moving forward with our strategy to redefine low-fare travel with our new, high-value travel options.\u201d",
      "In an evolution from its budget-exclusive roots, Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.",
      "In a message sent to Spirit customers Wednesday, Christie continued to point those four travel options from the airline, which he said \u201clet you choose how you want to fly.\"",
      "Wednesday's announcement also noted plans to trade shares publicly again, although not immediately. Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy \u2014 but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, \u201cas soon as reasonably practicable.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile \u2014 between wider economic turmoil, high-profile plane crashes and other consumer uncertainty \u2014 major airlines have issued warnings in recent days about falling demand. Carriers like Delta, Southwest, American have all recently downgraded revenue outlooks for the first quarter.",

      "Florida\u2019s citrus growers are struggling to survive the one-two punch of hurricanes and disease",
      "LAKE WALES, Fla. -- As Trevor Murphy pulls up to his dad's 20-acre (8-hectare) grove in one of the fastest-growing counties in the United States, he points to the cookie-cutter, one-story homes encroaching on the orange trees from all sides.",
      "\u201cAt some point, this isn't going to be an orange grove anymore,\" Murphy, a third-generation grower, says as he gazes at the rows of trees in Lake Wales, Florida. \"You look around here, and it's all houses, and that's going to happen here.\u201d",
      "Polk County, which includes Lake Wales, contains more acres of citrus than any other county in Florida. And in 2023, more people moved to Polk County than any other county in the country.",
      "Hit in recent years by hurricanes and citrus greening disease, which slowly kills the trees, many growers are making the difficult decision to sell orange groves that have been in their families for generations to developers building homes to house the growing population.",
      "Others, like Murphy, are sticking it out, hoping to survive until a bug-free tree or other options arrive to repel the disease or treat the trees.",
      "When Hurricane Irma blasted through the state's orange belt in 2017, Florida's signature crop already had been on a downward spiral for two decades because of the greening disease. Next came a major freeze and two more hurricanes in 2022, followed by two hurricanes last year. A tree that loses branches and foliage in a hurricane can take three years to recover, Murphy said.",
      "Those catastrophes contributed to a 90% decline in orange production over the past two decades. Citrus groves in Florida, which covered more than 832,00 acres (336,698 hectares) at the turn of the century, populated scarcely 275,000 acres (111,288 hectares) last year, and California has eclipsed Florida as the nation's leading citrus producer.",
      "\u201cLosing the citrus industry is not an option. This industry is ... so ingrained in Florida. Citrus is synonymous with Florida,\u201d Matt Joyner, CEO of trade association Florida Citrus Mutual told Florida lawmakers recently.",
      "Nevertheless, Alico Inc., one of Florida\u2019s biggest growers, announced this year that it plans to wind down its citrus operations on more than 53,000 acres (21,000 hectares), saying its production has declined by almost three-quarters in a decade.",
      "That decision hurts processors, including Tropicana, which rely on Alico\u2019s fruit to produce orange juice and must now operate at reduced capacity. Orange juice consumption in the U.S. has been declining for the past two decades, despite a small bump during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "A prominent growers group, the Gulf Citrus Growers Association, closed its doors last year.",
      "Pressure on citrus farming is also growing from one of the state's other biggest industries: real estate.",
      "Florida expanded by more than 467,000 people last year to 23 million people, making it the third largest state in the nation. And more homes must be built to house that ever-growing population.",
      "Some prominent, multi-generational citrus families each have been putting hundreds of acres (hectares) of groves up for sale for millions of dollars, or as much as $25,000 an acre.",
      "Murphy owns several hundred acres (hectares) of groves and says he has no plans to abandon the industry, though last year he closed a citrus grove caretaking business that managed thousands of acres for other owners.",
      "However, he also has a real estate license, which is useful given the amount of land that is changing hands. He recently sold off acres in Polk County to a home developer, and has used that money to pay off debt and develop plans to replant thousands of trees in more productive groves.",
      "\u201cI would like to think that we\u2019re at the bottom, and we\u2019re starting to climb back up that hill,\u201d Murphy says.",
      "A whole ecosystem of businesses dependent on Florida citrus is at risk if the crops fail, including 33,000 fulltime and part-time jobs and an economic impact of $6.8 billion in Florida alone. Besides growers, there are juice processors, grove caretakers, fertilizer sellers, packing houses, nurseries and candy manufacturers, all hoping for a fix for citrus greening disease.",
      "Tom Davidson, whose parents founded Davidson of Dundee Citrus Candy and Jelly Factory in Lake Wales in 1966, says the drop in citrus production has impacted what flavor jellies the business is able to produce and the prices it charges to customers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really hoping that the scientists can get this figured out so we can we can get back to what we did,\u201d Davidson says.",
      "Researchers have been working for eight years on a genetically modified tree that can kill the tiny insects responsible for citrus greening. The process involves inserting a gene into a citrus tree that produces a protein that can kill baby Asian citrus psyllids by making holes in their guts, according to Lukasz Stelinski, an entomology professor at the University of Florida/Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences' Citrus Research and Education Center.",
      "It could be at least three years before bug-resistant trees can be planted, leaving Florida growers looking for help from other technologies. They include planting trees inside protective screens and covering young trees with white bags to keep out the bugs, injecting trees with an antibiotic, and finding trees that have become resistant to greening through natural mutation and distributing them to other groves.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like being a Lions fan before the Detroit Lions started to win games,\u201d Stelinski says. \u201cI'm hoping that we are making that turnaround.\u201d",

      "Seven & i has made public a letter that Stephen Dacus, its new chief executive, sent to Bouchard in September, explaining why it was rejecting the Canadian company's offer.",

      "The U.S. is suddenly looking less bubbly for European wines",
      "The United States is suddenly looking less bubbly for European wines.",
      "President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with a planned 50% tariff on American whiskey. Wine sellers and importers said a tariff of that size would essentially shut down the European wine business in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think customers are prepared to pay two to three times more for their favorite wine or Champagne,\u201d Ronnie Sanders, the CEO of Vine Street Imports in Mt. Laurel Township, New Jersey, said.",
      "Jeff Zacharia, president of fine wine retailer Zachys in Port Chester, New York, said 80% of the wine he sells is from Europe. Importers depend on European wines for a big part of their distribution system, he said, and there\u2019s not enough U.S. wine to make up for that.",
      "\u201cThis is just going to have a major negative impact on the whole U.S. wine industry in all aspects of it, including U.S. wineries,\u201d he said.",
      "Zacharia said there are so many unknowns right now he's stopped buying European wine until the picture becomes clearer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to make preparations when as a business you don\u2019t have a clear path forward,\u201d he said. \u201cOur preparations would be very different if it\u2019s 200% compared to 100% compared to 10%.\u201d",
      "Wine and spirits from the 27-nation European Union made up 17% of the total consumed in the U.S. in 2023, according to IWSR, a global data and insight provider specializing in alcohol. Of that 17%, Italy accounted for 7% -- mostly from wine \u2013 and French wine, cognac and vodka accounted for 5%.",
      "Overall, the U.S. imports much more alcohol than it exports. The $26.6 billion worth of foreign-produced alcoholic beverages that entered the country in 2022 accounted for 14% percent of all U.S. agricultural imports, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. exported $3.9 billion worth of beer, wine and distilled spirits that year.",
      "Marten Lodewijks, president of IWSR U.S., said a 200% tariff would not be unprecedented but import duties of that size tend to be more targeted.",
      "In 2020, China imposed tariffs as high as 218% on Australian wine, which caused exports to plunge by 90%, Lodewijks said. China lifted the tariffs last year, but by then Australia's wine industry had taken a big hit. Australia's wine trade to China was worth 1.1 billion Australian dollars ($710 million) annually before the tariffs were put in place.",
      "Europe's tax on American whiskey, which was unveiled in response to the Trump administration's steel and aluminum tariffs, is expected to go into effect on April 1. Trump responded Thursday in a social media post.",
      "\"If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThis will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Trump was incorrect about the Champagne business. Champagne is a legally protected wine that can only come from France\u2019s Champagne region. But U.S. winemakers \u2014 including Trump Winery, a Virginia winery owned by the president's son Eric Trump \u2014 do make sparkling wine.",
      "Reaction from across the Atlantic was swift Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe must stop a dangerous escalation that is leading to a global trade war where the first victims will be U.S. citizens who will pay more for products, and with them, farmers,\u2019\u2019 Ettore Prandini, president of Italy's Coldiretti agriculture lobby, said.",
      "Italian wine exports to the U.S. \u2013 led by prosecco -- have tripled in value over the last 20 years and reached 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) last year. In France, the U.S. market for wines and spirits is worth 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) annually.",
      "Gabriel Picard, who heads the French Federation of Exporters of Wines and Spirits, said 200% tariffs would be \u201ca hammer blow\u201d for France\u2019s alcohol export industry, impacting hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "\u201cNot a single bottle will continue to be expedited if 200% tariffs are applied to our products. All exports to the United States will come to a total, total, halt,\u201d Picard said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "French transporter Grain de Sail, which uses sail power to ship wines and other goods across the Atlantic, said Thursday that some winemakers had already cancelled planned shipments of wine to the U.S. because they were anticipating tariffs even before Trump's announcement.",
      "\u201cIt has more or less frozen exports. There's no point even hoping to send wine to the United States under these conditions,\u201d said Jacques Barreau, the firm\u2019s co-founder.",
      "Some U.S. wine stores saw an opportunity Thursday. In Washington, the wine bar Cork announced a tariff sale, encouraging regulars to come stock up on their favorite wines while they\u2019re still affordable.",
      "Others wondered aloud whether Trump would really go through with a 200% tariff.",
      "\u201cIt changes by the hour now, right?\" Mark O\u2019Callaghan, the founder of Exit 9 Wine & Liquor Warehouse in Clifton Park, New York, said. European wines make up around 35% of sales at his store, he said.",
      "Others seemed to want to stay out of the fray. Total Wine, which operates 279 stores in 29 U.S. states, didn't respond to a request for comment Thursday. Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits, one of the country's largest alcohol distributors, also didn't respond to a message seeking comment.",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Jae'Lyn Withers stood in a hallway of the Spectrum Center, his left arm resting around the shoulders of North Carolina coach Hubert Davis. He was surrounded by reporters, all wanting to know a simple question.",
      "How did it happen?",
      "It was roughly an hour after the Tar Heels nearly completed a comeback from a 24-point deficit against top-ranked Duke in the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament. But it slipped painfully away on the most unusual of mistakes: Withers' lane violation in the final seconds that negated the tying free throw from Ven-Allen Lubin.",
      "The Blue Devils hung on for a 74-71 victory Friday night in the semifinal, a game that was flirting with earning its own place in the rivalry's lore for the comeback \u2014 only to secure it for an entirely different reason.",
      "To his credit, Williams \u2014 a graduate forward who had helped lead the Tar Heels\u2019 final-month surge to revive their NCAA Tournament hopes \u2014 didn't hide from reporters. He instead faced the questions about that painful moment. He spoke in a low voice, his coach standing at his side in a public show of support.",
      "\u201cI guess you could just say I kind of mistimed the shot,\u201d Withers said. \u201cI was trying to make sure I crashed hard to secure a rebound in case he did miss.\"",
      "Before that moment, it seemed North Carolina (22-13) was on the verge of an improbable comeback likely to eliminate lingering doubts about their chances of earning a bid to March Madness. Duke was playing without freshman star Cooper Flagg and versatile defender Maliq Brown due to injuries, but closed the first half on a 15-0 run and took its largest lead at 52-28 with 17:01 left.",
      "But the Tar Heels took over, getting loose in transition to finally create some space and rhythm.

      "The Tar Heels missed a desperation 3-pointer on one final possession, and Withers immediately covered his face with his jersey at the bench in anguish. He regrouped enough to go through the postgame handshake line with a towel on his head.",
      "\u201cThe emotions (that) followed was just just the sense, I\u2019d say mostly disbelief initially,\u201d Withers said. \"But following that, of course upset with the end result.\u201d",

      "FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Emani Jefferson scored 15 points to lead Florida Gulf Coast to the Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament championship for the ninth straight season, defeating Central Arkansas 68-51 on Saturday.",
      "The Eagles continued their dominance of the ASUN tournament. They are 38-2 all-time in the tournament since becoming eligible in 2012. They are 26-0 in their nine-year streak and have won 12 of the last 14 titles.",
      "Against Central Arkansas, Jefferson made 6 of 8 shots and collected seven rebounds, four assists and five steals with only one turnover. Dolly Cairns and Khamari Mitchell-Steen added 10 points each for the top-seeded Eagles (30-3).",
      "Leah Mafua had 17 points, Jade Upshaw 15 and Cheyanne Kemp 10 for No. 2-seed Central Arkansas (23-9).",
      "FGCU did not allow a field goal in the final 3 1/2 minutes of the first quarter and the Eagles' 8-2 run resulted in a 16-12 lead heading to the second quarter. Cairns opened the second with a 3-pointer and Mitchell-Steen followed with a layup for a 21-12 lead four-plus minutes into the quarter.",
      "The Eagles went on to score 22 points in the second quarter. They led 38-21 with a minute left in the period and held Central Arkansas without a field goal from 4:44 to 0:08 when the Sugar Bears' Bree Stephens scored in the paint to make it 38-24 at halftime. The Sugar Bears' next field goal came four minutes into the third quarter.",
      "FGCU's lead reached 21 after a 7-0 run to open the third quarter. Midway through the fourth Jefferson hit a 3-pointer and a long jumper to restore the 21-point lead, 68-47, with 3:16 remaining. Upshaw scored the last four points of the game for Central Arkansas.",

      "Renault is testing a new driverless mini-bus in Barcelona this week. The autonomous vehicle is running on a 2.2-km (1.3-mile) circular route with four stops in the center of the Spanish city. Adventurous commuters can jump on free of charge.",
      "The French carmaker has teamed up with WeRide, a company specializing in autonomous vehicles, to make the prototype. It unveiled the driverless bus at the French Open venue last year, but now it is testing it on the open road in Barcelona. It also has testing projects going in Valence, France, and at the Zurich airport.",

      "Driverless taxis and buses are being tried out by companies in other cities, from San Francisco to Tokyo.",

      "\u201cThe US is doing a lot of experimentation with autonomous vehicles, the same thing in China,\u201d Patrick Vergelas, head of Renault's autonomous mobility projects, told The Associated Press. \u201cUntil now we don\u2019t have a lot in fact in Europe.

      "LOS ANGELES -- The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are warning against a dangerous ransomware scheme.",
      "In an advisory posted earlier this week, government officials warned that a ransomware-as-a-service software called Medusa, which has launched ransomware attacks since 2021, has recently affected hundreds of people. Medusa uses phishing campaigns as its main method for stealing victims' credentials, according to CISA.",
      "To protect against the ransomware, officials recommended patching operating systems, software and firmware, in addition to using multifactor authentication for all services such as email and VPNs. Experts also recommended using long passwords, and warned against frequently recurring password changes because they can weaken security.",
      "Medusa developers and affiliates \u2014 called \u201cMedusa actors\u201d \u2014 use a double extortion model, where they \u201cencrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid,\u201d the advisory said.

      "\u201cRansom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets,\u201d the advisory said. \u201cAt this stage, Medusa concurrently advertises sale of the data to interested parties before the countdown timer ends.

      "The next time you get a call about an upcoming medical appointment you may not be talking to a human",
      "The next time you\u2019re due for a medical exam you may get a call from someone like Ana: a friendly voice that can help you prepare for your appointment and answer any pressing questions you might have.",
      "With her calm, warm demeanor, Ana has been trained to put patients at ease \u2014 like many nurses across the U.S. But unlike them, she is also available to chat 24-7, in multiple languages, from Hindi to Haitian Creole.",
      "That\u2019s because Ana isn\u2019t human, but an artificial intelligence program created by Hippocratic AI, one of a number of new companies offering ways to automate time-consuming tasks usually performed by nurses and medical assistants.",
      "It\u2019s the most visible sign of AI\u2019s inroads into health care, where hundreds of hospitals are using increasingly sophisticated computer programs to monitor patients' vital signs, flag emergency situations and trigger step-by-step action plans for care \u2014 jobs that were all previously handled by nurses and other health professionals.",
      "Hospitals say AI is helping their nurses work more efficiently while addressing burnout and understaffing. But nursing unions argue that this poorly understood technology is overriding nurses' expertise and degrading the quality of care patients receive.",
      "\u201cHospitals have been waiting for the moment when they have something that appears to have enough legitimacy to replace nurses,\u201d said Michelle Mahon of National Nurses United. \u201cThe entire ecosystem is designed to automate, de-skill and ultimately replace caregivers.\u201d",
      "Mahon\u2019s group, the largest nursing union in the U.S., has helped organize more than 20 demonstrations at hospitals across the country, pushing for the right to have say in how AI can be used \u2014 and protection from discipline if they decide to disregard automated advice. The group raised new alarms in January when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the incoming health secretary, suggested AI nurses \u201cas good as any doctor\u201d could help deliver care in rural areas. On Friday, Dr. Mehmet Oz, who\u2019s been nominated to oversee Medicare and Medicaid, said he believes AI can \u201cliberate doctors and nurses from all the paperwork.\u201d",
      "Hippocratic AI initially promoted a rate of $9 an hour for its AI assistants, compared with about $40 an hour for a registered nurse. It has since dropped that language, instead touting its services and seeking to assure customers that they have been carefully tested. The company did not grant requests for an interview.",
      "Hospitals have been experimenting for years with technology designed to improve care and streamline costs, including sensors, microphones and motion-sensing cameras. Now that data is being linked with electronic medical records and analyzed in an effort to predict medical problems and direct nurses' care \u2014 sometimes before they've evaluated the patient themselves.",
      "Adam Hart was working in the emergency room at Dignity Health in Henderson, Nevada, when the hospital's computer system flagged a newly arrived patient for sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to infection. Under the hospital's protocol, he was supposed to immediately administer a large dose of IV fluids. But after further examination, Hart determined that he was treating a dialysis patient, or someone with kidney failure. Such patients have to be carefully managed to avoid overloading their kidneys with fluid.",
      "Hart raised his concern with the supervising nurse but was told to just follow the standard protocol. Only after a nearby physician intervened did the patient instead begin to receive a slow infusion of IV fluids.",
      "\u201cYou need to keep your thinking cap on\u2014 that\u2019s why you\u2019re being paid as a nurse,\u201d Hart said. \u201cTurning over our thought processes to these devices is reckless and dangerous.\u201d",
      "Hart and other nurses say they understand the goal of AI: to make it easier for nurses to monitor multiple patients and quickly respond to problems. But the reality is often a barrage of false alarms, sometimes erroneously flagging basic bodily functions \u2014 such as a patient having a bowel movement \u2014 as an emergency.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re trying to focus on your work but then you\u2019re getting all these distracting alerts that may or may not mean something,\u201d said Melissa Beebe, a cancer nurse at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even tell when it\u2019s accurate and when it\u2019s not because there are so many false alarms.\u201d",
      "Even the most sophisticated technology will miss will miss signs that nurses routinely pick up on, such as facial expressions and odors, notes Michelle Collins, dean of Loyola University\u2019s College of Nursing. But people aren't perfect either.",
      "\u201cIt would be foolish to turn our back on this completely,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe should embrace what it can do to augment our care, but we should also be careful it doesn\u2019t replace the human element.\u201d",
      "More than 100,000 nurses left the workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to one estimate, the biggest staffing drop in 40 years. As the U.S. population ages and nurses retire, the U.S. government estimates there will be more than 190,000 new openings for nurses every year through 2032.",
      "Faced with this trend, hospital administrators see AI filling a vital role: not taking over care, but helping nurses and doctors gather information and communicate with patients.",
      "At the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences in Little Rock, staffers need to make hundreds of calls every week to prepare patients for surgery. Nurses confirm information about prescriptions, heart conditions and other issues \u2014 like sleep apnea \u2014 that must be carefully reviewed before anesthesia.",
      "The problem: many patients only answer their phones in the evening, usually between dinner and their children\u2019s bedtime.",
      "\u201cSo what we need to do is find a way to call several hundred people in a 120-minute window -- but I really don\u2019t want to pay my staff overtime to do so,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Sanford, who oversees the center\u2019s health IT.",
      "Since January, the hospital has used an AI assistant from Qventus to contact patients and health providers, send and receive medical records and summarize their contents for human staffers. Qventus says 115 hospitals are using its technology, which aims to boost hospital earnings through quicker surgical turnarounds, fewer cancellations and reduced burnout.",
      "Each call begins with the program identifying itself as an AI assistant.",
      "\u201cWe always want to be fully transparent with our patients that sometimes they are talking to a human and sometimes they\u2019re not,\u201d Sanford said.",
      "While companies like Qventus are providing an administrative service, other AI developers see a bigger role for their technology.",
      "Israeli startup Xoltar specializes in humanlike avatars that conduct video calls with patients. The company is working with the Mayo Clinic on an AI assistant that teaches patients cognitive techniques for managing chronic pain. The company is also developing an avatar to help smokers quit. In early testing, patients have spent about 14 minutes talking to the program, which can pickup on facial expressions, body language and other cues, according to Xoltar.",
      "Nursing experts who study AI say such programs may work for people who are relatively healthy and proactive about their care. But that\u2019s not most people in the health system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the very sick who are taking up the bulk of health care in the U.S. and whether or not chatbots are positioned for those folks is something we really have to consider,\u201d said Roschelle Fritz of the University of California Davis School of Nursing.",

      "The FBI is warning Americans not to respond to scam road toll collection texts after receiving more than 2,000 complaints this month",
      "WASHINGTON -- The FBI is warning Americans not to respond to scam road toll collection texts after receiving more than 2,000 complaints this month.",
      "The texts impersonating state road toll collection agencies attempt to get phone users to reveal financial information, such as credit or debit cards or bank accounts.",
      "They're so-called smishing scams \u2014 a form of phishing that relies on SMS texts to trick people into sending money or share sensitive information.",
      "The FBI says the texts are moving from state to state and use nearly identical language falsely claiming that recipients have an unpaid or outstanding toll that could result in fines or suspended driving privileges.",
      "The FBI is asking those who receive the scams to file a complaint with its IC3 internet crime complaint center, www.ic3.gov, and to also delete the texts.",
      "Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks said last week that a threat actor has registered over 10,000 domains for the scams. The scams are impersonating toll services and package delivery services in at least 10 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Ontario.",
      "While Apple bans links in iPhone messages received from unknown senders, the scam attempts to bypass that protection by inviting users to reply with \u201cY\u201d and reopen the text."

      "The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage",
      "ROME -- The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage and sent 11 people to the hospital, the most serious suffering contusions after part of a ceiling collapsed, officials said.",
      "The quake was the strongest in recorded history around the Phlegrean Fields, a sprawling area of ancient volcanoes that covers a broad swath of the Naples metropolitan area. It matched the magnitude of another quake in the same area last May that has put the population on alert.",
      "Residents shaken awake by the early-morning quake sought safety in the streets, as they did in May.",
      "The temblor, which loosened stone and cement from some facades, was centered just offshore from Pozzuoli, a seaside suburb bordering Naples. Mayor Gaetano Manfredi told reporters that one church, a seven-story residential building and another building were declared off-limits due to damage, and some schools were closed as a precaution.",
      "Inspectors were checking buildings for further damage, Manfredi said. \u201cWe are following with the greatest attention all of our structures, and are monitoring all events in real time,\u2019\u2019 the mayor said.",
      "In all, 11 people sought hospital treatment. One woman was injured after part of a ceiling fell, and several others suffered cuts from glass that broke in the quake, Manfredi said.",
      "Seismologists have reported a fresh increase in activity around the Phlegrean Fields over recent weeks. Authorities last summer conducted drills in preparation for a major emergency as the frequency of temblors increased.",
      "The area around the Phlegrean Fields, which encompasses western neighborhoods of Naples and its suburbs, is both seismically and volcanically active. The surface has been pushed up 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) since 2006, which is higher than prior to the last major event in 1984, but seismologists have emphasized it is impossible to predict when an eruption or stronger quake might occur.",
      "At least 500,000 people live in the zone most at risk should the volcano erupt. Italy's national institute for geophysics and vulcanology has called for a governmental plan to ensure that structures can withstand a quake of at least a magnitude 5.0.",
      "During the 1984 event, 40,000 residents were evacuated during a period of intense seismic activity as a precaution against a feared eruption that did not occur.",

      "WASHINGTON -- An hours-long outage Wednesday on StudentAid.gov, the federal website for student loans and financial aid, underscored the risks in rapidly gutting the Department of Education, as President Donald Trump aims to dismantle the agency.",
      "Hundreds of users reported FAFSA outages to Downdetector starting midday Wednesday, saying they were having trouble completing the form, which is required for financial aid at colleges nationwide. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, a group of people who handle colleges' financial aid awards, also received reports of users experiencing technical issues and having trouble completing the FAFSA.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get more clarity on why it\u2019s down,\" said Allie Bidwell Arcese, a spokeswoman for NASFAA. The Education Department hadn't shared any information on the outage, she said. \u201cThe maintenance and troubleshooting may be impacted by yesterday\u2019s layoffs.\u201d",
      "The developers and IT support staff who worked on the FAFSA form were hard hit in the Education Department's layoffs Tuesday, along with staff buyouts and the termination of probationary employees. In all, the Education Department has reduced its staff by half, to roughly 2,000, since Trump took office.",
      "A list of laid-off staff obtained and verified by AP shows more than 300 people cut from Federal Student Aid \u2014 two dozen of them from Federal Student Aid's technology division. That included the entire team responsible for systems supporting the FAFSA form, a person with knowledge of the outage told The Associated Press, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation. While laid-off staffers are still technically employed until March 21, they had limited access to their email, phones and computers, making a response to the outage difficult, the person said. At one point Wednesday, about 70 people had joined a Teams call to try to pinpoint the cause of the outage.",
      "The call continued for hours. By Wednesday evening, the website carried a banner claiming \u201cPlanned Maintenance\u201d was underway, and login access was cut off.",
      "The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment on the outage.",
      "Problems with the FAFSA had vexed the administration of former President Joe Biden, drawing rebuke from Republicans. The form was overhauled last year in an attempt to simplify it, but technical problems blocked students from submitting forms or bungled financial aid calculations.",
      "Advocates say the frustration probably led thousands of students to give up on going to college at all. Last fall, U.S. colleges saw a 5% decrease in freshmen enrollment over the previous year, and it was deeper at colleges with large numbers of low-income students, according to the National Student Clearinghouse.",

      "Universities across the U.S. have announced hiring freezes, citing new financial uncertainty as the Trump administration threatens a range of cuts to federal contracts and research grants.",
      "In February, the administration announced deep cuts to National Institutes of Health grants for research institutions, a shift that could reduce the money going to some universities by over $100 million. Some schools already have shelved projects because of the cuts, which have been delayed temporarily by a court challenge.",
      "Recently, President Donald Trump has shown appetite for targeting colleges\u2019 funding more directly. His administration has vowed to take federal money from colleges that defy his agenda on issues including diversity, equity and inclusion programs, transgender athletes\u2019 participation in women\u2019s sports, and student protests that he deems \u201cillegal.\u201d",
      "On March 7, the administration on Friday pulled $400 million from Columbia University over what it described as the Ivy League school\u2019s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus. The Education Department followed up with a letter Monday warning 60 colleges they could lose federal money if they fail to make campuses safe for Jewish students.",
      "Higher education has been a steady job generator since the pandemic, with private colleges and universities adding 35,000 jobs nationwide last year. Hiring freezes and cuts at universities could contribute to slower job growth in the months ahead, advocates for workers say.",
      "Over the last two weeks, more than a dozen institutions have announced limits on hiring for faculty and staff positions and other measures to tighten purse strings.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. stock market has just dropped 10% from its high set last month, hurt by worries about the economy and a global trade war",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. stock market has just dropped 10% from its high set last month, hurt by worries about the economy and a global trade war.",
      "T he fall for the S&P 500 is steep enough that Wall Street has a name for it: a \u201ccorrection.\u201d Such drops have happened regularly for more than a century, and market pros often view them as potentially healthy wipeouts of overdone euphoria, which could send stock prices too high if unchecked.",
      "But corrections are frightening in the moment, particularly for every new generation of investors that gets into the market at a time when it seems like stocks only go up.",
      "The S&P 500 is coming off two straight years with gains of more than 20%. Such stellar gains left the market looking too expensive to critics, who pointed to how prices rose faster than corporate profits.",
      "Culling too-high enthusiasm among day traders is one thing. The larger fear always accompanying a correction is that it could be a warning sign of a coming \"bear market,\" which is what Wall Street calls a drop of at least 20%.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what history shows about past corrections, and what market watchers are expecting going forward.",
      "The U.S. stock market initially jumped after President Donald Trump's election in November on hopes he'd bring lower taxes, less regulation for businesses and other policies that would drive corporate profits higher. All those gains have since disappeared, as Wall Street faces the potential downsides of Trump's White House for the economy.",
      "The president has been making announcements on tariffs at a dizzying pace, first placing them on trading partners, then exempting some and then doing it all over again. The tariffs could hit every country that trades with the United States, which would raise prices for U.S. households and businesses when high inflation has already proven stubborn to fully subdue.",
      "The fear is that tariffs could slow or even halt the solid growth the U.S. economy was showing when it ended 2024. Even if Trump ultimately goes forward with less painful tariffs, all the uncertainty around the will-he-or-won't-he rollout could prove damaging by freezing economic activity. Such concerns have shown up in the latest readings on consumer confidence, as well as companies' forecasts for future profits.",
      "Trump himself has acknowledged his plans could affect the U.S. economy's growth.",
      "All the uncertainty is also making things more complicated for the Federal Reserve, which had been cutting interest rates after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Cutting rates further would help the economy, but it could also put upward pressure on inflation.",
      "The brunt of this sell-off has also hit stocks that critics were saying looked the most expensive after running wild through the frenzy around artificial intelligence. Nvidia, for example, has already dropped roughly 14% in 2025 so far after surging more than 800% through 2023 and 2024.",
      "Most of the other big stocks in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have dominated the market recently have also been lagging the rest of the S&P 500. Those seven stocks alone had accounted for more than half the S&P 500\u2019s total return last year.",
      "Every couple years, on average. Even during the historic, nearly 11-year-long bull run for U.S. stocks from March 2009 to February 2020, the S&P 500 stumbled to five corrections, according to CFRA. Worries about everything from interest rates to trade wars to a European debt crisis caused the pullbacks.",
      "The U.S. market's last correction was in 2023, when the S&P 500 dropped 10.3% from the end of July into October. At the time, high Treasury yields were undercutting stock prices as traders accepted a new normal where the Fed would keep rates high for a while. But stocks would quickly turn higher as optimism revived that cuts to rates were on the horizon.",
      "The last correction that did graduate into a bear market was in 2022. That's when the Fed first began cranking up interest rates to combat the worst inflation in generations. Worries rose that high rates would slow the economy enough to create a recession, one that ultimately never came.",
      "Through the 2022 bear market, the S&P 500 fell 25.4% from Jan. 3 to Oct. 12.",
      "Looking only at corrections since 1946 that managed to right themselves before turning into a bear market, the S&P 500 has taken an average of 133 days to hit bottom and lost an average of nearly 14% along the way, according to CFRA. The index has taken an average of 113 days to recoup its losses.",
      "For declines that become bear markets, the damage is much worse. Going back to 1929, the average bear market has taken an average of nearly 19 months to hit bottom and caused a loss of 38.5% for the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "On paper, an investor can lose most of their money. From late 1929 into the middle of 1932, the stock market fell a little more than 86%, for example.",
      "A bear market can also feel interminable: One lasted more than five years, from 1937 into 1942, where U.S. stocks lost 60%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "In Japan, after the Nikkei 225 index set a record at the end of 1989, it sank and then took decades to fully recover. It wasn't until 2024 that it got back to that peak.",
      "The Japanese example is an outlier, though. In almost every case, investors would have made back all their losses from a downturn for U.S. stocks if they simply held on and didn't sell. That includes the 2000 dot-com bust, the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus collapse.",
      "No one knows. Some investors on Wall Street say they expect Trump to pull back on some policies if they prove to be too damaging, while others say the uncertainty alone is creating enough pain.",
      "The economy has given signals that it's still relatively solid at the moment, including last month's jobs report, but the outlook looks cloudier than usual given all the unknowns."

      "WASHINGTON -- There sat Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s top health official, at a Steak \u2019n Shake with Fox News host Sean Hannity, raving about the fries.",
      "\u201cSteak \u2019n Shake has been great, we\u2019re very grateful for them,\u201d Kennedy said, in between nibbles of fries that the Midwestern franchise recently announced would be cooked in beef tallow instead of common cooking oils that Kennedy says are bad for Americans' diet.",
      "It's the kind of endorsement that doctors have implored him to make about the childhood vaccines used to prevent deadly diseases, like measles as outbreaks worsened in Texas and New Mexico during his first month in office.",
      "The secretary of Health and Human Services has, instead, raised doubts about vaccines, most recently saying in his interview with Hannity that the shots cause \u201cdeaths every year,\" although he later added that vaccinations should be encouraged.",
      "In his first month in office, Kennedy, who vowed to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d has delivered an inconsistent message that has the nation's top infectious diseases specialists worried that his tepid recommendations of vaccines will undermine access to long-proven remedies.",
      "During his first address to thousands of workers at the federal public health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy promised to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the childhood vaccine schedule. Days later, the CDC cancelled a public meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Panel, a group of doctors and scientists who make recommendations on vaccines. That meeting has not been rescheduled.",
      "In another case, a cancelled public meeting of vaccine advisers who make recommendations on the flu vaccine every year for the FDA also has not been given a new date. This week, the National Institutes for Health, also under Kennedy's purview, began cancelling funding for some research on vaccines.",
      "The CDC also is preparing to research autism and vaccines, planning to \"leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening,\u201d HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in a statement. Agency officials did not comment further for this article.",
      "Numerous studies have concluded that there is no link between the two, a fact the agency states on its website.",
      "\u201cWhat he is trying to do is scare about the safety of vaccines,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser and infectious disease doctor at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said of Kennedy's first month in office. \u201cIt shouldn't surprise anybody. His agenda has always been to get vaccines off the market, or to make them less available.\u201d",
      "Offit worries that the cancellation of the FDA\u2019s flu vaccine meeting, held every March for at least 30 years, is just the beginning. The committee's June meeting to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine's formulation has also not been scheduled, he said.",
      "Democrats and Republicans pushed back when Dr. Marty Makary, the FDA nominee, wouldn\u2019t commit to rescheduling the committee's flu meeting .",
      "\u201cWhat is lost is the transparency,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate health committee who is also a physician.",
      "During his senate confirmation hearings earlier this year, Kennedy repeatedly rejected any notion that he would undermine vaccines. \u201cI support vaccines. I support the childhood schedule,\u201d he said. He promised Cassidy, who was unsettled about Kennedy's anti-vaccine advocacy work, that he would not change existing vaccine recommendations.",
      "But Kennedy\u2019s skeptical views of vaccines have emerged during interviews and public statements since his confirmation.",
      "He's sent \u201cmixed messages\u201d on vaccine safety, even though the U.S. has \u201cthe most elaborate vaccine adverse event surveillance system in the world,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. Serious problems, including death, are very rare and the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, he said.",
      "\u201cA simple way to describe this to the average person is the serious adverse events generally occur at a rate of 1 to a few cases per million doses of vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a needle in a haystack.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece on FoxNews.com earlier this month, Kennedy said the measles outbreak in West Texas that left a six-year old child dead was a \u201ccall to action\u201d but stopped short of recommending that people receive the vaccine that prevents 97% of cases. Despite the U.S. registering its first measles death in a decade, Kennedy has repeatedly downplayed this year's outbreaks, noting that when he was a child \u201ceverybody got measles.\"",
      "This year's cases \u2014 reported at 250 \u2014 are on track to far outpace last year's reports of 286 measles infections.",
      "Pediatricians are fielding more questions from confused parents in their exam rooms, said Dr. Susan Kressly. Worried about reports of cancelled vaccine meetings, they\u2019re wondering about their access to next year\u2019s flu vaccines. Others are asking if they should get doses of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine earlier. Kressly said there\u2019s a clear message the government can send to help stop the rising case count.",
      "\u201cThe only way to stop an outbreak is increased coordinated positive messaging around vaccinating,\u201d Kressly said.",
      "The CDC has assisted with vaccination efforts in West Texas. But Kennedy himself has publicly advocated for an alternative treatment for measles: Vitamin A. Under his watch, the CDC\u2019s guidance was updated to say that Vitamin A should be given to children with severe measles and prescribed in doses under a doctor\u2019s supervision.",
      "Vitamin A supplementation has been recommended for decades to reduce pneumonia and death in malnourished children in developing countries, but the benefits in well-nourished children in countries like the U.S. are less clear.",
      "\u201cWe need to use Vitamin A for those kids who are unlucky enough to get measles,\u201d said Dr. Andy Pavia, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Utah. \u201cBut it can\u2019t prevent measles and it can only provide some help in reducing the severity.\u201d",
      "When administered correctly, using Vitamin A in kids with severe measles will \u201cdo no harm,\u201d Pavia said. But if improperly done, high doses of Vitamin A can be toxic and deadly.",
      "Abrupt staffing changes have also dominated Kennedy's first weeks in office, with CDC pick Dave Weldon withdrawing from the nomination mere minutes before his hearing, Kennedy's top HHS spokesman quitting two weeks into the job and the Food and Drug Administration's newly minted chief counsel departing 48 hours into the position.",
      "Trump and Kennedy's supporters, however, have dismissed concerns about the rocky start.",
      "His newfound platform as health secretary and talk of healthier foods is already affecting change in the American diet, advisers close to Kennedy and Trump have claimed on social media.",
      "They credit Kennedy with prompting Republican legislators to introduce bills in Utah and Texas that would ban soda in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, for example. And then there's Steak \u2018n Shake\u2019s new fries.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr. just ate Steak \u2019n Shake on live TV, the fast food joint that\u2019s bravely frying everything in beef tallow,\u201d conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk said this week in a tweet. \u201cThis is the way.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, after a meeting with a handful of executives from the nation's largest food manufactures, Kennedy released a slickly-produced video that promised more change would be on the way, saying companies were taking his \u201cMAHA\" movement seriously.",
      "\u201cThey understand they have a new sheriff in town,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "He did not share any details about what was discussed at the meeting.",

      "A new report says at least 112 North American bird species have lost more than half their populations in the past 50 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- At least 112 North American bird species have lost more than half their populations in the past 50 years, according to a new report published Thursday.",
      "Among the birds showing the steepest declines are Allen\u2019s hummingbirds, Florida scrub jays, golden-cheeked warblers, tricolored blackbirds and yellow-billed magpies.",
      "\u201cThese are the very real consequences if we are unable to conserve and protect the crucial habitats that birds need,\u201d said study co-author Mike Brasher, a senior scientist at the nonprofit Ducks Unlimited.",
      "For several decades, waterfowl stood out as a conservation bright spot with duck populations growing nationwide even as many other groups of birds declined in the U.S. But that trend has reversed, the new data shows.",
      "The total number of dabbling and diving ducks is down about 30% from 2017, said Brasher. Loss of grasslands habitat and a prolonged drought affecting the wetlands of the Great Plains\u2019 prairie pothole region have taken a toll. Among all waterfowl, numbers are down 20% since 2014, the report found.",
      "The latest report is a collaboration between several groups including Cornell University, Ducks Unlimited, American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society and the American Ornithological Society.",
      "The work draws on survey data from the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and citizen projects such as Cornell's eBird. There are some 2,000 bird species in North America. A third of the species examined are rated as high or moderate concern for conservation due to declining numbers, habitat loss or other threats.",
      "These birds \u201cneed urgent conservation attention,\u201d said Amanda Rodewald, a study co-author from Cornell, adding that bird survey trends also reveal the health of their habitats.",
      "The report focuses on birds that must breed and feed in specific habitats such as forests, grasslands and coastal regions. Grassland birds including the Bobolink are most at risk.",
      "\u201cFor each species that we\u2019re in danger of losing, it\u2019s like pulling an individual thread out of the complex tapestry of life,\u201d said Georgetown University biologist Peter Marra, who was not involved in the new report.",
      "Marra pointed to key past conservation successes in the U.S. \u2013 such as the comebacks of bald eagles, egrets and osprey.",
      "\u201cWe know that we can bend the curve back with targeted conservation plans. But we can\u2019t just close our eyes and hope,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Vaccines could be a key means of suppressing bird flu and avoiding the slaughter of millions of chickens, which is blamed for egg prices averaging nearly $5 a dozen",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Vaccines could be a key means of suppressing bird flu and avoiding the slaughter of millions of chickens, which is blamed for egg prices averaging nearly $6 a dozen. But the move has been delayed in part because of concerns it could jeopardize chicken exports worth billions of dollars a year.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced plans to spend $100 million to study bird flu vaccines to fight the disease in concert with meat chicken, egg and turkey groups. That's part of a larger $1 billion effort to invest in more protections to keep the virus off farms that President Donald Trump believes will help lower egg prices.",
      "Chicken meat producers remain the most resistant to vaccines because of concerns they could harm meat exports, which totaled nearly $4.7 billion last year. Egg and turkey producers sell most of their products in the U.S. and have been hit hardest by the virus.",
      "Without a new policy including vaccines, the government will continue to slaughter every flock with a bird flu infection to limit the spread of the disease. Those deaths have totaled over 166 million birds in the U.S. since 2022.",
      "Most birds killed are egg-laying chickens, and the death of so many hens is the main reason egg prices keep rising. The average price per dozen has hit $5.90, and in some part of the country, it is far higher.",
      "Poultry veterinarian Simon Shane, who runs www.Egg-News.com, said the government is hesitant to use vaccines and change its policy of killing birds largely because of the meat chicken industry's opposition.",
      "\u201cBasically this is a political issue, and this only came to a head because eggs are at $8 to $9 a dozen, and it\u2019s embarrassing the government \u2014 embarrassing the present administration,\u201d Shane said.",
      "Before using vaccinations, the government must decide how to devise an effective system and monitor for outbreaks within vaccinated flocks that might not show any symptoms, said John Clifford, the USDA's former longtime chief veterinary officer, who now works with a poultry industry export group. Once that is figured out, the industry can negotiate with countries to minimize trade problems.",
      "\u201cWhat the industry wants is the ability to develop the strategic plan to share that with the trading partners and then find out what kind of impact that that will have on trade,\u201d Clifford said.",
      "There are fears that vaccinating could allow the virus to linger undetected in flocks and mutate in ways that could make it more of a threat to humans and allow sick birds to get into the food supply. Like with other diseases, properly cooking chicken to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) will kill bird flu, but the industry and chicken buyers don't want it there at all.",
      "For meat chicken, known as broilers, the virus isn't as significant because those birds are slaughtered at 6 to 8 weeks old and thus have less chance of being infected compared with egg-laying hens, which live to 2 years or older. Also most broilers are raised in the Southeast, which hasn't had as many outbreaks as the Midwest and West.",
      "Another delay to vaccinating concerns distribution. Egg farmers want to administer it through chicken feed or water, saying it's not practical to give shots to millions of birds in a single barn.",
      "It can also be difficult to tell the difference between a vaccinated bird and one that has been sick with the virus. That would make other countries nervous about importing meat.",
      "\u201cPeople have talked about how expensive it would be to monitor vaccinated populations. And it would be. But where do we want to spend our money?\u201d said Dr. Carol Cardona, a bird flu expert at the University of Minnesota. \u201cWe\u2019re spending our money hand over fist right now in depopulation and to buy eggs for breakfast.\u201d",
      "China and Mexico have been vaccinating their poultry for years, but they take different approaches.",
      "In Mexico chicken are vaccinated, but Clifford said the country doesn't slaughter flocks when infections are found. That basically ensures the virus is present in poultry.",
      "China still slaughters vaccinated flocks when infections are found, which has proven more effective at limiting the spread of the virus and reigning in outbreaks.",
      "Clifford said the U.S. would need to continue culling flocks with outbreaks even after vaccinating, and it might make sense to give shots only to egg layers and turkeys, not broilers.",
      "Don't expect big relief anytime soon.",
      "The USDA, which did not respond to a request for comment for this article sent last week, clearly isn't moving to vaccinate immediately. And, regardless, it will take time to raise new hens.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to wait to replace those with new hatched chicks, and it takes 20 weeks before they even start laying,\u201d Shane said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to get the eggs from.\u201d",
      "Prices may ease somewhat later this year after peak demand, which happens around Easter, if massive egg farms in Iowa, Ohio, California and elsewhere can avoid more outbreaks.",
      "The USDA has predicted that average egg prices will be 41% higher than the 2024 average of $3.17 per dozen. That would mean $4.47 per dozen, slightly below the current average."

      "WASHINGTON -- A fossil of a partial face from a human ancestor is the oldest in western Europe, archaeologists reported Wednesday.",
      "The incomplete skull \u2014 a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw \u2013 was found in northern Spain in 2022. The fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old, according to research published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThe fossil is exciting,\" said Eric Delson, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt's the first time we have significant remains older than 1 million years old in western Europe.\u201d",
      "A collection of older fossils from early human ancestors was previously found in Georgia, near the crossroads of eastern Europe and Asia. Those are estimated to be 1.8 million years old.",
      "The Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors \u201cwere taking excursions into Europe\u201d at that time, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program.",
      "But there is not yet evidence that the earliest arrivals persisted there long, he said. \u201cThey may get to a new location and then die out,\u201d said Potts, who had no role in the study.",
      "The partial skull bears many similarities to Homo erectus, but there are also some anatomical differences, said study co-author Rosa Huguet, an archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain.",
      "Homo erectus arose around 2 million years ago and moved from Africa to regions of Asia and Europe, with the last individuals dying out around 100,000 years ago, said Potts.",
      "It can be challenging to identify which group of early humans a fossil find belongs to if there's only a single fragment versus many bones that show a range of features, said University of Zurich paleoanthropologist Christoph Zollikofer, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The same cave complex in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains where the new fossil was found also previously yielded other significant clues to the ancient human past. Researchers working in the region have also found more recent fossils from Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens.",

      "Vancouver school staff and anyone else with links to the files could read everything. Firewalls or passwords didn\u2019t protect the documents, and student names were not redacted, which cybersecurity experts warned was a massive security risk.",
      "The monitoring tools often helped counselors reach out to students who might have otherwise struggled in silence. But the Vancouver case is a stark reminder of surveillance technology\u2019s unintended consequences in American schools.",
      "In some cases, the technology has outed LGBTQ+ children and eroded trust between students and school staff, while failing to keep schools completely safe.",
      "Gaggle Safety Management, the company that developed the software that tracks Vancouver schools students\u2019 online activity, believes not monitoring children is like letting them loose on \u201ca digital playground without fences or recess monitors,\u201d CEO and founder Jeff Patterson said.",
      "Roughly 1,500 school districts nationwide use Gaggle\u2019s software to track the online activity of approximately 6 million students. It\u2019s one of many companies, like GoGuardian and Securly, that promise to keep kids safe through AI-assisted web surveillance.",
      "The technology has been in high demand since the pandemic, when nearly every child received a school-issued tablet or laptop. According to a U.S. Senate investigation, over 7,000 schools or districts used GoGuardian\u2019s surveillance products in 2021.",
      "Vancouver schools apologized for releasing the documents. Still, the district emphasizes Gaggle is necessary to protect students\u2019 well-being.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we could ever put a price on protecting students,\u201d said Andy Meyer, principal of Vancouver\u2019s Skyview High School. \u201cAnytime we learn of something like that and we can intervene, we feel that is very positive.\u201d",
      "Dacia Foster, a parent in the district, commended the efforts to keep students safe but worries about privacy violations.",

      "Foster says she\u2019d be upset if her daughter\u2019s private information was compromised.",
      "\u201cAt the same time,\u201d she said, \u201cI would like to avoid a school shooting or suicide.\u201d",
      "Gaggle uses a machine-learning algorithm to scan what students search or write online via a school-issued laptop or tablet 24 hours a day, or whenever they log into their school account on a personal device. The latest contract Vancouver signed, in summer 2024, shows a price of $328,036 for three school years \u2014 approximately the cost of employing one extra counselor.",
      "The algorithm detects potential indicators of problems like bullying, self-harm, suicide or school violence and then sends a screenshot to human reviewers. If Gaggle employees confirm the issue might be serious, the company alerts the school. In cases of imminent danger, Gaggle calls school officials directly. In rare instances where no one answers, Gaggle may contact law enforcement for a welfare check.",
      "A Vancouver school counselor who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation said they receive three or four student Gaggle alerts per month. In about half the cases, the district contacts parents immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, families don\u2019t know. We open that door for that help,\u201d the counselor said. Gaggle is \u201cgood for catching suicide and self-harm, but students find a workaround once they know they are getting flagged.\u201d",
      "Seattle Times and AP reporters saw what kind of writing set off Gaggle\u2019s alerts after requesting information about the type of content flagged. Gaggle saved screenshots of activity that set off each alert, and school officials accidentally provided links to them, not realizing they weren\u2019t protected by a password.",
      "After learning about the records inadvertently released to reporters, Gaggle updated its system. Now, after 72 hours, only those logged into a Gaggle account can view the screenshots. Gaggle said this feature was already in the works but had not yet been rolled out to every customer.",
      "The company says the links must be accessible without a login during those 72 hours so emergency contacts \u2014 who often receive these alerts late at night on their phones \u2014 can respond quickly.",
      "In Vancouver, the monitoring technology flagged more than 1,000 documents for suicide and nearly 800 for threats of violence. While many alerts were serious, many others turned out to be false alarms, like a student essay about the importance of consent or a goofy chat between friends.",
      "Foster\u2019s daughter Bryn, a Vancouver School of Arts and Academics sophomore, was one such false alarm. She was called into the principal\u2019s office after writing a short story featuring a scene with mildly violent imagery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re being safe about it, but I also think it can be a bit much,\u201d Bryn said.",
      "School officials maintain alerts are warranted even in less severe cases or false alarms, ensuring potential issues are addressed promptly.",
      "\u201cIt allows me the opportunity to meet with a student I maybe haven\u2019t met before and build that relationship,\u201d said Chele Pierce, a Skyview High School counselor.",
      "Between October 2023 and October 2024, nearly 2,200 students, about 10% of the district\u2019s enrollment, were the subject of a Gaggle alert. At the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, where Bryn is a student, about 1 in 4 students had communications that triggered a Gaggle alert.",
      "While schools continue to use surveillance technology, its long-term effects on student safety are unclear. There\u2019s no independent research showing it measurably lowers student suicide rates or reduces violence.",
      "A 2023 RAND study found only \u201cscant evidence\u201d of either benefits or risks from AI surveillance, concluding: \u201cNo research to date has comprehensively examined how these programs affect youth suicide prevention.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right number of mental health counselors, issuing more alerts is not actually going to improve suicide prevention,\u201d said report co-author Benjamin Boudreaux, an AI ethics researcher.",
      "In the screenshots released by Vancouver schools, at least six students were potentially outed to school officials after writing about being gay, transgender or struggling with gender dysphoria.",
      "LGBTQ+ students are more likely than their peers to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and turn to the internet for support.",
      "\u201cWe know that gay youth, especially those in more isolated environments, absolutely use the internet as a life preserver,\u201d said Katy Pearce, a University of Washington professor who researches technology in authoritarian states.",
      "In one screenshot, a Vancouver high schooler wrote in a Google survey form they\u2019d been subject to trans slurs and racist bullying. Who created this survey is unclear, but the person behind it had falsely promised confidentiality: \u201cI am not a mandated reporter, please tell me the whole truth.\u201d",
      "When North Carolina\u2019s Durham Public Schools piloted Gaggle in 2021, surveys showed most staff members found it helpful.",
      "But community members raised concerns. An LGBTQ+ advocate reported to the Board of Education that a Gaggle alert about self-harm had led to a student being outed to their family, who were not supportive.",
      "Glenn Thompson, a Durham School of the Arts graduate, spoke up at a board meeting during his senior year. One of his teachers promised a student confidentiality for an assignment related to mental health. A classmate was then \u201cblindsided\u201d when Gaggle alerted school officials about something private they\u2019d disclosed. Thompson said no one in the class, including the teacher, knew the school was piloting Gaggle.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just (surveil) people and not tell them. That\u2019s a horrible breach of security and trust,\u201d said Thompson, now a college student, in an interview.",
      "After hearing about these experiences, the Durham Board of Education voted to stop using Gaggle in 2023. The district ultimately decided it was not worth the risk of outing students or eroding relationships with adults.",
      "The debate over privacy and security is complicated, and parents are often unaware it\u2019s even an issue. Pearce, the University of Washington professor, doesn\u2019t remember reading about Securly, the surveillance software Seattle Public Schools uses, when she signed the district\u2019s responsible use form before her son received a school laptop.",
      "Even when families learn about school surveillance, they may be unable to opt out. Owasso Public Schools in Oklahoma has used Gaggle since 2016 to monitor students outside of class.",
      "For years, Tim Reiland, the parent of two teenagers, had no idea the district was using Gaggle. He found out only after asking if his daughter could bring her personal laptop to school instead of being forced to use a district one because of privacy concerns.",
      "The district refused Reiland\u2019s request.",
      "When Reiland's daughter, Zoe, found out about Gaggle, she says she felt so \u201cfreaked out\u201d that she stopped Googling anything personal on her Chromebook, even questions about her menstrual period. She didn\u2019t want to get called into the office for \u201csearching up lady parts.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was too scared to be curious,\u201d she said.",
      "School officials say they don\u2019t track metrics measuring the technology\u2019s efficacy but believe it has saved lives.",
      "Yet technology alone doesn\u2019t create a safe space for all students. In 2024, a nonbinary teenager at Owasso High School named Nex Benedict died by suicide after relentless bullying from classmates. A subsequent U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation found the district responded with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to some families\u2019 reports of sexual harassment, mainly in the form of homophobic bullying.",
      "During the 2023-24 school year, the Owasso schools received close to 1,000 Gaggle alerts, including 168 alerts for harassment and 281 for suicide.",
      "When asked why bullying remained a problem despite surveillance, Russell Thornton, the district\u2019s executive director of technology responded: \u201cThis is one tool used by administrators. Obviously, one tool is not going to solve the world\u2019s problems and bullying.\u201d",
      "Despite the risks, surveillance technology can help teachers intervene before a tragedy.",
      "A middle school student in the Seattle-area Highline School District who was potentially being trafficked used Gaggle to communicate with campus staff, said former Superintendent Susan Enfield.",
      "\u201cThey knew that the staff member was reading what they were writing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was, in essence, that student\u2019s way of asking for help.\u201d",
      "Still, developmental psychology research shows it is vital for teens to have private spaces online to explore their thoughts and seek support.",
      "\u201cThe idea that kids are constantly under surveillance by adults \u2014 I think that would make it hard to develop a private life, a space to make mistakes, a space to go through hard feelings without adults jumping in,\u201d said Boudreaux, the AI ethics researcher.",
      "Gaggle\u2019s Patterson says school-issued devices are not the appropriate place for unlimited self-exploration. If that exploration takes a dark turn, such as making a threat, \u201cthe school\u2019s going to be held liable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for that open free expression, it really can\u2019t happen on the school system\u2019s computers.\u201d",

      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry",
      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry. Many of the moves would affect landmark regulations aimed at protecting clean air and water.",
      "Industry generally applauded the proposed changes, while environmentalists worried about what would amount to historic rollbacks if they are approved. Here's a look at some of the 31 regulatory changes Zeldin announced:",
      "The Biden administration set limits on planet-warming emissions from existing gas and coal-fired power plants \u2013 a major step in the administration\u2019s effort to reduce greenhouse gases from the heavily polluting energy sector. Trump has long opposed such tough, climate-friendly limits and has instead promoted oil and gas development. Zeldin said the agency would reconsider the Biden administration standards to avoid constraining energy production.",
      "Coal plants emit toxic metals like mercury and the Biden administration issued a rule to severely limit those pollutants. Officials at the time said technology had progressed enough for these plants to do better. The EPA on Wednesday said nearly two dozen states had sued, arguing the rule was costly and a major burden, especially to coal plants. They also considering offering industry a two-year compliance extension while officials reconsider the rule.",
      "Hazardous metals like mercury and arsenic end up in the wastewater of steam-powered electric generating power plants like coal. These can have serious health effects including increasing cancer rates and lowering childhood IQ scores. The Biden administration tightened regulations of this wastewater. The EPA said it will revisit those \u201cstringent\u201d rules that are costly to industry and therefore may raise residential energy bills.",
      "Currently, treated wastewater generated from oil and gas drilling can be used in limited ways in certain western lands, such as for agriculture. Environmentalists say there can be a broad range of contaminants in the wastewater, some of which might not be known. The EPA said it will reconsider those rules and look at how the treated water could be used for other purposes like cooling data centers, fighting fires and other ecological needs. They say the current rules are costly, old and don\u2019t reflect the capabilities of modern treatment technologies.",
      "The Biden administration tightened safeguards against accidents for industrial and chemical plants that millions of people live near. The agency\u2019s risk management program added planning and reporting requirements for facilities and forced some to implement new safeguards. Accidents at these plants can be severe \u2013 a 2019 explosion at a Texas facility, for example, forced tens of thousands to evacuate, for example. Industry associations have criticized parts of the rule, such as requirements to publicly report sensitive information.",
      "Zeldin said Biden administration officials \u201cignored recommendations from national security experts on how their rule makes chemical and other sensitive facilities in America more vulnerable to attack.\u201d The EPA is reconsidering the rule.",
      "The EPA said it was reconsidering its mandatory greenhouse gas reporting program, which requires thousands of major industrial polluters to tell the agency about its emissions. Zeldin said the \u201cbureaucratic government program\u201d costs hundreds of millions of dollars and doesn\u2019t help air quality. Until now, the EPA said the data helped businesses compare their emissions to competitors and find opportunities to reduce them and lower costs.",
      "Zeldin vowed to review his agency\u2019s emissions standards for cars and trucks, calling the tightened emissions rules the \u201cfoundation for the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate.\u201d Nothing the Biden administration implemented required automakers to make and sell EVs or for consumers to buy them. Loosening standards would allow vehicles to emit more planet-warming greenhouse gases, but many automakers have already been investing in making their vehicles more efficient.",
      "The scientific finding, under the 2009 Clean Air Act, determined that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. It has been at the core of the nation\u2019s action against climate change. Trump had already directed the EPA to consider the finding\u2019s \u201clegality\u201d in an executive order. Experts say the impacts of climate change on human health and the environment are already clear, and that upending the finding would be devastating.",
      "This program enforced strict rules to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent and planet-warming greenhouse gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps and more. HFCs, as they are known, are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide and leak through equipment that uses compressed refrigerants. Dozens of countries around the globe have pledged to slash their use and production of the chemicals.",
      "This rule was intended to limit air pollution by restricting power plant smokestack emissions, and those from other industrial sites, across 11 states. Eliminating it would especially impact downwind neighborhoods that are burdened by pollution from ground-level ozone, or smog, that is out of their control. However, the Supreme Court had already put a hold on the rule last summer, ruling that states challenging it were likely to prevail.",
      "These seats have long been politicized given how influential they can be in setting national environmental policy. The board reviews \u201cthe quality and relevance of the scientific and technical information being used by the EPA or proposed as the basis for Agency regulations\u201d and agency research programs. Congress directed the agency to establish the board to provide the Administrator science advice in 1978. The committee can give \u201cindependent advice\u201d to the agency\u2019s Administrator specific to the nation\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Standards.",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities release particulate matter, or soot, that can easily pass through a person\u2019s lungs and into their bloodstream. Last year, the Biden administration tightened standards regulating soot in response to scientific research indicating existing regulations were insufficient. At the time, the EPA estimated its stronger regulations would save thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of cases of asthma and lost workdays annually. The Trump administration\u2019s EPA says these regulations are \u201ca major obstacle\u201d for companies and that the U.S. has low levels of soot.",
      "These EPA standards apply to pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects or other serious health problems. Industrial facilities are required to follow strict standards to monitor and limit the amount of these chemicals they release into the air. Last year, the EPA tightened standards surrounding ethylene oxide emissions, a human carcinogen commonly used as a sterilizer for medical equipment. The Trump administration said it is considering a \u201c2-year compliance exemption\u201d for facilities affected by these standards, among others.",
      "For decades, this EPA program has required states to reduce pollution that threatens scenic views in more than 150 national parks and wilderness areas, including in the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Zeldin said that the U.S. has made strides in improving visibility in national parks and that the program is being used as justification for shutting down industrial facilities and threatening affordable energy.",
      "The social cost of carbon is an EPA tool to weigh the economic costs and benefits of regulating polluting industries by putting a price tag on climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 set at $190 per ton under the Biden administration\u2019s EPA. That calculation is used in cost-benefit analyses, and was intended to account for greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 impacts including natural disasters, crop damage, health problems and sea-level rise. Under the first Trump administration, carbon was pegged at around $5 per ton. An executive order Trump signed on his first day in office directs the EPA to consider eliminating this calculation entirely to advance his \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d policy.",
      "After coal is burned, ash filled with heavy pollutants including arsenic, lead and mercury is left behind and typically stored in giant pits under federal regulation. The EPA says it is now seeking to rapidly put regulation \u201cmore fully into state hands,\u201d which environmental groups fear could lead to weaker standards. Last year, the Biden administration closed a gap that had allowed companies to avoid responsibility for cleaning up inactive coal ash pits \u2013 a policy that environmental groups say could now be repealed.",

      "Japanese automaker Nissan says its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results and its merger talks with Honda collapsed.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Nissan stock edged up slightly at the opening but soon slipped about 1% in early Wednesday trading in Tokyo, highlighting investors' skepticism over what was announced late the previous day.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles, meaning he's an insider perhaps less willing to take drastic action.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate their businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "Analysts said Nissan's future remains precarious, with little time left, but noted Nissan may need an outsider rather than an insider like Espinosa.",
      "Todd Duvick and Will Lee, auto analysts at CreditSights, believe the focus is still on a business turnaround, not the proposed integration with Honda.",
      "\u201cNot that a turnaround could not coexist with a Honda merger, but we view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d they said in a report.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010. Besides its proud legacy, Nissan also boasts solid engineering. It recently showed off its autonomous vehicle running on regular streets near its Yokohama headquarters.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled to Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Uchida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",

      "In less than a month, TikTok could have one or a few new owners, be banned again, or simply receive another reprieve to continue operating in the United States.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring its China-based parent company to divest or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, President Donald Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "As he returned to Washington from his Florida home on Sunday, Trump told reporters that a deal could come soon. He did not offer any details on the interested buyers, but said the administration was in talks with \u201cfour different groups\u201d about TikTok.",
      "\u201cA lot of people want it and it\u2019s up to me,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn't appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year's presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic advisor. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",
      "Trump has said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok. However, the administration hasn't provided details on what exactly that would entail, or what role the U.S. government could play in the future of the short-form video app.",
      "Some potential bidders have floated proposals that would allow the U.S. to invest or own a stake in the platform. Last month, Trump himself also said the U.S. could own part of TikTok through a new government-owned investment fund.",
      "Chinese officials, who would have to approve the deal, appear to have softened their stance on the issue compared to last year when Beijing called the push for divestment a \u201crobbers\u201d act.",

      "Explorers have discovered the sunken wreckage of one of the first steel cargo ships to travel the Great Lakes",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Twenty years before the Titanic changed maritime history, another ship touted as the next great technological feat set sail on the Great Lakes.",
      "The Western Reserve was one of the first all-steel cargo ships to traverse the lakes. Built to break speed records, the 300-foot (91.4-meter) freighter dubbed \u201cthe inland greyhound\u201d by newspapers was supposed to be one of the safest ships afloat. Owner Peter Minch was so proud of her that he brought his wife and young children aboard for a summer joyride in August 1892.",
      "Then tragedy struck. As the ship entered Lake Superior's Whitefish Bay between Michigan and Canada on Aug. 30, a gale came up. With no cargo aboard, the ship was light and floating high in the water. The storm battered it until it cracked in half. Twenty-seven people perished that night, including the Minch family. The only survivor was wheelsman Harry W. Stewart, who swam a mile (1.6 kilometers) to shore after his lifeboat capsized.",
      "For almost 132 years the lake hid the wreckage. In July, explorers from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society pinpointed the Western Reserve off Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The society announced the discovery Saturday at the annual Ghost Ships Festival in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Executive Director Bruce Lynn called the discovery one of the society's most significant finds.",
      "\u201cThere's a number of concurrent stories that make this important,\u201d Lynn said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMost ships were still wooden. It was a technologically advanced ship. They were kind of a famous family at the time. You have this new ship, considered one of the safest on the lake, new tech, a big, big ship. (The discovery) is another way for us to keep this history alive.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel, the society's marine operations director, and his brother, Dan Ertel, spent more than two years looking for the Western Reserve.",
      "Lynn said this winter the brothers outlined a search grid. On July 22 they set out on the David Boyd, the society's research vessel. Heavy ship traffic that day forced them to alter their course, though, and search an area adjacent to their original grid, Lynn said.",
      "The brothers towed a side-scanning sonar array behind their ship. Side sonar scans to starboard and port, providing a more expansive picture of the bottom than traditional sonar mounted beneath a ship. About 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Whitefish Point on the Upper Peninsula, they picked up a line with a shadow behind it in 600 feet of water. They dialed up the resolution and spotted a ship broken in two with the bow resting on the stern. Each section was 150 feet (45.2 meters) long, suggesting they'd found the Western Reserve.",
      "Eight days later, the brothers returned to the site along with Lynn. They deployed a submersible drone equipped with high-intensity lighting and a high-resolution camera. The drone returned clear images of a portside running light that match the Western Reserve's starboard running light, which had washed ashore in Canada after the ship went down. That light was the only artifact recovered from the ship.",
      "\u201cThat was confirmation day,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cIt's pretty exciting.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel said that discovery gave him chills \u2014 and not in a good way. \u201cKnowing how the 300-foot Western Reserve was caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" he said in a society news release. \"A squall can come up unexpectedly\u2026anywhere, and anytime.\u201d",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that went down in a November 1975 storm that was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" sank off Whitefish Point within 100 miles of the Western Reserve. There were no survivors."

    "story": [
      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When artificial intelligence-backed tractors became available to vineyards, Tom Gamble wanted to be an early adopter. He knew there would be a learning curve, but Gamble decided the technology was worth figuring out.",
      "The third-generation farmer bought one autonomous tractor. He plans on deploying its self-driving feature this spring and is currently using the tractor's AI sensor to map his Napa Valley vineyard. As it learns each row, the tractor will know where to go once it is used autonomously. The AI within the machine will then process the data it collects and help Gamble make better-informed decisions about his crops \u2014 what he calls \u201cprecision farming.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to completely replace the human element of putting your boot into the vineyard, and that\u2019s one of my favorite things to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be able to allow you to work more smartly, more intelligently and in the end, make better decisions under less fatigue.\u201d",
      "Gamble said he anticipates using the tech as much as possible because of \u201ceconomic, air quality and regulatory imperatives.\u201d Autonomous tractors, he said, could help lower his fuel use and cut back on pollution.",
      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce. New agricultural tech like AI can help farmers to cut back on waste, and to run more efficient and sustainable vineyards by monitoring water use and helping determine when and where to use products like fertilizers or pest control. AI-backed tractors and irrigation systems, farmer say, can minimize water use by analyzing soil or vines, while also helping farmers to manage acres of vineyards by providing more accurate data on the health of a crop or what a season\u2019s yield will be.",
      "Other facets of the wine industry have also started adopting the tech, from using generative AI to create custom wine labels to turning to ChatGPT to develop, label and price an entire bottle.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anybody losing their job, because I think that a tractor operator\u2019s skills are going to increase and as a result, and maybe they\u2019re overseeing a small fleet of these machines that are out there, and they\u2019ll be compensated as a result of their increased skill level,\u201d he said.",
      "Farmers, Gamble said, are always evolving. There were fears when the tractor replaced horses and mules pulling plows, but that technology \u201cproved itself\u201d just like AI farming tech will, he said, adding that adopting any new tech always takes time.",
      "Companies like John Deere have started using the AI that wine farmers are beginning to adopt. The agricultural giant uses \u201cSmart Apply\u201d technology on tractors, for example, helping growers apply material for crop retention by using sensors and algorithms to sense foliage on grape canopies, said Sean Sundberg, business integration manager at John Deere.",
      "The tractors that use that tech then only spray \u201cwhere there are grapes or leaves or whatnot so that it doesn\u2019t spray material unnecessarily,\u201d he said. Last year, the company announced a project with Sonoma County Winegrowers to use tech to help wine grape growers maximize their yield.",
      "Tyler Klick, partner at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management, said his company has started automating irrigation valves at the vineyards it helps manage. The valves send an alert in the event of a leak and will automatically shut off if they notice an \u201cexcessive\u201d water flow rate.",
      "\u201cThat valve is actually starting to learn typical water use,\u201d Klick said. \u201cIt\u2019ll learn how much water is used before the production starts to fall off.\u201d",
      "Klick said each valve costs roughly $600, plus $150 per acre each year to subscribe to the service.",
      "\u201cOur job, viticulture, is to adjust our operations to the climatic conditions we\u2019re dealt,\u201d Klick said. \u201cI can see AI helping us with finite conditions.\u201d",
      "Angelo A. Camillo, a professor of wine business at Sonoma State University, said that despite excitement over AI in the wine industry, some smaller vineyards are more skeptical about their ability to use the technology. Small, family-owned operations, which Camillo said account for about 80% of the wine business in America, are slowly disappearing \u2014 many don\u2019t have the money to invest in AI, he said. A robotic arm that helps put together pallets of wine, for example, can cost as much as $150,000, he said.",
      "\u201cFor small wineries, there\u2019s a question mark, which is the investment. Then there\u2019s the education. Who\u2019s going to work with all of these AI applications? Where is the training?\u201d he said.",
      "There are also potential challenges with scalability, Camillo added. Drones, for example, could be useful for smaller vineyards that could use AI to target specific crops that have a bug problem, he said \u2014 it would be much harder to operate 100 drones in a 1,000 acre vineyard while also employing the IT workers who understand the tech.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think a person can manage 40 drones as a swarm of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a constraint for the operators to adopt certain things.\u201d",
      "However, AI is particularly good at tracking a crop\u2019s health \u2013 including how the plant itself is doing and whether it\u2019s growing enough leaves \u2013 while also monitoring grapes to aid in yield projections, said Mason Earles, an assistant professor who leads the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab at UC Davis.",
      "Diseases or viruses can sneak up and destroy entire vineyards, Earles said, calling it an \u201celephant in the room\u201d across the wine industry. The process of replanting a vineyard and getting it to produce well takes at least five years, he said. AI can help growers determine which virus is affecting their plants, he said, and whether they should rip out some crops immediately to avoid losing their entire vineyard.",
      "Earles, who is also cofounder of the AI-powered farm management platform Scout, said his company uses AI to process thousands of images in hours and extract data quickly \u2014 something that would be difficult by hand in large vineyards that span hundreds of acres. Scout's AI platform then counts and measures the number of grape clusters as early as when a plant is beginning to flower in order to forecast what a yield will be.",
      "The sooner vintners know how much yield to expect, the better they can \u201cdial in\u201d their wine making process, he added.",
      "\u201cPredicting what yields you\u2019re going to have at the end of the season, no one is that good at it right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really important because it determines how much labor contract you\u2019re going to need and the supplies you\u2019ll need for making wine.\u201d",
      "Earles doesn\u2019t think the budding use of AI in vineyards is \u201cfreaking farmers out.\u201d Rather, he anticipates that AI will be used more frequently to help with difficult field labor and to discern problems in vineyards that farmers need help with.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen people trying to sell them tech for decades. It\u2019s hard to farm; it\u2019s unpredictable compared to most other jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe walking and counting, I think people would have said a long time ago, \u2018I would happily let a machine take over.\u2019\u201d",

      "The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant\u2019s radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday",
      "OKUMA, Japan -- The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes.",
      "It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection \u2014 full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.",
      "As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.",
      "The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.",
      "A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor.",
      "That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.",
      "Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.",
      "A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks.",
      "Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2.",
      "Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.",
      "In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.",
      "\u201cWorking under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,\" said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. \"It was a difficult assignment.\u201d",
      "Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.",
      "To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.",
      "The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order.",
      "A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.",
      "The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit.",
      "Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers.",
      "In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems.",
      "Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.",
      "On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.",
      "At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel.",
      "To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant.",
      "Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris.",
      "After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor.",
      "Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided.",
      "Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home.",
      "\u201cAs a Fukushima citizen, I would like to make sure the decommissioning work is done properly so that people can return home without worries,\u201d he said."

      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers urge the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests in coming decades",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday urged the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests as part of efforts to stop the birds from crowding out a smaller type of owl that's facing potential extinction.",
      "The 19 lawmakers \u2014 led by Republican Rep. Troy Nehls, a Texas conservative, and Democrat Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California liberal \u2014 claimed the killings would be \u201cgrossly expensive\u201d and cost $3,000 per bird.",
      "They questioned if the shootings would help native populations of northern spotted owls, which have long been controversial because of logging restrictions in the birds' forest habitat beginning in the 1990s, and the closely related California spotted owl.",
      "Barred owls are native to eastern North America and started appearing in the Pacific Northwest in the 1970s. They\u2019ve quickly displaced many spotted owls, which are smaller birds that need larger territories to breed.",
      "An estimated 100,000 barred owls now live within a range that contains only about 7,100 spotted owls, according to federal officials.",
      "Under a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan approved last year, trained shooters would target barred owls over 30 years across a maximum of about 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometers) in California, Oregon and Washington.",
      "The plan did not include a cost estimate. But the lawmakers said in a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that it could top $1.3 billion based on extrapolating costs from a grant awarded to the the Hoopa Valley Native American Tribe in California to kill up to 1,500 barred owls.",
      "\u201cThis is an inappropriate and inefficient use of U.S. taxpayer dollars,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \"This latest plan is an example of our federal government attempting to supersede nature and control environmental outcomes at great cost.\u201d",
      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about the cost estimate and the owl removal program. The agency's plan called for more than 2,400 barred owls to be removed this year and for that number to ramp up to more than 15,500 birds annually beginning in 2027.",
      "Scientists for years have been shooting barred owls on an experimental basis and officials say the results show the strategy could halt spotted owl declines. As of last year, about 4,500 barred owls were killed on the West Coast by researchers since 2009.",
      "Killing one bird species to save others has divided wildlife advocates and is reminiscent of past government efforts to save West Coast salmon by killing sea lions and cormorants. Or when, to preserve warblers, cowbirds that lay eggs in warbler nests were killed. The barred owl removals would be among the largest such effort to date involving birds of prey, researchers and wildlife advocates said.",
      "Barred owls arrived in the Pacific Northwest via the Great Plains, where trees planted by settlers gave them a foothold, or via Canada\u2019s boreal forests, which have become warmer and more hospitable as the climate changes, researchers said.",
      "Their spread has undermined decades of spotted owl restoration efforts that previously focused on protecting forests where they live. That included logging restrictions under former President Bill Clinton that ignited bitter political fights and temporarily helped slow the spotted owl\u2019s decline.",

    "summary": "A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting any noncitizens pursuant to the president's recent proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act.",
    "story": [
      "Judge James Boasberg ordered the government to turn around deportation flights.",
      "A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deporting any noncitizens pursuant to the president's recent proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Less than two hours after President Donald Trump attempted to invoke the 18th century law to deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order that blocks the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens currently in custody pursuant to the president's recent proclamation.",
      "\"Flights are actively departing and plan to depart. I do not believe that I am able to wait any longer,\" Boasberg said.",
      "He also ordered the Trump administration to immediately turn around two planes carrying noncitizens if they are covered by his order, including one that potentially took off during a break in the court's hearing.",
      "\"You shall inform your clients of this immediately any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States,\" he said. \"However that's accomplished, turning around the plane, or not embarking anyone on the plane\u2026this is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.\"",
      "Finding the deportations would cause irreparable harm, Boasberg barred the Trump administration from deporting \"all non-citizens who are subject to the AEA proclamation\" for at least 14 days. ICE will continue to keep the noncitizens in their custody while the lawsuit makes its way through the courts.",
      "\"I think there's clearly irreparable harm here given that these folks will be deported and many \u2013 or the vast majority \u2013 to prison or back to Venezuela where they face persecution or worse,\" he said.",
      "Before Judge Boasberg issued his order, a lawyer with the DOJ had declined to say whether any deportations were ongoing, arguing disclosing \"operational details\" would raise \"potential national security issues.\" He later acknowledged that two flights -- one to El Salvador and another to Honduras -- had already departed.",
      "Boasberg also raised concerns that the Venezuelans would be sent to a prison in El Salvador, rather than their home country.",
      "\"No only are they going to be deported, but it's not going to be to friendly countryside but to prison,\" Judge Boasberg said.",
      "Following the judge's decision, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a statement criticizing the judge who, she said, \"supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans. TdA is represented by the ACLU. This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump\u2019s power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk.\"",
      "The ACLU is representing five plaintiffs it believes have been moved to detention centers in Texas intended to be \"staging facilities to remove Venezuelan men under the AEA,\" court documents show. Four of the five plaintiffs have been accused of being members of Tren de Aragua.",
      "The ACLU claims they have been wrongfully accused of being gang members, some seemingly only based on their tattoos, despite the fact that some are seeking protection in the United States from the same gang they're now accused of being a part of.",
      "The hearing Saturday came as the Trump administration claimed that the president's Article II powers give him the authority to unilaterally deport any person who poses a \"significant threat\" to the United States. DOJ lawyers argued that the temporary restraining order would pose an \"irreparable harm\" to Trump's authority.",
      "Earlier in the day, Boasberg temporarily blocked the deportation of five noncitizens and said he was considering extending his temporary restraining order to cover a broader class of noncitizens.",
      "Lawyers with the ACLU alleged that the Trump administration was actively deporting \"hundreds\" of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvadoran prisons.",
      "\"Our understanding from people on the ground from different sources is that planes are going right now taking Venezuelans to El Salvador and maybe ending up in El Salvador in prison,\" said ACLU's Lee Gelernt. \"Not only will that divest this court of jurisdiction, but I think those people are in real trouble.\"",
      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to enter an administrative stay of Boasberg's temporary restraining order.",
      "\"This Court should halt this massive, unauthorized imposition on the Executive's authority to remove dangerous aliens who pose threats to the American people,\" they said in the filing.",
      "The government argued that Boasberg overstepped his authority, declined to hear a response from the Trump administration before ruling and is \"setting the stage to potentially inject itself into all such removals nationwide.\"",
      "Boasberg previously oversaw the United States Alien Terrorist Removal Court and was nominated to federal judicial roles by both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.",
      "The AEA states that it can only be invoked when there is a war with or an invasion by a foreign government or nation. It allows the president to order all citizens of that foreign nation who are not naturalized in the U.S. to be arrested and removed \"as alien enemies.\"",
      "In essence, members of that hostile nation could be swiftly removed from the country with little to no due process.",
      "The ACLU argues that the government would be illegally invoking the act to target alleged members of Tren de Aragua because the gang is not a nation and there is no invasion as outlined by U.S. law.",
      "\"The Trump administration's intent to use a wartime authority for immigration enforcement is as unprecedented as it is lawless. It may be the administration's most extreme measure yet, and that is saying a lot,\" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project and lead counsel.",
      "The Department of Defense is not expected to have a role in the invoking of the authority, which could be used to deport some migrants without a hearing.",
      "There have been discussions inside the administration about invoking the act, multiple sources said.",
      "Trump had previously said on the campaign trail that he planned to invoke the act.",
      "The act hasn't been used since World War II when it was used to detain Japanese Americans.",
      "During World War II, the Alien Enemies Act was partially used to justify the internment of Japanese immigrants who had not become U.S. citizens. The broader internment of Japanese-Americans was carried out under executive orders signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and not the Alien Enemies Act since the law does not apply to U.S. citizens.",

      "The strikes differ from the Biden administration's, Waltz told \"This Week.\"",
      "The U.S. airstrikes that bombarded Yemen on Saturday targeted and \"took out\" multiple leaders of the Iranian-backed Houthis, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Sunday.",
      "Speaking on ABC's \"This Week,\" Waltz argued to co-anchor Martha Raddatz that these latest strikes differ from the countless strikes the Biden administration launched against the rebel group, which the Trump administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "\"These were not kind of pinprick, back and forth -- what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,\" Waltz said. \"This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible.\"",
      "Waltz accused Iran of helping the Houthis attack U.S. warships and global commerce. Some 70% of global commerce is now diverting around South Africa to avoid the Houthis, resulting in higher shipping costs and supply chain issues, Waltz said.",
      "\"President Trump has found it unacceptable. What we inherited was -- was a terrible situation, and this is one of what will be a sustained effort to right that wrong and to reopen global commerce,\" Waltz said.",
      "A source told ABC News Saturday that the strikes are not expected to be a single day event. On social media, President Donald Trump warned the Houthis that if their attacks do not stop, \"HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!\"",
      "Trump also issued a warning to Iran, calling on the Islamic Republic to stop supporting the Houthis, and adding: \"Do NOT threaten the American People, their President... or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won\u2019t be nice about it!\"",
      "Here are highlights from Waltz's interview:",
      "On the potential for U.S. military action against Iran",
      "\"Well, all actions are always on the table with the president. But Iran needs to hear him loud and clear. It is completely unacceptable and it will be stopped. The level of support that they\u2019ve been providing the Houthis, just like they have Hezbollah, just like they have the militias in Iraq, Hamas and others. The difference here is the Houthis have incredibly sophisticated air defenses, and they also have anti-shipping cruise missiles, drones, sea skimming types of attack drones and other ballistic missiles even. They\u2019ve launched dozens of attacks on multiple war ships, dozens of attacks, over 175 on global commerce, sank multiple ships. ... We will hold not only the Houthis accountable, but we\u2019re going to hold Iran, their backers, accountable as well. And if that means they\u2019re targeting ships that they have put in to -- to help their Iranian trainers, IRGC and others, that intelligence, other things that they have put in to help the Houthis attack the global economy, those -- those targets will be on the table, too.\"",
      "On Trump urging Iran to engage in nuclear talks",
      "\"What the president has completely -- has repeatedly said is that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. All options are on the table to ensure it does not have one. And that\u2019s all aspects of Iran's program. That\u2019s the missiles, the weaponization, the enrichment. They can either hand it over and give it up in a way that is verifiable, or they can face a whole series of other consequences. But, either way, we cannot have a world with the ayatollahs with their finger on the nuclear button. We cannot have a situation that would result in an arms race across the Middle East in terms of nuclear proliferation. ... Iran has been offered a way out of this to make sure that we don\u2019t have a world that can be threatened by a radical regime, not only our ally Israel, but the entire world that would be threated with a \u2013 with \u2013 by a radical regime that could destroy, not only Israel, but its neighbors, and have the capability to hit the United States.\"",
      "On efforts to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine",
      "\"A fundamental aspect of the approach here from President Trump is that, you know, this has to be permanent. That\u2019s what we continue to hear from the Ukrainians, that, you know, we cannot have a situation where this continues to break down. At the same time, we are engaging with the Russians. What we heard from President Putin was that he will absolutely consider a ceasefire. There are some other thing that he would like to see that President Trump\u2019s national security team has -- is considering over the coming days. So, this back and forth diplomacy is -- is ongoing.\"",
      "On whether Ukraine will have to cede territory to Russia",
      "\"We have to ask ourselves, is it in our national interest? Is it realistic? We\u2019ve talked to the Europeans about this, and the Ukrainians. Are we going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea? And what the strategy of the Biden administration was, was, as long as it takes, as much as it takes, no matter what the timeline is, which is essentially endless warfare, in an environment that we are literally losing hundreds of thousands of people in a matter of months. And could escalate into World War III. ... We can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong. And we also have to talk about the reality of the situation on the ground. And that\u2019s what we are doing through diplomacy, through shuttle diplomacy, through proximity talks.\"",

      "Education is a local level-issue already as the federal education department only administers roughly 10% of public school funds nationwide, according to multiple education experts.",
      "The Department of Education does not administer curriculum or create lessons for the nation's students. It also does not set requirements for enrollment and graduation or establish or accredit schools or universities.",
      "In fact, curriculum comes from the states and local school districts. The education department doesn't teach the students taking standardized exams and assessments. The states already do that.",
      "The education department does hold schools accountable for enforcing non-discrimination laws based on race, gender and disability.",
      "The agency also administers funds for K-12 education support programs such as the Rural Education Achievement Program, which supports rural districts that may lack personnel and resources; Title I, which funds programs aimed at improving the performance of low-income and low-achieving schools; and grants for Individuals with Disabilities including the Transition and Postsecondary Programs for students.",
      "Not only does the department administer K-12 assistance, it also helps students pursue higher education through the office of Federal Student Aid through grants, work-study funds and low-interest loans.",
      "Finally, the DOE holds schools accountable for student achievement through the Every Student Succeeds Act, which requires each state to provide data on subject performance, graduation rates, suspensions, absenteeism, teacher qualifications and more.",
      "The Education Department's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access, according to ed.gov.",
      "Trump has claimed, without evidence, that many Department of Education employees weren't going to work or doing a good job.",
      "\"Many of them don't work at all. Many of them never showed up to work. Many of them, many of them never showed up to work,\" Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.",
      "The White House did not respond to ABC News' request for comment about where Trump got this information.",
      "Based on dozens of interviews, ABC News reporting has not found any evidence of employees \"never\" showing up to work, as Trump claimed.",
      "ABC News has spoken to employees tasked with everything from conducting critical research projects to enforcing anti-discrimination laws for students based on race, gender and disability, among other characteristics.",
      "When the Department of Education cut nearly 50% of its workforce earlier this week, an email to those who remained employed said, \"Please know that these decisions were not made lightly, and in no way reflect on the dedication and hard work of those who are leaving.\"",
      "Joe Murphy, whose position as a management and data analyst was eliminated at the Department of Education earlier this week, said on Wednesday that he felt \"disposable.\"",
      "\"We got the sense that we were disposable in a certain sense, especially those of us in the data space,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Victoria DeLano was an Equal Opportunity Specialist in the education department's Office for Civil Rights serving people with disabilities. DeLano said she believes she was the sole employee within the OCR who was stationed in Alabama.",
      "\"It's horrifying that the Office for Civil Rights, to begin with, is understaffed, but then, when I was locked out of access to work last week, to think, OK, one more person that was taken out of the equation,\" Delano said.",
      "\"These students have no one else. They can still file complaints with OCR. Please understand OCR is understaffed at best, and OCR right now does not have external communication with you all. So I don't know where they turn,\" she added.",
      "A regional Department of Education employee, who received the reduction in force email on Tuesday and spoke to ABC News on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said their civil rights office was abolished.",
      "Offices in major cities including San Francisco, New York, Cleveland, Boston, Chicago and Dallas have shuttered, and the three U.S. Department of Education buildings in D.C. will eventually be consolidated, according to senior department of education officials.",
      "\"All those disabled kids, which is the bulk of our docket, will not be helped,\" the employee said.",

    "story": [
      "In a test vote, the Senate voted 62 to 38 to advance the bill.",
      "The Senate passed a House-approved government funding bill that averts a government shutdown that was set to be triggered at the end of the day Friday.",
      "The Senate voted 54 to 46 to pass the bill. The approval of the bill follows several Democrats voting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to keep the funding bill moving forward despite blowback from other members of their party.",
      "Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen voted in favor of the bill. All other Democrats voted against it.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was on the only Republican to cast a vote against the bill.",
      "Earlier, 10 Senate Democrats provided the necessary votes to allow a test vote to advance. Democrats voted with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to keep the funding bill moving forward, despite blowback from other members of their party.",
      "\"I know a lot of members didn't like the CR -- the government shutdown would be far worse. A government shutdown gives Donald Trump, Elon Musk and DOGE almost complete power \u2026 to close down because they can decide what is an essential service,\" Schumer said on CNN between the votes.",
      "\"My job as leader is to lead the party,\" he added. \"And if there's going to be danger in the near future to protect the party. And I'm proud I did it.\"",
      "The vote comes after Schumer took to the Senate floor Friday morning to defend his decision to support the Republican short-term funding bill -- a move that has drawn criticism from other Democrats.",
      "His surprise reversal, first announced Thursday evening -- a day after he said he and Democrats would try to block the bill -- means there will almost certainly be enough Democratic votes to advance the measure to a final Senate vote Friday just hours before the shutdown deadline.",
      "\"As everyone knows, government funding expires at midnight tonight. As I announced yesterday, I will vote to keep the government open. I believe it is the best way to minimize the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people,\" Schumer said Friday.",
      "He said he believes the short-term funding bill -- or continuing resolution -- is a \"bad bill\" but said he believes if the government were to shut down, it would be a far worse outcome for the country.",
      "\"The CR is a bad bill. But as bad as the CR is, I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,\" Schumer said.",
      "Schumer said he believed a government shutdown would mean President Donald Trump and Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would have even more authority to \"destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.\"",
      "He said they would also have the power to determine which federal employees are considered essential -- potentially giving them more power to lay off or fire more government workers and shutter federal agencies.",
      "\"A shutdown would allow DOGE to shift into overdrive. Let me repeat, a shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive. It would give Donald Trump and DOGE the keys to the city, state and country,\" he said. \"Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate than they can right now and over a much broader field of destruction that they would render.\"",
      "He continued, \"In a shutdown, Donald Trump and DOGE will have the power to determine what is considered essential and what is not and their views on what is not essential would be mean and vicious and would decimate vital services and cause unimaginable harm to the American people.\"",
      "\"Musk has told everybody he wants a shutdown because he knows it will help him achieve his horrible goal of just decimating the federal government from one end to the other. In other words, if government were to shut down, DOGE has a plan in place to exploit the crisis for maximum destruction,\" Schumer said.",
      "\"A shutdown would be the best distraction Donald Trump could ask for,\" he added.",
      "Schumer also defended some of his Senate Democratic colleagues who have come out opposed to the short-term funding bill. He acknowledged the tough decisions they as a caucus had to weigh.",
      "\"Our caucus members have been torn between two awful alternatives, and my colleagues and I have wrestled with which alternative would be worse for the American people,\" Schumer said.",
      "Trump praised Schumer in a post on his social media platform on Friday, saying it took \"guts\" for the New York senator to signal his support for the GOP bill.",
      "\"Congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing -- Took \"guts\" and courage! The big Tax Cuts, L.A. fire fix, Debt Ceiling Bill, and so much more, is coming,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.",
      "\"We should all work together on that very dangerous situation. A non pass would be a Country destroyer, approval will lead us to new heights. Again, really good and smart move by Senator Schumer. This could lead to something big for the USA, a whole new direction and beginning,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Two separate letters were sent to Schumer on Friday, urging senators to reject the GOP continuing resolution -- one from freshman California Rep. Derek Tran and the second from Ranking Member of House Appropriations Committee Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.",
      "Tran's letter, which has 66 signatures so far and is addressed directly to Schumer, states that \"as members of the House Democratic Caucus, we write to express our strong opposition to the passage of a partisan continuing resolution that potentially legitimizes President Trump and the Republican party's dismantling of government.\"",
      "\"We urge you to reject the partisan continuing resolution coming before the Senate and stand with the American people in opposing these draconian Republican cuts. All parties must come back to the negotiating table and work across party lines to keep the government open in a responsible way,\" the lawmakers wrote.",
      "DeLauro's letter, which came from Democratic lawmakers on the Appropriations Committee, echoed similar sentiments.",
      "\"As members of the House Committee on Appropriations, we urge our Democratic colleagues in the Senate to reject the partisan and harmful continuing resolution that will only serve to enable President Trump, Elon Musk, and the Republican Party's ongoing efforts to unilaterally and unlawfully destroy the agencies and programs that serve the American people,\" the appropriators said.",
      "\"We urge all Senate Democrats to stand with House Democrats and with the American people, reject this continuing resolution,\" they added.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump is set to visit the Justice Department on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "He said his predecessors had turned it into the \"Department of Injustice.\"",
      "President Donald Trump visited the Justice Department on Friday -- a move that comes as he has sought to assert control over the nation's top law enforcement agency that brought two historic prosecutions against him, which were thwarted by his 2024 election victory.",
      "\"As we begin a proud new chapter in the chronicles of America, justice is really is something we're turning the page on for a long years of corruption, weaponization and surrender to violent criminals,\" Trump said to the crowd. \"And we are restoring fair, equal and impartial justice under the Constitution or rule of law. And you're the people that are doing it.",
      "\"Under the Trump administration, the DOJ and the FBI will once again become the premier crime fighting agencies on the face of the earth,\" he added.",
      "He used the setting to repeat his now-familiar accusation that the Justice Department was \"weaponized\" to attack him.",
      "\"We must be honest about the lies and abuses that have occurred within these walls. Unfortunately, in recent years, a corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government obliterated that trust and goodwill built up over generations,\" he said. \"They weaponized the vast powers of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to try and thwart the will of the American people.\"",
      "\"Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the Department of Injustice,\" continued Trump, who became a convicted felon in May 2024 after he was found guilty on 34 felony counts in New York. \"But I stand before you today to declare that those days are over, and they are never going to come back. They're never coming back. So now, as the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.\"",
      "The rare visit marks Trump's first time inside the walls of the Robert F. Kennedy building as president, and as such his first since crowds of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 and were subsequently charged by the DOJ, and follows nearly a decade's worth of conflict that have proven to be the ultimate stress test for the Justice Department's post-Watergate norms intended to preserve independence from the White House.",
      "Trump himself faced four criminal court cases, but all remaining charges were dropped when he was elected president -- but not because the cases lacked merits -- allowing him to avoid serious consequences. The president denied all the allegations and said the cases were politically motivated.",
      "The opening weeks of Trump's presidency have been a time of unprecedented upheaval for the DOJ, as Trump's political leadership immediately moved to reassign or oust career officials who served in senior criminal and national security roles across multiple administrations.",
      "Dozens of prosecutors who worked on investigations stemming from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol were fired, as well as DOJ and FBI officials who worked on former special counsel Jack Smith's investigations of Trump.",
      "An effort by the department to drop its criminal corruption case against New York City Mayor Adams resulted in a dramatic standoff leading to multiple resignations by prosecutors and other top officials who described the arrangement as a clear \"quid pro quo\" to secure Adams' cooperation with the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "However, in the very same speech in which the president griped about his own prosecutions, he suggested that his predecessor should be jailed for the way his administration handled the Afghanistan withdrawal.",
      "\"What a shame. The way we got out, I think it was the most humiliating time in the history of our country,\" he said. \"The way it happened. Not that we were getting out because we wanted to get out, but we would have gotten out with dignity and strength. And what a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country, when you think about it. And the people who did this to us should go to jail, they should go to jail. So, I just want to say, God bless America because we have to say God bless. We're lucky we're still here.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt previewed Trump's remarks on Fox News, saying that it will be focused on \"restoring law and order,\" but she added that he might also discuss \"ending the weaponization of justice.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump will go to the Department of Justice to visit with Attorney General Pam Bondi and Kash Patel to give a speech not just to the Department of Justice but to the American people about Donald Trump's intention to restore a justice department that is truly focused on fighting crime and restoring law and order in American communities,\" Leavitt said on Fox News.",
      "She also previewed the remarks when asked by reporters at the White House on Friday morning, saying that Trump will be joined by families who have lost children \"at the hands of illegal migrant criminals\" and because of \"illegal Chinese fentanyl.\"",
      "In remarks Thursday to reporters at the White House, Trump said his speech a thet DOJ would \"set out\" his \"vision\" for the department through the rest of his tenure.",
      "\"I think we have unbelievable people, and all I'm going to do is set out my vision. It's going to be their vision, really, but it's my ideas,\" he said. \"We want to have justice, and we want to have -- we want to have safety in our cities as well as our communities. And we'll be talking about immigration. We'll be talking about a lot of things.\"",
      "Nearly every top appointee for the department previously represented Trump as a defense attorney in either an official or personal capacity, a reflection of Trump's expectation for loyalty from a department that he has said he believes stymied his first term and was later \"weaponized\" against him after leaving office.",
      "While Attorney General Pam Bondi told senators in her confirmation hearing she would \"not politicize\" her office, her opening weeks, critics argue, have been marked with politically charged statements repeatedly emphasizing her loyalty to Trump.",
      "\"I've never seen this before, and we all adore Donald Trump and we want to protect him and fight for his agenda,\" Bondi said in an interview with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump.",
      "In another interview early this month, Bondi said she was still working to \"root out\" officials at the department who she said \"despise Donald Trump.\"",
      "In one of her first directives following her confirmation, Bondi ordered DOJ officials to \"zealously defend\" the interests of the presidency and threatened discipline or termination for any attorney who refused to sign onto legal arguments put forward by political leadership.",
      "\"When Department of Justice attorneys, for example, refuse to advance good-faith arguments by declining to appear in court or sign briefs, it undermines the constitutional order and deprives the President of the benefit of his lawyers,\" the directive stated.",
      "Trump's visit to DOJ is his first to any government agency since taking office, though it's not without precedent. The last visit by a sitting American president to the building was when former President Barack Obama attended a departure ceremony in 2015 for Eric Holder -- for a retirement ceremony honoring his time as attorney general.",

      "\"Mahmoud was moved across multiple state lines and subsequently transferred to a remote prison in Louisiana hours after filing his habeas petition, an intentional and retaliatory act and an attempt to interfere with the jurisdiction of the New York court,\" Sisay said.",
      "In the weeks leading up to his arrest, Khalil said he had been fearing for his safety as he and other Columbia University students advocating for the rights of Palestinians experienced increased doxing and harassment, his attorneys said.",
      "\"It's like an almost daily occurrence where Twitter, social media posts showing photographs of students, identifying where they're located, where they live, who they're associated with, while tagging ICE, while tagging DHS, while tagging the president, tagging the Secretary of State,\" Amy Greer, an attorney with Dratel & Lewis who is representing Khalil, said Friday.",
      "\"He's genuinely fearful that what's happened to him will happen to others,\" Greer said.",
      "Khalil's attorneys accused the Trump administration of retaliating against Khalil for his protests and activism in support of Palestinians arguing his speech is protected by the First Amendment.",
      "\"The Trump administration is taking an extraordinarily broad and unconstitutional view of how the material support for terrorism laws apply in these contexts,\" Brian Hauss, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, said at the press conference.",
      "\"The Supreme Court was very clear in a case called Holder vs Humanitarian Law Project that the federal material supported terrorism laws do not apply to independent advocacy, even when that advocacy is explicitly supportive of a foreign designated terrorist organization, say a statement saying, 'I support Hamas,' if that statement is not coordinated with a foreign designated terrorist organization it is protected by the First Amendment,\" Hauss said.",

      "\"Trump administration is punishing Mr. Khalil for his speech about Palestine. It is silencing him, and it is setting him up as an example to chill the millions of green card holders and other non-citizens around the country from saying anything that might draw President Trump's ire.

      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, faced a confirmation hearing Friday before the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "Oz, a doctor and former television host whose nomination to lead CMS has put him in the political spotlight for the first time since his unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat three years ago, faced tough questions from Democrats on the 27-member committee, which will vote whether to move his nomination to a floor vote in front of the entire Senate.",
      "Oz talked about his accomplishments as a physician and TV host during his opening statement, noting the 10 Emmys his show won, and contended Trump \"wants to love and cherish Medicare and Medicaid.\"",
      "\"We have a generational opportunity to fix our health care system and help people stay healthy for longer,\" he said Friday.",
      "Oz said his main goals as the head of CMS deal with more transparency and eliminating waste, echoing Trump's goals.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking member on the committee, however, slammed Oz during his introduction, calling him out over his past comments and actions. Wyden, D-Ore., noted Oz has had a history of promoting Medicare Advantage companies and baseless wellness remedies and claimed if confirmed the nominee would \"coddle the for profit insurance companies.\"",
      "\"Dr. Oz will be calling the shots of what gets cuts, or what stays,\" he said.",

      "Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., later asked, \"How many children losing health insurance would be acceptable to you?\"",
      "\"I don't want children to lose health insurance,\" Oz said.",
      "\"Well, then, you're going to need to reject the Republican budget,\" Hassan responded.",

      "A study Oz cited at the time was later retracted, and an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission found the data behind the product was \"deeply flawed.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in particular, has been increasingly vocal ahead of the hearing about Oz's financial ties to health care companies that he will now oversee in his role at CMS and his past comments about privatizing Medicare, one of the programs he'll manage.",
      "She also criticized what she calls his \"hostile record\" on abortion rights, referring to Oz's comments on the campaign trail that a woman's decision to get an abortion should be made by her, her doctor and \"local political leaders.\"",

      "Republicans came to Oz's defense and also pushed their agenda for the agency, specifically in upholding the Hyde Amendment.",
      "The amendment has banned the use of any federal funds for abortion, only allowing exceptions to pay for the procedure when the life of the mother is at risk or the pregnancy results from rape or incest. Medicaid, for example, does not cover abortion services beyond those exceptions \u2014 though some states use their own funds to do so.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, argued that Biden took action to expand abortion access in ways that were \"explicitly in violation of the Hyde Amendment.\"",

      "\"Dr. Oz's position is counter to the position of the Department of Treasury and results in him not paying into Social Security and Medicare, the very healthcare program he hopes to manage,\" Democratic Senate Finance Committee staff wrote in the memo, circulated to the committee.",
      "\"He avoided hundreds of thousands of dollars in Social Security and Medicare taxes in the years reviewed,\" the staff wrote. They reviewed Oz's taxes from 2021 to 2023.",

      "The high-stakes race for Wisconsin Supreme Court has gotten most of the attention leading up to the April 1 election",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The high-stakes race for Wisconsin Supreme Court has gotten most of the attention leading up to the April 1 election. But it is not the only issue voters will decide when early voting begins Tuesday.",
      "Also on the ballot is a race for the battleground state's top education official who will guide policies affecting K-12 schools during President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "There is also a measure that would place the state's voter ID law into the state constitution.",
      "Both of those contests have sharp partisan divisions, even though the spending and national attention have been far less than those for the race for control of the state's highest court.",
      "Here is a closer look at what's at stake as voting begins Tuesday:",
      "The race to lead the state education department pits the teachers' union-backed incumbent, Jill Underly, against consultant Brittany Kinser, a supporter of the private school voucher program who is endorsed by Republicans.",
      "A third candidate lost the February primary, unable to chip away enough at Underly's key support. The day after her victory, the state teachers' union, which did not endorse in the primary, came out in support of Underly.",
      "Underly's education career began in 1999 as a high school social studies teacher in Indiana. She moved to Wisconsin in 2005 and worked five years for the state education department. She also worked as principal of Pecatonica Elementary School for a year before becoming the district administrator.",
      "Underly was elected as state superintendent in 2021 and is endorsed by the Wisconsin Education Association Council, which is the state teachers union, as well as the Wisconsin Democratic Party and numerous Democratic officeholders.",
      "Kinser, who is backed by the Wisconsin Republican Party, touts her past as a public school principal in her first television ad. But she doesn't mention it was a charter school. She worked for Rocketship schools, part of a national network of public charter schools and became its executive director in the Milwaukee region.",
      "In 2022, she left Rocketship to work for City Forward Collective, a Milwaukee education nonprofit that advocates for charter and voucher schools. She also founded a consulting firm that year where she currently works.",
      "Wisconsin is the only state where voters elect the top education official, but there is no state board of education. That gives the person who runs the Department of Public Instruction broad authority to oversee education policy, which includes dispersing money to schools and managing teacher licensing.",
      "Kinser has tried to brand Underly as being a poor manager of the Department of Public Instruction. She has keyed in on Underly's overhaul of state achievement standards last year.",
      "Underly said they better reflect what students are learning now, but bipartisan opposition included Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who served as state superintendent before being elected governor in 2018. Evers has not endorsed in the race.",
      "Kinser said the new standards lowered the bar for students and made it more difficult to see how schools and districts are performing over time.",
      "Underly tries to portray Kinser as nothing more than a lobbyist who doesn't care about public education. Kinser supports the state's private school voucher and charter school program, which Democrats and Underly are critical of. Opponents say those programs siphon money away from public schools.",
      "\u201cInstead of fighting for students, Kinser is standing with the far-right politicians who are trying to rip resources away from our schools,\" Underly said.",
      "Underly, who casts herself as the champion of public schools, also has tried to make the possible elimination of the U.S. Department of Education an issue in the race.",
      "Underly opposes dismantling the federal agency, while Kinser has said as long as the state continues to receive federal education funding, \u201cI am confident in our ability to navigate whatever changes Washington sends our way.\u201d",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s photo ID requirement for voting would be elevated from a state law to a constitutional amendment under a proposal on the ballot.",
      "Even if voters reject it, the voter ID requirement that has been in state law since 2011 will remain in place. The law didn't go into effect permanently until 2016, after a series of unsuccessful lawsuits.",
      "Republicans put the measure on the ballot, pitching it as a way to bolster election security and protect the law from being overturned in court.",
      "But Democratic opponents argue photo ID requirements are often enforced unfairly, making it more difficult for people of color, the disabled and poor people to vote.",
      "If voters agree to place the photo ID requirement in the constitution, it would make it more difficult for a future Legislature controlled by Democrats to change a law they have long opposed. Any constitutional amendment must be approved in two consecutive legislative sessions and by a statewide vote of the people.",
      "Wisconsin is one of nine states where voters must present a photo ID to cast a ballot and its requirement is the strictest in the country, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Thirty-six states have laws requiring or requesting that voters show some sort of identification at the polls, according to the conference."

      "Sunday's parade dates back to the turn of the 20th century and marks both St. Patrick\u2019s Day and Evacuation Day, which commemorates the day in 1776 when British troops left Boston after a protracted siege during the Revolutionary War.",
      "The 3.5-mile (5.6-kilometer) parade rolls through the neighborhood South Boston, a center of Irish-American heritage in a city where more than 1 in every 5 people are of Irish descent. The South Boston Allied War Veterans Council organizes the parade and this year\u2019s chief marshal is retired Navy Lt. Cmdr. Alanna Devlin Ball, who grew up in the neighborhood and represented the U.S. at the 2023 Invictus Games in Germany where she took home gold in powerlifting.",
      "\u201cLt. Cdr. Devlin Ball\u2019s 12 years career in the Navy serves as an inspiration to young women who seek to serve in today\u2019s military. We are grateful for her service, sacrifice and power of example,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch, a South Boston native.",
      "The parade is scheduled to kick off slightly earlier in the morning than normal. Last year\u2019s events were marred by violence and public intoxication that officials say they hope to curb on Sunday.",
      "The goal of the parade is \u201ckeeping alive the tradition of honoring heritage and service,\u201d the war veterans council said in a statement.",
      "The parade also has been a source of political controversy in years past. The South Boston Allied War Veterans Council banned gay rights groups from marching in the parade up until a decade ago and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upheld that right in the 1990s.",
      "Two gay and lesbian groups joined the parade in 2015. Organizers for one of the groups, Boston Pride, heralded the move as a point of progress at the time.",
      "Chicago held its St. Patrick's Day parade on Saturday. Philadelphia also celebrates on Sunday and New York City holds its parade Monday.",

      "President Donald Trump delivered what sounded like one of his typical meandering, grievance-laden campaign speeches on Friday, but it was where he did it \u2014 inside the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 that mattered.",
      "The appearance marked Trump\u2019s clearest exertion yet of personal control over the country\u2019s federal law enforcement apparatus, which is normally run by appointees who keep at least an arm\u2019s length from the president to avoid the appearance that politics are governing prosecutorial decisions. Trump, instead, embraced the notion of the agency as his own personal tool of vengeance.",
      "\u201cAs the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred,\u201d Trump told the audience, with Attorney General Pam Bondi (who is technically the country\u2019s chief law enforcement officer) and FBI Director Kash Patel in the audience.",
      "One of Trump's favorite campaign songs, \u201cYMCA,\u201d played after he wrapped up his nearly hourlong address inside the department's ceremonial Great Hall.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what Trump said, what the reality is and the significance of his words.",
      "\u201cThe same scum you have been dealing with for years. Guys like Andrew Weissman, deranged Jack Smith. There\u2019s a guy named Norm Eisen, I don\u2019t even know what he looks like. His name is Norm Eisen of CREW; he\u2019s been after me for nine years.\u201d",
      "Trump named lawyers and a legal nonprofit that he has tangled with over the years, which could serve as a roadmap for people he would like prosecuted by the officials in the room with him.",
      "Trump named lawyer Eisen, but misidentified him as running the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which unsuccessfully sued to block Trump from running for reelection due to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Eisen was with the organization during part of Trump\u2019s first term but has since left.",
      "Trump rained vitriol on CREW as well as Eisen, who remains staunchly opposed to Trump and co-founded an online publication, The Contrarian, to take on the new administration. Still, Trump claimed Eisen has been \u201cviolent,\u201d which is laughable. He\u2019s a lawyer who\u2019s never used physical force toward Trump.",
      "Weissman was lead prosecutor for the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s dealings with Russia during Trump\u2019s first term. One of the people Weissman convicted in that probe, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, watched the speech and was warmly introduced by Trump himself.",
      "Trump also name-checked Smith, who was the special prosecutor who filed charges against Trump for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and for hoarding classified documents at his Florida resort.",
      "Notably, the president didn\u2019t name a single possible crime these lawyers or CREW committed other than opposing him.",
      "\u201cI believe that CNN and MSDNC, who literally write 97.6% bad about me, are political arms of the Democrat Party. And in my opinion, they are really corrupt and they are illegal. What they do is illegal.\u201d",
      "This was a remarkable moment \u2014 the president of the United States telling his Department of Justice that he believes the media are illegal because they write bad things about him.",
      "Needless to say, CNN and MSNBC (which Trump tweaked by changing its initials) are not actually part of the Democratic Party. No matter if you think their coverage leans in that direction, there\u2019s no actual, legal connection.",
      "Even if there was, the First Amendment allows political groups to criticize a rival politician. It certainly allows the media to do so, regardless of any perceived ideological bias.",
      "\"What a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country, when you think about it. And the people who did this to us should go to jail. They should go to jail.\u201d",
      "This is one of Trump's favorite subjects \u2014 how he didn't really lose the 2020 election. He did, though.",
      "Trump has claimed falsely that widespread fraud cost him the 2020 election, but the evidence says otherwise. Trump lost dozens of court challenges, including some before judges he appointed, his own attorney general at the time said there was no evidence of fraud on a scale that could have tipped the election, and reviews, recounts and audits in the battleground states where Trump contested his loss all affirmed Biden\u2019s win.",
      "It's unclear who \u201cthe people who did this\u201d are in Trump's threat, but when a president says someone should go to jail while addressing the Department of Justice \u2014 especially about something that never happened \u2014 that's significant.",
      "\u201cI pardoned hundreds of political prisoners who had been grossly mistreated. We removed the senior FBI officials who misdirected resources to send SWAT teams after grandmothers and J6 hostages. And it was a great honor for me, a great honor to fire James Comey.\u201d",
      "Trump claimed he'd end what he called \u201cweaponization\u201d of the Department of Justice, but then quickly boasted of pardoning those who attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn his election loss on Jan. 6.",
      "Trump also boasted of firing Comey, who was the FBI director in his first term. It was one of Trump's most controversial acts then, but seems almost quaint now. The man whom Trump nominated to replace Comey, Christopher Wray, stepped aside in December after years of being targeted by Trump, who has now replaced him with Patel, a loyalist who never worked in the bureau.",
      "The president boasting of firing top FBI officials is a clear signal to those inside the Department of Justice.",
      "\u201cThey wanted to scare the hell out of the judges. And they do it. How do you stop it? ... What do you do to get rid of it? You convict Trump.\u201d",
      "Trump has personally singled out judges who ruled against him for attack since he first ran for president in 2016. But, remarkably, Trump implied that the adverse legal decisions against him have been because his opponents are threatening judges.",
      "In reality, the judge who presided over Trump\u2019s criminal in New York, Juan Merchan, received threats after Trump repeatedly attacked him and his family. Judicial organizations have reported a sharp rise in threats as Trump increasingly complained the legal system was \u201crigged\u201d against him as he fought four separate prosecutions during his campaign.",
      "Trump did accurately note negative coverage that conservative justices on the nation\u2019s highest court have received over some of their rulings and conduct. He has reason to want those justices to be sympathetic to him because several of his administration\u2019s initiatives are tangled up in litigation headed straight to the Supreme Court."

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats were grim Friday as they left Washington after a brutal 10-week stretch that consistently showed the limits of their power in the minority \u2014 and culminated with a deeply personal rupture over how to best counter President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cEveryone made hard decisions, right? Really hard decisions,\u201d said Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, of the position in which Democrats found themselves over the last week as they had to decide between voting for a Republican spending bill they hated and shutting down the government. \u201cIt\u2019s like two horrible things, and you can\u2019t imagine either one.\u201d",
      "Internal dissension burst into the open Thursday evening after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer announced he would vote to move forward on the Trump-backed spending measure, ensuring its eventual passage even though Democrats said it would give Trump broad discretion on decisions that are traditionally left to Congress.",
      "The intraparty backlash was unusually swift as activists and House Democrats who had uniformly opposed the bill heaped criticism on Schumer. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Schumer\u2019s New York colleague, joined other top party members in a statement saying, \u201cWe will not be complicit.\"",
      "The heat on Schumer came after several other Democratic setbacks in the dizzying weeks since Trump\u2019s inauguration, and as Republicans have only become more unified under the president\u2019s second term.",
      "Republicans confirmed Trump\u2019s entire Cabinet swiftly and with little internal disagreement, denying Democrats the needed votes to block nominees they saw as extreme, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Democrats were also unable to stop a series of moves by Trump\u2019s administration that would normally be left to Congress under the law, including mass firings across the government. Adding to their challenges, the outlook for future Senate elections grew even gloomier after Democrats in three swing states \u2014 the latest being Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire \u2014 announced their retirement.",
      "The days leading up to Friday\u2019s vote on government spending were particularly bleak after several hourslong meetings that became contentious. Senate Democrats repeatedly left the meetings stone-faced and refusing to talk with reporters. The angst was particularly acute among rank-and-file who have spent years messaging about the perils of shutdowns.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a momentous decision,\u201d said Shaheen, one of nine Democrats who voted with Schumer to keep the government open.",
      "The tension was unusually high after Senate Democrats had remained solidly unified through Trump\u2019s first term and through most of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, when Democrats passed several major policy bills and held the Senate against perceived odds in the 2022 midterm elections.",
      "Schumer\u2019s move to support the spending legislation put him in the rare position of bucking his party\u2019s base. He said that of two bad options, a partial government shutdown was worse because it would give Trump even more control to shut down agencies and there would be \u201cno off-ramp\u201d to get out of it. \u201cI think people realize it\u2019s a tough choice,\u201d he said.",
      "Reaction to Schumer\u2019s decision was mixed. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who voted not to move forward on the spending measure, wouldn\u2019t answer when asked by reporters if she still has confidence in the Democratic leader. But Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who voted to move forward, said Schumer \u201cis showing leadership\u201d by taking a stand.",
      "Schumer and Democrats in his caucus say they believe they will eventually gain more political ground as members of their party become more motivated, and as they continue to criticize Trump on what they predict will be the economic ramifications of his policies.",
      "On Friday, as he walked into the Senate to vote, Schumer said Democrats will \u201cresume pounding away at Donald Trump\u201d and arguing that he\u2019s hurting the middle class economically. \u201cIt\u2019s brought down his numbers some, and we\u2019re going to keep at it, keep at it, keep at it.\u201d",
      "Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said that spending vote was a \u201ctough political call,\u201d but the party would continue to be unified on the economic message.",
      "\u201cAll of our base wants us to fight, and I'm with them,\u201d said Welch, who voted not to move forward on the spending measure. But he questioned whether the party ever had any leverage, as Trump was preparing to blame them if there was a shutdown.",
      "Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Democrats need to \u201ckeep their eyes on the ball.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe stark reality is, we\u2019re the minority in the House, we\u2019re the minority in the Senate, and we don\u2019t control the White House, so we need to use every tool as nimbly and ingeniously as we can,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cBut most importantly, the growing anger.\u201d"

She applied to the National Science Foundation\u2019s Graduate Research Fellowship which would guarantee three years of graduate school funding, but lately NSF has been silent on timing for awards. She's uncertain the agency will have funding at all.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s beyond frustrating,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s made me feel like I am in limbo.\u201d",
      "Cuts to NIH funding have been delayed by a legal challenge from a group of 22 states plus organizations representing universities, hospitals and research institutions. But the uncertainty already has put some projects on hold as universities deal also with delays or cuts in grants from other agencies including USAID and NSF.",
      "Admissions in some graduate programs have have been cut in half or paused altogether, said Emilya Ventriglia, president of UAW 2750, the union representing around 5,000 early career researchers at NIH facilities in Bethesda, Maryland, and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cAt this rate, with the hiring freeze, there may be no Ph.D. students next year if it\u2019s not lifted soon, because usually people make their decisions by April,\u201d Ventriglia said.",
      "Ventriglia's research focuses on how the brain responds to anti-depressants. But now she is unable to continue recruiting another researcher she planned to mentor this spring. She said she also is worried that new purchasing restrictions, and firings of employees who processed those purchases, mean she will be unable to acquire reagents she needs for experiments.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re expecting this to play out for generations,\u201d said Levin Kim, the president of a union that represents 8,000 academic workers at the University of Washington.",
      "The financial and emotional toll on those navigating the uncertainty is mounting.",
      "\u201cI love the work that I do. It\u2019s all I want to do,\u201d said Natalie Antenucci, a first-year graduate student at the University of North Carolina. Her work at a lab researching the ways social experiences can impact health is funded by an NIH grant. \u201cI\u2019m not in a financial position where I could continue to do it if there wasn\u2019t funding available for this sort of work.\u201d",
      "Some American students are looking to institutions overseas.",
      "Marleigh Hutchinson, who will graduate from Kansas State University in May with an undergraduate degree in environmental engineering, said getting hired in the U.S. as a graduate teaching assistant or researcher seems unlikely because of the uncertainty.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always told people I do want to work in the international development space. I want to work on food security and water security issues,\u201d she said, \u201cand if that\u2019s something that the United States is no longer going to value, then I would like to go somewhere else.\u201d",
      "Hutchinson was notified last month that funding was slashed to a USAID-funded lab where she was working. Its focus was making crops more resistant to drought in places like Africa as the world grows warmer.",
      "At the University of Nebraska, an institute that works to improve water management for agriculture offered to host a doctoral candidate in hydrology from Ghana and was talking to three other international students. But it had to rescind the offer after it lost USAID funding, said Nicole Lefore, associate director of the school's Daugherty Water for Food Global Institute.",
      "She now worries about the diplomatic fallout, noting she has met with agriculture ministers in other countries who were educated at land grant universities in the U.S. through USAID programs.",
      "\u201cThe university you go to, people have a loyalty to it. And so bringing in generations of students for education and agriculture in the U.S. helped to create those personal connections and then later scientific and diplomatic connections. That\u2019s really important to the soft diplomacy side of what the innovation labs were doing.\u201d",
      "She said she is barraged with emails asking what this will mean.",
      "\u201cThe only winner out of this is China, she said. \u201dBecause the countries that are being cut off there, I think they will turn to someone.\u201d",

      "For parents of kids with disabilities, advocating for their child can be complicated, time-consuming \u2014 and expensive",
      "WASHINGTON -- For parents of kids with disabilities, advocating for their child can be complicated, time-consuming \u2014 and expensive.",
      "Changes at the Education Department are likely to make the process even more difficult, advocates for kids with disabilities say.",
      "When a parent believes their child is not receiving proper services or school accommodations for a disability, they can seek remedies from their district. They can file complaints with their state, arguing the child's rights have been taken away without due process of law, or even pursue litigation in state or federal courts.",
      "Those processes often involve multiple sessions with hearing officers who are not required to be experts in disability law. Legal fees can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a single case. Legal aid and other advocacy organizations that can provide free assistance often have more demand for their services than they can meet.",
      "But filing a complaint with the Education Department has long been an option for families who can't afford a lawyer. They begin by filling out the Office for Civil Rights' online form, documenting the alleged instances of discrimination. From there, the agency's staff is supposed to investigate the complaint, often interviewing school district employees and examining district policies for broader possible violations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s known and has the weight of the federal government behind it,\u201d said Dan Stewart, managing attorney for education and employment at the National Disability Rights Network. \u201cThe process, the complaint portal, as well as the processing manual are all in public, and it does not require or typically involve lawyers.\u201d",
      "That option seems increasingly out of reach, advocates say.",
      "Under President Donald Trump, the Education Department\u2019s staff has been cut approximately in half \u2014 including in the Office for Civil Rights, whose attorneys are charged with investigating complaints of discrimination against kids with disabilities. The staff has been directed to prioritize antisemitism cases. More than 20,000 pending cases \u2014 including those related to kids with disabilities, historically the largest share of the office\u2019s work \u2014 largely sat idle for weeks after Trump took office. A freeze on processing the cases was lifted early this month, but advocates question whether the department can make progress on them with a smaller staff.",
      "\u201cThe reduction in force is simply an evisceration of the Office for Civil Rights\u2019 investigatory authority and responsibility,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that I can see that OCR can keep up with the backlog or with the incoming complaints.\u201d",
      "A federal lawsuit filed Friday challenges the layoffs at the Office for Civil Rights, saying they decimated the office's ability to process and investigate complaints.",
      "While the OCR process was not perfect, reducing the office\u2019s investigative staff will only worsen the challenges families face when seeking support for their kids, said Nikki Carter, an advocate for kids with disabilities and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cIt makes them feel hopeless and helpless,\u201d Carter said. \u201cBy reducing the number of employees to handle cases, by putting stipulations on certain cases, it only makes it feel intensified.\u201d",
      "Education Department officials insist the staff reductions will not affect civil rights investigations and the layoffs were \u201cstrategic decisions.\u201d",
      "In her state of Alabama, Carter said families face an uphill battle to finding legal representation.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t have the money for an attorney,\u201d she said. \u201cOr the representation they\u2019re getting is not the representation they feel like will be best for their child.\u201d",
      "Even if families can afford the high costs, a limited number of attorneys have the expertise to take on disability discrimination cases. Programs that offer free representation often have limited capacity.",
      "If the backlog of cases increases at the federal Office for Civil Rights, families may lose faith in how quickly the department will investigate their complaints, Stewart said. That may drive them to alternate pathways, such as filing state complaints.",
      "But state and local agencies haven't always had the capacity or understanding to handle education disability complaints, Stewart said, since those cases so often went to the U.S. Education Department.",
      "\u201cThey might not have the infrastructure or the knowledge or the staffing to take on the influx of cases,\u201d Stewart said.",
      "In a separate federal lawsuit filed Thursday, Democratic attorneys general argued the staff reductions at the Education Department may embolden school districts to ignore complaints of discrimination or harassment.",
      "\u201cStudents with current complaints will likely see no meaningful resolution, with cases backlogged due to the shortage of employees to resolve them,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cStudents facing discrimination, sexual harassment or sexual assault will lose a critical avenue to report their case.\u201d",

      "A federal judge barred the Trump administration Saturday from carrying out deportations under a sweeping 18th century law that the president invoked just hours earlier to speed removal of Venezuelan gang members from the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge barred the Trump administration Saturday from carrying out deportations under a sweeping 18th century law that the president invoked hours earlier to speed removal of Venezuelan gang members from the United States.",
      "U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government already was flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under President Donald Trump\u2019s proclamation to be incarcerated in El Salvador and Honduras. El Salvador already agreed  this week to take up to 300 migrants that the Trump administration designated as gang members.",
      "\u201cI do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,\u201d Boasberg said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. \u201cA brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,\u201d he added, noting they remain in government custody but ordering that any planes in the air be turned around.",
      "The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations.",
      "The act has only ever been used three times before, all during wars. Its most recent application was during World War II, when it was used to incarcerate Germans and Italians as well as for the mass internment of Japanese-American civilians.",
      "In a proclamation released just over an hour before Boasberg's hearing, Trump contended that Tren de Aragua was effectively at war with the United States.",
      "\u201cOver the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA,\u201d Trump\u2019s statement reads. \u201cThe result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States.\u201d",
      "The order could let the administration deport any migrant it identifies as a member of the gang without going through regular immigration proceedings, and also could remove other protections under criminal law for people the government targeted.",
      "In a statement Saturday night, Attorney General Pam Bondi slammed Boasberg\u2019s stay on deportations. \u201cThis order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump\u2019s power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk,\u201d Bondi said.",
      "The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation\u2019s economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and formally designated it a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d last month.",
      "Authorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela\u2019s government claims to have eliminated the criminal organization.",
      "The government said Trump actually signed the proclamation on Friday night. Immigration lawyers noticed the federal government suddenly moving to deport Venezuelans who they would not otherwise have the legal right to expel from the country, and scrambled to file lawsuits to block what they believed was a pending proclamation.",
      "Boasberg issued an initial order at 9:20 a.m. Saturday blocking the Trump administration from deporting five Venezuelans named as plaintiffs in the ACLU suit who were being detained by the government and believed they were about to be deported. The Trump administration appealed that order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch.",
      "If the order were allowed to stand, \"district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint,\u201d the Justice Department wrote in its appeal.",
      "Boasberg then scheduled the afternoon hearing on whether to expand his order to all people who could be targeted under Trump's declaration.",
      "Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign contended that the president had broad latitude to identify threats to the country and act under the 1798 law. He noted the U.S. Supreme Court allowed President Harry Truman to continue to hold a German citizen in 1948, three years after World War II ended, under the measure.",
      "\u201cThis would cut very deeply into the prerogatives of the president,\u201d Ensign said of an injunction.",
      "But Lee Gelernt of the ACLU contended that Trump didn't have the authority to use the law against a criminal gang rather than a recognized state. Boasberg said precedent on that question seemed tricky but that the ACLU had a reasonable chance of success on those arguments, and so the order was merited.",
      "Boasberg halted deportations for those in custody for up to 14 days, and scheduled a Friday hearing in the case.",
      "The flurry of litigation shows the significance of Trump's declaration, the latest step by the administration to expand presidential power. Ensign argued that, as part of its reaction to the Sept. 11, 2001 attack, Congress had given the president power to delegate \u201ctransnational\u201d organizations threats on the level of recognized states. And Gelernt warned that the Trump administration could simply issue a new proclamation to use the Alien Enemies Act against another migrant gang, like MS-13, which has long been one of Trump's favorite targets.",

      "The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen say a series of airstrikes have hit the capital, Sanaa, on Saturday evening",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use \u201coverwhelming lethal force\u201d until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said at least 18 civilians were killed.",
      "\u201cOur brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists\u2019 bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cNo terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.\u201d",
      "He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country \u201cfully accountable\u201d for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S. leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran\u2019s advancing nuclear program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational.",
      "The Houthis reported explosions in their territory Saturday evening, in the capital of Sanaa and the northern province of Saada, the rebels\u2019 stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia, with more airstrikes reported in those areas early Sunday. Images online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. The Houthis also reported airstrikes early Sunday on the provinces of Hodeida, Bayda, and Marib.",
      "At least 18 people were killed, including 13 in Sanaa and five in Saada, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. At least 24 others were wounded, including nine in Sanaa and 15 in Saada, it said.",
      "A U.S. official said this was the beginning of air strikes on Houthi targets that are expected to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press.",
      "Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won\u2019t deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. \u201cSanaa will remain Gaza\u2019s shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges,\u201d he added on social media.",
      "Another spokesman, Mohamed Abdulsalam, on X, called Trump\u2019s claims that the Houthis threaten international shipping routes \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d",
      "The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel\u2019s latest blockade on Gaza. They described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.",
      "There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.",
      "Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of \u201cadditional consequences\u201d for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn\u2019t extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase.",
      "The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when this ceasefire in Gaza took effect.",
      "The attacks raised the Houthis\u2019 profile as they faced economic and other problems at home amid Yemen\u2019s decade-long stalemated war that\u2019s torn apart the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation.",
      "The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa\u2019s northern district of Shouab. Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children.",
      "\u201cThe explosions were very strong,\u201d said Abdallah al-Alffi. \u201cIt was like an earthquake.\u201d",
      "The Eastern Geraf is home to Houthi-held military facilities and a headquarters for the rebels' political bureau, located in a densely populated area.",
      "The Houthis reported fresh strikes on the southwestern Dhamar province late Saturday. They said the strikes hit the outskirts of the provincial capital, also named Dhamar, and the district of Abs.",
      "The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel\u2019s military declined to comment.",
      "However, Saturday's operation was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration.",
      "Such broad-based missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region.",
      "The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturday's mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.",

      "\u201cReductions-in-force\u201d memos have also been sent to current workers, and more layoffs are expected. The cuts included workers at the Grand Coulee Dam, the largest hydropower generator in North America, according to two fired staffers interviewed by The Associated Press.",

      "Several other federal agencies that help ensure dams run safely also have faced layoffs and closures. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is laying off 10% of its workforce and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Dam Safety Review Board was disbanded in January.",
      "The cuts come at a time when the nation's dams need expert attention.",
      "An AP review of Army Corps data last year showed at least 4,000 dams are in poor or unsatisfactory condition and could kill people or harm the environment if they failed. They require inspections, maintenance and emergency repairs to avoid catastrophes, the AP found.",
      "Heavy rain damaged the spillway at California\u2019s Oroville Dam in 2017, forcing nearly 190,000 residents to evacuate, and Michigan's Edenville Dam breached in storms in 2020, the AP found.",
      "Stephanie Duclos, a Bureau of Reclamation probationary worker fired at the Grand Coulee Dam, said she was among a dozen workers initially terminated. The dam across the Columbia River in central Washington state generates electricity for millions of homes and supplies water to a 27-mile-long (43-kilometer) reservoir that irrigates the Columbia Basin Project.",

      "A Texas lawmaker has introduced a bill to change the language in the state\u2019s abortion laws to make it clearer when exceptions can be made to save the life of the patient",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas lawmaker who helped pioneer the state's restrictive abortion laws introduced a bill on Friday to clarify medical exceptions allowed under the law, representing a pivot from Republican legislators who have defended the state's abortion ban in the face of lawsuits and medical scrutiny.",
      "The bill, introduced by Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes, still requires that patients have a medical emergency for a physician to perform an abortion but strikes language that it be a life-threatening condition. The bill would also require doctors and lawyers to receive training about the law.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve learned in a number of cases where the physician was willing to treat the mom, but the lawyers for the hospital would advise against it,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo one of the most important things we want to do is make sure that doctors and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is.\u201d",
      "Hughes' proposed legislation follows similar efforts by Kentucky lawmakers who added medical exceptions to their state's near-total abortion ban on Thursday.",
      "Texas law currently prohibits abortions except when a pregnant patient has a life-threatening condition. Doctors who are convicted of providing an illegal abortion can face up to 99 years in prison, a $100,000 fine and lose their medical license.",
      "Texas\u2019 abortion laws are among the strictest in the nation and have survived multiple legal challenges since the overturning of Roe v. Wade from opponents who say the law is unclear about when medical exceptions are allowed.",
      "Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the president of the Senate, has made the bill one of his legislative priorities, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's office said he's open to supporting the legislation.",
      "\u201cSince the Dobbs decision, there have been 135 medically necessary abortions to save mothers\u2019 lives in Texas with no repercussions for those physicians,\u201d Abbott spokesperson Andrew Mahaleris said in a statement. \u201cGovernor Abbott looks forward to seeing any clarifying language in any proposed legislation from the legislature.\u201d",
      "For years, abortion rights advocates have criticized Texas\u2019 abortion laws, which do not allow exceptions for cases of incest or rape, as too restrictive.",
      "\u201cNo amount of attempted clarification from Texas lawmakers would suffice because abortion bans are dangerous,\u201d said Ashley Gray, senior policy adviser for the Center for Reproductive Rights. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re criminalizing doctors for providing care, patients will suffer.\u201d",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court said the state\u2019s abortion laws were not too vague, ruling against a group of women who had serious pregnancy complications and were denied abortions. The Texas Medical Board has refused to list specific exceptions for doctors under the law.",
      "Dallas mother Kate Cox was at the center of a separate lawsuit brought in 2023 for a similar issue after a court denied her permission to obtain an abortion after her fetus developed a fatal condition.",
      "A group of more than 100 obstetricians and gynecologists across the state sent a letter in November to state officials urging them to reform the law after an investigation by ProPublica found three women had died after doctors had delayed treating their miscarriages.",

      "The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, until the current ceasefire in Gaza took effect in mid-January. Other missiles and drones were intercepted or failed to reach their targets, which included Western military ones.",
      "The attacks paused during the ceasefire, but the Houthis on Wednesday said they would resume against \u201cany Israeli vessel\u201d after Israel cut off all aid supplies to Gaza to pressure Hamas during talks on extending their truce. The rebels said the warning also affects the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.",

      "\u201cThese relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,\u201d Trump said Saturday while announcing the airstrikes in a social media post.",
      "The earlier Houthi campaign saw U.S. and other Western warships repeatedly targeted, sparking the most serious combat the U.S. Navy had seen since World War II.",
      "The United States under the Biden administration, as well as Israel and Britain, previously struck Houthi-held areas in Yemen. But a U.S. official said Saturday\u2019s operation was conducted solely by the U.S.",
      "The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturday's mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.",
      "Trump said the strikes were to \u201cprotect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom.\u201d",
      "The focus on the Houthis and their attacks have raised their profile as they face economic and other pressures at home amid Yemen\u2019s decadelong stalemated war, which has torn apart the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation.",
      "Saturday\u2019s strikes also were meant to pressure Iran, which has backed the Houthis just as it has supported Hamas and other proxies in the Middle East.",
      "Trump vowed to hold Iran \u201cfully accountable\u201d for the Houthis\u2019 actions.",
      "The State Department earlier this month reinstated the \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d designation for the Houthis, which carries sanctions and penalties for anyone providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d for the group.",
      "The Trump administration also has been pressing Iran to restart bilateral talks on Iran\u2019s advancing nuclear program, with Trump writing a letter to the country's supreme leader. Trump, who unilaterally withdrew America from Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, has said he will not allow the program to become operational.",
      "Trump has also levied new sanctions on Iran as part of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against the country and has suggested that military action remains a possibility, while emphasizing he still believes a new nuclear deal can be reached.",

      "The agreement follows discussions between El Salvador's President, Nayib Bukele, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio about housing migrants in El Salvador's notorious prison. Bukele's government has arrested more than 84,000 people, sometimes without due process, since 2022 as part of his crackdown on gang violence in the small country.",

      "President Donald Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II, granting himself sweeping powers under a centuries-old law to deport people associated with a Venezuelan gang. Hours later, a federal judge halted deportations under Trump's order.",
      "The act is a sweeping wartime authority that allows non-citizens to be deported without being given the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.",
      "Trump repeatedly hinted during his campaign that he would declare extraordinary powers to confront illegal immigration and laid additional groundwork in a slew of executive orders on Jan. 20.",

Boasberg, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, blocked anyone from being deported under Trump's proclamation for two weeks and scheduled a Friday hearing to consider arguments.",
      "In 1798, with the U.S. preparing for what it believed would be a war with France, Congress passed a series of laws that increased the federal government's reach. Worried that immigrants could sympathize with the French, the Alien Enemies Act was created to give the president wide powers to imprison and deport non-citizens in time of war.",
      "Since then, the act has been used just three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "During World War II, with anti-foreigner fears sweeping the country, it was part of the legal rationale for mass internment in the U.S. of people of German, Italian and especially Japanese ancestry. An estimated 120,000 people with Japanese heritage, including those with U.S. citizenship, were incarcerated during the war.",

      "The agreement with El Salvador followed discussions between that country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio about housing migrants in El Salvador\u2019s notorious prisons. Bukele\u2019s government has arrested more than 84,000 people, sometimes without due process, since 2022 in a crackdown on gang violence.",
      "ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said two flights Saturday may have carried people deported under Trump's proclamation, one to El Salvador and one possibly to Honduras. Boasberg said any such flights would have to be returned midair to the United States.",
      "For years, Trump and his allies have argued that America is facing an \u201cinvasion\u201d of people arriving illegally. Arrests on the U.S. border with Mexico topped 2 million a year for two straight years for the first time under President Joe Biden, with many released into the U.S. to pursue asylum. After hitting an all-time monthly high of 250,000 in December 2023, they plunged to less than 8,400 this February \u2014 the lowest levels since the 1960s.",
      "The act, Trump said in his inaugural address, would be a key tool in his immigration crackdown.",

      "Critics say Trump is wrongly using the act to target non-state actors, not foreign governments.",
      "\u201cInvoking it in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse,\u201d the Brennan Center for Justice wrote, calling it \u201cat odds with centuries of legislative, presidential, and judicial practice.\u201d",
      "\u201cSummary detentions and deportations under the law conflict with contemporary understandings of equal protection and due process,\u201d the Brennan Center said.",
      "It's a new and untested argument. Trump has warned of the power of Latin American criminal gangs in the U.S., but only a tiny percentage of the people living illegally in the U.S. are criminals.",
      "Trump, in his wartime declaration on Saturday, said Tren de Aragua \u201cis perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\u201d He said the gang was engaged in \u201cirregular warfare\u201d against the United States at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Tren de Aragua originated in an infamously lawless prison in the central state of Aragua and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation\u2019s economy came undone last decade.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration designated Tren de Aragua and seven other Latin American crime organizations as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations,\u201d upping pressure on cartels  operating in the U.S. and on anyone aiding them.",
      "Congress\u2019 research arm said in a report last month officials may use the foreign terrorist designations to argue the gang's activities in the U.S. amount to a limited invasion. \u201cThis theory appears to be unprecedented and has not been subject to judicial review,\u201d the Congressional Research Service said.",
      "The Venezuelan government has not typically taken its people back from the U.S., except on a few occasions. Over the past few weeks, about 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",

      "Federal immigration agents have arrested two foreigners \u2014 one of them a student \u2014 who protested last year at Columbia. They've revoked the visa of another student, who fled the U.S. this week. Department of Homeland Security agents also searched the on-campus residences of two Columbia students on Thursday but did not make any arrests there.",

      "\u201cGreen-card-holding faculty members involved in any kind of advocacy that might be construed as not welcome by the Trump administration are absolutely terrified of the implications for their immigration status,\u201d said Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.",
      "Dubal, who is also general counsel for the American Association of University Professors, says some international faculty are now shying away from discourse, debate, scholarly research and publishing articles in peer-reviewed journals.",
      "\u201cWe are literally not hearing their voices. There is a silencing happening that has a huge impact on the vibrancy of higher education,\u201d Dubal said. \u201cPeople are very, very scared.\u201d",
      "The first publicly known arrest occurred last Saturday, when federal immigration agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent Palestinian activist and outspoken graduate student, in the lobby of his apartment building near the Columbia campus.",
      "Khalil has become the face of President Donald Trump\u2019s drive to punish what he calls antisemitic and anti-American protests that swept U.S. campuses last year. Khalil, a legal U.S. resident with a green card, is being held in a federal detention complex in Louisiana.",
      "Students and faculty who participated in the protests at Columbia have insisted criticizing Israel and advocating for Palestinian rights isn\u2019t antisemitic. Some Jewish students and faculty say the anti-Israel rhetoric made them feel unsafe.",
      "Civil rights advocates say the detention of Khalil is an assault on free speech. But the ongoing arrests send a wider message that disagreeing with the Trump administration could get you kicked out of the country, said Brian Hauss, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "\u201cIf the administration can do this to Mr. Khalil because of the speech about Palestine, it can do it to any non-U.S. citizen who takes a position on hot-button global issues, including the war between Russia and Ukraine, the tariffs imposed against U.S. allies or the rise of far-right political parties in Europe,\u201d he said.",
      "That worry has spread outside New York.",
      "A Bangladeshi student at Louisiana State University, who agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities, said she has stopped posting about anything political on social media since the first arrest at Columbia. She fears losing her green card.",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s not safe for me to share those things anymore because I have a fear that a quote-unquote \u2018authoritarian regime\u2019 is lurking over social media posts,\u201d the student said. When she lived in Bangladesh, she said, people could be arrested for posting dissent on social media. \u201cWhat I fear is a similar situation in the United States.\u201d",
      "Some schools have been advising international students to be cautious of what they say publicly and to watch what they say online. Several international students on a variety of college campuses said they preferred not to speak with a reporter out of concern for their immigration status.",
      "Administrators at Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism have warned students who are not U.S. citizens about their vulnerability to arrest or deportation.",
      "\u201cNobody can protect you, these are dangerous times,\u201d the school\u2019s dean, Jelani Cobb, said in a post Thursday on Bluesky explaining the comment. \u201cI went on to say that I would do everything in my power to defend our journalists and their right to report but that none of us had the capacity to stop DHS from jeopardizing their safety.\"",

      "Several states are considering moves to change how they compensate people incarcerated after wrongful convictions",
      "ATLANTA -- Earlier this year, Michael Woolfolk attended a legislative committee in Georgia where lawmakers considered for a third year whether to compensate the 45-year-old for the 19 years he spent behind bars for a 2002 killing before charges against him were dismissed.",
      "Behind him sat Daryl Lee Clark, also 45, who spent 25 years in prison for a 1998 murder conviction that was vacated over a series of legal and police errors. It was his second attempt to obtain compensation.",
      "Georgia is one of 11 states with no law on compensating people found to have been wrongfully convicted. Individuals seeking compensation take their cases to the legislature, where they seek a lawmaker to sponsor a resolution to pay them. Critics say it mires the process in politics.",
      "Lawmakers have been considering legislation to move the decision to judges, but now it's unclear if that will pass this year.",
      "\u201cWe need to take care simply of people who have lost so many years of their lives and their ability to make money, have a job, have a family, create stability,\u201d Republican Rep. Katie Dempsey, a sponsor of the Georgia bill, told The Associated Press. \u201cMany are at the age where they would be looking at their savings, and instead, there\u2019s none.\u201d",
      "Missouri lawmakers have sent the governor a bill updating the state's compensation law, and legislatures in Florida and Oregon also are considering updates of their laws. Montana is considering an update of its expired program and Pennsylvania is among those, like Georgia, looking to create one.",
      "Of the 1,739 people who have filed wrongful compensation claims under state laws since 1989, 1,328 received compensation, according to data from George Washington University law professor Jeffrey Gutman.",
      "That doesn't include cases in states like Georgia, which has no law outlining a process.",
      "Since 1995, 12 Georgians have received compensation and at least 11 more have sought it, according to the Georgia Innocence Project. Even some people with strong cases were turned down because they failed to convince lawmakers they were innocent, advocates say.",
      "The latest version of Georgia's proposal would require individuals to prove their innocence to an administrative law judge. They could receive $75,000 for each year of incarceration and reimbursement for other costs such as fines and fees. There would be an additional $25,000 for each year of incarceration awaiting a death sentence.",
      "\u201cThe way that the state has treated these individuals by taking away their freedom and liberty and effectively ruining their lives, by wrongfully convicting them and then failing to expeditiously compensate them and help them get back on their feet, doesn\u2019t sit well with me,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Scott Holcomb, a bill sponsor and former prosecutor.",
      "Whether a person was released based on a finding they were not guilty or based on trial or law enforcement error is often a sticking point. Advocates say those wrongfully convicted deserve compensation either way because they are innocent until proven guilty, but some lawmakers are hesitant to pay them.",
      "Senate Majority Whip Randy Robertson, a former sheriff\u2019s deputy, was the lead opponent last year of individual requests for compensation and an effort to pass a compensation law. He takes issue with the term \u201cexonerated,\u201d which he says is too often used in cases where convictions are overturned based on trial errors.",
      "Robertson this year introduced a different compensation bill with stricter rules that didn't get a hearing.",
      "Florida is the only state that prevents exonerees with previous felony convictions from qualifying for compensation, according to an analysis by the advocacy group The Innocence Project.",
      "Florida Republican state Sen. Jennifer Bradley wants to change that. For the third year she is sponsoring a bill to end the rule, arguing that an unrelated charge should not prevent people who were wronged by the state from being compensated for their \u201clost liberty.\u201d",
      "A bill in the Oregon Legislature would update a law passed in 2022 that provides exonerees $65,000 for each year they were wrongfully imprisoned, on the condition they file a successful petition proving their innocence. The new bill comes amid criticism that few exonerees have received compensation since the law took effect.",
      "Missouri's legislature recently passed and sent to the governor a measure expanding a restitution program for people wrongly convicted of felonies. The legislation would raise compensation from $100 to $179 per day of imprisonment and remove a requirement that innocence is proven by DNA analysis.",
      "Many Georgia lawmakers have said they don\u2019t want to play judge and hope the state process changes.",
      "If the legislature doesn\u2019t pass a bill before adjourning April 4, Woolfolk and Clark may not be compensated this year. The House overwhelmingly approved five requests that could fail in the Senate.",
      "Starting a career at 45 is hard, Woolfolk said, and he missed his children\u2019s upbringing. He said he is sick of trying to convince lawmakers to help him.",
      "Clark, who does not have children, got a standing ovation from House lawmakers last year who voted to compensate him.",

      "The boss of online clothing brand Snag has told the BBC it gets more than 100 complaints a day that the models in its adverts are \"too fat\".",
      "Chief executive Brigitte Read says models of her size 4-38 clothing are frequently the target of \"hateful\" posts about their weight.",
      "The brand was cited in an online debate over whether adverts showing \"unhealthily fat\" models should be banned after a Next advert, in which a model appeared \"unhealthily thin\", was banned.",
      "The UK's advertising watchdog says it has banned ads using models who appear unhealthily underweight rather than overweight due to society's aspiration towards thinness.",
      "The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 61 complaints about models' weight in 2024, with the vast majority being about models who appeared to be too thin.",
      "But it only had grounds to investigate eight complaints and none were about Snag.",
      "Catherine Thom read the BBC report about the Next advert ban and got in touch to say she found it \"hypocritical to ban adverts where models appear too thin for being socially irresponsible, however when models are clearly obese we're saying it's body positivity\".",
      "The 36-year-old from Edinburgh was one of several people who contacted the BBC with this view, while a Reddit thread had more than 1,000 comments with many along the same theme.",
      "Mrs Thom says she was \"bombarded with images of obese girls in tights\" after buying from Snag when she was pregnant.",
      "\"I see Snag tights plastering these morbidly obese people all over social media,\" she says.",
      "\"How is that allowed when the photo of the Next model isn't? There should be fairness, not politically correct body positivity. Adverts normalising an unhealthy weight, be it obese or severely underweight, are equally as harmful.\"",
      "'Fat phobia'",
      "But Snag founder Ms Read says: \"Shaming fat people does not help them to lose weight and actually it really impacts mental health and therefore their physical health.\"",
      "She thinks the idea of banning adverts showing models with bigger bodies is a symptom of society's \"fat phobia\".",
      "Of her 100 staff, 12 are dedicated \"just to remove negative comments and big up those promoting body positivity\".",
      "\"Fat people exist, they're equally as valid as thin people, they buy clothes and they need to see what they look like on people that look like them,\" she says.",
      "\"You are not worth less the bigger you are. Models of all sizes, shapes, ethnicities and abilities are valid and should be represented.\"",
      "Sophie Scott is a 27-year-old salon owner from Lossiemouth in Scotland who has modelled for Snag, and received positive and negative comments about her size on social media.",
      "\"I get either 'you're so beautiful' or 'you need to lose weight'. When I started modelling I was a size 30. Having lost weight since then I'm still on the receiving end of hate comments because it will never be enough for some people.\"",
      "Sophie is used to online comments telling her she is \"unhealthy\", but says, \"fitness is not measured by the way you look. They are making assumptions, they don't know me or my activity levels.",
      "\"People say 'you're glorifying obesity' but I don't think anyone is looking at me and saying 'I want to look like that'. Perhaps some people are looking at me and saying 'she has a similar body type to me'.",
      "\"When I get a message from someone saying 'we are the same size and you've inspired me to wear what I want', it takes away from every hate comment I get.",
      "\"If I've helped one person accept their body then the hate comments don't really bother me.\"",
      "Fashion journalist Victoria Moss believes the \"depressing\" debate shows society is not used to seeing bigger bodies in advertising campaigns.",
      "\"You'd be pretty hard pushed to find genuine plus-size models on retailers' websites because even a mid-size is a 10/12 and plus is 14/16 which is actually around the average size for a woman in the UK,\" she says.",
      "\"The issue with adverts showing very small or very big models is the context and the provocation. We know people with eating disorders seek out images of very thin people as 'thinspiration'. But if anyone sees a picture of a bigger person they're not going to drive to buy 10 McDonald's to try to get fatter.\"",
      "Jess Tye at the ASA told the BBC the watchdog gets about 35,000 complaints a year about all advertising, and in 2024 received 61 complaints about 52 adverts relating to the model's weight.",
      "She says an advert will be investigated if it could be seen to be encouraging people to aspire to an unhealthy body weight. Adverts simply promoting body confidence and using a model who is relevant to the product's size range would not be investigated.",
      "\"It's to do with the wider societal context. We know in the UK currently society tends to view thinness as aspirational and that's not the case for being overweight.\""

      "The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in January, in a blow to the government ahead of its Spring Statement later this month.",
      "The economy contracted by 0.1%, which was weaker than forecast, driven mainly by a decline in the manufacturing sector.",
      "The government has made boosting growth its key priority, but the weakness of the economy is expected to affect Chancellor Rachel Reeves's decisions as she seeks to meet her self-imposed rules on tax and spending.",
      "Reeves said the government needed to go \"further and faster\" on the economy, but the Conservatives accused it of being a \"growth killer\".",
      "Economists had predicted the economy would grow by 0.1% in January, after 0.4% growth in December. Monthly readings can be volatile, and the ONS said the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.2% over the three months to January.",
      "But the overall picture for the UK was one of weak growth, said Liz McKeown, ONS director of economic statistics.",
      "Construction and oil and gas extraction had a weak month, she said.",

      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for some time.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "In addition, firms are facing new uncertainty surrounding the tariffs being imposed by US President Donald Trump, while the government is also under pressure to increase defence spending.",
      "Responding to the latest growth figures, Reeves said: \"The world has changed and across the globe we are feeling the consequences.\"",
      "She said the government was \"launching the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War\", but this comes as public spending plans are under pressure as the chancellor seeks to meet self-imposed budget rules.",
      "Last month, the Bank of England halved its growth forecast for the UK this year. At the Spring Statement later this month, the independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility is also likely to downgrade its growth prediction.",
      "This has led to expectations that government spending will have to be reined in so that Reeves can meet her tax and spending rules.",
      "The government is expected to set out significant cuts to the welfare budget next week, as part of these cost savings.",

      "The recent cut to UK aid to fund an increase in defence spending \"is a preview that some departments will see their spending plans squeezed\", she added.",
      "Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said a slight rise or fall in GDP for one month was not significant, but the important point was the economy overall is \"quite weak and therefore quite vulnerable\".",
      "Car manufacturers in particular have \"notable weaknesses\" with trade uncertainty from Trump tariffs, and \"chopping and changing in the targets of the adoption of electric vehicles\".",

      "Gold touched a record $3,004.86 per ounce on Friday, with prices having risen by 14% since the start of 2025.",
      "Gold is seen as a safer asset for investors and is often sought after in times of economic instability.",
      "The escalating trade war between the US and many of its largest trading partners has unsettled financial markets and raised concerns about the impact on economies and consumers across the world.",
      "The introduction of tariffs, which are taxes charged on businesses importing goods from overseas, has fuelled fears of price inflation, which has driven investors to gold.",
      "When tariffs are imposed on goods, businesses face extra costs, which could be passed on through the price tags of the products sold to consumers - increasing the cost of living.",
      "On Thursday, US President Donald Trump threatened a 200% tariff on any alcohol coming to the US from the European Union (EU) in the latest twist of the trade war.",
      "The announcement was in response to the EU's plans for a 50% tax on imports of US-produced whiskey as part of the bloc's first retaliation to Trump's blanket tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US from any country.",
      "The US president has also raised levies on Chinese imports into the US to at least 20%.",
      "Trump threatens 200% tariff on alcohol from EU",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "\"In a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and ongoing tariff changes, appetite for gold remains strong,\" said Suki Cooper, a precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered.",
      "Victoria Hasler, head of fund research at Hargreaves Lansdown, suggested there were two main drivers behind the gold price at present.",
      "\"Between Trump's tariffs and social media comments and the ongoing tensions in both the Middle East and Russia/Ukraine, uncertainty is high and seems to be rising,\" she said.",
      "\"Markets hate uncertainty. This dynamic has helped to drive the gold price to new highs.\"",
      "The second big driver was central banks buying up gold, Ms Hasler said, but the exact reasons for this were difficult to determine. \"It's probably safe to assume that at least part of the reason is a desire to diversify reserves away from US dollars.",
      "\"Both of the above drivers remain intact and I can't see them diminishing in the near future.\"",
      "Peaks and troughs of the gold price have occurred at some of the key moments in economic history. At the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2007, investors bought gold as a haven asset, which led to a rise in its price.",
      "Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, cited World Gold Council figures, which showed central banks had added some 1,045 tonnes of gold to their reserves last year - the third year in a row more than 1,000 tonnes had been bought.",
      "He said we were in an \"era in which gold is really starting to shine\".",
      "Since the metal dipped below $1,200 an ounce in late 2018, Mr Mould said prices had \"marched inexorably higher\", driven by several factors including the Covid pandemic and higher government deficits pushing investors to \"warm to gold once more\".",
      "\"Quite which of these issues is now the main driver of gold's renaissance is hard to divine, especially as Donald Trump's tariffs are prompting a debate about how inflationary (or stagflationary) they may prove to be, and how effective they may be at funding the new US President's hoped-for tax cuts,\" he said."

      "Allan Leighton, Asda\u2019s executive chairman, said profits would be lower this year due to investment plans aimed at lowering prices for customers and improving the availability of products.",
      "Britain's third largest supermarket has been struggling to keep up with its competitors, losing market share to bigger rivals such as Tesco and discounters Aldi and Lidl last year.",
      "After releasing its latest financial figures on Friday, Mr Leighton said the grocer was aiming for its prices to be five to 10% cheaper than its rivals going forward.",
      "Asda revealed on Friday that sales, excluding fuel, fell almost 1% to \u00a321.7bn last year.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 22:16:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but his experience managing global economic crises will help.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

    "story": [
      "Taxpayers and the pension schemes of Thames Water workers would both suffer if the UK's largest water company was temporarily nationalised, the water regulator and Thames' pension trustees have warned.",
      "Ofwat has not disputed that placing Thames under government control in the event the debt-laden company collapsed could end up costing taxpayers billions of pounds.",
      "Some 12,000 current and former employees could also see future pension entitlements reduced, according to documents seen by the BBC.",
      "The future of Thames Water is in the balance as the Court of Appeal considers whether a \u00a33bn emergency loan to the troubled utility giant can go ahead.",
      "Thames and the majority of its lenders have backed a plan that would see the company, which has a \u00a320bn debt pile, borrow a further \u00a33bn to keep it afloat long enough to complete a restructure.",
      "The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people. It is expected to run out of cash completely by mid-April.",
      "The \u00a33bn rescue loan was approved following a crucial High Court battle last month, but a smaller group of lenders worried they stood to lose the most and Liberal Democrat MP Charlie Maynard, who argued that piling on more debt was not in the public interest, launched an appeal.",
      "The Court of Appeal has been hearing arguments over whether the loan should be granted, with a decision expected early next week.",
      "Thames Water secures \u00a33bn lifeline after court ruling",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "Documents seen by the BBC revealed Ofwat rejected claims from Maynard that Thames adding to its debt pile would mean higher bills and also that a collapse into administration would result in a negligible cost to taxpayers.",
      "In a letter to the court, the water regulator insisted that Thames would be barred from recovering any additional interest payments from customer bills.",
      "It said that it had seen \"no evidence to support\" a figure put forward by Maynard that administration would cost the government as little as \u00a366m.",
      "The regulator did not comment on Thames's estimate that it would cost taxpayers up to \u00a34bn.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed has previously said government intervention in Thames Water would \"cost billions and take years\".",
      "Separately, the trustees for some 12,000 Thames Water pension scheme members have expressed concern that they \"could be significantly and detrimentally impacted\" should the company enter administration.",
      "If Thames were to collapse, those members would likely be transferred to the lifeboat Pension Protection Fund, which provides lower future benefits than those promised by the original scheme.",
      "Thames is hoping that the additional \u00a33bn in borrowing will provide it with enough time to start addressing the many problems it has.",
      "The company has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration.",
      "But regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households will continue as normal.",
      "The company's first priority, if the loan is approved, would be to reduce its huge debt pile, by requiring lenders to accept a discount in what they are owed.",
      "Second would be to appeal a decision by Ofwat that it can only raise bills by 35% above inflation over the next five years. Thames has argued it needs to increase by 53% over the period.",
      "Its third move, which is connected to both of the above, would be to attract new investors to pump money into a business that has attracted public anger and regulatory fines.",
      "While the government, the regulator and the pension trustees are keen to avoid a collapse, there are many who think that Thames Water needs to be put out of its misery - rather than lurching from one financial and operational crisis to another.",
      "What Ofwat and the pension trustees point out is that is likely to come at a cost to both taxpayers and workers."

      "Two US judges have ordered several federal government agencies to reinstate the jobs of probationary employees fired en masse by the Trump administration last month.",
      "In California, District Judge William Alsup called the sacking of these employees part of a \"sham\" strategy that aimed to circumvent proper procedures for reducing the federal workforce.",
      "His order - which was followed by another from Maryland - applies to thousands of probationary workers who were fired at a range of departments, including defence, energy, treasury, and veterans affairs.",
      "The Department of Justice says the firings were done based on guidance - rather than a directive - from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).",
      "The BBC has contacted OPM for comment.",
      "OPM, a once-obscure agency that manages the federal government's civil service, has been thrust into the spotlight amid President Donald Trump's moves to slash the size of the federal workforce.",
      "In Thursday's hearing in San Francisco, California, Judge Alsup countered the DOJ lawyer's arguments from the bench, citing evidence including termination letters that stated the firings were carried out on OPM's instructions.",
      "\"That should not have been done in our country,\" Judge Alsup said. \"It was a sham in order to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "Danielle Leonard, a lawyer representing a coalition of government employee unions, said probationary employees were targeted because they lacked the right to appeal.",
      "During the hearing, Judge Alsup also lamented the firing of a government worker in Albuquerque, New Mexico who had been given top marks for performance but was then issued a pink slip citing performance as the cause of their termination.",
      "\"I just want to say it is a sad day when our government would fire a good employee and say it's for performance when they know good and well that's a lie,\" Judge Alsup said.",
      "Judge Alsup's order was followed by a similar ruling from Baltimore, Maryland, by District Judge James Bredar, who agreed that Trump's team had broken regulations and cast doubt on the idea that the workers had been individually sacked for unsatisfactory performances.",
      "Responding to the first ruling, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Judge Alsup of singlehandedly \"attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the executive branch\".",
      "She said that power rested with the president and \"singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the president's agenda\".",
      "\"The Trump administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order,\" she added.",
      "Elon Musk's name was not mentioned during the California hearing, but he has been tasked by President Trump with downsizing the federal workforce through the ad hoc Department of Government Efficiency - or Doge.",
      "\"He was on everybody's mind,\" said Luz Fuller, president of a local Sacramento branch of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents more than 4,500 employees in Northern California.",
      "The White House has denied that Musk is the agency's leader, although Trump labelled him as such during his Congressional address last week."

      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",

      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",

      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",

      "That followed an order earlier this month that raised levies on Chinese imports into the US to at least 20%.",
      "Trump has also threatened tariffs - which are taxes applied to goods as they enter a country - on a range of more specific items, including copper, lumber and cars.",
      "Leaders in Canada and Europe called the new metals taxes unjustified and struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products.",

      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",

      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

    "summary": "Economists say the president's import taxes could result in higher prices for a range of products in the US.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners.",
      "The tariffs apply to steel and aluminium imported to the US, as well as to some other products from Mexico, Canada and China - prompting counter-measures from the latter two countries and the European Union.",
      "Economists have warned the US tariffs - and those introduced in response by other countries - could put prices up for American consumers.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.",
      "So which things could become more expensive?",
      "Cars",
      "Some cars are among the products given a temporary reprieve by Trump from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico.",
      "When this ends, cars are expected to go up in price - by about $3,000 (\u00a32,300) according to TD Economics.",
      "That's because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",
      "Many well-known car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, General Motors and Honda trade parts and vehicles across the three countries.",
      "The cost of the higher taxes due on imported components is likely to be passed on to customers.",
      "\"Suffice it to say that disrupting these trends through tariffs... would come with significant costs,\" said TD Economics' Andrew Foran.",
      "He argued that the \"uninterrupted free trade\" which has \"existed for decades\" in the car-making sector has lowered prices for consumers.",
      "Follow live updates on Trump's tariffsWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Follow live updates on Trump's tariffs",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Beer, whisky and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "However, it's also possible that firms could decide to bring in less foreign beer.",
      "Modelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now.",
      "The picture is more complicated when it comes to spirits, which have been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s.",
      "Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\".",
      "They argue that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises.",
      "The bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in the US, Canada and Mexico.",
      "Houses",
      "The US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs.",
      "Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders urged the president to exempt building materials \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".",
      "The industry group has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Imports from the rest of the world could also be affected.",
      "On 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production.",
      "Findings are due towards the end of 2025.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "The \"most obvious\" household impact of a trade war with Canada would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.",
      "Canada's billion-dollar industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil.",
      "According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.",
      "While the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%.",
      "The US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices.",
      "Avocados",
      "Avocados thrive in in the Mexican climate.",
      "Nearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.",
      "The US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.",
      "Related dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive.",

      "Through an app, she can find where the nearest available car is, and drive off, paying by the minute - a system she finds convenient and flexible.",
      "Some providers even include parking in the price, and if she takes an electric car, it's even better, as they qualify for free parking around the city.",
      "\"The ability to move around a big city quickly, and not worry about parking, helps me have a more flexible schedule and better control of my time,\" says Ms Mackeviciute, 30, who works in communications.",
      "Yet despite being a regular car-sharing user, Ms Mackeviciute still owns a car in Kaunas, which she regularly uses for visiting family living in the countryside. And even while working in Vilnius, occasional issues with car sharing can disrupt Ms Mackeviciute's day.",
      "\"It can sometimes be hard to find a vehicle nearby. And sometimes, when you're in a rush the closest vehicle can have not one, but a few, maintenance lights on. While I do understand that fleet maintenance is a challenge, especially as a business grows, it is still disappointing,\" she says.",
      "When it comes to cars, most people feel like Ms Mackeviciute - they still want to own one.",
      "In the UK, for example, while 61% of people drive daily and 68% are worried about the rising cost of car ownership, 78% don't know what car sharing is, and fewer than 20% of Londoners would consider signing up to such a scheme, according to a report by car rental company SIXT.",
      "Despite brands like Zipcar being around since 2000, industry data shows car sharing to still be a niche service.",
      "There are just two million car sharing users in the UK, while around 35 million people still own a car.",
      "\"Consumers are still tied to exclusive access to their car. Clear scepticism about the ability for car-sharing options to provide a car to hand whenever they need it, and concerns about hassle, are the biggest issues,\" explains Felicity Latcham, associate partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants.",
      "\"This concern gets greater for families and older individuals who are particularly tied to being able to leave things in their vehicle.\"",
      "But the growing electrification of the car sharing market might be attractive to younger, eco-conscious drivers.",
      "In a 2023 McKinsey survey of 4,000 people in the UK, France and Germany, 32% of those in the Gen Z bracket said they wanted to use shared-mobility schemes more, wishing to reduce private car reliance.",
      "The survey also suggested that 50% of Gen Z also want their next car to be fully electric.",
      "The car-sharing industry is heading in that direction.",
      "Almost a quarter of European car sharing companies now offer a 100% electric fleet.",
      "A third of shared cars in the EU are electric vehicles, data from Statista shows. Meanwhile, Zipcar doubled its electric fleet in 2023 in the UK, with plans to go fully electric this year.",

      "Since July last year, users of the Bolt ride-sharing app - the Baltic states' answer to Uber - can also now book Spark vehicles.",
      "Spark founder Nerijus Dagilis is confident that the increasing availability of electric vehicles can get more people on board with car sharing, especially with the support of the city of Vilnius, which, on top of free parking for electric cars, allows them to be driven in bus lanes, too.",
      "\"Our customer pool is increasing every month, so that means we are creating a certain value for people, who prefer electric cars for sustainability reasons. It's becoming a daily habit for many people, especially families - we see more of them downsizing from two cars to one,\" says Mr Dagilis.",

      "She has kept an original private Facebook account: \"I cleanse it once a year, and check on photos and privacy of posts and where I have been tagged.\"",
      "Ms Smith has also become more aware of the terms and conditions of social media platforms.",
      "\"I follow AI trends and I know a lot of images are training AI models and we don't have ethical guidelines on how they can be used. That's another massive factor why I will never put my child on social media as the images can be used for whatever want.\"",
      "As scams become more sophisticated, research suggests that more people are concerned about the information they share online.",
      "In a report by Statista, 39% of respondents said they were worried about how companies use their online data, while a quarter (26%) admitted to using a VPN.",
      "There are a number of reasons why people might want to reduce their online profiles.",

      "\"What might be innocent information right now might be bring you into difficulties 10 years down the line, for example, if there's a change of laws, or political environment.\"",
      "Another issue is the explosion of AI, says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "\"Fraud is getting better and better, and one thing that is essential for all scams is having data,\" he says.",
      "AI is getting to the stage where it can impersonate people close to you. Add to that ability any personal information shared online, then you have a \"deadly combination\", says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "Also, information shared online about us is collected by data brokers and sold to advertisers.",
      "Mr Kaziukonis says the information is also available to scammers. \"It's the Wild West out there,\" he says.",
      "So what can we do to minimise our footprints?",
      "Firstly, it's important to think about how much information you share online.",
      "\"Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "\"It could be leaked and used against you.\" He also advises using a different email address for websites that you sign up to. \"That limits the spamming.\"",
      "It's worth remembering that under data protection law, you have the right to ask a company what data they hold on you, and request that it is deleted.",
      "\"They have to comply as otherwise they can receive huge fines,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "Gus Hosein, executive director at charity Privacy International, recommends several ways to reduce your digital footprint.",
      "He suggests using a VPN (virtual private network) which, for a price, offers a user more privacy when online.",
      "He also recommends cookie-blockers and selecting web browsers with privacy controls.",
      "What you need to know about cookiesWhat is a VPN service?",
      "What you need to know about cookies",
      "What is a VPN service?",
      "\"The underlying solution remains that we must keep the pressure on our governments to have strong laws to protect everyone,\" Mr Hosein says.",
      "Karen Renaud is a computing scientist at the University of Strathclyde  working on security and privacy.",
      "Last year she studied 15 privacy policy documents, which lay out what a company is going to do with your data.",
      "She found that the most complicated of them would take 32 minutes to read and would require college-level education to understand.",
      "\"The situation is pretty dire,\" she says.",
      "She advises it's a good idea to clear out the cookies on your browser from time to time, and reduce the cookies you accept.",
      "\"Also, you can stop some tracking. Google, for example, makes it possible to prevent tracking of your searches.\"",
      "Some people turn to services such as DeleteMe and Surfshark, which help remove personal information from data brokers.",
      "Amanda Unterreiner, product manager at US-based data removal service DeleteMe, says high-profile individuals like video gamers and judges use their service as a safety measure.",
      "\"In the case of judges\u2026 because if they're announcing some decision, someone might show up at their house.\"",
      "She also mentions the case of the killing earlier last year of United Healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson.",
      "\"Stories like that kind of spark regular people to think I better get protected.\"",
      "Ms Unterreiner went through the process of having her data removed when she joined the company.",
      "\"You could see every other place I had ever lived, every phone number I've ever had, every email address, on the first page of Google. If someone wanted to steal my identity\u2026 they would be able to cause some real personal damage.\"",
      "The company also offers a service to mask your house on Google Maps.",
      "\"You can look at street view, but that particular property will just be kind of very pixelated.\"",
      "There's multiple reasons why Saam Collingwood, who lives near Stratford-upon-Avon, has cut back her online profile over the years.",
      "The first was following an incident at work where she had included her personal Facebook account on an email to a client and her employer was unhappy.",
      "\"They were able to see photos from a night out,\" she says. \"That didn't go down too well.\"",
      "In another incident she was trolled by a stranger online after posting a video of herself learning a dance routine on YouTube.",
      "Plus, rising online fraud convinced her to further reduce her online profile.",
      "She hasn't completely erased her online presence but she no longer posts regularly on Facebook, reducing it about twice a year.",
      "\"I don't like it when people tag me, people knowing I'm not at home. Most times I remove the tag.\"",
      "She says she has upgraded her anti-virus and security software with a service from online security firm Norton.",

      "\"I miss seeing old friends [on Facebook] and people I would contact once or twice year,\" says Ms Smith.",

      "An ornate platter of food catches the corner of my eye.",
      "\"That is a seafood tower as a welcome food amenity, as well as caviar, and you can also see the champagne there for guests to enjoy,\" says Dana Pouwels, head of airport lounge benefits at US bank Chase.",
      "She is showing me around Chase's new Sapphire Lounge at New York's La Guardia Airport.",
      "This is what waiting to catch a flight can look like these days \u2013 if you can afford to pay $550 (\u00a3433) a year to have the correct credit card required to gain entry.",
      "Then once inside Chase's new La Guardia lounge you can then choose to pay up to $3,000 to access a private suite for a few hours.",
      "BBC Business Daily: the battle of the VIP lounges",
      "It is all part of what has been described as a global arms race among the credit card companies that you are probably entirely unaware of \u2013 they are competing to outdo each other with bigger, better, bolder airport lounges.",
      "And while most of us don't have access to these lounges, experts say we are almost certainly helping pay for them. And they don't come cheap.",
      "\"Yes, it's an arms race, and they're getting extraordinary,\" says Clint Thompson, the news editor at the flight and travel website The Points Guy. \"From what we do know, we're talking up to tens of millions of dollars per lounge.",
      "\"Like the new [American Express-owned] Centurion lounge in Atlanta, I believe they spent about $100m to make that happen.\"",
      "Airport lounges aren't a new concept, and credit card issuers have long teamed up with airlines to offer branded credit cards with lounge access.",
      "But now the card issuers are building lounges themselves, as a way of directly appealing to card holders - and potential new customers too.",
      "JP Morgan Chase, American Express, Capital One, they're all now in the lounge - and lifestyle - business.",
      "For American Express this includes opening a high-end lounge in midtown Manhattan.",
      "Its Centurion New York venue is located on the 55th floor of a skyscraper, with floor to ceiling windows offering sweeping views of New York, and fine dining and private bars.",
      "It's designed for Centurion card holders \u2013 a card which will cost you $10,000 as a signing on fee, plus $5,000 a year. And it is invite-only to get one.",
      "\"We're more than a credit card company or a charge card company, it's more a lifestyle brand, getting you special access to concerts, getting you into restaurants,\" says Audrey Hendley, the head of global travel at American Express.",
      "The card issuers have even moved into a 21st Century staple, the coffee shop.",
      "Capital One have Capital One Caf\u00e9s - now you have a barista in a bank.",
      "Their branch in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington DC has all the classic signs of the hip coffee shop - exposed vents, bare brick walls, barista coffee machine.",
      "The only immediate giveaway you might be in the bank is the neon Capital One sign on the wall and their branded touch screens. Look a bit closer, and you might spot one of their casually dressed people who looks like a customer, but is actually what Capital One calls their ambassadors, here to welcome you in and help you with all your banking needs.",
      "Anyone can use the caf\u00e9, but hold a Capital One card and you get money off your brew.",
      "\"We're creating a showroom for our products,\" says Shaun Rowley the director of Capital One Cafes.",
      "\"For customers to come in and see Capital One in action, to touch it, to smell it and even taste it with our cafes. And watching them walk out, as you know, raving fans and advocates for us is kind of the return that we're looking for.\"",
      "None of this sounds like the sort of language you hear normally hear from financial institutions.",
      "Dan Bennett is the head of behavioural science the ad giant Ogilvy. He says this is all about brands tapping into how people think about themselves, and other people.",
      "\"Yeah, it is a piece of plastic with the chip in it that holds your money, but it is something that actually gives you a position in society,\" he says. \"It is something that says something about who you are. It is something that can make you feel elevated.",
      "\"The credit card firms are not just building rooms at airports, they're building a sense of self. It's kind of amazing that financial services companies have managed to kind of look at some deep-core human drivers, and then build experiences around that.",
      "\"And that's why they're so successful with them, because they've managed to find the psychological levers to pull, rather than just looking at the world through a rational lens.\"",
      "But even if you're never going to get access to these places, you are ultimately still paying for them, according to Lulu Wang. He's assistant professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University near Chicago, and has studied how card payment systems work.",
      "He points out that credit cards are more expensive for merchants, be they retailers, or bars and restaurants to accept than debit cards as they incur a higher processing fee.",
      "Prof Wang says merchants are likely to put up prices to cover the additional cost of people using credit cards.",
      "\"We typically think that corporations, you know, they're facing higher costs, they're going to pass on a pretty substantial share of those costs onto consumers,\" he explains.",
      "\"If we impose all these costs on the merchant, it ends up being a cost that is ultimately borne by all of us as consumers. Well-off people get to use the high merchant fee, high reward cards, and then it's the rest of society that has to bear that cost.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 22:16:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but his experience managing global economic crises will help.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "Mr Drew says the school benefits from its good reputation, and that word of mouth is \"the single best recruiter\" of new teachers.",
      "Recent bursary changes in some shortage subjects has increased the supply of teachers in some areas. Starting salaries also recently increased to \u00a330,000, while teachers received an average pay rise of 5.5% last year, fully funded by the government.",

      "For primary schools, the number of teacher trainees has fallen from 94% of the government's target last year, to 88% this year, according to DfE figures.",
      "And in secondary schools, though the number of teachers has grown by 3% since 2015, pupil numbers have grown by 15% in the same time - meaning the number of students in class sizes above 30 has increased.",
      "The NFER's school workforce lead, Jack Worth, says more students are now being taught by unqualified or non-specialist teachers, with the impact felt more acutely by students living in disadvantaged areas.",
      "\"The spending review in June is a real now or never moment. Not taking that opportunity will really risk not delivering [on the 6,500 promise] and not having anything to show the electorate at the end of the parliament.\"",

      "New and expectant fathers should have the same protections from redundancy as mothers, a Labour MP has said.",
      "Currently, mothers who are pregnant or on maternity leave have some legal protection from being made redundant - but fathers on paternity leave do not.",
      "Speaking during a debate on the government's Employment Rights Bill, Lola McEvoy said that \"lack of protection\" means some fathers \"can't even take what they're entitled to\" when it comes to paternity leave.",
      "A spokesperson for the government said it is carrying out a wider review of parental leave, including making paternity leave and unpaid parental leave day one rights, which employees qualify for on their first day of a new job.",
      "Speaking during a debate on the Employment Rights Bill - dubbed the biggest upgrade to workplace rights in a generation - McEvoy said \"dads taking paternity leave are left out\" from the existing protections, leaving families vulnerable.",
      "The only way fathers are currently protected from redundancy is if they opt to take shared parental leave. But analysis from campaign group The Dad Shift suggests that was used in fewer than 2% of all births last year.",
      "Campaigners want the law to be changed to give fathers taking paternity leave enhanced protection from redundancy from the moment they tell their employer they are expecting a child, until the baby is 18 months old.",
      "Fathers whose jobs are closing would be offered a suitable alternative vacancy if there is one.",
      "\"My generation and those younger than me are the keenest yet for more family time, but our primary concern has got to be paying the bills,\" McEvoy said.",
      "Chris Stringer, from Swansea, said protection from losing his job would have been a huge help to him and his wife.",
      "He was made redundant six weeks before his son Chester was born in August last year and hasn't been able to find full-time employment since.",
      "Chris said it destroyed the family's feelings of financial security ahead of the birth, as well as their hopes of buying a home.",
      "\"That life was gone, like that. Everything changed,\" he said.",
      "He said it severely damaged his mental health too, which was made worse by the sleep deprivation of being a new parent.",
      "\"It was pretty rough, pretty dark at times and I had some quite scary thoughts,\" he said.",
      "\"I went through those thoughts at three in the morning, holding my child, just crying.\"",
      "Although he has found part-time work in a shop, Chris said it won't be enough to fund childcare costs for him and his partner, who is having to return to work early to support the family.",
      "\"If there was a safety net there to keep us afloat for even just a little bit longer, it would have made a huge difference,\" he said.",
      "'Our lives have been shaken up'",
      "One woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, said her partner was made redundant when she was 36 weeks pregnant.",
      "\"I stayed awake at night crying because I was afraid of what was going to happen to my family,\" she said.",
      "Two weeks later, the couple lost their baby daughter.",
      "She said: \"While we were at the hospital, he was responding to emails from the lawyers saying: 'We have just had a stillbirth.'\"",
      "She said her partner then had to look for work at the same time as supporting her.",
      "\"He didn't have time to process what had happened to us,\" she said.",
      "\"The whole of our lives have been shaken up.\"",
      "He has since found a new job, but several months on he is still \"in a very dark place\".",
      "\"My partner is now battling his own fight while being in a new job where very few people know what has happened to him,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm asking for measures to be taken to protect men, protect fathers, protect women, protect mothers [and] protect babies' lives.\"",
      "'Dads are left out'",
      "The Dad Shift estimates roughly one in 60 new and expectant fathers in the UK were made redundant, dismissed or forced to leave their jobs due to poor treatment in the year to March 2024 - almost 3,700 people.",
      "The Dad Shift's co-founder, George Gabriel, said the stories he hears are often \"absolutely gut-wrenching\".",
      "He added the UK's statutory paternity leave of two weeks is the least generous in Europe and Labour has the \"opportunity to put this right and for the party to prove they're on the side of working dads and families\".",
      "But Pregnant Then Screwed, a charity which supports the rights of pregnant women and new mothers, said the current law does not always stop mothers being fired.",
      "Analysis published last month by the charity estimates that up to 74,000 women a year lose their jobs after getting pregnant or while on maternity leave \u2013 up by more than a third since 2016.",
      "Pregnant Then Screwed founder Joeli Brearley said she had \"long suspected things are getting worse, not better\".",
      "A spokesperson for the government said: \"We are making paternity leave and unpaid parental leave day one rights as part of our Employment Rights Bill, and are also carrying out a review of wider statutory parental leave to ensure it offers the best possible support to working families.\"",

    "story": [
      "Parents who are worried about their children being on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.",
      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Responding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.",
      "\"There are parental controls, and our users would urge constant parental supervision,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"But we all know that with the best will in the world life sometimes gets in the way.",
      "\"If you've got multiple children you're looking after and things happen, and you probably can't 24/7 watch everything they're doing, even if you've got all your parental controls set.\"",
      "Ellie Gibson - from the Scummy Mummies podcast - said Mr Baszucki's message risked sounding \"a bit of a get out\".",
      "\"It's much easier said than done, especially when all their friends are playing it,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Gaming giant",
      "US-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.",
      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",
      "Safety filters bypassed",
      "However, the BBC was able to create two fake accounts, one aged 15 and one aged 27, on unlinked devices and exchange messages between the two.",
      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",
      "We also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP''Special Forces Simulator'''Squid Game''Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP'",
      "'Special Forces Simulator''",
      "'Squid Game'",
      "'Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "When we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.",
      "\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.",
      "He insists that when Roblox rates experience, they go through rigorous guidelines and that the company has a \"consistent policy\" on that.",
      "How can you keep your child safe online?",
      "Plan to make phone use safer for teens watered down",
      "Mr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.",
      "Mr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.",
      "\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.",
      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",
      "Mr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.",
      "He says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.",
      "\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.",
      "But despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.",
      "Players buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.",
      "Mr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.",
      "Robux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).",
      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",
      "Mr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.",
      "He describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.",
      "They have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.",
      "Asked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"",
      "We finish our time together playing a couple of his favourite games: Natural Disaster Survival and Dress to Impress.",
      "We use his account and he's constantly recognised by other players \u2014 but we still get smashed to pieces by a blizzard outside the Natural Disasters mansion.",

      "Earlier this year, Cardiff University announced plans to cut 400 academic jobs and other Welsh institutions also said they would be seeking redundancies in order to balance the books.",

      "He said Medr did not have the powers to tell a university \"that you can't delete subject X or you have to do subject Y\" but it could advise the government where a subject may be \"vulnerable\".",

    "story": [
      "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.",
      "Film critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.",
      "It is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".",
      "Paste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".",
      "There have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".",
      "But overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.",
      "Critics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday.",
      "It fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.",
      "\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.",
      "Sandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".",
      "\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.",
      "Bad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"",
      "While a critic's job is to analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.",
      "The Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.",
      "It also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.",
      "The Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.",
      "The film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.",
      "And it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.",
      "The streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements.",
      "\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.",
      "\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"",
      "Red Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.",
      "Other recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.",
      "Brooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.",
      "They are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.",
      "In December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".",
      "\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.",
      "\"But it does depend on the movie.\"",
      "Netflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.",
      "Another critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.",
      "\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.",
      "\"But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners.",

      "Clueless has been brought to the stage by the film's original writer and director Amy Heckerling - who says keeping the 90s theme was integral to the show.",
      "Heckerling insists she has \"no interest in being modern\" - which will come as a relief to the audiences who grew up quoting \"As if!\" and aspiring to Cher's plaid and Prada-filled wardrobe.",
      "The story follows the life of the na\u00efve and lovably spoiled teenager, who plays matchmaker with her friends before ultimately finding love herself.",
      "An adaption of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless captured the teen spirit of the 90s and inspired countless school dramas like Mean Girls, Gossip Girl and Legally Blonde.",
      "The stage version has songs in the form of an original score by singer-songwriter KT Tunstall.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Tunstall says the film was \"omnipotent\" in the 90s and influenced everything from the clothes people wore to the music people listened to.",
      "The Scottish singer, best known for songs like Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Suddenly I See, says working on the show was a \"dream project\".",
      "She says the original soundtrack was a big inspiration, and describes the music as \"a mixtape of all your favourite 90s bangers\".",
      "The process of creating the soundtrack for Clueless: The Musical was intense for Tunstall, who says it's no easy feat to add music to an adaptation of a film that didn't originally have it.",
      "\"You really have to think about whether a song fits the structure and flow of the story and whether it actually helps the audience understand the narrative better,\" she says.",

      "\"Those types of films weren't very common in the 90s but I'm glad we could add in music now,\" she says.",
      "Critics had mixed thoughts about the new songs - the Guardian called them \"disappointingly flat-footed\" in a two-star review and said the lyrics \"too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama\".",
      "Similarly, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote that the show has \"numbers designed to sound in keeping with the period but which are so generic they don't ring with real-world authenticity\".",
      "But What'sOnStage praised Tunstall's \"infuriatingly catchy tunes\" and Glenn Slater's \"nifty, witty lyrics\".",
      "For Emma Flynn, who is making her West End debut as Cher, the music has another important function in the show - it allows characters to easily share their inner thoughts with the audience.",
      "\"In the film you hear these really funny inner monologues of Cher, but the great thing about this show is you can hear all of the character's thoughts, which makes you feel more connected to them.\"",
      "Flynn has been praised by critics, with the Evening Standard noting her \"powerfully-sung breakout performance\" and describing it as channelling \"both Alicia Silverstone in the original movie and Sabrina Carpenter today, while making the role entirely her own\".",
      "Co-star Keelan McAuley, who plays nerdy Josh, tells the BBC he loves the play's nostalgia factor.",

      "Nostalgia fest",
      "The show stays almost entirely true to the 1995 film, with everyone sporting the latest 90s fashions, carrying a glitzy pager, and listening to angsty teen bangers on a Walkman.",
      "While it may feel like a nostalgia fest, Heckerling admits she doesn't \"like to stick to real life\", and even her sunny film was far from the reality of what the 90s were like for most teenagers in LA, with race riots and other political problems.",
      "The Independent's three-star review says the show \"sticks to the original movie like chewing gum to the underside of a school desk\" at first, but changes tack by the second half.",
      "\"[Director Rachel] Kavanaugh and Heckerling gain the confidence to part ways a bit from the movie's script, and to let the story's heart show,\" Alice Saville wrote.",
      "For Tunstall, what sets Clueless apart from traditional rom-coms and high school dramas is that there isn't a typical villain and there's no nastiness or bad intentions from the main characters.",
      "Jane Austen famously thought her main character wouldn't be a widely liked heroine, but Tunstall says she is often people's favourite character because of her honesty and depth.",
      "\"People can relate to her on a deeper level, like how she is trying to process the death of her mother and help keep her family in order.",

Apart from McVeigh, who was appointed a chief presenter on the BBC News channel in February 2024, the others will not return to the full presenter roles they had and then lost in the restructuring recruitment process, which sparked two years of attrition.",
      "Through that lens, it looks like a stalemate.",
      "The losers, though, are licence fee payers who have seen hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on BBC presenters who were off work on full pay for at least a year, on top of whatever the costs of this settlement add up to. That may never be made public.",
      "The pressure is on to justify the financial waste.",
      "Why did it take so long to reach an agreement?",
      "Both sides were entrenched. For two years, they were in conflict, with the presenters off screen for half of that time.",
      "Contracts are binding. Employees remain on full pay while internal disputes are resolved. But this one took a long time, and they continued to fight when they returned to work. Only, on the brink of the tribunal, was there a resolution.",
      "The BBC will have had licence fee payers in mind when weighing up whether to proceed to a full tribunal or settle. It apparently decided it wasn't worth going through three damaging weeks, with all the headlines and media attention that would have generated.",
      "A settlement is always likely to bring down costs. The impact of a tribunal can be substantial, and there is also the potential for appeals and further hearings that increase the financial impact.",
      "But the optics of the last two years, ending in a settlement, aren't good. And there is frustration inside the BBC about the impact of it all, at a time when budgets are shrinking."

      "Dwarfism debate",
      "The debate around the film began making headlines in January 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, an actor with Dwarfism, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney has used computer-generated dwarfs in the remake and said it would \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\".",

      "Zegler also called the original film \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power,\" adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Elsewhere, fans have speculated that there may have been a behind-the-scenes rift between Zegler and Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, because the actresses have opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",

      "There is no word yet on which character she might play, but fans have speculated she could be introduced as X-Men mutant Jean Grey.",
      "The reports have not yet been confirmed by Marvel Studios or Sony Pictures, who are due to release the film in July 2026.",
      "In Hollywood, it's normal for casting news to be reported in trade publications before the studio confirms it.",
      "This can be for a variety of reasons - it may be that an actor is in final talks but has not yet signed on the dotted line, or casting news is sometimes leaked by the studio to see how fans will respond, or by an actor's agent to generate excitement.",

      "The most recent Spider-Man film, 2021's No Way Home, was a huge box office success, grossing $1.9bn worldwide.",

      "As a result, Holland's Spider-Man decided to complete Doctor Strange's spell that erases his identity from the world, meaning his girlfriend MJ (Zendaya) and friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) would forget he had ever existed.",
      "Given the way the plot is likely to develop, Deadline said there would porbably be several new actors such as Sink added to the ensemble cast as a new collection of characters are brought in.",
      "Holland is currently filming The Odyssey, the latest film from Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan, but is expected to move on to Spider-Man when shooting concludes.",
      "Sink's reported casting comes after she finished shooting the final season of Stranger Things, the horror series that has been one of Netflix's biggest hits since its launch in 2016.",
      "The show helped launch or boost the careers of several young stars, including Sink, Millie Bobby Brown, Noah Schnapp and Finn Wolfhard.",

      "\"There's not a world where I could sit here and try and justify it, you know, there was no reason, there was no need for me to be out there behaving like that.\"",
      "She adds that she \"wasn't thinking about the girls on the shop floor\" and \"wasn't thinking about anybody else other than myself\".",
      "The documentary-maker spent eight months looking into the rise in shoplifting in the UK - and says \"shoplifting has never been more prolific than it is now\".",
      "And this comes as retail theft and violence and abuse towards shop workers is rising, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC).",
      "Based on the latest weighted BRC-Opinium survey with 2,000 participants, the BRC estimates almost a quarter (24%) of the UK population witnessed shoplifting in the 12 months to February 2025.",
      "In Meet the Shoplifters, Dooley asks shoplifters about their motivations. Some see it as an act of defiance against big corporations, while others say they find it \"really degrading\" but do it to get things like nappies and milk for their children.",
      "One shoplifter Dooley spoke to, for example, was a mother stealing milk and bread to feed her child. \"She was riddled with guilt,\" Dooley says of the mother. \"It was out of sheer desperation.\"",
      "Tom Holder from the BRC says shoplifting in the UK is becoming worse and worse, adding: \"We're now just reaching new heights. People think that they can get away with it, without consequence.\"",
      "The recent BRC survey also estimates 23% of customers witnessed the physical or verbal abuse of shop staff in the year to February 2025. This can include racial or sexual abuse, physical assault or threats with weapons.",
      "Dooley spoke to retail worker Dips, who works in a cosmetics store in Manchester, and says \"as each year has gone on, it's got worse for us\".",
      "\"It's not a victimless crime. Somebody always pays the price for it down the line. And for us, it's the staff in here,\" she adds.",
      "Dooley also explains how shoplifting is being documented on social media. \"We've seen shop assistants be, you know, verbally abused, physically abused,\" she says.",
      "Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, adds that while an incident can be \"over in a matter of seconds\", it can have \"life-long consequences\" on those who experience it, making them think twice about visiting their local high streets.",
      "When speaking to shoplifters, Dooley says some of them \"don't even see it as a crime, necessarily\".",
      "And she adds that on social media, some people use hashtags to offer other shoplifters advice.",
      "But shoplifting cost UK retailers \u00a32bn in one year, according to a recent estimate.",

      "However, the claims against the Oscar winner have now been removed from the lawsuit, according to US media.",
      "When the action was filed in February, the actor's lawyers called them \"frivolous\", saying: \"Mr Cage does not control Weston's behaviour in any manner and is not responsible for Weston's alleged assault of his mother.\"",

    "summary": "The figures come as debate continues about how much money artists and songwriters receive in royalties.",
    "story": [
      "Spotify paid the music industry $10bn (\u00a37.7bn) in 2024, which the streaming service said was the highest annual payment from any single retailer in history.",
      "But the figures come as a heated debate continues about how much money artists and songwriters receive in royalties.",
      "Earlier this year, several Grammy-nominated songwriters boycotted an awards event hosted by Spotify in a row about their streaming earnings.",
      "As the new figures were published, a spokesperson for Spotify said the responsibility for distributing the money it pays lay with record labels and publishers.",
      "The company said it pays royalties to rights holders, adding that it does not have \"visibility\" on where the money ultimately goes because earnings are based on artists' individual contracts with their labels.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"Spotify does not pay artists or songwriters directly. We pay rights-holders, these are typically record labels, music publishers, collection societies.",
      "\"These rights-holders then pay artists and songwriters based on their individual agreements.\"",
      "The amount of money earned by artists will vary, but the BPI noted the average royalty rate for UK artists signed to major labels was around 26%, according to a 2021 study from the Competition and Markets Authority.",
      "As a result, the performer ultimately earns about 16% of a stream's overall value.",
      "However, Spotify is not the only streaming service to generate revenue for artists, and many pop stars make more money from other income streams such as live tours.",
      "Spotify said more than two-thirds of all music revenue goes \"straight to the recording and publishing rights-holders\", and added that, like other streamers, Spotify does not pay on a per-stream basis.",
      "The annual figures were published in Spotify's Loud and Clear report - part of the company's aim to provide transparency on how it pays the music industry.",
      "The amount Spotify paid this year was an increase on the more than $9bn (\u00a37bn) it handed over in 2023.",
      "The report highlighted that the number of artists generating annual royalties between $1,000 (\u00a3770) and $10m had tripled since 2017.",
      "Taylor Swift was named Spotify's top artist globally with more than 26 billion streams, in the year she released her double-length album The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology.",
      "Swift herself was part of the debate about streaming royalties in 2014, when she removed her music from Spotify as part of a boycott, eventually re-joining the platform in 2017.",
      "More recent artist boycotts have generally been prompted by other factors, such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell removing their music over the streamer's employment of podcast host Joe Rogan. Both artists returned to the platform last year.",
      "But dissatisfaction over streaming royalties continues.",
      "A large-scale survey of musicians in Europe carried out last year found that about 70% were unhappy with the amount they were paid in streaming revenue.",

      "They are part of an exhibition at Ulster University for the Children's Festival.",
      "Mr Marshall told BBC News NI that the models, which are made from cardboard, have a cross generational appeal.",
      "\"Children appreciate the miniature dolls house type model making, adults appreciate the skill that goes into making them, and older people who may remember when some of these places still stood.\"",
      "Lockdown project",
      "\"It all started as a lockdown project,\" Mr Marshall told BBC News NI.",
      "\"I started working on a model of the Grand Opera House as part of the heritage exhibition and through doing that got interested in looking at all the other theatres that aren't about anymore.\"",
      "The models are \"mostly made of different types of cardboard, like mounting card or coloured paper and then they're glued together\".",
      "\"The Hippodrome was the most complicated and detailed one I've made, it took me around six weeks to make.\"",
      "He said he mostly works from old photographs, but it can be hard to get enough accurate detail because \"with a black and white photograph that you can't move around, it's basically static\".",
      "When photographs of the old theatres are not available or poor quality, Mr Marshall refers to old newspaper articles which sometimes have written descriptions of what materials the theatre was built from and how it appeared.",
      "The Alhambra - 'quite a rowdy place'",
      "Opening in the early 1870s, the Alhambra was Belfast's first music hall and was a \"real spit on the floor type joint\", according to Mr Marshall.",
      "\"In the early days, the Alhambra was more of a variety house, and I've heard that it wasn't the most enticing establishment, quite a rowdy place.",
      "\"The Alhambra didn't cater for the more refined clientele,\" he added.",
      "A typical bill from the early days of the Alhambra shows performances which \"would nowadays be contentious\" included events such as a minstrel show and a Japanese troupe.",
      "\"I've seen other things listed, which were more overtly racist, but that was kind of the way at the time,\" he added.",
      "To adapt to the evolution of mass entertainment, the Alhambra converted to a full time cinema house in 1936.",
      "Between the late 1800s and it's closure in 1959, the Alhambra suffered four separate fires.",
      "The Theatre Royal - 'higher class establishment'",
      "The Theatre Royal was Belfast's original high-end theatre, opening in the late 1700s with a capacity of just over 1,000.",
      "The building was demolished and rebuilt a number of times.",
      "\"As these places go, they kept getting burnt down or demolished and rebuilt again - there's always a renewal aspect to them.\"",
      "The Theatre Royal was to be Belfast's \"higher class establishment\", which in the end became \"a mixed-use building of shops and place called the 'boom boom room', which was like a dance hall upstairs, which then became the starlight ballroom upstairs\".",
      "\"Now,  there's a little Starbucks in the corner where the building stood,\" he added.",
      "The Empire - 'stayed true to theatre'",
      "Not to be mistaken with the pub and music hall on Botanic Avenue, The Empire Theatre was situated on Victoria Square and opened to the public in 1894.",
      "According to Mr Marshall, the Empire \"operated at a similar time to the Alhambra from the 1890s up until the early 1960s, and then it was it was knocked down.",
      "\"It was eventually replaced by a Little Woods department store, which has been redeveloped again and again, until finally becoming Victoria Square shopping centre.\"",
      "While it did adapt to the growing popularity of cinema, The Empire \"stayed true to theatre for all of its life\", Mr Marshall said.",
      "The Hippodrome - 'Cinema in mind'",
      "The Hippodrome was \"more fiddly [model to make] than some of the other ones\".",
      "Mr Marshall describes how there aren't too many quality photographs of the Hippodrome, so he \"had to use his judgement\" when designing the model in terms of colour scheme and scale.",
      "Coming quite late, the \"Hippodrome was was built in 1907 originally with a cinema in mind\" as to take full advantage of the advent of modern cinema and growing popularity of picture shows.",
      "The Ritz - 'The Stones, The Beatles...'",
      "\"And then there was the Ritz...\" which opened in 1938.",
      "The Ritz was, according to Mr Marshall, \"a giant cinema more or less, but it called itself the Ritz Theatre\". However, it did produce shows as part of the night's entertainment.",
      "\"They would have a brass band, dancers or a ballet, and then a film at the end.\"",
      "\"It also did huge concerts, people like the Stones, The Beatles and Billy Connolly all performed at the Ritz during their time,\" he added.",
      "It was the biggest in Northern Ireland at the time, with just over 2,000 capacity.",
      "The Ritz was damaged by bombs hidden in the seats and the theatres interior and roof was destroyed in 1977.",

    "story": [
      "Actor Gene Hackman was alone.",
      "The two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals.",
      "Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.",
      "If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.",
      "Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.",
      "The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.",
      "Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.",
      "Their remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate.",
      "But a police investigation found no foul play.",
      "Instead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions.",
      "\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.",
      "She noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act.",
      "\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.",
      "Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.",
      "Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.",
      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",
      "\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"",
      "Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.",
      "\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.",
      "Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.",
      "Jeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.",

    "summary": "The Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni feud has shone a light on a part of the entertainment industry that many of those within it would rather remain invisible.",
    "story": [
      "The lawsuits between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni have shed light on a secretive group of people in Hollywood who operate behind the scenes to keep a lid on fallouts and scandals. But in recent years their role has shifted - and their challenges multiplied",
      "Listen to Steven read this article.",
      "\"She's a phony, but I guess the public likes that\u2026\" This is the line that actress Joan Crawford is said to have declared about film star Bette Davis.",
      "The back-and-forth sniping between the pair played out in public in the 1930s and 40s. \"Bette is a survivor... She survived herself,\" Crawford also apparently remarked.",
      "Their tempestuous relationship was so notorious that in 2017 it was made into an Emmy award-winning TV series, Feud.",
      "Hollywood rivalries are of course nothing new \u2013 yet conflicts today rarely play out so publicly. That might be why the dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, which spilled out into the open in December 2024, is still in the headlines three months on.",
      "The subsequent legal battle brought to light a fallout during production of the film It Ends With Us. After the promotional and cinematic run had ended, the pair \u2013 who didn't appear on the red carpet together at the premiere in New York \u2013 filed lawsuits against each other.",
      "Lively has accused Baldoni and others of carrying out a smear campaign against her after she complained about alleged sexual harassment on set. Baldoni, meanwhile, has accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist of carrying out a smear campaign against him, and claims that she tried to take over control of the film. Both sides deny all allegations.",
      "What emerged as this all played out is that crisis PR managers had been employed. Legal representatives for Lively obtained numerous text messages between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and the crisis team he retained, led by Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake. Ms Nathan was alleged to have texted Ms Abel, \"You know we can bury anyone.\"",
      "Lively has now reportedly taken on the CIA's former deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro to advise on her legal communications strategy.",
      "While the outcomes of the lawsuits remain to be seen, the feud has cast the spotlight on an industry that would ordinarily remain largely invisible: that is, the publicity machine at work behind the scenes in Hollywood.",
      "\"On every set, there are fights, liaisons\u2026 there are all sorts of things that go on,\" explains Richard Rushfield, founder and columnist at Hollywood newsletter The Ankler. \"Hollywood is a world full of very messy people coming together for these giant projects, where they put together teams quickly to make these things and disband immediately after.",
      "\"Between all that a lot of stuff goes on, and they deal with it quietly \u2013 they're very obsessive about controlling the narrative. When this stuff explodes into the public, beyond control, it makes everyone very nervous.\"",
      "But the world of the Hollywood PR has shifted in recent years, partly because of the growth of social media, which has changed the relationship between celebrities and fans, bringing them into direct contact and removing some of the mystique.",
      "So, what does that mean for the people whose job it is to keep a lid on the industry's messy reality?",
      "From Tom Hardy to Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "Few fallouts have spilled out into the open in recent years \u2013 and those that did were picked over simply because they're so rare. Actor Dwayne Johnson revealed \"a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating\" with his Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel, in a 2018 interview.",
      "The stars of another action film, Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, are reported to have filmed many of their scenes separately.",
      "And then there were the alleged tensions between Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker, who were co-stars of Sex and the City, which ran for six years. In 2018, after Parker offered condolences for Cattrall's brother's death, Cattrall responded on social media, calling Parker a \"hypocrite\" and stating, \"You are not my family. You are not my friend.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hundreds of other spats will never see the light of day. \"Some of a publicist's best work may never be seen,\" says Daniel Bee, a publicist and brand consultant based in Los Angeles, \"because it stopped something that was wrong, or re-crafted something to a different narrative, or pointed the light in a different direction.",
      "\"The most interesting stuff I've ever done as a publicist is the stuff nobody will ever know about.\"",
      "'Powerful forces at play'",
      "Since Daniel Bee started out as an entertainment publicist in 1997, he has observed a shift in the wider industry. \"I started my career in the British media, there were 11 national newspapers competing with each other. It was a bear pit, hard work, and it was getting to know individuals via relationships.",
      "\"Now, you're up against an anonymous algorithm and accounts where you don't know who you're up against. It's harder to control than ever before.\"",
      "Certainly, social media has posed challenges for those attempting to control narratives around major films and their stars \u2013 while also heralding new forms of \"dark arts\" through which publicists can attempt to shape opinion.",
      "Dating apps could be in trouble \u2013 here's what might take their place",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "Sneaky Britain? How our moral compasses are changing",
      "\"There has always been an army of advisors and consultants doing PR voodoo,\" says Eriq Gardner, entertainment law expert and founding partner of Puck News. \"While I'd love to say the public is media-literate and savvy enough to read between the lines to see the spin, the truth is there are a lot of powerful forces at play and sometimes a large amount of misinformation.\"",
      "So-called PR voodoo is different now that a celebrity \u2013 or their fans \u2013 can access an audience of millions with a click.",
      "While the publicists of previous eras might only have had to worry about print and broadcast platforms, smartphones and social media mean today's digital landscape is a wild west where anyone can shape their own narrative. A badly judged post or comment can damage an actor's career.",
      "But the flipside is a whole new medium in which PRs can practise their \"voodoo\".",
      "Astroturfing and ways to 'cause mischief'",
      "One of the tactics is \"astroturfing\" \u2013 or disguising an orchestrated campaign as a spontaneous up-swelling of public opinion.",
      "This works by manipulating public opinion and creating a false impression of grassroots support (hence the name) or opposition, often coordinated through social media accounts in a way that seems organic.",
      "The practice isn't new, but has been given new life with the advent of social media algorithms.",
      "\"It's deliberately planting disinformation, or twisted versions of the truth, in certain sections of social media,\" says Carla Speight, founder of the PR Mastery app. \"The aim is the halfway point of influential where they will get a bit of traction, but so that it's not too obvious \u2013 you wouldn't hire a Kardashian to do it.",
      "\"It's built up in layers,\" she continues. \"It's like playing a very sinister game of chess. You're putting all the pieces in the right places, just the right amount of mixed-up information, and then you just watch it explode.\"",
      "Although the posts might appear to be genuine public opinion, in fact it's a faked crowd \u2013 whether that's made up of bots or real people, who can be paid to coordinate their posts.",
      "\"All it takes is one or two people to create a meme and put it with the right people,\" says Ms Speight. \"It needs to appear as a trend, and then it's gone. Something is dripped here, something else over there, and when it's done well\u2026 it causes a bit of mischief.\"",
      "Reinventing an age-old tactic?",
      "But all of this is simply a new platform for an age-old trend that has been going on long before the advent of social media, according to Mr Bee. \"Undetected smear campaigns have always been a thing,\" he points out.",
      "\"Previously it would have been a publicist whispering to a diarist of a national newspaper. The issue with digital media is it's anonymous and untraceable.\"",
      "What has changed, he continues, is that audiences have become savvier. \"Whereas before, a quite subservient audience would just take what was given to them in the media, with natural scepticism, curiosity, and a greater level of information, I think people use more critical thinking.\"",
      "Eriq Gardner is less convinced: \"I'm not sure the public approaches what they read with enough scepticism.\"",
      "And yet those in the industry are often alert to it. According to Ms Speight, \"Usually, there's a distinct sort of tell, and it may be the PR thing where we have 'spidey senses' and we can sort of see it, but you're asking, 'Where has that come from? Who started that?' And when there's never a specific place to point it to, that's usually a tell-tale sign.\"",
      "The Hollywood ecosystem",
      "What's clear, though, is that, with studios providing some publications with significant advertising revenue, as well as supplying talent for special events and front covers, revelations often emerge elsewhere in the media.",
      "\"When [scandals] come out, it's usually from places outside of Hollywood,\" argues Mr Rushfield. \"The Harvey Weinstein story was broken by The New York Times and the New Yorker.\"",
      "It was The New York Times that first reported Lively's legal complaint in December. \"It's one of the few places that can afford to do that, and then everyone else jumped in so nobody was sticking their neck out.\" Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times in December, although a federal judge indicated this week that it might be dismissed.",
      "Even when bigger outlets break news about Hollywood disputes, the growing dominance of social media means that stories might not have the same cut-through they had previously.",
      "Doreen St Felix, a writer who was previously an editor on Lena Dunham's newsletter, recently wrote in The New Yorker that stories of harassment and abuse, for example, now receive a \"curdled, cynical, and exhausted reception\" \u2013 this, less than a decade after the emergence of the MeToo movement.",
      "She went on to claim that: \"The late 2010s genre of #MeToo reportage cannot thrive on today's volatile internet. Information is misinformation and vice versa. Victims are offenders and offenders are victims.\"",
      "Sometimes, however, the best way for publicists to prevent stories being amplified is by bypassing social media entirely when reacting to a scandal.",
      "\"If you give it to the press first, they don't quote as many of the comments on social media,\" says Ms Speight. \"You control the narrative completely, because the comments come afterwards.\"",
      "Mr Rushfield points out that very little of the revelations in the entertainment press comes out because someone \"uncovered\" something. \"Almost everything you read is there because somebody placed it there \u2013 somebody is dictating a story.\"",
      "What viewers want",
      "None of this industry would exist if the appetite weren't there and if the viewing public didn't want to unpick details about their lives \u2013 and rifts. And yet attitudes towards celebrity have undoubtedly changed since the advent of social media.",
      "\"It's now a two-way communication, which it never was before,\" points out Mr Bee. \"It was generally celebrities, or lawyer or government or whatever, just saying something that gets reported, and that message is conveyed. Now, you have to be prepared for a two-way conversation.\"",
      "But he thinks there are different attitudes to the media today than in the era of celebrity gossip magazines. Nodding to the UK, he continues: \"We had the Leveson Inquiry, we're about to get an ITV drama about phone hacking \u2013 it's as if the curtain has been lifted.\"",
      "As for the Lively and Baldoni lawsuits, it's not clear how these will play out \u2013 but the very fact that it has so unusually spilled into the public domain is a reminder of how well-oiled the Hollywood publicity machine is the rest of the time. And that is unlikely to change soon.",

      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said there is a \"risk of disruption\" in the NHS as he attempts to overhaul the service and reduce waste, but has promised long-term improvements.",
      "On Thursday, Streeting announced NHS England, a public administrative body, would be scrapped to save money and give ministers more control of health services.",
      "The Labour government expects the move will take two years and save hundreds of millions of pounds that can be spent on frontline NHS services.",
      "Appearing on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Streeting defended the reforms but admitted there would be challenges.",
      "When asked about the impact on patient care, he said: \"Of course there are always up-front costs. And yes there is always a risk of disruption.\"",
      "Streeting said former health secretaries had \"not been prepared to take on those sorts of challenges\" and argued NHS England \"was set up to shield politicians like me from responsibility\".",

      "It dubbed NHS England \"the world's largest quango\" - the term used to describe publicly funded organisations at arm's length from the government.",
      "Currently, NHS England oversees the health service, working with government to agree funding and priorities, as well as monitoring the performance of local NHS services.",
      "Under the changes, the organisation will be brought into the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), which is headed by Streeting.",
      "The reforms will not impact anyone's access to the NHS, with the health service remaining free at the point of use.",
      "The government said it expected around half of the jobs at NHS England and DHSC to go - around 9,000 administrative roles.",
      "The chairman of NHS England, Richard Meddings, said he did not disagree with the abolishing of the organisation, in his first interview since the changes were announced.",
      "But speaking to the BBC, he said the buck will now stop with ministers, saying: \"There will no longer be a separate vehicle that can be pointed [at] to say that's what got it wrong.\"",
      "Writing in the Telegraph, Streeting suggested scrapping NHS England was \"the beginning, not the end\" and said he would continue \"slashing bloated bureaucracy\".",
      "The health secretary tasked Penny Dash, who was made chairman of NHS England at the start of this month, with carrying out a review of bureaucracy.",
      "Some of the organisations overseen by the Department for Health include Care Quality Commission, the UK Health Security Agency and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.",
      "Beneath those is a patchwork of smaller public bodies on a regional and local level.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Streeting would not be drawn on which bureaucratic NHS organisations he would consider axing, but suggested there was \"an overregulation\" of NHS services.",
      "He said NHS frontline leaders have told him \"they are often receiving a barrage of commands - sometimes contradictory and competing demands - from the Department for Health, from NHS England and from the wide range of regulators in this space\".",
      "He said simplification would set the NHS up to succeed and he was \"going after the bureaucracy, not the people who work in it\".",
      "He added: \"Of course, I can't sugar coat the fact that there will be a significant number of job losses and we will want to make sure we are treating people fairly, supporting them properly through that process.\"",
      "The Conservatives have welcomed the move to bring the management of the health service back under ministerial control, but warned Labour \"cannot hide if things go wrong\".",
      "The Liberal Democrats said the government should ensure that scrapping NHS England does not \"have negative impacts on the quality of care for patients\" and urged ministers to complete a review of social care.",

      "\"There will no longer be a separate vehicle that can be pointed [at] to say that's what got it wrong,\" Richard Meddings told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, in the first interview with a senior official from the organisation since it was announced it would be abolished.",
      "Earlier this week the government confirmed the administrative body would be swallowed up by the Department of Health and Social Care. It will not affect patient care in hospitals, GP practices, and other health organisations but it will change how the NHS is run.",
      "Mr Meddings, who is due to step down at the end of this month, acknowledged that ministers wanted to be involved in the running of the NHS, but argued there had been a subtle form of micromanagement.",
      "\"At times, some weeks, almost 20 new instructions, commissions coming from government and ministers into the system,\" he said.",
      "Streeting admits 'risk of disruption' in NHS overhaul",
      "He also defended the idea of quangos \u2013 the term used to describe publicly funded organisations at arm's length from the government. \"I've worked with six secretaries of state and complete changes of ministers. So there is an argument for a construct that would separate the delivery vehicle from government.\"",
      "The advantage, he said, is that \"it brings in a steady engagement from relevant expertise on a particular topic. And the difference from the political world is.... they don't all necessarily come with relevant experience to run and oversee those areas\".",
      "And he argued that NHS organisational changes can't do much to change the underlying health of the population: \"The NHS deals with whoever or whatever comes through the gates in whatever condition. And many of the conditions of poor health are driven by factors outside the NHS.\"",
      "As Mr Meddings was setting out the case for the defence, the debate about the shake-up rages on.",
      "One well-placed source argued that NHS England's leaders had the chance just after the election to re-set the relationship with government but failed to do so as \"there had been too much suspicion of politicians\".",
      "The organisation, said the source, had become a bureaucracy that was \"intellectually stagnant\" and that its position interacting with both the health service and ministers \"wasn't right\".",
      "Ministers have argued that cutting around 9,000 jobs with the shift of NHS England into the Department of Health would free up resources for frontline services, perhaps as much as \u00a3500 million a year. Having two organisations often duplicating work, they say, led to wasted time and needless costs.",

    "story": [
      "We are surrounded by an invisible killer. One so common that we barely notice it shortening our lives.",
      "It's causing heart attacks, type 2 diabetes and studies now even link it to dementia.",
      "What do you think it could be?",
      "The answer is noise - and its impact on the human body goes far beyond damaging hearing.",
      "\"It is a public health crisis, we've got huge numbers of people exposed in their everyday life,\" says Prof Charlotte Clark, from St George's, University of London.",
      "It's just a crisis we don't talk about.",
      "So I've been investigating when noise becomes dangerous, chatting to the people whose health is suffering and seeing if there's any way of overcoming our noisy world.",
      "I started by meeting Prof Clark in an eerily silent sound laboratory. We're going to see how my body reacts to noise and I've been kitted out with a device that looks like a chunky smartwatch.",
      "It's going to measure my heart rate and how much my skin sweats.",
      "You can join in too if you have some headphones. Think about how these five sounds make you feel.",
      "The one I find really grating is the traffic noise from Dhaka, Bangladesh, which has the title of the noisiest city in the world. I immediately feel like I'm in a ginormous, stressful traffic jam.",
      "And the sensors are picking up my agitation - my heart rate shoots up and my skin is sweating more.",
      "\"There's really good evidence that traffic noise affects your heart health,\" says Prof Clark, as the next sound is prepared.",
      "Only the joyful sounds of the playground have a calming effect on my body. The dogs barking and the neighbour's party in the early hours lead to a negative response.",
      "LISTEN: Is noise an invisible killer?",
      "LISTEN: Is noise an invisible killer?",
      "But why is sound changing my body?",
      "\"You have an emotional response to sound,\" says Prof Clark.",
      "Sound is detected by the ear and passed onto the brain and one region \u2013 the amygdala \u2013 performs the emotional assessment.",
      "This is part of the body's fight-or-flight response that has evolved to help us react quickly to the sounds like a predator crashing through the bushes.",
      "\"So your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones,\" Prof Clark tells me.",
      "All of this is good in an emergency, but over time it starts to cause damage.",
      "\"If you're exposed for several years, your body's reacting like that all the time, it increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" says Prof Clark.",
      "Insidiously, this even happens while we're fast asleep. You might think you adapt to noise. I thought I did when I lived in a rental near an airport. But the biology tells a different story.",
      "\"You never turn your ears off; when you're asleep, you're still listening. So those responses, like your heart rate going up, that's happening whilst you're asleep,\" adds Prof Clark.",
      "Noise is unwanted sound. Transport - traffic, trains and aeroplanes \u2013 are a major source, but so too are the sounds of us having a good time. One person's great party is another's insufferable noise.",
      "I meet Coco at her fourth-floor flat in the historic Vila de Gr\u00e0cia area of Barcelona, Spain.",
      "There's a bag of freshly picked lemons tied to her door gifted by one neighbour, her fridge contains a tortilla cooked by another and she offers me fancy cakes made by a third neighbour who's training in patisserie.",
      "From the balcony you can see the city's famous cathedral, the Sagrada Familia. It is easy to see why Coco has fallen in love with living here, but it comes at a huge price and she thinks she'll be forced to leave.",
      "\"It's extremely noisy\u2026 it's 24-hour noise,\" she tells me. There's a dog park for owners to walk their pooches which \"bark at 2, 3, 4, 5am\" and the courtyard is a public space that is used for everything from children's birthday parties to all-day concerts finished off with fireworks.",
      "She gets out her phone and plays the recordings of the music being blasted out so loud it makes the glass in her windows vibrate.",
      "Her home should be a refuge from the stress of work, but the noise \"brings frustration, I feel like crying\".",
      "She has been \"hospitalised twice with chest pain\" and \"absolutely\" thinks noise is causing the stress, which is damaging her health. \"There is a physical change that I feel, it does something to your body, for certain,\" she says.",
      "In Barcelona there are an estimated 300 heart attacks and 30 deaths a year just from traffic noise, according to researcher Dr Maria Foraster, who has reviewed evidence on noise for the World Health Organization.",
      "Across Europe noise is linked to 12,000 early deaths a year as well as millions of cases of severely disturbed sleep as well as serious noise annoyance which can impact mental health.",
      "I meet Dr Foraster at a caf\u00e9 that is separated from one of Barcelona's busiest roads by a small park. My sound meter says the noise from the distant traffic is just over 60 decibels here.",
      "We can easily chat over the noise without raising our voices, but this is already an unhealthy volume.",
      "The crucial number for heart health is 53 decibels, she tells me, and the higher you go the greater the health risks.",
      "\"This 53 means that we need to be in a rather quiet environment,\" says Dr Foraster.",
      "And that's just in daytime, we need even lower levels for sleep. \"At night we need quietness,\" she says.",
      "Although it is not just about the volume, how disruptive the sound is and how much control you have over it affect our emotional response to noise.",
      "Dr Foraster argues the health impact of noise is \"at the level of air pollution\" but is much harder to comprehend.",
      "\"We are used to understanding that chemicals can affect health and they are toxic, but it's not so straightforward to understand that a physical factor, like noise, affects our health beyond our hearing,\" she says.",
      "A loud party can be the fun that makes life worth living and someone else's intolerable noise.",
      "The sound of traffic has the greatest impact on health because so many people are exposed to it. But traffic is also the sound of getting to work, doing the shopping and taking the children to school. Tackling noise means asking people to live their lives differently - which creates problems of its own.",
      "Dr Natalie Mueller, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, takes me for a walk around the city centre. We start on a busy road \u2013 my sound meter clocks in at over 80 decibels \u2013 and we head to a quiet tree-lined avenue where the noise is down to the 50s.",
      "But there is something different about this street \u2013 it used to be a busy road, but the space was given over to pedestrians, cafes and gardens. I can see the ghost of an old cross roads by the shape of the flowerbeds. Vehicles can still come down here, just slowly.",
      "Remember earlier in the lab, we found that some sounds can soothe the body.",
      "\"It is not completely silent, but it's a different perception of sound and noise,\" Dr Mueller says.",
      "The initial plan was to create more than 500 areas like this, termed \"superblocks\" - pedestrian-friendly areas created by grouping several city blocks together.",
      "Dr Mueller performed the research projecting a 5-10% reduction in noise in the city, which would prevent about \"150 premature deaths\" from noise alone each year. And that would be \"just the tip of the iceberg\" of the health benefits.",
      "But in reality only six superblocks were ever built. The city council declined to comment.",
      "Urbanisation",
      "The dangers of noise though are continuing to grow. Urbanisation is putting more people into noisy cities.",
      "Dhaka, Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. This has brought more traffic and given the city a cacophonous soundtrack of honking horns.",
      "Artist Momina Raman Royal earned the label of the \"lone hero\" as his silent protests have focused attention on the city's noise problem.",
      "For about 10 minutes each day, he stands at the intersection of a couple of busy roads with a big yellow placard accusing drivers who honk their horns loudly of causing a massive nuisance.",
      "He took on the mission after his daughter was born. \"I want to stop all honking from not only Dhaka, but from Bangladesh,\" he says.",
      "\"If you see the birds or trees or rivers, no one's making noise without humans, so humans are responsible.\"",
      "But here there are the beginnings of political action too. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who's the environment adviser and minister for the government of Bangladesh, told me she was \"very worried\" about the health impacts of noise.",
      "There is a crackdown on honking horns to get the noise levels down - with an awareness campaign and stricter enforcement of existing laws.",
      "She said: \"It's impossible to get it done in one year or two years, but I think it is possible to ensure that the city becomes less noisy, and when people feel that, they feel better when it's less noisy, I'm sure their habit will also change.\"",
      "The solutions to noise can be difficult, complicated and challenging to solve.",
      "What I'm left with is a new appreciation for finding some space in our lives to just escape the noise because in the words of Dr Masrur Abdul Quader, from the Bangladesh University of Professionals, it is \"a silent killer and a slow poison\".",

    "summary": "NHS England says it cannot afford to offer abiraterone, which is available in Scotland and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "A cancer charity has said it is \"angry and frustrated\" that ministers and health officials have not approved the provision of a life-extending prostate cancer drug through the NHS in England.",
      "The drug, abiraterone, has been available in Scotland and Wales for two years for high-risk patients whose cancer has not yet spread, but not in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "In a letter to Prostate Cancer UK, seen by the BBC, Health Minister Karin Smyth said the decision by NHS England, following a lengthy review, was \"based on overall affordability\" and that \"it would not be appropriate to intervene\".",
      "The government said urgent advice had been requested on the issue.",
      "The charity said it was a \"dire and urgent situation in England\" with \"a bureaucratic blockage denying men this treatment\".",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration and upset of some patients who cannot access this potentially life-saving treatment. Ministers have requested urgent advice on the issue.\"",
      "Although not a cure, abiraterone can help stop prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body.",
      "In England and Northern Ireland, the drug is only approved for men with very advanced prostate cancer which has spread already.",
      "In Wales and Scotland, people with the disease that has not yet spread can also get it.",
      "Research has shown that for these earlier stage patients, the survival rate after six years is improved and that the drug halved the rate of progression of the cancer.",
      "The charity says many lives could be extended by the drug, given the findings from a trial called Stampede, published in 2022.",
      "It found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care, and concluded that abiraterone should be considered a new standard treatment.",
      "According to figures from NHS England, each year about 8,400 patients have high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread.",
      "Using the Stampede assumptions, 672 of those men could die prematurely without access to abiraterone.",
      "In October 2023, BBC News spoke to Giles Turner, a retired banker living in Sussex. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England.",
      "He chose to pay for treatment with the drug at \u00a3250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not.",
      "At the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men.",
      "However, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that \"it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets\".",
      "Because abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone \"off patent\" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.",
      "Each year, NHS England can make \"discretionary\" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug.",
      "Smyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at \"the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes\", and ministers would not intervene.",
      "Mr Turner said he was \"stunned\" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales.",
      "He has spent \u00a320,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS \u00a377 per pack per month - could not be."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:51:56 GMT",
    "summary": "As part of Your Voice, Your BBC, we answer questions from you on government plans to scrap NHS England.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced NHS England will be abolished to \"cut bureaucracy\" and reform how the National Health Service is run.",
      "The changes will not impact anyone's access to the NHS - it will still be free at the point of use and cover all the services it does already.",
      "Around 9,000 administrative roles are being cut at NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care as part of the changes - amounting to roughly half of all roles at the two organisations.",
      "As part of Your Voice Your BBC, we asked for your questions on the plans and what they could mean for you - below we have answered them for you.",
      "What does NHS England do?",
      "NHS England is the administrative body which manages how health services up and down the country are run. It is made up primarily of managers and officials, not the doctors and nurses providing care in hospitals.",
      "The government provides it with money and tells it what its priorities are for the health service - for example, that might be cutting waiting times or improving cancer survival rates.",
      "NHS England's role is to funnel the money it is given into different parts of the health service and work out how to juggle resources in order to bring about the change the government wants to see.",
      "In 2012, NHS England was given more independence by the Conservative-led government. They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services.",
      "NHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services.",
      "There are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England.",
      "Did this decision come out of the blue?",
      "Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.",
      "Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "When Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy.",
      "NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit.",
      "In that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.",
      "What is a 'quango' - and why do ministers think 'bureaucracy' is a problem?",
      "These are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control.",
      "In this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.",
      "Starmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services.",
      "We also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "In short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "They range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission.",
      "Their numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Labour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was \u00a3353bn.",
      "Will there be more control over decision-making and budgets locally?",
      "We do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies.",
      "One of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls.",
      "They will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country.",
      "Will this mean an increase in funding to the NHS and better access to medicines?",
      "Thursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer.",
      "We already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that.",
      "But government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government \u00a3500m a year.",
      "On access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective.",
      "When a new drug is produced by the pharmaceutical industry, the institute will decide if the NHS can afford it and whether it is better than other drugs that are used.",

      "The chair of NHS England has said he does not disagree with the abolishing of the organisation - although he warns that the buck will now stop with ministers.",
      "\"There will no longer be a separate vehicle that can be pointed [at] to say that's what got it wrong,\" Richard Meddings told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, in the first interview with a senior official from the organisation since it was announced it would be abolished.",
      "Earlier this week the government confirmed the administrative body would be swallowed up by the Department of Health and Social Care. It will not affect patient care in hospitals, GP practices, and other health organisations but it will change how the NHS is run.",
      "Mr Meddings, who is due to step down at the end of this month, acknowledged that ministers wanted to be involved in the running of the NHS, but argued there had been a subtle form of micromanagement.",

      "Dr Sally Anne Wilson, chair of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine's safer care committee, told BBC Breakfast: \"As a parent you want to make sensible decisions for what you buy your child and if you're not aware that there's glycerol in the slushie and what that can do, then you're not going to have any qualms about buying the said slushie.\"",
      "Dr Wilson said age-based advice on the drinks is difficult because there's a variation in children's weight, but added \"there's definitely an argument\" for increasing the minimum age because it would solve that problem.",
      "One reason for the recent rise in children becoming ill may be the lower sugar content of the slushies, which is attractive to parents, the study says.",

      "Michael Gove has told the Covid inquiry it was \"ludicrous\" to suggest he tried to force through a deal for a new ventilator made by the electronics giant Dyson without proper safety checks.",
      "Emails show a senior official at the health watchdog warned that the former cabinet office minister was trying to \"circumvent the regulatory process\" in March 2020.",
      "Messages between staff at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Mr Gove did not \"appreciate the level of risk involved\" and was working to a \"totally unrealistic\" timescale.",
      "A provisional order for 10,000 machines was placed at the time, but the deal was scrapped after Dyson failed to win regulatory approval.",
      "No public money was spent on the prototype.",
      "Dyson said it never intended to make a profit from the venture and wrote off around \u00a320m in research and development costs.",
      "Ventilator Challenge",
      "In March 2020, as Covid was spreading across northern Italy, there was a frantic attempt by health authorities to get hold of ventilators to help patients breathe.",
      "The NHS had between 6,000 and 8,000 in stock but modelling suggested it needed 30,000 by the end of June and 90,000 by November to cope with a predicted influx of patients.",
      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",
      "The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project.",
      "On 20 March 2020, Mr Johnson wrote that \"Dyson [was] freaking\" and called for \"Action this day\".",
      "Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, \"I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it.\"",
      "Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government's then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place \"against commercial guidance\".",
      "Five days later, on 25 March, Boris Johnson wrote another WhatsApp message to the same group saying that: \"Dyson has a ventilator ready to go\u2026 It's safe, effective and loses less oxygen. Rhys Williams has blocked it under the misapprehension that oxygen passes through the motor. That is total b****cks.\"",
      "He accused officials of \"fiddling while Rome burns\" and added: \"Sorry but I'm on a mission. Dyson knows what he's doing and won't risk his global brand reputation delivering dodgy ventilators.\"",
      "'Totally unrealistic'",
      "Sir Gareth said, at that point, the Dyson prototype pushed air from a fan directly into the lungs of patients, something that could cause safety concerns.",
      "The Dyson team did subsequently \"fix\" that part of the design, he added.",
      "Later on 25 March, Sir Gareth wrote to Sir John Manzoni, a top civil servant in the cabinet office, saying that Michael Gove was \"INSISTENT we place an order with Dyson\u2026 contingent on passing clinical and passing MHRA approvals.\"",
      "A provisional \u00a3100,000 order was then placed for the Dyson prototypes, and an email from Michael Gove's private office set out a number of actions that needed be taken quickly including: \"The MHRA and Sir Gareth Rhys Williams to ensure by the end of Friday, [that] the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA\u2026 [and] the final product has started to be manufactured.\"",
      "The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was \"keen to press forward with Dyson's proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic.\"",
      "He added that Mr Gove \"did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators\" and \"wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place\".",
      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",
      "The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately \"did not get through testing\" and \"whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them.\"",
      "He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply \"shorthand for 'we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale'\".",
      "In the end the government said the Ventilator Challenge helped scale up the production of three existing models, and approved one new design by the medical devices firm Penlon.",
      "In total, an extra 14,000 devices were delivered over three months, fewer than the government originally planned for as doctors identified other ways of treating the most severe Covid cases.",
      "In a statement, Dyson said Sir James Dyson responded to a personal call from Boris Johnson to \"develop and make a medical-grade ventilator in 30 days during the national emergency\".",
      "\"Far from receiving any commercial benefit, there was significant commercial cost to Dyson which diverted 450 engineers away from commercial projects,\" added a company spokesperson.",
      "\"Uniquely amongst the many businesses involved, [Sir] James Dyson did not seek payment for any of the \u00a320m the company spent on the project \u2013 rather this was its contribution to the national effort to save lives.\""

      "Ministers are considering abandoning plans to freeze some disability benefits, the BBC understands.",
      "Initial reports had suggested Personal Independence Payments (PIP) would not rise in line with inflation for a year, but many usually loyal Labour MPs have voiced strong opposition in meetings in No10, as well as to party whips and ministers.",
      "The eligibility criteria for PIP will be tightened with the government expected to cut billions of pounds from the welfare budget, but dropping the freeze could avoid a potentially damaging vote in the Commons.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said he had not seen the plans but Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall wanted \"to support people who need help the most\".",

      "On the same programme, Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott accused the government of being \"all over the place and divided\" over welfare reform.",
      "Kendall will set out details of reforms to welfare in a green paper next week.",
      "Part of the reform will also include a \"right to try\" guarantee - allowing people with disabilities the opportunity to take up employment without the risk of losing their benefits if it does not work out.",
      "Streeting said he thought there was an \"overdiagnosis\" of mental health conditions with \"too many people being written off\" and not getting the support they need.",
      "\"So if you can get that support to people much earlier, then you can help people to either stay in work or get back to work,\" he added.",
      "After Liz Kendell lays out her plans, Chancellor Rachel Reeves will then reveal the full scale of welfare spending reductions, expected to be between \u00a35bn and \u00a36bn, in her Spring Statement on 26 March.",
      "On Friday she said the government needed to \"get a grip\" on the welfare bill, saying the system is not working for the taxpayer or recipients.",
      "Total spending on health and disability benefits is forecast to rise from \u00a364.7bn in 2023-24 to \u00a3100.7bn in 2029-30. The biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.",
      "The second largest single element of the working-age welfare bill is PIP.",
      "In 2023-24, PIP totalled \u00a318bn, a figure projected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30. That would mean the number of claimants rising from 2.7 million to 4.2 million.",
      "PIP is intended to help with the extra living costs for people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition. Some recipients are in work and argue it provides essential support enabling them to remain in employment. But it also goes to those who are heavily disabled and unable to work.",
      "With Labour holding a large Commons majority, a freeze to PIP would be likely to pass a vote, but internal divisions would be highlighted.",
      "Sources told the BBC the measures to be announced would still be difficult and restricting who qualifies for PIP was likely to concern some Labour MPs.",
      "Even with the tighter eligibility measures planned, sources said spending on PIP would still rise but not as quickly as otherwise forecast.",
      "A number of MPs broadly supportive of welfare reform have told the BBC they have received assurances that severely disabled people would not be expected to work and would not lose entitlement to benefits.",
      "The expected changes to the benefit system come after the government announced it would be axing NHS England, the arms-length body currently responsible for running the health service in England.",

    "story": [
      "The prime minister has just had another moment at the lectern, urging Europe to stand up for Ukraine. He's an increasingly confident leader, but in the coming days No 10 faces what could be a defining fight at home.",
      "\"There is a collision coming,\" a Labour insider tells me. Sir Keir Starmer has long been up for fights with his party. But with controversy around every corner, who are the tribes in the party in 2025, and might they fight back?",
      "The party's history is crammed with bitter bust-ups, years when MPs seemed most comfortable to be fighting each other, rather than political rivals.",
      "With a squeeze on benefits coming, there is unease on the back, and the front benches, including in cabinet. The decision on winter fuel payments still causes resentment, and new plans for immigration coming in a white paper later in the spring are likely to be controversial too.",
      "A long-time party observer says: \"Put three Labour people in a room and you'll have a faction.\"",
      "Sir Keir's allies seem pretty confident Labour's ditched that habit of constant scrapping. But No 10 is worried enough to be inviting MPs into Downing Street to make their pitch for the changes to welfare, knowing there'll be upset from the usual suspects and hoping there won't be too much of a backlash on the soft left.",
      "It's also grappling with the massive group of MPs elected last year, with some eager backbenchers actively trying to make Sir Keir's case, unkindly branded by one source as \"toadies\" trying to suck up to the leadership.",
      "So how will the \"usual suspects\", the \"softies\", the \"newbies\" and the \"toadies\" shake down?",
      "There has always been criticism of Sir Keir from the left-hand edge of Labour, not least because he spent the first couple of years in charge squeezing out the hard left, and even kicked out some MPs after the general election for voting against him over the cap on benefits for families with more than two children.",
      "It's common for MPs like Diane Abbott or Nadia Whittome to take pot shots at the prime minister's plans. But now this group is much smaller and less influential than it once was, it can't do much damage on its own. Gone are the days when the Socialist Campaign Group held sway with Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 there are only around 30 MPs in the group these days. But unhappiness about the coming welfare cuts spreads its tentacles far further.",
      "One of those arguing against them told me the vast majority of Labour MPs were in the \"group of resistance\" \u2013 and \"privately some of the cabinet are very against it.\"",
      "There is a whiff of opportunity to force Sir Keir to back down, some believe. \"There is a chance that the old left and the soft left come together,\" another MP tells me.",
      "A source on the left of the party tells me there's \"potential to broaden this out and team up with people who don't want to see benefits cut after 15 years of austerity. The challenge for us on the left is to work with those people - then we'll have a sizeable rebellion.\" It is \"breathtaking\" to see new MPs backing undisclosed changes to benefits for disabled people, they add.",
      "They point to the rebellion against Tony Blair in 1997 when 47 Labour MPs voted against the new government over - you guessed it - cuts to benefits. One hundred MPs abstained. It didn't change the policy, just as a rebellion of that kind of size wouldn't change it this time either, given the PM's huge majority. But it shocked ministers, still in the pomp of their massive victory that year. Could this do the same?",
      "Downing Street evidently is worried - but the resistance on the soft left so far seems, well, rather soft.",
      "Another source tells me there are lots of colleagues who are expressing discomfort, and there are fault-lines, but it's not organised. Some of those who would rather like there to be a rebellion seem to also rather like the idea of someone else organising it.",
      "Rebellions do need organising, effort, energy, and an eagerness to make sparks fly. They also need leaders willing to put their head above the parapet. While the concern is strong, the appetite for a big spat when the plans eventually get to Parliament is less so, at least for now.",
      "It's symbolic of where power is held in the party right now. \"The soft left has been obliterated,\" a senior Labour figure tells me, adding: \"I'm not sure No 10 has the story right and I fear it will be handled badly, but on welfare \u2013 they have got no choice.\"",
      "Ministers are trying to make a moral argument - that sorting out welfare is a mission, that it's better for people's well-being and health to have a job. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, will almost inevitably make that case when he joins us in the studio tomorrow. That argument was made by Labour in the election and in its manifesto. But the second part of the expected plans - squeezing payments to disabled people who may already be struggling - was not.",
      "None of the hordes of Labour MPs elected for the first time in 2024 had taking cash from the worst off on their campaign leaflets or Facebook posts. But are the newbies, barely a year into the job, the kind of tribe to cause trouble? Of course, it's important to note they don't all think the same but talking to some of them, there are some characteristics you can trace.",
      "Remember more than half of Labour's MPs \u2013 243 out of 406 \u2013 are completely new, so understanding their centre of gravity is hugely important. And it seems very different to the previous generations.",
      "One of the newbies told me: \"Even more than the welfare stuff, the moment that was most revealing about how different we are to 1997 was the 3% defence target and the aid cuts.\" This wasn't met with any more resistance than the resignation of International Development Minister Annaliese Dodds and a \"few rumblings\" from inside the party - but for most of the 2024 intake it was a \"no-brainer\", given the need to spend more on defence as the world becomes less secure.",
      "It's not just that Labour's recruits are different, but they note their political upbringing is different too: \"We have come of age politically in a time when chaos is the norm and the world feels like it is continually going to hell\" \u2013 so cutting aid and other policies that are uncomfortable for moderates a generation above \"are not that troubling\".",
      "Indeed, some of the newbies have been unkindly branded \"toadies\" by others, as another source describes them - not just accepting some of the leadership's tougher plans, but even egging them on, busy writing public letters, or giving supportive interviews.",
      "Whether on welfare, defence or planning, another MP describes them as \"pop-up pressure groups\", publicly calling for No 10 to push its reforms harder, and further.",
      "\"Aren't they hilarious?\" a party veteran jokes, gently mocking the ambition of those involved, suspicious that the leadership may have gently encouraged a few aspirant MPs to make their case vigorously and loudly.",
      "A government source acknowledges there is a significant chunk of MPs who want to be helpful to the leadership, but with many in marginal seats, \"they are not swots, they are street fighters\" who are closer to their voters' concerns. They're telling the leadership they can give them space to be more radical on welfare, immigration or getting houses built.",
      "For now, whatever the motivation of the usual suspects, No 10 can enjoy a level of unity in the governing party.",
      "It's also plain that the political operation in government has improved since the summer, in part due to his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, credited by many for bringing a new discipline to the party. \"There is only one tribe,\" a senior figure told me, \"it's Morgan McSweeney's \u2013 it's his way or the high way \u2013 his people are controlling things at the moment.\" That's described differently by others, who say: \"It's Keir's party now.\" And an increasingly confident prime minister abroad has more clout at home.",
      "But the rows over welfare that will bubble up this week and the chancellor's decisions in the Spring Statement next week still certainly matter. Not every MP or activist agrees with the decisions being taken by the centre - but with a whopping majority, the risk is not about losing votes.",
      "It's about a direction of travel and the perception of the party to the public. It matters in the next few weeks on the inside of government because managing unhappiness takes up political time, energy and effort. It matters outside because rows over policy, whether welfare or immigration, create headlines, and headaches, and the danger of giving the public the impression that the party in charge is not pulling together.",
      "That's acknowledged by a government source observing the journey Sir Keir's Labour Party has been on: \"We were united against the hard left, then we were united against the Tories\" - but as the government settles in, it's less clear what the party is united on now.",

      "The earlier court hearing heard the statements, made in the European Parliament and in opinion pieces to news outlets such as 112 Ukraine, were \"supportive of a particular narrative\" which would \"benefit Russia regarding events in Ukraine\".",
      "Mr Gill was stopped at Manchester Airport on 13 September 2021 under anti-terror legislation, the court was told in February.",
      "It was said then that his mobile phone was seized and evidence was found that police say suggested he was in a professional relationship with Mr Voloshyn and had agreed to \"receive or accept monies in return for him performing activities as an MEP\".",

      "A requirement for the secretary of state to sign off on CPOs will be removed \"in certain instances\", he said, adding that the legislation would be \"transformative\" in unlocking construction for new homes, roads, rail and renewable energy projects.",
      "The bill also aims streamline the planning process, with more decisions made directly by officers rather than councillors.",
      "However, councils have raised concerns this could mean they will be shut out of the democratic planning process.",
      "Richard Clewer, housing and planning spokesperson at the Country Councils Network, said he welcomed changes to CPOs as a \"useful tool\".",
      "However, he said changes to the planning process could \"dilute and bypass the role of councillors\", particularly with rural developments where a few new homes could make a significant impact.",
      "Defending the plans, Pennycook said \"expert planning officers\" would support elected councillors with technical detail and allow councillors to focus on larger, more controversial applications.",
      "The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, with the pledge key to boosting economic growth.",
      "However, the number of new homes continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, with the construction industry warning the country does not have enough workers to deliver on the target.",
      "Pennycook said the inheritance from the previous Conservative government was \"dire\" but there were \"very positive signs\" and \"green shoots coming forward\" in the number of planning applications being submitted.",
      "Other measures in the bill include:",
      "Up to \u00a32,500 off energy bills for people living within 500m of new pylonsStreamlining the process for approving key projects like wind farms, roads or railways and banning multiple \"meritless\" legal challenges.Allowing \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served process\" which the government says has clogged up the system",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd3jr7e4n3o",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 18:36:23 GMT",
    "summary": "The government is to set out details of how it will save billions of pounds from the working welfare bill.",
    "story": [
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is set to unveil details of how the government plans to cut billions of pounds from the working-age welfare bill.",
      "The focus will be on reducing spending on health-related and disability benefits.",
      "That bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting people back into work.",
      "But this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget, and to try to encourage more people into employment.",
      "And charities are warning about the adverse impact on vulnerable recipients.",
      "There are three broad approaches which the government is believed to be examining:",
      "Cutting the level of benefit paymentsTightening the eligibility for benefitsAttempting to get people off benefits and into work",
      "Cutting the level of benefit payments",
      "Tightening the eligibility for benefits",
      "Attempting to get people off benefits and into work",
      "BBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.",
      "Cutting payments",
      "The working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "That would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.",
      "By 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.",
      "The other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.",
      "One straightforward way for ministers to curb this projected rise would be to hold payments flat in cash terms, rather than allowing them to rise in line with prices each year.",
      "\"Reducing award amounts is the easiest way to get savings in the short term,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "Freezing incapacity benefits in cash terms until 2030 would save \u00a31bn a year, according to the Resolution Foundation.",
      "But you can only receive incapacity benefit if your income and savings are below a certain level, so freezing payments would impact people who are worse off.",
      "Also, people on disability benefits such as PIP are considerably more likely to be in poverty and material deprivation.",
      "Under previous governments between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits did not rise in line with inflation - to save money.",
      "And from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.",
      "So cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.",
      "Tighten eligibility",
      "Rather than cutting the value of these benefits for all recipients, the government could seek to save money by making it harder for people to claim them in the first place.",
      "For instance, the previous government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP, arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.",
      "But it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.",
      "PIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.",
      "PIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.",
      "Yet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015 and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).",
      "Another attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.",
      "The reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria. Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.",
      "Official decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around a third of those challenges are ultimately upheld at an independent tribunal.",
      "\"Britain's chequered history of benefit reform shows that the government should proceed cautiously, rather than rush ahead to find savings which could backfire,\" says Louise Murphy of the Resolution Foundation.",
      "Encourage work",
      "Another way for the government to try to achieve savings is by encouraging more people to come off these benefits and enter work.",
      "Around 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.",
      "One potential route to increase employment rates could be regular reassessments of people in receipt of incapacity benefit and a requirement for them to start looking for jobs if they are found to be fit for work.",
      "The fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.",
      "However, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work and could also create unexpected distortions in the system.",
      "The OBR has suggested the sanctions introduced to the wider benefits system by the last government, requiring people judged fit to work to be actively looking for employment or risk losing their benefits, had the counterproductive effect of increasing the incentive for people to try to claim incapacity benefits (for which these work-searching requirements did not apply).",
      "Another potential policy avenue to boost employment rates is through providing much greater support to find jobs.",
      "Some advocate increasing government investment in official schemes, working with employers, to help people to enter the workplace.",
      "There have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.",
      "Evaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.",
      "However, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.",
      "That implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.",
      "Nevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.",
      "\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to slash the costs of regulation with an \"active government\".",
      "In a speech, he said politicians had chosen to hide behind quangos and he took aim at a \"cottage industry of checkers and blockers slowing down delivery for working people\".",
      "But the key announcement was the abolition of the \"world's largest quango\", NHS England, which works with the government to agree funding and priorities, and oversees the delivery of services.",
      "He announced the government was bringing it back under the control of the Department of Health.",
      "Incoming governments have often sought to cut the number of quangos - but what are they and what do they do?",
      "What is a quango?",
      "Quango stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation, but the government calls them \"arm's length bodies\". They are organisations such as regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall.",
      "They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "How many quangos are there?",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, nearly 300 were axed - dubbed the \"bonfire of the quangos\" - in an attempt to improve accountability and cut costs.",
      "Despite Sir Keir indicating he would also like to reduce the role of quangos, the new Labour government has set up more than 20 since winning power.",
      "These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals, and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.",
      "Asked earlier this week if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",
      "How much do they cost?",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with 90% of this going to the largest 10 bodies.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - the latest published figures - was \u00a3353.3bn.",
      "Why are they controversial?",
      "Campaign groups like the TaxPayers' Alliance have long criticised quangos, claiming they allow ministers to dodge responsibility for mistakes and can be inefficient and costly.",
      "The Institute for Government think tank says in some cases scrapping public bodies can save money and improve how services are delivered.",
      "It gives the example of how absorbing JobCentre Plus into the Department for Work and Pensions helped cut the department's workforce and office space by a third.",
      "But the think tank argues abolitions also cost money and time in the short term, with services disrupted when powers are transferred.",

      "It is a comparison neither would likely welcome, but look closely and the arguments of Sir Keir Starmer and Liz Truss about why government doesn't work well enough are remarkably similar.",
      "Neither are the first to grumble about the machinery of government.",
      "More than 20 years ago, Sir Tony Blair gave a speech much of which Sir Keir could give today.",
      "\"Sometimes we can be so frightened of the process of accountability, we opt for inertia,\" Sir Tony said in 2004, adding that too often the civil service had acted as \"a shock absorber in order to maintain the status quo\".",

      "Their language and emphases may be different, but the diagnosis is the same.",

      "Starmer pledges to tackle 'flabby' state",
      "Starmer pitches reform to 'shackled' civil servants",
      "Sir Keir Starmer says the state has become \"overcautious\" and \"flabby\" and government has become bigger, but weaker.",
      "By weaker, he means a growing inability to make stuff happen and a big reason for that, he reckons, is the proliferation of arm's length bodies \u2013 taxpayer funded organisations with independence from the government and considerable power.",
      "There has been a growing sense in Downing Street as the prime minister and his team have adjusted to life in government that organisations dreamt up as a wheeze by previous governments so they don't get blamed for this or that all too often now stand in the way of a minister being able to do what they want.",
      "The recent row about the Sentencing Council in England and Wales is seen as a case in point.",
      "And now, scrapping NHS England is, ministers will argue, the ultimate case study in scrapping unaccountable bureaucracy.",
      "Scale of challenge",
      "So what did Liz Truss argue after her time in government?",
      "She talked of the \"tyranny of the technocracy\", the \"power of the administrative state\" and argued that \"there is something rather undemocratic about this\".",
      "She said that \"Blair and Brown had imposed a web of legalistic architecture that added process and put more power in the hands of technocrats\", which granted is a point where you might think Truss and Starmer would depart and no doubt do in many instances.",
      "But strikingly, given that recent row about the Sentencing Council, when was it set up?",
      "In April 2010, when Gordon Brown was prime minister.",
      "\"For any challenge faced, for too long the answer has been more arm's length bodies, quangos and regulators which end up blocking the government,\" Sir Keir writes in the Daily Telegraph, without reference to any particular such body.",
      "It is also true that this new-ish government has itself created new arms-length bodies, such as GB Energy and Skills England.",
      "Perhaps it is human nature - that your own arm's length bodies don't feel as pernicious as ones dreamt up by a predecessor.",
      "Beyond the comparisons, the reason all this matters is the government is up against a pervasive sense that nothing works any more.",
      "Think the 8am scramble for an appointment with the doctor and the waiting lists for an operation for a start.",
      "Some senior Labour figures fret privately that their talk of \"missions\" and a \"Plan for Change\" might seem puny to many in comparison with the scale of that challenge.",
      "The prime minister said: \"Every pound that we spend, every regulation, every decision must deliver for working people. And I don't just mean efficiency...I mean something else which is allowing the state, the government, to operate what I call maximum power.\"",
      "The prime minister's speech is both a symptom of his early frustration at the capacity of government to get stuff done - and an acknowledgement of the urgency to do just that.",

      "Despite the government's hopes, the UK has not, in the end, been exempted from President Trump's 25% steel and aluminium tariffs.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the UK will \"keep all options on the table\", but has not announced immediate retaliation.",
      "BBC Verify looks at how big the impact on the UK could be and what might happen next.",
      "Starmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffs",
      "Metal products",
      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",
      "So the total annual value of UK exports affected would be around \u00a32.7bn.",
      "For context, the UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US on an annual basis in 2024 - so the share of goods hit by these new Trump tariffs represents just under 5%.",
      "The UK hopes to conclude a free trade deal with the Trump administration, which could mean these tariffs being removed.",
      "But we have no way of knowing if - or how soon - such an agreement could be concluded.",
      "Trump has also threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on all the United States' trading partners, including the UK, from next month.",
      "These are taxes on imports to the US which are set at a similar rate to taxes other countries put on goods they import from the US.",
      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",

      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",

      "North Sea tanker collision - what we know so far",
      "What might be on board?",
      "Maritime operations company, Crowley, which was managing the oil tanker the MV Stena Immaculate, has confirmed that it was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 containers at the time of the incident.",
      "It was not clear on the status of all the containers but Crowley said one had \"ruptured\" and was leaking fuel into the sea.",

      "Jet fuel is a toxic substance that can be lethal to marine organisms and other animals like seabirds if ingested.",
      "The level of toxicity is dependent on the crude oil that it has been refined from.",
      "Sodium cyanide, which is used in industry including for metal cleaning, is a also a toxic substance and poisonous for living organisms as it disrupts cell function and leads to oxygen starvation.",
      "Sodium cyanide is also highly soluble in water and it can react vigorously to produce the gas hydrogen cyanide - which is also toxic.",
      "The confirmation that it was only empty containers on board will allay some concerns about environmental damage and make the clean-up operation easier.",
      "The third consideration for authorities will be whether the fuel used to run both ships - the bunker fuel - has also leaked out.",

      "What mitigation can be taken?",
      "The Marine Accident Investigation Branch is overseeing the operation to respond to the incident and clean up any pollution.",
      "Melanie Onn, the MP for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is currently doing an evaluation of the contamination risk and working with the owners of both of the vessels to plan a salvage operation.",
      "Prof Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds said: \"The priority, I imagine, for the crews trying to contain the damage, will be to extinguish the fires and keep vessels afloat. This will reduce the quantity of chemicals entering the water and the risk for wildlife downstream.\"",
      "The fire that broke out following the crash will have helped to burn off some of the jet fuel but testing kits are being set to the site to confirm there is no residue remaining.",
      "Frode Vikeb\u00f8, research manager at the Institute of Marine Research said that the UK government will be modelling the spread of any contaminants at sea, considering ocean circulation and weather conditions, as part of \"standard procedure\".",
      "In terms of mitigation, Dr Karen Purnell, former director of ITOPF - which advises governments on maritime pollution, said the first approach would be to let the jet fuel \"dissipate naturally where possible and avoiding deliberate containment.\"",
      "If any jet fuel did make it to shore, she said: \"Flushing the shoreline to remobilise the fuel and perhaps directing it into absorbent booms or mats for later disposal could be an option.\" But she said the approach would differ depending on the different types of environment, for example whether there were wetlands.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Esme read this article",
      "Donald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.",
      "Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\".",
      "And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals.",
      "Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.",
      "So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?",
      "The Elon Musk effect?",
      "Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).",
      "Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.",
      "She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.",
      "Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"",
      "He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.",
      "The US position in the global race",
      "The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Failure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".",
      "China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.",
      "\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.",
      "Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"",
      "Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.",
      "China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).",
      "\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.",
      "She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.",
      "What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).",
      "\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"",
      "As he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.",
      "The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.",
      "A stark warning for the US",
      "In the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.",
      "The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.",
      "By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.",
      "And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.",
      "But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.",
      "\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.",
      "\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"",
      "Whispers of another executive order",
      "There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.",
      "The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.",
      "Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"",
      "As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.",
      "Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.",
      "MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.",
      "He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.",
      "If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.",
      "Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"",
      "He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"",
      "But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"",

      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",

In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.",
      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",

      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",

      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",

      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",

      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",

      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",

      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",

Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",

      "The hearing is due to be held in private because it relates to the security services, but campaigners say the public has a right to hear it.",
      "\"This hearing should not be held in secret,\" Caroline Wilson Palow, legal director at Privacy International told the BBC.",
      "\"The public has a right to know whether or not the security of a service that could be used by millions or perhaps billions of people worldwide is being undermined.\"",
      "What Apple pulling Advanced Data Protection means for you",
      "The row began in February when it first emerged the government was seeking the right to be able to access data protected by ADP, using powers granted to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "The Act allows it to covertly compel firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "ADP allows users with iCloud accounts and storage to secure photos, notes, voice memos and other data with end to end encryption, meaning no-one but the user - not even Apple - can access it.",

      "\"As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will,\" a spokesperson told the BBC.",
      "Later in February the row escalated, as Apple announced it was pulling ADP in the UK.",
      "Shortly after that, the BBC learnt Apple was taking legal action by appealing to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal to try to overturn the government's demand.",
      "On its website, the Tribunal lists a hearing to be held before its president Lord Justice Singh on Friday afternoon.",
      "The listing makes no mention of Apple or the government, nor has the Tribunal confirmed if they are the parties involved - however a source familiar with the matter has indicated that is the case, as was first reported by Computer Weekly.",
      "In the statement it issued in February, Apple said it regretted the action it felt it had been forced to take.",
      "\"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end-encryption is more urgent than ever before,\" it said.",
      "\"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in future in the UK.\"",
      "In a previous statement, a Home Office spokesperson said: \"The UK has a longstanding position of protecting our citizens from the very worst crimes, such as child sex abuse and terrorism, at the same time as protecting people's privacy.",
      "\"The UK has robust safeguards and independent oversight to protect privacy and privacy is only impacted on an exceptional basis, in relation to the most serious crimes and only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so.\""

    "summary": "Market researchers say the slumping popularity of the market-leading Apple Watch was to blame",
    "story": [
      "Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.",
      "Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.",
      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",
      "It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.",
      "\"We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,\" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.",
      "Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.",
      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",
      "But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.",
      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",
      "\"For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.\"",
      "Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with \"single-digit percentage growth in 2025\".",
      "It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.",

    "story": [
      "Hackers thought to be working for the North Korean regime have successfully converted at least $300m (\u00a3232m) of their record-breaking $1.5bn crypto heist to unrecoverable funds.",
      "The criminals, known as Lazarus Group, swiped the huge haul of digital tokens in a hack on crypto exchange ByBit two weeks ago.",
      "Since then, it's been a cat-and-mouse game to track and block the hackers from successfully converting the crypto into usable cash.",
      "Experts say the infamous hacking team is working nearly 24 hours a day - potentially funnelling the money into the regime's military development.",
      "\"Every minute matters for the hackers who are trying to confuse the money trail and they are extremely sophisticated in what they're doing,\" says Dr Tom Robinson, co-founder of crypto investigators Elliptic.",
      "Out of all the criminal actors involved in crypto currency, North Korea is the best at laundering crypto, Dr Robinson says.",
      "\"I imagine they have an entire room of people doing this using automated tools and years of experience. We can also see from their activity that they only take a few hours break each day, possibly working in shifts to get the crypto turned into cash.\"",
      "Elliptic's analysis tallies with ByBit, which says that 20% of the funds have now \"gone dark\", meaning it is unlikely to ever be recovered.",
      "The US and allies accuse the North Koreans of carrying out dozens of hacks in recent years to fund the regime's military and nuclear development.",
      "On 21 February the criminals hacked one of ByBit's suppliers to secretly alter the digital wallet address that 401,000 Ethereum crypto coins were being sent to.",
      "ByBit thought it was transferring the funds to its own digital wallet, but instead sent it all to the hackers.",
      "Ben Zhou, the CEO of ByBit, assured customers that none of their funds had been  taken.",
      "The firm has since replenished the stolen coins with loans from investors, but is, in Zhou's words, \"waging war on Lazarus\".",
      "ByBit's Lazarus Bounty programme is encouraging members of the public to trace the stolen funds and get them frozen where possible.",
      "All crypto transactions are displayed on a public blockchain, so it's possible to track the money as it's moved around by the Lazarus Group.",
      "If the hackers try to use a mainstream crypto service to attempt to turn the coins into normal money like dollars, the crypto coins can be frozen by the company if they think they are linked to crime.",
      "So far 20 people have shared more than $4m in rewards for successfully identifying $40m of the stolen money and alerting crypto firms to block transfers.",
      "But experts are downbeat about the chances of the rest of the funds being recoverable, given the North Korean expertise in hacking and laundering the money.",
      "\"North Korea is a very closed system and closed economy so they created a successful industry for hacking and laundering and they don't care about the negative impression of cyber crime,\" Dr Dorit Dor from cyber security company Check Point said.",
      "Another problem is that not all crypto companies are as willing to help as others.",
      "Crypto exchange eXch is being accused by ByBit and others of not stopping the criminals cashing out.",
      "More than $90m has been successfully funnelled through this exchange.",
      "But over email the elusive owner of eXch - Johann Roberts - disputed that.",
      "He admits they didn't initially stop the funds, as his company is in a long-running dispute with ByBit, and he says his team wasn't sure the coins were definitely from the hack.",
      "He says he is now co-operating, but argues that mainstream companies that identify crypto customers are betraying the private and anonymous benefits of crypto currency.",
      "North Korea has never admitted being behind the Lazarus Group, but is thought to be the only country in the world using its hacking powers for financial gain.",
      "Previously the Lazarus Group hackers targeted banks, but have in the last five years specialised in attacking cryptocurrency companies.",
      "The industry is less well protected with fewer mechanisms in place to stop them laundering the funds.",
      "Recent hacks linked to North Korea include:",

    "story": [
      "The NHS is \"looking into\" allegations that patient data was left vulnerable to hacking due to a software flaw at a private medical services company.",
      "The flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month in England.",
      "The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.",
      "Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.",
      "The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.",
      "In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.",
      "An NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"",
      "Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.",
      "However, the software bug, discovered in November, made Medefer's internal patient record system vulnerable to hackers, the engineer said.",
      "The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.",
      "\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"",
      "The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.",
      "The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.",
      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",
      "It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was \"extremely open\".",
      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",
      "Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England.",
      "In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector.",
      "\"Individual NHS organisations must ensure they meet their legal responsibilities and national data security standards to protect patient data when appointing suppliers, and we offer them support and training nationally on how this should be done.\""

      "\"Oopsie... Too late,\" he said.",
      "The move by the US to send alleged criminals from other countries to El Salvador was an arrangement Rubio previously called \"the most unprecedented and extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world\".",
      "Bukele wrote that the detainees were immediately transferred to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) \"for a period of one year\", something that was \"renewable\" - suggesting they could be held there for longer.",
      "\"The United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us,\" he added.",
      "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the alleged gang members arrival in El Salvador and thanked Bukele, calling him \"the strongest security leader in our region\".",
      "Hours before, on Saturday evening, US District Judge James Boasberg ordered a halt to deportations covered by Trump's proclamation, which invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The law allows the government to detain and deport people threatening the country's safety without due process.",
      "After hearing that planes with deportees had taken off, Judge Boasberg ordered them turned back, the Washington Post reported.",
      "Rubio confirmed in a statement on Sunday that the deportations happened under the Alien Enemies Act, and made no mention of the judge's ruling.",
      "He said: \"Hundreds of violent criminals were sent out of our country.\"",
      "A video attached to one of Bukele's social media post shows lines of people with their hands and feet shackled being escorted by armed officials from the plane.",
      "Some of the detainees are placed into the back of armoured vehicles, while others, hunched over as officers push their heads down, are forced onto buses.",
      "The video also shows an aerial view of a long, winding police escort leading the buses into El Salvador's notorious mega-jail Cecot.",
      "The newly-built maximum-security jail is a proud achievement of Bukele's, and part of his effort to crack down on the country's organised crime.",
      "The facility, which can hold up to 40,000 people, has been criticised by human rights groups for maltreatment of inmates.",
      "The arrangement between the US and El Salvador is a sign of strengthening diplomatic ties.",
      "\"Thank you for your assistance and friendship,\" Rubio told Bukele on Sunday.",
      "El Salvador was the second country Rubio, the US's top diplomat, visited after he was sworn in.",

      "The latest deportations under Trump's second term are part of the president's long-running crusade against illegal immigration in the US.",
      "In January, Trump signed an executive order declaring Tren de Aragua and MS-13 as foreign terrorist organisations.",
      "He won voters on the campaign trail, in part, by promising to enact the largest deportation operation in US history.",
      "The agenda has so far not met expectations, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents not meeting Trump's daily quota for arrests.",
      "A recent report suggested ICE agents had deported fewer immigrants in February than they had the same month a year prior during the previous administration under Joe Biden - 11,000 in February 2025, compared to 12,000 in February 2024 - according to NBC News."

      "The mission had been delayed by several years because of technical issues in the spacecraft's development, and there were problems during its launch and docking on to the ISS. This included issues with some of Starliner's thrusters, which would be needed to slow the spacecraft for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, and leaks of helium gas in the propulsion system.",
      "Nasa decided that it would not take even a small risk in bringing back Butch and Suni on Starliner, when they had the option of returning them on SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Nasa decided the best option was to do this during a scheduled crew rotation, even though it would mean keeping the astronauts on the space station for several months.",
      "Boeing has consistently argued that it would have been safe to bring Butch and Suni back on Starliner, and were unhappy about the decision to use a rival's capsule instead, which will be \"embarrassing\" for Boeing, according to Dr Barber.",

      "\"We looked at a wide range of options and worked hand-in-hand with SpaceX to look at what was the best thing to do overall and when we laid all that out the best option was to have the one we are embarking upon,\" he said.",
      "That decision was supported by Dr Libby Jackson, who is head of space at the Science Museum in London and worked at Europe's control centre for the ISS.",
      "\"Butch and Suni's wellbeing would always have been at the very forefront of everybody's minds as the decisions were being made for how best to deal with the circumstances that they were presented,\" she said.",
      "\"Nasa made those decisions based on good technical reasons, on programmatic reasons, and found the right solution that has kept Butch and Suni safe.",

      "The students have been calling for full transparency and accountability over the collapse of a concrete and glass canopy at the station in Serbia's second city, which was renovated and only reopened - by Vucic - in 2022.",
      "They want the government to publish all the documentation relating to the renovation project and say they are not satisfied with the papers the authorities have released so far.",
      "They also want those responsible for the disaster to be charged and convicted. Prosecutors have indicted at least 16 people, including former construction minister Goran Vesic.",
      "But the charges have yet to go to trial. And the students insist they will continue with their protests until the authorities meet all their demands.",
      "\"We're making progress,\" a student representing Belgrade University's philosophy faculty told the BBC. \"But at this point none of our demands have been met completely.\"",
      "\"A couple of politicians have resigned from their offices,\" noted another. \"But they weren't fired. We're yet to see anything but empty promises\".",
      "Prime Minister Milos Vucevic announced his resignation at the end of January. But that has yet to be ratified by the National Assembly and he remains in his post.",
      "But the real power in Serbia lies with Vucic, who insists that he is going nowhere.",
      "\"I don't give in to blackmail,\" he told a media conference on the eve of the big protest. \"I won't allow the street to pave a horrible future for this country.\"",
      "Vucic described the student protests as \"well-intentioned\". But he had less flattering words for opposition parties, labelling them members of a \"criminal cartel\". He accused them of attempting to force the formation of a \"fraudulent interim government\".",
      "Borko Stefanovic does not deny that the opposition parties are looking for the establishment of a \"government of experts\".",
      "The deputy president of the Party of Freedom and Justice describes it as the \"only rational way out\" of the political crisis, which would establish the conditions for fresh elections.",
      "Like other opposition leaders, Stefanovic says that free elections are not currently possible due to the Progressive Party's domination of the media and state institutions.",
      "But this is not one of the students' demands. They are simply calling for the truth behind the Novi Sad disaster to be established.",
      "As law professor Miodrag Jovanovic puts it \"they are asking for the things I've been lecturing about - the rule of law, respect for the constitution, and the responsibility and accountability of public officials\".",
      "Whatever happens during the \"15th for 15\" protest, it seems unlikely that the students will relent until they receive some satisfactory answers."

Tackling noise means asking people to live their lives differently - which creates problems of its own.",

      "He took on the mission after his daughter was born. \"I want to stop all honking from not only Dhaka, but from Bangladesh,\" he says.",

      "There is a crackdown on honking horns to get the noise levels down - with an awareness campaign and stricter enforcement of existing laws.",
      "She said: \"It's impossible to get it done in one year or two years, but I think it is possible to ensure that the city becomes less noisy, and when people feel that, they feel better when it's less noisy, I'm sure their habit will also change.\"",
      "The solutions to noise can be difficult, complicated and challenging to solve.",
      "What I'm left with is a new appreciation for finding some space in our lives to just escape the noise because in the words of Dr Masrur Abdul Quader, from the Bangladesh University of Professionals, it is \"a silent killer and a slow poison\".",

    "summary": "Going to school in Ghana was like prison for Londoner Mark Wilberforce, but he feels it kept him from jail.",
    "story": [
      "When my mother told me at the age of 16 that we were going from the UK to Ghana for the summer holidays, I had no reason to doubt her.",
      "It was just a quick trip, a temporary break - nothing to worry about. Or so I thought.",
      "One month in, she dropped the bombshell - I was not coming back to London until I had reformed and had earned enough GCSEs to continue my education.",
      "I was hoodwinked in a similar way to the British-Ghanaian teenager who recently took his parents to the High Court in London for sending him to school in Ghana.",
      "In their defence, they told the judge they did not want to see their 14-year-old son become \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London\".",
      "Back in the mid-1990s, my mother, a primary school teacher, was motivated by similar concerns.",
      "I had been excluded from two high schools in the London Borough of Brent, hanging out with the wrong crowd (becoming the wrong crowd) - and heading down a dangerous path.",
      "My closest friends at the time ended up in prison for armed robbery. Had I stayed in London, I would have almost certainly been convicted with them.",
      "But being sent to Ghana also felt like a prison sentence.",
      "I can empathise to a degree with the teenager, who said in his court statement that he feels like he is \"living in hell\".",
      "Yet, speaking for myself, by the time I turned 21 I realised what my mother had done had been a blessing.",
      "Unlike the boy at the centre of the London court case - which he lost - I did not go to boarding school in Ghana.",
      "My mother placed me in the care of her two closest brothers, they wanted to keep an eye on me and it was felt that being around boarders could prove too much of a distraction.",
      "I first stayed with my Uncle Fiifi, a former UN environmentalist, in a town called Dansoman, near the capital, Accra.",
      "The lifestyle change hit hard. In London, I had my own bedroom, access to washing machines and a sense of independence - even if I was using it recklessly.",
      "In Ghana, I was waking up at 05:00 to sweep the courtyard and wash my uncle's often muddy pick-up truck and my aunt's car.",
      "It was her vehicle that I would later steal - something of a watershed moment.",
      "I did not even know how to drive properly, treating a manual like an automatic and I crashed it into a high-ranking soldier's Mercedes.",
      "I tried to flee the scene. But that soldier caught me and threatened to take me to Burma Camp, the notorious military base where people had disappeared in the past.",
      "That was the last truly reckless thing I did.",
      "It was not just discipline that I learnt in Ghana - it was perspective.",
      "Life in Ghana showed me how much I had taken for granted.",
      "Washing clothes by hand and preparing meals with my aunt made me appreciate the effort needed.",
      "Food, like everything in Ghana, required patience. There were no microwaves, no fast-food runs.",
      "Making the traditional dough-like dish fufu, for example, is laborious and involves pounding cooked yams or cassava into a paste with a mortar.",
      "At the time, it felt like punishment. Looking back, it was building resilience.",
      "Initially, my uncles considered placing me in high-end schools like the Ghana International School or SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College.",
      "But they were smart. They knew I might just form a new crew to cause chaos and mischief.",
      "Instead, I received private tuition at Accra Academy, a state secondary school that my late father had attended. It meant I was often taught on my own or in small groups.",
      "Lessons were in English, but out of school those around me were often speaking local languages and I found it easy to pick them up perhaps because it was such an immersive experience.",
      "Back home in London, I used to love to learn swear words in my mother's Fante language - but was far from fluent.",
      "When I later moved to the city of Tema to stay with my favourite uncle, Uncle Jojo - an agricultural expert, I continued private tuition at Tema Secondary School.",
      "In contrast to the boy making the headlines in the UK, who claimed Ghana's education system was not up to standard, I found it to be exacting.",
      "I was considered academically gifted in the UK, despite my troublesome ways, but actually found it tough going in Ghana. Students my age were far ahead in subjects like maths and science.",
      "The rigour of the Ghanaian system pushed me to study harder than I ever had in London.",
      "The result? I earned five GCSEs with grades C and above - something that once seemed impossible.",
      "Beyond academic achievements, Ghanaian society instilled values that have stayed with me for life.",
      "Respect for elders was non-negotiable. Throughout the neighbourhoods I lived in, you greeted those older than you, regardless of whether or not you knew them.",
      "Ghana did not just make me more disciplined and respectful - it made me fearless.",
      "Football played a huge part in that transformation. I played in the parks, which were often hard red clay with loose pebbles and stones, with two square goalposts fashioned out of wood and string.",
      "It was a far cry from the neatly maintained pitches in England, but it toughened me up in ways I could not have imagined - and it is no wonder some of the greatest  footballers seen in the English Premier League have come from West Africa.",
      "The aggressive style played in Ghana was not just about skill - it was about resilience and endurance. Getting tackled on rough ground meant picking yourself up, dusting yourself off and carrying on.",
      "Every Sunday, I played football on the beach - though I would often be late because there was absolutely no way either of my uncles would allow me to stay home instead of attending church.",
      "Those services felt like they lasted forever. But it was also a testament to Ghana as a God-fearing nation, where faith is deeply embedded in everyday life.",
      "The first 18 months were the hardest. I resented the restrictions, the chores, the discipline.",
      "I even tried stealing my passport to fly back to London, but my mother was ahead of me and had hidden it well. There was no escape.",
      "My only choice was to adapt. Somewhere along the way, I stopped seeing Ghana as a prison and started seeing it as happy home.",
      "I know of a few others like me who were sent back to Ghana by their parents living in London.",
      "Michael Adom was 17 when he arrived in Accra for school in the 1990s, describing his experience as \"bittersweet\". He stayed until he was 23 and now lives back in London working as a probation officer.",
      "His main complaint was the loneliness - he missed his family and friends. There were times of anger about his situation and the complications of feeling misunderstood.",
      "This largely stemmed from the fact that his parents had not taught him or his siblings any of the local languages when growing up in London.",
      "\"I didn't understand Ga. I didn't understand Twi. I didn't understand Pidgin,\" the 49-year-old tells me.",
      "This made him feel vulnerable for his first two-and-a-half years - and, he says, liable to being fleeced, for example, by those increasing prices because he seemed foreign.",
      "\"Anywhere I went, I had to make sure I went with somebody else,\" he says.",
      "But he ended up becoming fluent in Twi and, overall, he believes the positives outweighed the negatives: \"It made me a man.",
      "\"My Ghana experience matured me and changed me for the better, by helping me to identify with who I am, as a Ghanaian, and cemented my understanding of my culture, background and family history.\"",
      "I can concur with this. By my third year, I had fallen in love with the culture and even stayed on for nearly two more years after passing my GCSEs.",
      "I developed a deep appreciation of the local food. Back in London, I never thought twice about what I was eating. But in Ghana, food was not just sustenance - each dish had its own story.",
      "I became obsessed with \"waakye\" - a dish made from rice and black-eyed peas, often cooked with millet leaves, giving it a distinctive purple-brown colour. It was usually served with fried plantain, the spicy black pepper sauce \"shito\", boiled eggs, and sometimes even spaghetti or fried fish. It was the ultimate comfort food.",
      "I enjoyed the music, the warmth of the people and the sense of community. I was not just \"stuck\" in Ghana any more - I was thriving.",
      "My mother, Patience Wilberforce, passed away recently, and with her loss I have reflected deeply on the decision she made all those years ago.",
      "She saved me. Had she not tricked me into staying in Ghana, the chances of me having a criminal record or even serving time in prison would have been extremely high.",
      "I went on to enrol at the College of North West London aged 20 to study media production and communications, before joining BBC Radio 1Xtra via a mentoring scheme.",
      "The guys I used to hang out with in north-west London did not get the second chance that I did.",
      "Ghana reshaped my mindset, my values and my future. It turned a misguided menace into a responsible man.",
      "While such an experience might not work for everyone, it gave me the education, discipline and respect I needed to reintegrate into society when I returned to England.",
      "And for that, I am forever indebted to my mother, to my uncles and to the country that saved me.",

    "summary": "Campaigners in St Louis want support for those who claim to have become ill due to research into the atomic bomb.",
    "story": [
      "After Kim Visintine put her son to bed every night at a hospital in St Louis, Missouri, she spent her evening in the hospital\u2019s library. She was determined to know how her boy had become seriously ill with a rare brain tumour at just a week old.",
      "\"Doctors were shocked,\" she says. \"We were told that his illness was one in a million. Other parents were learning to change diapers but I was learning how to change chemotherapy ports and IVs.\"",
      "Kim\u2019s son Zack was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme. It is a brain tumour that is very rare in children and is usually seen in adults over 45.",
      "Zack had chemotherapy treatments but doctors said there was no hope of him ever recovering. He died at just six years old.",
      "Years later, social media and community chatter made Kim start to think that her son was not an isolated case. Perhaps he was part of a bigger picture growing in their community surrounding Coldwater Creek.",
      "In this part of the US, cancer fears have prompted locals to accuse officials of not doing enough to support those who may have been exposed to radiation due to the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s.",
      "A compensation programme that was designed to pay out to some Americans who contracted diseases after exposure to radiation expired last year - before it could be extended to the St Louis area.",
      "This Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (Reca) provided one-time payouts to people who may have developed cancer or other diseases while living in areas where activities such as atomic weapons testing took place. It paid out $2.6bn (\u00a32bn) to more than 41,000 claimants before coming to an end in 2024.",
      "Benefits were paid to such neighbours, frequently called \"downwinders\", in Arizona, Utah and Nevada, but not New Mexico, where the world's first test of a nuclear weapon took place in 1945. Research published in 2020 by the National Cancer Institute suggested that hundreds of cancers in the area would not have occurred without radiation exposure.",
      "St Louis, meanwhile, was where uranium was refined and used to help create the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. After World War Two ended, the chemical was dumped near the creek and left uncovered, allowing waste to seep into the area.",
      "Decades later, federal investigators acknowledged an increased cancer risk for some people who played in the creek as children, but added in their report: \"The predicted increases in the number of cancer cases from exposures are small, and no method exists to link a particular cancer with this exposure.\"",
      "The clean-up of the creek is still ongoing and is not expected to finish until 2038.",
      "A new bill has been put forward in the House, and Josh Hawley, a US senator representing Missouri, says he has raised the issue with President Donald Trump.",
      "When Kim flicks through her school yearbook, she can identify those who have become sick and those who have since passed away. The numbers are startling.",
      "\"My husband didn\u2019t grow up in this area, and he said to me, 'Kim, this is not normal. It seems like we\u2019re always talking about one of your friends passing away or going to a funeral',\" she says.",
      "Just streets away from the creek, Karen Nickel grew up spending her days near the water picking berries, or in the nearby park playing baseball. Her brother would often try and catch fish in Coldwater Creek.",
      "\"I always tell people that we had just the fairytale childhood that you would expect in what you consider suburban America,\" says Karen. \"Big backyards, big families, children playing out together until the street lights came on at night.\"",
      "But years later, her carefree childhood now looks very different.",
      "\"Fifteen people from the street I grew up on have died from rare cancers,\" she says. \"We have neighbourhoods here where every house has been affected by some cancer or some illness. We have streets where you can\u2019t just find a house where a family has not been affected by this.\"",
      "When Karen\u2019s sister was just 11 years old, doctors discovered that her ovaries were covered in cysts. The same had happened to their neighbour when she was just nine. Karen\u2019s six-year-old granddaughter was born with a mass on her right ovary.",
      "Karen helped found Just Moms STL, a group that is dedicated to protecting the community from future exposures that could be linked to cancers - and which advocates for a clean-up of the area.",
      "\"We get messages every day from people that are suffering from illnesses and are questioning whether this is from exposure,\" she says. \"These are very aggressive illnesses that the community is getting, from cancers all the way to autoimmune diseases.\"",
      "Teresa Rumfelt grew up just a street away from Karen and lived in her family home from 1979 until 2010. She remembers every one of her animals passing away from cancer and her neighbours getting ill from rare diseases.",
      "Years later, her sister Via Von Banks was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neurone disease. Some medical studies have suggested there could be a link between radiation and ALS, but this is not definitive - and more research needs to be done to firm it up.",
      "That does not reassure people like Teresa who are concerned that more needs to be done to understand how locals are being affected.",
      "\"ALS took my sister at 50,\" Teresa says. \"I think it was the worst disease ever of mankind. When she was diagnosed in 2019, she\u2019d just got her career going and her children were growing. She stayed positive through all of it.\"",
      "Like Hawley, Just STL Moms and other community members want the government's compensation act to be expanded to include people within the St Louis area, despite the programme being in limbo after expiring.",
      "Expanding it to the Coldwater Creek community would mean that locals could be offered compensation if they could prove they were harmed as a result of the Manhattan Project, during which the atomic bomb was developed with the help of uranium-processing in St Louis. It would also allow screenings and further study into illnesses other than cancer.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the US government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it took concerns very seriously and had actively worked with federal, state and local partners - as well as community members - to understand their health concerns, and to ensure community members were not exposed to the Manhattan Project-era waste.",
      "The BBC has also contacted the US Army Corps of Engineers, which is leading the clean-up - but has not received a response to a request for comment.",
      "\"My sister would have loved to be part of the fight. She\u2019d be the first to picket,\" says Teresa of her efforts to get greater support from the government.",
      "The trend in people around Coldwater Creek getting unwell has not gone unnoticed among healthcare professionals.",
      "Dr Gautum Agarwal, a cancer surgeon at Mercy Hospital in St Louis, says he has not noticed a \"statistical thing\", but notes that he has seen husbands and wives and their neighbours presenting cancers.",
      "Now, he ensures that his patients are asked where they live and how close they are to Coldwater Creek.",
      "\"I tell them that there\u2019s a potential that there\u2019s a link. And if your neighbours or family live near there, we should get them screened more often. And maybe you should get your kids screened earlier.\"",
      "He hopes that over time more knowledge will be gained about the issue, and for a study into multi-cancer early detection tests to be introduced that could help catch any potential cancers, and help reassure people in the area.",
      "Other experts take a different view of the risks. \"There is a narrative that many people are sick from cancers, specifically from exposures while living next to Coldwater Creek for the last few decades\", says Roger Lewis, a professor in the environmental and occupations health department of St Louis University.",
      "\"But the data and studies don't indicate that. They show that there is some risk but it's small. It doesn't mean that it's not significant in some ways, but it's very limited.\"",
      "Prof Lewis acknowledges the fear in the community, saying locals will feel safer if the government is clearer about its efforts  to eliminate any hazards.",
      "For many people near Coldwater Creek, conversation with authorities is not easing the angst that comes with living in an area known for the dumping of nuclear waste.",
      "\"It\u2019s almost a given in our community that at some point we all expect to have some sort of cancer or illness,\u201d says Kim Visintine. \u201cThere\u2019s almost this apathy within our group that, well, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\"",
      "Correction 16 March: This article originally reported that the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act covered parts of New Mexico. It has been amended to show that benefits were paid under the act to people in Arizona, Nevada and Utah, but not in New Mexico."

    "summary": "A fashion show in a snowy town has sparked a controversy in Indian-administered Kashmir.",
    "story": [
      "A fashion show held last week in a picturesque, snow-clad town in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked a major controversy that is still simmering.",
      "The show, by the well-known fashion brand Shivan & Narresh, was held last Friday at a ski resort in Gulmarg to display their skiwear collection. The label is the first big, non-local brand to hold a fashion show in Kashmir, a scenic Himalayan region which has seen decades of violence.",
      "But it soon sparked outrage among locals, politicians and religious leaders in Muslim-majority Kashmir after fashion publisher Elle India posted a video on social media which showed some models wearing underwear or bikinis. Locals were also angry over another video - shared by online magazine Lifestyle Asia - of a party held after the show, which showed people drinking alcohol outdoors.",
      "Many took offence with the show being held in the holy month of Ramadan - a time of fasting and prayer for Muslims - and accused the designers of \"mocking their faith\" and \"disregarding local culture and sentiments\". Some clerics called the show \"obscene\" and said it was like \"soft porn\".",
      "Some others explained that the outrage had arisen not only from religious conservatism, but also from a fear of cultural imposition from \"outsiders\". Kashmir has witnessed decades of armed separatist insurgency against Indian rule since the late 1980s.",
      "The backlash prompted Elle India and Lifestyle Asia to delete their videos. Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja, the designers behind the label, also apologised, saying that their \"sole intention was to celebrate creativity\" and that they didn't intend to offend religious sentiments.",
      "Kashmir - known as the land of saints and Sufism (Islamic mysticism) - has a rich tradition of spirituality which influences many aspects of peoples' lives. The traditional attire is modest, with locals - both men and women - often wearing the pheran, a long, loose cloak.",
      "The row also moved off social media and a discussion about the show and the after-party caused a ruckus in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly.",
      "The opposition criticised the government, accusing it of giving permission for the event despite being aware of local sensitivities. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah distanced his government from the event, saying it had been organised by private entities, and asking local authorities to investigate the matter and submit a report.",
      "\"If law has been violated, strict action will be taken,\" he said in the assembly on Monday. The police have not yet given details about who organised the event and what laws, if any, have been violated.",
      "The fashion brand did not respond to the BBC's questions about the show, including about permissions it obtained.",
      "It's not surprising that scenic Gulmarg - one of India's few skiing destinations and a favourite with tourists - was the choice of venue for a show highlighting a skiwear collection.",
      "Fashion journalist Shefalee Vasudev says it's not uncommon for designers to want to hold fashion shows in exquisite locations.",
      "In fact, international designers like Alexander McQueen and Karl Lagerfeld are remembered as much for their creative, theatrical fashion shows as they are for their iconic designs.",
      "But experimentation brings with it the risk of controversy and so, it's important to be mindful of the political and cultural sensitivities of a place, Ms Vasudev told the BBC.",
      "And this holds especially true in a place like Kashmir, which has witnessed wars and decades of armed conflict.",
      "Article 370: What happened with Kashmir and why it matters'Don't beat us, just shoot us': Kashmiris allege violent army crackdown",
      "Article 370: What happened with Kashmir and why it matters",
      "'Don't beat us, just shoot us': Kashmiris allege violent army crackdown",
      "Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but control it only in parts. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the territory.",
      "Thousands of people have been killed since the late 1980s, when a separatist insurgency broke out against Indian rule. Though the separatist movement has lost steam over the years, many locals continue to view the administration in Delhi with distrust.",
      "These sentiments have deepened since 2019 when the federal government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, stripped the region of its autonomy.",
      "So some locals told the BBC that they were not surprised by the reactions to the show.",
      "\"Everything in Kashmir is political; people see things through a political prism,\" says Mir, a professor at a local university (he asked for his surname to be withheld to protect his identity). He adds that people are sceptical about big corporate events like the fashion show and - even if they are organised by private players - they believe that the government is trying to dilute their culture.",
      "Arshid Ahmad, a researcher, uses stronger words to express public angst. \"The government is trying to dilute the spirit of resistance in Kashmiris,\" he says.",
      "This isn't the first time an event held by non-locals has triggered a controversy in Kashmir. In 2013, separatists and human rights activists in the region protested against a show by renowned conductor Zubin Mehta. They said it was an attempt by the government to show the world that all was well in Kashmir when people were \"suffering and dying\".",
      "Some of the recent apprehensions around culture and identity can also be tied to the increase in tourists to Kashmir from other states in India. The federal government has often connected this boom in tourism to the abrogation of Article 370, which stripped the region of its autonomy.",
      "Nousheen Fatima, 34, says because of government messaging, people outside Kashmir now see the region as being safer and \"more assimilated with India\". But she alleges that many tourists do not respect the region's culture.",
      "Last year, a video showing tourists drinking alcohol during a boat ride on the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar evoked outrage from political and religious leaders, who called the behaviour \"un-Islamic and unethical\".",
      "In February, locals put up posters in Srinagar, asking tourists to \"respect local culture and traditions\" and \"avoid alcohol and use of drugs\", but these were later pulled down by the police.",
      "In an editorial for The Voice of Fashion magazine, Ms Vasudev argues that the outrage needs to be examined from a critical lens. She asks if it would have been all right for the show to have been held in another Indian city instead of Kashmir, where Muslims would also be observing Ramadan. And whether it would have been acceptable to hold the show in Kashmir if it featured only outfits perceived as modest.",
      "She also points out that Kashmir is home to the \"world's finest wool yarn; some of the finest handspun, handwoven pashmina creations and its artisans\".",
      "\"What Kashmir creates and stands for cannot be replicated anywhere. Shouldn't a fashion show at Gulmarg then, with innovative garments made with 100% wool, be seen as regenerating interest in untried ways?\" she asks.",

      "Retired Navy Admiral William McRaven was the architect of the mission that tracked down Osama bin Laden. He's also a bestselling author. Now, McRaven and his daughter, Kelly, have thoughts about children and storytelling:",
      "WILLIAM: When I was a boy, my father, an Air Force fighter pilot, would tell me stories before bedtime, making up characters and weaving them into exciting tales of adventure. Every story had a moral. Elmer the Elf was always honest and kind, helping those less fortunate. Freddy the Frog was courageous and heroic, saving people from aliens and bad guys.",

      "What I didn't realize at the time was that these stories were more than just entertaining; they were carefully crafted to teach us valuable morals and lessons that he hoped we would carry into our daily lives. Much as his own father had taught him these lessons, he was now passing them along.",
      "WILLIAM: Now, as parents, we want our children to grow up to be thoughtful, kind, generous, honest, hard-working, and courageous. We hope that they will learn these lessons by watching us, provided we do the right things in life.",
      "However, the stories we tell them at a young age play a crucial role in their development. If we tell them stories of boys and girls like them, who overcome challenges by being honest, noble and courageous, they are more likely to grow up admiring and demonstrating these qualities.",
      "KELLY: I've always understood the power of storytelling, but as a new mother, I'm even more aware of how crucial it is to continue our family tradition of reading to my daughter. At a time when reading levels are declining and screen time is on the rise, it's more important than ever to share stories that teach valuable lessons in fun and engaging ways.",
      "WILLIAM: Translating my adult books into children's books was a natural evolution, and an important mission for me. My adult books all try to convey the values that I believe make us better citizens, leaders, and human beings.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Mar 2025 11:10:20 -0400",
    "summary": "The Emmy-winning star of \"Succession\" earned an Olivier Award for portraying 26 different characters in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in London. And now, she's bringing her chameleonic performance to Broadway.",
    "story": [
      "Sarah Snook set the record straight for us: Her last name is pronounced \"Snuke\" (like nuke), not \"Snook\" (as in book or took).",
      "On Broadway this spring, she's neither Snuke nor Snook, but 26 completely different people. The 37-year-old Australian is chameleonic in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" changing accents, wigs, and gender to tell the story of a man who makes a spiritual bargain to appear eternally young, while his portrait reflects the hideousness of his actions.",
      "The show has suspense, horror, humor, and also a lot of heart. \"People don't often credit Oscar Wilde with something heartfelt,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, he has a lot of pathos,\" Snook said. \"I think there's a lot of empathy for the human condition \u2013 I think, you know, seeing the soul as a real thing and as a part of your body, personality, spiritual makeup that one might need to protect and look after.\"",
      "It's a performance for which Snook won an Olivier (the British theater award) during the show's run in London's West End.",
      "Oscar Wilde published the story (his only novel) in 1890. Victorian critics called it \"poisonous\" and \"morally depraved.\" Now, almost a century-and-a-half later, the tale feels resonant. Snook said today is an interesting time to come to this story, \"where we have such an image-based culture and ability to construct a visual image to sell to anyone online, on Instagram. And part of the reason of playing multiple different characters is about choosing which mask is the right mask, which is the public/private mask that we show of ourselves.\"",
      "After making her name known abroad, Snook is now beloved by American audiences as Siobhan \"Shiv\" Roy, the cutthroat billionaire she played as the scion of a family empire on the TV series \"Succession.\" The saltiness of her Shiv garnered Snook legions of fans, and several awards.",
      "But Snook initially didn't want to audition for Shiv because, she says, she couldn't relate to her being beautiful and wealthy. \"Yeah, there was nothing in myself that I could see as, like, reflective or accessible in that character,\" she said.",
      "Like Dorian Gray, Shiv is an anti-hero, and Snook's been drawn to those complicated characters for a long time: \"I watched a ton of Disney films when I was a kid, and all I wanted to be was Ursula and Scar, all the villains, all the people who had seeming more complexity to why they were that in the first place.\"",
      "Snook discovered that complexity for herself during one of her first acting gigs back home in Adelaide: \"I used to do fairy parties. It was such a good training ground, 'cause kids, man, they tell you if they're not interested.\"",
      "Was she heckled? \"Yeah. Like, 'Fly! Lemme see you fly! Come on! Why can't you fly? Show us!'\"",
      "Kip Williams, the director and adapter of \"Dorian Gray,\" arrived at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney the year that Snook had just left. \"There was this word around school that there was this incredible red-headed actress, so my radar as a director was up for Sarah from the beginning,\" he said.",
      "Williams knew that he wanted to collaborate with Snook, and felt that a single actor could embody all the facets of Wilde's legendary work. \"Oscar Wilde talks about this notion that life is one grand act of theater, and that people are always in a form of performance where they are either revealing or concealing parts of themselves,\" Williams said. \"So, the form of this piece \u2013 one performer playing all of these 26 characters \u2013 is an expression of that idea.\"",
      "It is with technology that Williams illuminates humanity. He calls it \"cine-theater\" \u2013 combining live performance with cameras, large screens, and pre-recorded videos.",
      "So, is it fair to call this a one-woman show? \"I think it is definitely a one-person show,\" Williams said, \"but it is also, paradoxically, an ensemble piece. The camera team and the crew are kind of like her co-performers. They dance with her on stage \u2013 literally, one moment.\"",
      "A dance that feels intimately familiar to Snook: \"The feeling of a camera really close to you and not having that disrupt your train of thought or your flow, I think that's something that was really useful in 'Succession,' 'cause we kind of absorbed them as extra characters in the scene,\" she said.",
      "Snook has a few extra characters in her own life, too. She got married during the pandemic and has a young daughter. But as it turns out, Sarah Snook has not bitten off more than she can chew.",
      "\"So, this is your Broadway debut. Is the pressure off since you've already had such a successful run?\" I asked.",
      "Snook replied, \"Actually, one thing that Kip said on the first day of rehearsals is, 'You can only eat an elephant one spoonful at a time.' 'Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll do it that way.'\"",
      "\"So you think you've eaten the whole thing by now?\"",
      "\"No, now I've gotta eat the Broadway part of the elephant!\" Snook laughed.",

    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",

      "Griffin's memoir explores how keeping secrets can lead to shame and how revealing those secrets can be empowering. The book details Griffin's experience with childhood sexual abuse by a teacher, trauma she had suppressed for years.",
      "\"This book is going to help so many other people, particularly people who have suffered any kind of sexual abuse or any kind of shame, reveal for themselves,\" Winfrey said.",
      "Griffin described writing the memoir as a lengthy process, but said it was \"freeing.\" She explained that she had built \"walls and castles and moats\" in her life thinking they would keep her safe, but found liberation through sharing her story.",
      "\"When you realize that vulnerability is really the power that you have ... it changed so much in my life, in my relationships in every form,\" Griffin said.",

      "\"When you live in this perfect environment, you don't want to have to admit to yourself that something is wrong,\" Winfrey said.",
      "Griffin described how her children helped her recognize she needed to address her past, recalling her daughter saying, \"Mom, you are here, but you're not really here.\"",

    "story": [
      "Discussion Questions",
      "1. Amy Griffin spent much of her adult life determined to move forward, never letting herself stop to look back. What do you think eventually motivated her to want to revisit her past and then to tell her story? Talk about the courage it takes to confront one's past\u2014and to share it with the world. Have you ever decided to divulge something about yourself that you once felt was impossible to share?",
      "2. Amy was a star student in her small Texas town, and she became a high-achieving businesswoman after arriving in New York. Talk about ambition as a trauma response. Do you think Amy believed she could outwork (and outrun) her past? How can \"The Tell\" serve as a reminder that people who appear to \"have it all\" are not always as they seem?",
      "3. A physical therapist tells Amy: \"There's something your body is telling you that you don't want to hear.\" How did her body's message manifest? What messages has your body sent you over the years? What makes it hard for you to listen to the messages your body sends?",
      "4. John supports Amy's decision to try therapy with Olivia and he works to keep the family's life afloat at home while she takes time to process what she's uncovered. But John also understands his own limits, telling Amy when she needs to find outside support so he can just be her husband. How does he know when to place this boundary? How does Amy react to this? Have you ever had to place a difficult boundary to preserve a relationship?",
      "5. Would you try psychedelic-assisted therapy? Why or why not?",
      "6. \"I needed to find the evidence that would confirm my memories,\" Amy writes in her journal. Why do you think Amy needs others to confirm what she knows to be true?",
      "7. What did you learn from \"The Tell\" and from Amy's sessions with Lauren about how memory works? Consider the distinction between memory storage and memory recall, for instance. What did you find most surprising?",
      "8. \"My daughters were asking me to participate in life, and in our relationship, in a way that I could not.\" How do Amy's children both trigger her memories\u2014and help her heal?",
      "9. For years, Amy remembers so many details around the abuse, but not the abuse itself. She saw clues, but not the full picture of her trauma. How did \"The Tell\" make you consider\u2014or reconsider\u2014your own life events and memories? Is there anything you might be unable or unwilling to remember? Have you ever surprised yourself by \"unlocking\" an unexpected memory?",
      "10. Amy begins to feel that justice will bring her closure. How was Paul's story both a helpful\u2014and unfortunately rare\u2014example for Amy? How does it affect her when she realizes her own story might not have such a tidy or satisfying outcome?",
      "11. What was it like for her to tell her parents? Have you ever had to have a difficult conversation with your parents about your childhood? What did you learn through that conversation\u2014about yourself or about them?",
      "12. Amy was raised in a traditional patriarchal Texas culture. Children were expected to both respect and obey their elders. How do the environments of our childhoods\u2014and the cultures in which we are raised\u2014inform our adult choices? How can our backgrounds influence what we can and cannot face in our personal histories?",
      "13. Amy recognizes the resources and time she was able to devote to both her healing and pursuing her legal case. How are situations of abuse and survival different for those without the same resources? In what ways might financial and class privileges insulate you from pain, or not?",
      "14. At the beginning of her journey, Amy can't \"tell\" her secret to herself. By the end, she's realized \"the telling is the medicine.\" How does telling her story help Amy heal?",
      "15. How does Amy give herself the closure she needs?",
      "16. Who do you think wrote the postcard? Does the writer's identity matter?",
      "17. What was your biggest takeaway from \"The Tell\"?",

      "Dylan Mulvaney\u00a0burst onto the scene as a TikTok star, but what made her most famous was controversy. The trans influencer and performer was targeted after appearing in a campaign for Bud Light in 2023.",
      "In her new memoir, \"Paper Doll: Notes from a Late Bloomer,\" Mulvaney shares journal entries documenting the first year of her gender transition.",
      "\"I think of the book as like a quarter life crisis. But at the end of the day, I think it has a lot more heart than social media ever can have,\" Mulvaney said.",
      "Her TikTok series \"Days of Girlhood\" became a viral sensation, attracting more than one billion views. As her profile grew, the 28-year-old became a regular on red carpets.",
      "Mulvaney said she knew her gender identity from an early age.",
      "\"I knew I was a girl. That was one of the purest thoughts and intentions I've ever had throughout my entire life was to be brought into this world and to, so clearly, know who I was, and then to be told otherwise, is very conflicting,\" she said.",
      "She first came out as gay at 14, but it took another decade to embrace her identity as a trans woman.",
      "\"I settled into the identity as gay because that was all I saw around me,\" she explained.",
      "In 2023, Mulvaney joined celebrities partnering with Bud Light for a social media campaign. Her content was singled out by conservatives, leading to widespread backlash and\u00a0boycotts. Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, saw its revenue fall by more than 10% after the campaign was released.",
      "\"It took a lot to not feel guilty about that experience because I felt like it was my fault. And that me taking this one brand deal was affecting trans people globally,\" Mulvaney said. \"I think extremists and transphobic media needed a poster child, but I would've never done anything or taken any deal that I thought could negatively impact me or the community.\"",
      "The experience affected her mental health, she said.",
      "\"It resulted in a lot of suicidal ideation and dissociation,\" Mulvaney said. \"I'm still battling with some of that guilt and that shame, and that dysphoria that was projected onto me during that time.\"",
      "Her new book comes amid renewed debate over transgender rights in the U.S. Last month, a group of transgender people filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order that halted gender marker changes on passports.",
      "For Mulvaney, the executive order doesn't change how she feels.",
      "\"I'm a woman no matter what my passport says. We are not hurting anyone,\" she said. \"We're less than 1% of the population. And the way that they speak about us so often is as if we're taking over cities like Godzilla.\"",
      "\"I am now realizing that this is life or death for a lot of people,\" she added. \"I want every trans person in this country to have the opportunity to thrive. And unfortunately, we're living in a time where it is very hard to do so.\"",

      "In recent years, research has suggested a connection between oral bacteria and Alzheimer's disease, raising concerns for those with poor dental health.",
      "With nearly 700 species of bacteria inhabiting the human mouth, experts say maintaining good oral hygiene could benefit both heart and brain health.",
      "There is growing evidence suggesting good oral health could help prevent Alzheimer's disease. One study in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease\u00a0found that people who flossed regularly had a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's than those who did not.",
      "However, researchers caution there is still limited research. The observational studies do not prove that flossing directly prevents Alzheimer's disease.",
      "\"When you think about it, what is poor gum health, poor dental health? It's really a bacterial infection,\" explained Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor. \"When you have chronic infection, chronic inflammation, we know that chronic inflammation increases your risk for heart disease, for cerebrovascular disease, brain disease. It's really important to control these things.\"",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 4 in 10 U.S. adults 30 years or older have some form of periodontal disease.",
      "In addition to causing inflammation, the bacteria associated with gum disease produce enzymes that can be directly toxic to nerves, Gounder said. They also weaken the blood-brain barrier, allowing toxins and other bacteria to enter the brain.",
      "Research shows that these oral bacteria can increase amyloid in the brain \u2014 a protein plaque connected with Alzheimer's disease.",
      "The mouth-to-brain pathway occurs when bacteria from dental problems enter the bloodstream.",
      "\"When you have gum disease and dental problems, the bacteria in your mouth are getting into the blood, and from the blood, they can travel anywhere, including the heart and the brain,\" Gounder said.",
      "This bacterial spread isn't a new concern. Before antibiotics became available in the 1800s, dental infections commonly led to heart valve infections and heart failure as bacteria spread through the bloodstream.",
      "While water picks and mouthwash offer some benefits, Gounder emphasized they aren't sufficient replacements for flossing.",
      "\"Water picks are better than nothing, but mouthwash is not a substitute ... There is really no replacement for something like flossing,\" she said.",
      "The National Institutes of Health identifies several signs of gum disease, including red, swollen, or bleeding gums; pain while chewing; persistent bad breath; and loose or sensitive teeth.",
      "For prevention, the NIH recommends brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste, flossing regularly, visiting the dentist twice per year, and avoiding smoking.",
      "The recommendation is to floss once daily, preferably before bed. However, people with gingivitis, receding gums, diabetes or heart disease may benefit from flossing at least twice daily.",

      "The GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.",
      "If confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up\u00a0more than a third\u00a0of the budget.",
      "Medicare\u00a0covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers.\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.",
      "CMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.",
      "Oz\u00a0previously worked\u00a0as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a\u00a0narrow contest\u00a0where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.",
      "Oz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid",
      "Oz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.",
      "\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"",
      "It will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like\u00a0a pricey proposal\u00a0in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.",
      "Oz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.",
      "He also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.",
      "\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.",
      "Oz criticizes Medicare Advantage",
      "During Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.",
      "Just over\u00a0half of seniors\u00a0have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.",
      "He cited\u00a0reports\u00a0showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.",
      "He also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.",
      "\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.",
      "Oz calls for limiting prior authorization",
      "Oz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.",
      "On Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"",
      "\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.",
      "Republicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed",
      "In social media posts last month, Oz\u00a0has touted\u00a0\"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.",
      "\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted\u00a0on Feb. 5.",
      "Oz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House\u00a0withdrew his nomination\u00a0to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "A majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.",
      "Oz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.",
      "Democrats criticized Oz's past",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.",
      "\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.",
      "The president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.",
      "As part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.",
      "After the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.",
      "He has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.",
      "In the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show.",

      "A total of 1,274 cases were reported in 2019, according to the CDC, the most reported in the U.S. in decades. Health officials were alarmed at the time about large and ongoing outbreaks, driven mostly by spread in undervaccinated communities in New York.",

This month, an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico tested positive for measles after their death, although health officials said the official cause of death is still under investigation.",

      "Weldon, a vaccine critic, was set to appear before the Senate's health committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, and news of the withdrawal of his nomination came less than an hour before the hearing was to begin. Axios first reported news of Weldon's nomination being pulled.",
      "The committee was expected to question him about his long record of criticizing vaccines and the agency he was nominated to lead. Weldon is a physician and a former Republican member of Congress.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon said that Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0was \"very upset\" at his nomination being pulled. Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",
      "\"Bobby Kennedy is a good man who really is passionate about improving the health of the American people,\" Weldon said. \"President Trump did a good thing in making him secretary of HHS.  Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers.\"",
      "Weldon said that Maine Sen. Susan Collins had told Kennedy she had reservations about his nomination and said the Republican senator's staff had been \"very hostile\" in a meeting with him.",

      "\"I did not express concerns to the White House. I had some reservations, but I certainly had not reached a final judgment,\" Collins said.",

      "Weldon was unfamiliar with the CDC's current budget and workforce, telling congressional staffers he was busy with his medical practice and did not want to waste time reading up on an agency he might not be confirmed to lead, they said.",
      "Two people said Collins' staff had only asked Weldon how he would address the perception that he was against vaccines, but denied accusing him of being \"anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Weldon said that over 20 years ago, while in Congress, he raised concerns about childhood vaccine safety, and \"for some reason Collins staff suddenly couldn't get over that.\"",
      "He also claimed that another senator, Louisiana Republican Dr. Bill Cassidy, had also said he was anti-vaccine and had once asked for his nomination to be withdrawn.",
      "A spokesperson for Cassidy denied that he had asked the White House for Weldon's nomination to be withdrawn. Cassidy had been \"looking forward\" to Thursday's hearing with Weldon, the spokesperson said.",
      "The CDC has faced mounting questions from senators in recent weeks over moves to reopen studies into whether vaccines are linked to autism and also over an abruptly canceled meeting of the agency's outside immunization advisers, which has yet to be rescheduled.",
      "Kennedy has also faced criticism this week for inflating the risks of measles vaccines when discussing the\u00a0record outbreak\u00a0in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Kennedy, whose department oversees the CDC, also has a history of\u00a0criticizing vaccines.",
      "After a meeting with Sen. Patty Murray last month, the Washington Democrat said she was \"deeply disturbed to hear Dr. Weldon repeat debunked claims about vaccines.\"",
      "\"As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,\" Murray said in a statement Thursday.",

There's also another, less-closely watched index that is showing signs of trouble ahead.",
      "The Russell 2000, a stock index made up of small companies, is down more than 18% since its peak in November when Mr. Trump was elected. The index initially rose on optimism that the new administration would create a more business-friendly environment, but that sentiment has changed amid an escalating trade war with some of the U.S.'s closest allies. Mass federal layoffs initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also created tremendous uncertainty for businesses.",

      "\"Some small caps like the Russell 2000 were outperforming the S&P 500 after the election, presumably on the theory that there was going to be substantial deal activity, because these companies are more likely to be acquired and merge than the largest of the large-caps,\" Daniel Hornung, former deputy director of the National Economic Council, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There was a sense that there was going to be deregulation and easier environment for transactions to occur, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty hanging over the economy and markets right now that makes it really difficult for transactions to happen,\" Hornung explained.",

      "Based on the levies currently in place on Canada, Mexico and China, and assuming retaliatory tariffs, Bank of America estimates that the earnings hit could be three times larger for small caps than for large caps.",

      "Consumers anticipate inflation climbing at an annual rate of 4.9% during the next year, their highest expectations since 2022.

    "summary": "Recent changes to student loans have caused confusion and uncertainty around recertification process for borrowers enrolled in repayment plans.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's recent changes to student loans are causing frustration and confusion for some borrowers.",
      "In response to a February court ruling that blocked some Biden-era programs, the Education Department has taken down online and paper applications for income-driven repayment plans.",
      "\"This especially hurts anyone who's lost their jobs, including federal workers,\" said Natalia Abrams, founder and president of the Student Debt Crisis Center. \"A few months ago, they would have been able to get on a zero-dollar income-driven repayment plan.\"",
      "The removal of application materials also has caused confusion around the recertification process for borrowers already enrolled in repayment plans, experts say. Income-driven repayment plans take a borrower's finances and family size into account when calculating monthly payments, but borrowers must periodically demonstrate they still qualify.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty are layoffs at the Education Department, which oversees the federal loan system. The federal website for student loans and financial aid, StudentAid.gov, suffered an hours-long outage Wednesday, but the department has said it will continue to deliver on its commitments.",
      "\"It's been wave after wave of bad news for student borrowers,\" said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "Guidance for those with student loans",
      "All borrowers currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans should \"get a sense of when your recertification deadline is and get a sense of what options are available to you if the form is not available online to recertify your income,\" Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "Recertification confirms a borrower's financial situation. With some forms not currently available, borrowers who are unable to complete that process could be in jeopardy.",
      "If borrowers are already on an income-driven repayment plan, they should still be allowed to remain on that repayment plan if they are able to recertify their income.",
      "Abrams said it's also a good idea to take screenshots of your account's current status on the student aid website.",
      "State-specific and state-level resources are available for student borrowers. Congress members have teams charged with helping constituents if they are having trouble with a federal agency or struggling to contact a federal student loan servicer.",
      "Borrowers may contact their representatives in Congress and open a casework file by going onto their website or calling their office.",
      "\"Try saying something like, 'I need your help to understand how to get into an affordable repayment option, which I'm entitled to under the law,'\" Ba\u00f1ez said. \"'Even though this federal department has taken down these applications, I need your help.'\"",
      "Despite the thinning of the Education Department and President Donald Trump's dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, loan servicers still must consider a borrower's financial situation, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "\"You can see if you can get temporary forbearance or a deferment of payments for financial hardship,\" she said.",
      "State attorneys general also take inquiries from student borrowers.",
      "Jessica Fugate, a government relations manager for the city of Los Angeles, said she was less than a year from student loan forgiveness under the Biden-era Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives outstanding loans after 120 payments.",
      "With an ongoing court challenge to her former SAVE payment plan, though, Fugate hoped to switch to an income-driven plan before Trump took office. She applied in January.",
      "\"It's the most affordable option to repay my loans while living in Los Angeles working for the government on a government salary,\" said Fugate, 42. \"And it would mean my payments counted towards forgiveness.\"",
      "In February, Fugate received confirmation that her application was received and had been notified of its status, but they didn't say when she would know if she was approved.",
      "\"And when I called recently, the machine said there was a four hour wait,\" she said.",
      "With income-driven repayment plans in limbo, Fugate isn't sure what her options are and hopes to one day have her federal loans behind her.",
      "\"I've been working for government for almost 10 years. After that much time, you don't do it for the glory,\" she said. \"I've spent most of my career giving back to other people. I don't mind serving people. I just feel this was an agreement they made with the public, and so we're owed that. And it's a lot of us. And we're not just numbers.\"",
      "Debbie Breen, 56, works at an agency on healthy aging in Spokane, Washington. Breen said she has worked in the nonprofit sector for more than 10 years and that nearly all those years counted toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "Breen also was on the Biden-era SAVE plan, which means she was placed in forbearance when the court challenge to that plan was upheld. Like Fugate, she had planned to switch to an income-driven repayment plan to have her payments count towards forgiveness.",
      "\"I was months away from ending this nightmare,\" she said. \"Now I don't think that's going to happen. I'm kind of in panic mode because I know that if they stop income-driven repayment plans, I don't know that I'm going to be able to afford the payments each month.\"",
      "Breen said she has two kids who also have student loans.",
      "\"They're dealing with the same thing,\" she said. \"It's scary. It's absolutely scary.\"",

      "Guinness, the Irish beer that has been around since before the American Revolution, is celebrating a renaissance with rapidly rising popularity in the United States.",
      "\"People are finding this beer for the first time, or, in some cases, rediscovering it,\" said Ryan Wagner, Guinness National Ambassador. \"You're not just finding it in Irish pubs. Now it's in sports bars, at the beach, in coolers being taken to tailgates.\"",
      "Part of this resurgence is attributed to social media, where the viral \"Splitting the G\" challenge has celebrities like Ed Sheeran and Niall Horan attempting to take one or two gulps and land the beer line precisely in the gap of the letter \"G\" in the logo.",
      "For newcomers concerned about Guinness' dark appearance, Wagner offered reassurance.",
      "\"The first thing we would tell someone is don't let the color scare you away. It's light in body. It's a little roasty, a little toasty, incredibly drinkable, and something that's built around occasions, bringing people together.\"",
      "The legacy of Guinness",
      "The brewing legacy dates back to 1759 in Dublin. Today, 3.5 million pints are produced daily and shipped worldwide. Devoted fans insist the beer requires a specific \"perfect pour\" technique \u2014 a two-part process that affects both taste and texture.",
      "This meticulous pouring process has spawned dedicated enthusiasts like the trio behind New York State of Pint, who anonymously rate New York City's best pints of Guinness using a scoring system that evaluates taste, pour quality, glassware, temperature and bar ambiance.",
      "\"We're not looking for favorable treatment,\" said one of the anonymous raters. \"We really just want to rate the Guinness and spread the word about good Guinness in the city.\"",
      "As Wagner sees it, the future for Guinness remains bright.",
      "\"More than ever before, we value our time together. And the more that we find excuses to bring people together, whether that's a massive sporting event or just a couple of buddies sitting at the bar, Guinness draught stout is always going to be a part of those conversations.\"",

      "\"I think it's a lot of uncertainty at the moment,\" Martin said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday. \"Overall, tariffs are damaging to trade, damaging to businesses, but also damaging to consumers, because they will lead to an increase in prices for consumers. I don't think that's good, either way. So, we would hope that in the fullness of time that these things will settle down and that there would be negotiation, trade negotiations, to arrive at a landing zone that people can cope with and can accommodate.\"",

    "summary": "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices nationwide this summer under a frenetic and error-prone push by DOGE to scrap leases it says waste money.",
    "story": [
      "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer under a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk's budget-cutting advisers to terminate leases that they say waste money.",
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk heads, maintains a list of canceled real estate leases on its website, but internal documents obtained by The Associated Press contain a crucial detail: when those cancellations are expected to take effect. The documents from inside the General Services Administration, the U.S. government's real estate manager, list dozens of federal office and building leases expected to end by June 30, with hundreds more slated over the coming months.",
      "The rapid pace of cancellations has raised alarms, with some agencies and lawmakers appealing to DOGE to exempt specific buildings. Several agencies are facing 20 or more lease cancellations in all, including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Many of the terminations would affect agencies that aren't as well-known but oversee services critical to many Americans.",
      "They span from a Boise, Idaho, office of the Bureau of Reclamation - which oversees water supply and deals with disputes across the often-parched American West, to a Joliet, Illinois, outpost of the Railroad Retirement Board, which provides benefits for railroad workers and their survivors.",
      "The lease terminations don't mean all the locations will close. In some cases, agencies may negotiate new leases to stay in place, downsize their existing space or relocate elsewhere.",
      "\"Some agencies are saying: 'I'm not leaving. We can't leave,'\" said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official who now represents building owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions. \"I think there's going to be a period of pushback, a period of disbelief. And then, if necessary, they may start working on the actual execution of a move.\"",
      "DOGE says GSA has notified landlords in recent weeks that it plans to terminate 793 leases, focusing mostly on those that can be ended within months without penalty. The group estimates those moves will save roughly $500 million over the terms of the leases, which in some cases were slated to continue into the 2030s. The Bureau of Reclamation cancellation in Boise, for instance, would take effect Aug. 31 and is expected to save a total of $18.7 million through 2035.",
      "But DOGE's savings estimates - a fraction of Musk's $1 trillion cost-cutting goal - haven't been verified and don't take into account the costs of moves and closures. The group hasn't released any information about what they would mean for agencies.",
      "\"My initial reaction is this is just going to cause more chaos,\" said Jim Simpson, an accountant in Arizona who helps low-income people file taxes and serves on an IRS panel that advocates for taxpayers. \"There's a lot of room to help with government efficiency, but it should be done surgically and not with a chainsaw.\"",
      "Simpson said he was surprised to learn that dozens of IRS offices, including local taxpayer assistance centers, were facing upcoming lease cancellations. He refers clients there to get paperwork to file returns and answer IRS inquiries, and he said losing services would \"cause a lot of anxiety\" and delay refunds.",
      "DOGE scrapping some lease cancelations due to mistakes",
      "Plans to cancel the leases at several of the IRS centers and other sites were in error and have been rescinded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the changes who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid retaliation. Those changes aren't reflected yet on DOGE's list, which only removed one and added dozens more in its latest update published Thursday.",
      "The GSA walked back the cancellation of a Geological Survey office in Anchorage, Alaska, for instance, after learning it didn't have termination rights, according to the person familiar with the matter.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Monday that he'd convinced DOGE to back off lease terminations planned for the National Weather Center in Norman, a Social Security office in Lawton and the Indian Health Services office in Oklahoma City. But all three leases remained on DOGE's list of cancellations as of Thursday.",
      "GSA's press office didn't respond to inquiries.",
      "DOGE push took many by surprise",
      "While there was already a bipartisan push to reduce the government's real estate footprint, the mass cancellations blindsided an industry known for its stability.",
      "Landlords who'd been expecting government agencies to remain tenants \u2014 for several more years in some cases under their existing leases \u2014 were stunned. Some agencies learned from building managers, not their federal partners, that their leases were being canceled, according to real estate managers.",
      "Some cancelations could incur extra costs",
      "Becker, whose firm is tracking the DOGE lease cancellations, and other observers said they expect some agencies will be unable to move their personnel and property out of their spaces within such tight timelines. That may force some agencies to pay additional rent during what's known as a holdover period, undermining DOGE's stated goal of saving taxpayer money.",
      "The Building Owners and Managers Association, which represents the commercial real estate industry, told landlords in a recent advocacy alert to be prepared to seek payment from any federal government tenants who stay beyond their leases.",
      "Asked about plans for buildings with leases that will soon expire, the IRS didn't respond. A Social Security Administration spokesperson downplayed the impact of its offices losing leases, saying many were \"small remote hearing sites,\" didn't serve the public, were already being consolidated elsewhere or planned for closure.",
      "Several other agencies provided little clarity - saying they were working with GSA to consider their options, in statements that were nearly identical in some cases.",
      "But a spokesperson for the Railroad Retirement Board expressed concern over the upcoming lease cancellations of its offices in Joliet, Illinois, and eight other states, saying it was working to \"maintain a public-facing office presence for the local railroad community.\"",
      "Trimming federal real estate was already underway",
      "Government Accountability Office official David Marroni told a congressional hearing last week that the push to unload unnecessary federal real estate was \"long overdue,\" saying agencies have for too long held onto unnecessary space. But he warned the downsizing must be deliberate and carefully planned to \"generate substantial savings and mitigate the risk of mistakes and unexpected mission impacts.\"",
      "That process had already started before Musk's team arrived, with the federal government's real estate portfolio steadily declining over the last decade. Indeed, critics of DOGE say if it were truly interested in cost-cutting it could learn from GSA, whose mission even before Mr. Trump took office was to deliver \"effective and efficient\" services to the American public.",
      "A law signed by former President Joe Biden before he left office in January directed agencies to measure the true occupancy rates of leased spaces by this summer. Those that didn't meet a target of 60% use rate over time would be directed to dispose of their excess space.",
      "\"There is a logical and orderly way to do this,\" Rep. Greg Stanton, an Arizona Democrat, said at last week's hearing. Instead, he said, DOGE is pursuing a reckless approach that threatens to harm the delivery of public services.",
      "Industry observers cautioned that each situation is different and it will take months or years to understand the full impact of the lease cancellations.",
      "\"It really depends on the terms. But it is a shock, there is no question, that all of a sudden, boom, in six weeks all these things have happened,\" said J. Reid Cummings, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of South Alabama. \"It's like a blitzkrieg.\""

Led by billionaire Elon Musk, DOGE has\u00a0abruptly terminated thousands of federal workers\u00a0over the last three weeks, causing turmoil across multiple departments.",
      "The deadline for SSA workers to accept the \"voluntary separation incentive payments\"\u00a0is Friday, March 14. Those who opt in must leave the agency by April 19.",

      "\"Everybody who can is going to take that early out, but I think that 7,000 number is conservative,\" O'Malley said Thursday at a panel discussion on recent changes at the agency and how they could affect customer service, held by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization.",
      "\"They are all going to take it,\" he said, adding that employees who choose to stay, will risk losing their jobs without a bonus.",

      "The amount of the SSA incentive payments being offered individual workers depends on the employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. The highest-tier worker would receive a maximum of $25,000.",

      "Since returning to office, the president has threatened tariffs, and imposed the levies, on a host of major U.S. trading partners. On Wednesday, he increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting retaliatory action from the EU.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday that the countermeasures from the EU are worth 26 billion euros, or $28 billion. The tariffs, set to take effect April 1, target a range of U.S. exports, including beef, poultry, bourbon, jeans and peanut butter.",
      "\"We deeply regret this measure,\" von der Leyen said. \"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy. Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up.\"",
      "The U.S. exported $1.2 billion in wine and related products in 2024, including more than $167 million to the EU, according to the Department of Agriculture. It is the top importer of wine, bringing in nearly $4.9 billion worth in 2023. France and Italy were the top partners for importing both wine and Champagne into the U.S.",
      "Champagne is a sparkling wine from the Champagne region in northeast France. If it is made outside of that region, it is called sparkling wine.",

      "\"Reimposing these debilitating tariffs at a time when the spirits industry continues to face a slowdown in U.S. marketplace will further curtail growth and negatively impact distillers and farmers in states across the country,\" Swonger said in a statement. \"We urge the U.S. and EU governments to come to a resolution that gets our spirits industry back to zero-for-zero tariffs.\"",
      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "Lutnick added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "The president's trade war escalated this month with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tax on goods imported from China, taking effect last week. Beijing imposed retaliatory measures that went into force Monday that target U.S. farmers with levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "The president, however, swiftly reversed course on the levies on imports from Mexico and Canada, pausing the tariffs covered under a 2020 trade deal negotiated during his first administration until April 2. That agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, covers the majority of goods imported from Mexico. Those that are not subject to the deal, however, still face tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also exempted other products from his planned tariffs, including providing a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers that were bracing to be hit hard\u00a0by the levies on vehicle parts and components imported from Canada, Mexico and China.",

    "summary": "President Trump has imposed steep tariffs on Canadian goods, citing trade imbalances and drug trafficking. But many of his claims exaggerate or misrepresent the facts.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims about Canada in the past week as he imposed new tariff hikes on the country and touted his plans for more.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, significantly impacting Canada, the largest foreign supplier of these metals to the U.S. An additional 25% tariff on most Canadian goods is set to go into effect on April 2.",
      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",
      "In fact, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Canada in 2024 was closer to $35.7 billion, according to the latest trade data released from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 6.\u00a0 That trade deficit narrowed from $40.6 billion in 2023.",
      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that large amounts of fentanyl come from Canada",
      "President Trump said in his address to Congress\u00a0March 4: \"Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has cited Canada's failure to halt the flow of illicit drugs as a reason for imposing tariffs, saying that fentanyl has been coming from the country \"at levels never seen before.\" He claimed, \"The fentanyl coming through Canada is massive.\"",
      "However, Mr. Trump overstates the amount of fentanyl coming across the northern border. In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year. By contrast, approximately 21,100 pounds \u2014 about 96.6% of the total \u2014 was seized at the southern border.",

    "summary": "The USDA said it is promoting wiser government spending, but schools say it will make it tougher to serve healthy meals.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",
      "\"USDA can confirm it has provided notice to States, Territories and Tribes that the FY 2025 funding previously announced for the pandemic-era Local Food for Schools and Child Care Cooperative Agreement and pandemic-era Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement program is no longer available and those agreements will be terminated following 60-day notification,\" a spokesperson with the\u00a0agency said in an email to CBS News.",
      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.",
      "\"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit\"",
      "One of those school districts said the USDA's decision will wipe out $100,000 in funding that it had planned to spend on local beef and produce for students' school meals.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables,\" said Patti Bilbrey, director of nutrition services at the Scottsdale Unified School District in Arizona. \"It wasn't just about keeping food costs low \u2014 it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state.\"",
      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",
      "The Local Food for Schools program \"was a godsend to us,\" Bilbrey said. \"It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals.\"",
      "One farmer in Massachusetts told CBS News Boston that she was concerned the funding cut could hurt her business. Katie Carlson, president of Carlson Orchards in Harvard, Massachusetts, said the Worcester Regional Food Hub, which connects school districts with food from local farmers through the USDA program, had been a reliable customer.",
      "\"We know that this time of year we can count on the Worcester Food Hub,\" Carlson said. \"They may not be huge orders every week, but we know that they're coming to take something every week, so if that were to all of a sudden drop off [...] It's just not, not good.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Trade Commission asked a federal judge on Wednesday to delay a trial in a case accusing Amazon of using deceptive practices in its Prime subscription program, citing staffing and budgetary challenges at the government agency.",
      "Jonathan Cohen, a lawyer for the FTC, made the request before U.S. District Judge John Chun, who is overseeing the legal proceedings from a 2023 lawsuit the commission filed against the e-commerce giant in Washington state.",
      "\"Our resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment,\" Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday. \"We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team.\"",
      "When the judge asked if the agency's challenges were due to recent cuts in the federal government, Cohen said it was, adding that some employees chose to leave the FTC following the \"Fork in the road\" email sent by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in January. Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \"move the trial back more than a couple of months,\" Cohen said.",
      "Currently, the agency's legal team is \"racing at considerable cost\" to meet a late April deadline for discovery while at the same time dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel, Cohen explained.",
      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move into \"an abandoned USAID facility,\" Cohen said.",
      "Chun, the judge, asked how \"things are going to be different in two months\" with the issues the agency is experiencing.",

      "During the hearing, John Hueston, an attorney representing Amazon, pushed back on the agency's request. He said most of the FTC attorneys assigned to the Amazon case were still employed by the agency.",
      "Even in the case of staff turnover, the government still lacks the grounds to seek a delay since changes in legal teams happen often, Hueston argued. Amazon executives and trial lawyers already cleared their schedules for a September trial, and the company has wanted to clear its name for more than two years, he said.",

Attorneys for that case, which is scheduled to go to trial in October 2026, presented economic arguments in court last week.",
      "Like other tech companies, Amazon has been attempting to forge friendlier ties with President Donald Trump, who repeatedly criticized the company during his first term.",

      "By the numbers",
      "The Consumer Price Index was forecast to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "February's data comes after inflation accelerated in January, when it rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The report shows \"further signs of progress on underlying inflation, with the pace of price increases moderating after January's strong release,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Despite the lower-than-expected inflation, the Federal Reserve is still likely to hold off on cutting rates at its March 19 meeting, Haigh noted. \"[The] combination of easing inflationary pressures and rising downside risks to growth suggest that the Fed is moving closer to continuing its easing cycle,\" Haigh said.",
      "Grocery prices are continuing to rise, with groceries increasing 2.6% in February from a year earlier, the CPI report said. The ongoing rise of food costs is creating a financial pinch for many households, economists note.",
      "Egg prices were a driver of last month's grocery inflation, with the cost of eggs jumping 58.8% from a year earlier, the report said. Coffee rose 6% on an annual basis, while restaurant meals jumped 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Food inflation has been \"gradually accelerating since mid-2024, reaching almost 5% on a 3-month annualized basis\" in January, according to Morgan Stanley economists in a March 6 research note.",
      "Other items that saw price hikes in February include car insurance, which rose 11.1% on an annual basis, and medical care, which rose 3% from a year ago. Meanwhile, President Trump's tariff barrage has the potential to boost prices for many products, from food imports to automobiles, adding to an uncertain outlook for inflation, economists say.",
      "\"Good news on inflation, but good news pre-tariffs,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Unfortunately, three main pain points for consumer budgets \u2014 shelter, medical care and car insurance \u2014 had substantial increases.\"",
      "What it means for your money",
      "Even though the inflation data came in lighter than expected, price increases are still pacing well above the Fed's 2% annual goal. Because of that, economists say it's unlikely the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next week.",
      "That means consumers and businesses will continue to face higher borrowing costs for longer, while still grappling with elevated price hikes, economists say.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve will remain firmly planted on the sidelines at next week's meeting,\" Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said on Wednesday. \"Inflation readings still need to show sustained progress toward 2%, and the recent economic uncertainty will make them ever more data-dependent in the coming weeks and months.\"",

      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "\"Tariffs and non-tariff barriers tend to disproportionately burden the small and midsize businesses,\" added Panday. \"Profits are likely to be squeezed at the margin. To the extent businesses can pass on the rising cost, consumers would also eventually see their prices increase. Overall, pressure on inflation would rise just as markets and consumers are appearing to be sensitive to inflationary expectations.\"",
      "For Brooklyn-based brewery Talea, the tariffs on aluminum, which the company uses for its beer cans, could lead to higher operating costs, co-founder LeAnn Darland recently told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady. Darland said she hopes to share any increased costs with suppliers, because she's not sure consumers will be willing to swallow any price hikes.",
      "Even without the tariffs, said Darland, \"Sometimes we get complaints that our beer is too expensive.\"",

    "summary": "Consumers, businesses and investors are increasingly jittery about the risks of a protracted slump. So what exactly is a recession?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump sparked concerns this week when he declined to rule out the possibility of a U.S. recession this year. Asked on Fox news if he expects such a slump, Mr. Trump said, \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also seemed to leave open the possibility of a downturn, telling CBS News in an interview on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for a business cycle to be considered recessionary. Here's what to know.",
      "What is a recession, and who decides if we're in one?",
      "A recession is generally defined as a broad-based, persistent decline in economic activity. The more popular metric is that a recession is two straight quarters of negative economic growth, although in fact there's more to it than.",
      "Recessions are identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a non-profit, nonpartisan research group that dates U.S. business cycles. To determine if the economy has entered a recession, NBER evaluates six key indicators: real personal income; non-farm payroll employment; employment as measured by the household survey; personal consumption; manufacturing and trade sales; and industrial production.",
      "More specifically, NBER looks at the depth of the changes in these indicators, how broadly a slump is affecting different industries and how long a downturn lasts. The upshot: In a recession, the decline in economic activity must be significant, sustained and widespread, rather than limited to a particular sector.",
      "Could the U.S. tumble into a recession anytime soon?",
      "For now, economic data suggest that's unlikely. Although layoffs around the country are rising, the U.S. labor market continues to create jobs at a decent clip. Despite economic growth slowing, it's not expected to fall off a cliff. In fact, Julia Pollack, chief economist at career site ZipRecruiter, notes that four of the six signals tracked by the NBER point to continued economic expansion.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Still, cracks are appearing that could portend a sharper downturn down the road. Retail spending, which is the lifeblood of the economy, is\u00a0waning, while measures of consumer confidence show a\u00a0sharp deterioration of late. Investor concerns about the Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on other nations has also slammed stock prices, which could further pressure spending.",
      "\"Negative consumption is concerning because consumer spending is backbone of U.S. economy,\" Pollack said. \"And it's not just that spending fell. Sentiment has fallen, household budgets are squeezed and consumers are more vulnerable to shocks, which has heightened recession fears.\"",
      "Sweet added, \"Right now, your traditional causes of a recession aren't flashing red, but we just have this suffocating effect of all the uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy and immigration.\"",
      "Lutnick, the Commerce Department chief, defends Mr. Trump's economic policies, saying they will boost economic activity.",
      "\"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here,\" he told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "What signals would point to a recession?",
      "The clearest sign would be a steady increase in job losses and a jump unemployment. In a recession, consumers pare spending and businesses pull back on investment. That typically leads to a slowdown in hiring and rise in layoffs.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate did tick up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, though that is still quite low. But employers added 151,000 jobs, a sign that businesses are still seeking to hire workers and enough payroll gains to keep unemployment in check.",
      "Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, a gauge that indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly jobless claims\u00a0remain low.",
      "Who is most vulnerable in a recession?",
      "Most Americans would feel the impact of a recession in one way or another, for weaker hiring to tepid wage gains. Among people who are employed, those who entered the labor market last tend to be the first to lose their job in a recession, noted Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, a left-leaning economic think tank.",
      "\"So you see the people who are hardest to reach as we reach full employment are the first to get laid off. That includes lower wage workers, black workers, Latino workers. Those who have the hardest time getting a job when times are good are first to lose jobs when times are bad,\" he said.",
      "Americans who carry debt on their homes and can't make minimum payments also can face foreclosure in a downturn, locking a generation out of building household wealth.",
      "\"That's one reason why recessions are so damaging, because it's the least among us that get hurt the most when downturns come,\" Jacquez said.",

But even if they end up being milder than feared, all the whipsaw moves could leave U.S. companies and consumers unwilling to invest or spend, and looking to the Fed for a clearer economic outlook.",

      "President Trump officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday, promising they would help create U.S. factory jobs at a time when his seesawing tariff threats are jolting the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown, increased inflation and even a global trade war.",
      "The European Union quickly announced it would retaliate with steps that will take effect April 1.",
      "\"As the U.S. are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros ($28 billion),\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. \"We will always remain open to negotiation. We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.\"",
      "France's European Affairs Minister Benjamin Haddad said the EU could go even further, adding that a trade war was in no-one's interests, the Reuters news agency reports.",
      "The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.",
      "The EU measures will not only cover steel and aluminum products but textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods as well.",
      "British Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said \"all options were on the table\" to respond \"in the national interest,\" according to Reuters.",
      "It also reported that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the Trump move \"entirely unjustified ... and against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship,\" but he ruled out tit-for-tat duties.",
      "\"Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm, and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers,\" Albanese told reporters.",
      "Canada also plans to announce\u00a0nearly $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs in response to the U.S. steel and aluminum levies, a senior Canadian government official said Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak before the announcement.",
      "Mr. Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals, in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%.His moves, based off a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce.",
      "The president has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging \"reciprocal\" rates starting on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable Tuesday that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Mr. Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.",
      "\"The higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build,\" Mr. Trump told the group. \"The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That's a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but reversed course and\u00a0chose to stay with the 25% rate after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Trump tariffs history",
      "In many ways, the president is now addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Mr. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Mr. Trump's 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum were eroded by exemptions. After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn't find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Mr. Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the U.S., they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials. Economists also say the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \"downstream'' manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase in their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",
      "\"If you're an executive in the boardroom, are you really going to tell your board it's the time to expand that assembly line?\" remarked John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",

Economists now predict that inflation could tick upwards in 2025 due to Mr. Trump's tariff regime, which means the latest inflation data could prove to be the calm before the storm.",

      "Egg prices",
      "Egg prices were one of the main inflation drivers in January, with the cost jumping 53% from a year earlier. Overall grocery prices rose 1.9% over the same period, with declines in some foods, such as bread and tomatoes, offsetting the surge in egg prices.",
      "Since then, egg prices have receded, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. In a March 11 Fox Business interview, Rollins said egg Prices have declined to an average of $1.85 per dozen, which she credited to the Trump administration's five-point plan to battle the bird flu. A dozen eggs cost about $5 in January, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",

Households are now predicting that food costs could accelerate to an annual rate of 5.1%, the highest level since May 2024, it found.",

More Americans say they're gloomy about their financial prospects for the year ahead, the New York Fed found in its survey.",

      "Aging 401(k)s are a little like the old clothes in the back of your closet. You know you should do something about them, but there they sit, mostly out of sight and mind.",
      "And so it is with your old 401(k). If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list for a while, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
      "Step 1: See how much you have saved",
      "If your balance in your former employer's 401(k) plan is over $7,000, you can leave the money behind in the old plan or roll the assets into an IRA or your new employer's 401(k).",
      "But if your balance falls below that $7,000 threshold, some of the decision-making may be out of your hands.",
      "Step 2: Decide whether to roll the money or leave it alone",
      "Assuming your balance is over $7,000, your next task is to decide whether to roll the money into an IRA or keep it inside a 401(k).",
      "I often recommend rolling over the assets from a former 401(k) into a no-fee IRA with a topnotch mutual fund company or discount broker. But some people value the extra creditor protections that can accompany 401(k) assets versus IRA assets, while others may prize 401(k)-specific investment options.",
      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you're better off staying put in your former employer's plan or that of your new employer.",
      "Step 3: If rolling over into an IRA, find the right options",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer's 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won't owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "Step 4: Fill out the necessary paperwork",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You'll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you're rolling over to your current employer's 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You'll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you'll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not 55 or older.",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you'll also have to determine how you'll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to the chairman of the Budget Committee, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who joins us this morning from Clemson, South Carolina. Welcome back.",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Near miss with the government shutdown, sir, and I- I thought we'd be talking about a lot of domestic policy, but President Trump's point of view seems to be overseas in these- in this past week, certainly a lot of action. I looked through the last time we spoke, you were advocating for President Trump to bomb Iran. You said there's \"a one in a trillion chance you'll degrade the Iranian nuclear program through diplomacy.\" Since then, President Trump has offered negotiations. Are you softening your stance?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I don't mind negotiating long as we get the outcome that we all desire. They can't have a nuclear bomb. So I think there is a one in a trillion chance the Ayatollah would ever genuinely give up his quest for a nuclear weapon. He wants a nuclear weapon to use it. He wants to destroy Israel, kill all the Jews. He's a religious Nazi. He wants to purify Islam and drive us out of the region. Yeah, I think he- I think he's a fanatical religious Nazi who would use a bomb. But let's talk to him, and if he really is sincere, give up enrichment. There are 40 countries in this world that have nuclear power but don't enrich. There's no commercial purpose for enriching uranium at 60%. He has enough to make six bombs at 60% so turn that all over the international community. We'll pay for it. Get out of the enrichment business, and we'll help you with the nuclear power program. If you'll do all those things, then I will have been proven wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a long- that's a long to do list. And so far, no- no indication that he's taking the offer--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: -- Not really- if you don't want to bomb, give up enrichment. You don't need enrichment for nuclear power. You do need enrichment to make a bomb. It's not that hard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. We did see additional Russian strikes in Ukraine overnight. You have been an advocate for Ukraine. Do- you heard the Secretary of State. You heard Ambassador Witkoff. Is Putin playing for time? Is he playing President Trump?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I don't know yet, but I do know you played President Trump at your own peril. What Trump did to get Ukraine at the table was tough, and it worked. So if Putin is sincere about wanting peace, accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine and quit trying to mix the two: ceasefire and peace deal. What I would advise the Trump administration to do is to tell Putin, are you going to accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine, or not? If you're not, go back to maximum pressure. I have legislation that will overwhelmingly pass the United States Senate that will crush the Russian economy, and I'm willing to move forward if I have to, but we're talking about ceasefire, and we're talking about peace. We weren't talking about that in the last administration. But to me, Putin's a predator. The best way to judge Putin is not in a three hour meeting, but 30 years of action, and I see no indication that he's going to stop being a predator against Ukraine until the pain is too large\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Do you have--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: So if he refuses the ceasefire, that tells me all I need to know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any reason to believe that President Trump would sign the legislation you say you can use to put more sanctions on Russia? Because he hasn't put more sanctions on Russia in a significant way at all.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I think he's waiting to see what kind of response he gives from the discussions that Witkoff have, who- I like Steve and I'm glad he's doing what he's doing. I think Trump's going to talk to Putin this week. You can't solve a problem until you talk the- to the person who's creating the problem. And the problem is Putin. He's a predator toward Ukraine and the region at large. I hope President Trump can convince Putin to go to the peace table, to engage in a ceasefire and to find a win, win solution for both countries to stop the killing. You'll never know until you try. And there's one person on the planet capable of doing that, and that is President Trump. If Putin is playing Trump, he will regret it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Vladimir Putin benefits from the US decision to try to shutter some of the advocates for the free press and agents of the free press, like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America? As you know, there was an executive order to try to dismantle them.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. Yeah- I don't know what value these- these ideas have in the 21st century. At the end of the day, I'll look and evaluate where the Voice of America really is. Radio Free Europe, I know it made a difference in the Cold War, people told us that. So, that's something to consider. Is it still worth the price? But I like the idea of putting bad guys on their back foot and giving people hope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah you had been an advocate for soft power, I want to ask you about what's happening here at home. There were more executive orders from the president this week targeting some of the country's most prominent law firms, including Paul Weiss. He wants to restrict business activities of the firm, despite a federal judge ruling in a different case that it's unconstitutional. The President suspended security clearances at the firm. He stripped clearances from lawyers over at Covington & Burling as well because they were involved in representing former Special Counsel Jack Smith. Do you support this?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I think all of these things- I think Jack Smith was politically motivated. I think the Russian hoax, a lot of people should have gone to jail, and they didn't. I think the idea that President Trump was an agent of Russia was manufactured. The Steele Dossier was based on lies and falsehoods coming from a source that said he never meant it to be used in the fashion it was used. I think Jack Smith's effort to prosecute President Trump for January 6 was politically motivated, and people who engage in trying to destroy President Trump, I don't mind him going after them in a lawful way. I don't mind restrict--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this lawful?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: You know when Biden took- took- yeah I think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this good for the US legal system, Senator? Because the President is trying to use government power to punish private business because he didn't like some of the work they had been doing.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Private business aided government power in a fashion to destroy Donald Trump's life. You know- on our side, nobody in your world gets it, but our people believe that the Justice Department was used as a weapon to destroy Trump's campaign and his business interests and to ruin his family- that they made up bogus charges and they proceeded in a fashion that was designed to destroy him, politically and personally. I believe that. If these people involved pay a price, they got nobody but themselves to blame, that's what I believe--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But these are lawyers working on cases that- you're making it sound like the work that they take on is somehow part of a conspiracy, and they should be punished for it.",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah, I think- I think these law firms were pushing legal theories that, to me, were designed for political outcomes more than legal outcomes. You know, we can have a debate about- you know, holding a lawyer accountable for his client's actions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: I generally don't like that, but these- but these laws firms--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what this sounds like--",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: --and Jack Smith using the power of government- incorporating these law firms in my- in my view, were trying to disrupt and take down the Republican nominee for president. That this was an orchestrated effort, and Biden only regretted they didn't do it sooner. So it was politically motivated, and everybody with their fingerprints on it, I hope they pay a price.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I know- since you're on the Judiciary Committee--",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: And my answer's not going to change--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and have that oversight- important to get your point of view, but I got to leave it there for today. We'll be right back.",

      "SPECIAL ENVOY TO THE MIDDLE EAST STEVE WITKOFF: Thank you. Thank you, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you just heard Secretary of State Rubio talk about these efforts to broker a ceasefire. You were the man face-to-face with Vladimir Putin. I wonder what your answer to the question is, in regard to whether this is a delay tactic or whether Vladimir Putin is sincere in seeking a ceasefire?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I was there for quite some time, Margaret, and I agree with the Secretary's assessment. We made a lot of progress in that meeting. It was a meeting that was- it could have been as long as four hours, but it was certainly at least three. We talked about a lot of specifics, and I point to the large gap that existed between Ukraine and Russia prior to the inauguration, and where we are today. We have narrowed the issues between both of these parties, making a lot of progress, in my opinion, and I think that meeting underscores that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I heard you say on another program this morning that you do expect presidents Trump and Putin to speak this week. Is that a decision making call, or is this just next steps?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I would- I would assume that, you know, they have- they have a real- they have a real relationship from the president's first term. They've talked already, after the first visit that- that I had with President Putin. And I think this is going to be a very positive and constructive call between the two men, between the two presidents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And decisions will be made on whether to move forward with this 30-day ceasefire that the U.S. and Ukraine have agreed to, but Russia, at least publicly, has not?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, President Trump is the ultimate decision maker, our decision maker. And President Putin, for the country of Russia, is their decision maker. I think it's a very positive sign that the two of them will be talking at some point. I think that's- that's showing that there's positive momentum, that there's a- an inclination on- on the part of both countries, and by the way, this includes Ukraine as well, to get to a long term, durable peace here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, France's President publicly said yesterday that, in his country's view, Russia is not genuine in seeking peace. They're intensifying the fighting. We saw Vladimir Putin on television this week dressed in military fatigues. He made public comments about wanting to resolve root causes of the war. How different was his message in private?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I- look, I don't- I don't know what President Macron said. I think it's unfortunate when people make those sort of assessments, and they don't have, necessarily, firsthand knowledge. But I'm not going to comment on what he said, because I don't know what he said. I know what I heard, the body language I witnessed. I saw a constructive effort over a long period of time to- to discuss the specifics of what's going on in the field. There's a 2,000 kilometer border between these two countries, and they are facing- shooting each other and facing each other across that 2,000 mile border. That's a very, very, complicated ceasefire, and yet everybody is committed to have that discussion. Here we are, in the throes of having that discussion, with the Russians talking about sending technical teams, the United States, sending technical teams, a meeting in Saudi Arabia with our National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, and Secretary of State Rubio that had a lot of positivity attached to it, my meeting, which I- I regard as promising. I think those are all very, very good trends, and hopefully inform on the possibility of a near term peace agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So beyond the ceasefire, a peace agreement, you're already talking about technicalities in terms of territory that would be given up?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I- what I- what I'm saying, the technical- what I'm saying is that a ceasefire involves how to get people to not be fighting with each other over a 2,000 kilometer border. That's- that's 1,200 miles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Nor does that include a main area of confrontation, which is Kursk. And so there's different battlefield conditions. We've got to discuss that. There are regions that we all know the Russians are focused on. There is a nuclear reactor that supplies quite a bit of electricity to- to the country of Ukraine. That's got to be dealt with. There's access to ports. There's the Black Sea potential agreement, there's- there's just- there's so many elements, Margaret, to the implementation of a ceasefire here, and I compare it sometimes to Gaza. Gaza is a finite, defined, space, as compared to the- the battle- where the battle is being fought, in Ukraine, Russia. So this is a much more complicated situation, and yet no one is throwing their hands up in the air. What they are doing is, they are digging in, and everybody is committed, all stakeholders, including the Europeans, to doing everything we need to do to get to a successful resolution here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Gaza. I want to ask you what specifics you are looking at when it comes to relocating the 2 million Palestinians in Gaza. In the past, you've mentioned Egypt, you've mentioned Jordan. Are you talking to other countries at this point about resettling?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: I mean, I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that leads to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things. But right now, what's right in front of us, is coming to some sort of resolution on this conflict. And the recent experience that we had at the Arab Summit, where we spent seven and a half hours with leaders of various Arab countries, the recent experience we had with Hamas' response was not encouraging. Now to me, we put a very sensible proposal on the table that was intended as a bridge to get to a final discussion and final resolution here, that would have incorporated some sort of demilitarization of Hamas, which must happen. That's a red line for the Israelis. And maybe could have led to a long term peace resolution here. And yet Hamas- Hamas came up with their own construct, essentially disavowed what we discussed, and to my mind, that was a pretty poor ending, and I- I hope they reconsider, because the alternative is not so good for them.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0We go now to the Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, who joins us this morning from Annapolis. Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Thank you. Great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have in your state the Port of Baltimore, one of the country's largest ports. The President has put all these tariffs in place, teed them up, and on April 2, is poised to enact 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Do you have any idea when you will see the impact on shipping volume, what the impact on your state's economy will be?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: We're already seeing the impacts of these- of these- of these disastrous and, frankly, not very well thought out policies when it comes to tariffs. You know, tariffs are a tool. They're not an ideology, but this administration is using it like an ideology. And so while the decisions are being made- made not with us, they're being made to us, we're already seeing how this is going to have a significant impact on the Port of Baltimore, which is really one of these country- one of the country's largest and most effective ports. It's the largest port for roll-on, roll-off vehicles. It is also seeing how the tariff policies are having disastrous impacts on our farmers over in the Eastern Shore and our chicken farmers in the eastern shore. This lack of predictability, this erratic behavior and this- and the indecisive decision making that's being made is already having very real impact on costs, it's having a very real impact on our businesses and our small businesses, it's having a very real impact on our economic engines and American competitiveness, as well as our national security, and so these are the type of things- this erratic behavior is the things that people were concerned about, and we are now seeing in real time in our states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state was one of 20 that decided to legally challenge the Trump administration on the decision to dismiss 1300 workers at the Education Department. I'm wondering, as you sit there, how do you choose which issues to fight legally? And is litigation the Democrats' only tool here?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Well, it's not. I mean, when you look at the- at the flurry of executive actions and executive orders that have been laid out by this administration thus far, they really fall into three different categories. It's either ineffective, it is performative or it is illegal, right? Those are the three buckets that all these executive actions are falling under. And the ones that are illegal, we are going to take legal action to make sure that there are legal consequences for making these decisions that, frankly, the President of the United States does not have the authority to make unilaterally. And so when we talk about the different tools that we have- just in this past week alone, you know, I signed- I signed executive action, executive orders focusing on supporting law enforcement and our police officers and our firefighters and giving them pay raises. Because on the federal side, we've seen continued attacks on our public servants and our law enforcement and the cutting of first responders like FEMA. That just this past week, I have focused on things like lowering prescription drugs costs and actually creating partnerships with the private sector to lower prescription drug costs, that we're working on legislation right now to increase housing inventory that can bring housing prices down, and that is all in- that is all contrary to what we're seeing from the federal government. So the legal tool in working with our Attorney General closely to be able to file suit when the federal government oversteps his bounds is one tool, but we are going to use every tool at our disposal to make sure that the people of Maryland are protected, and we're making sure we're putting extra resources and money back into their pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0On Friday, President Trump went to the Justice Department, and while he was there, he said that the FBI headquarters will no longer be moved from Washington, DC out to the state of Maryland. He called Maryland a \"liberal state,\" and he said he's going to stop it. I know your office thought this was going to bring in 7,500 new jobs. Have you reached out to the White House to try to persuade them not to take it away?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: \u00a0Here's- here's the ironic thing about it is, I found out about that announcement from the president via the news. That goes to show the level of partnership that this administration is- is that they- that they have and they would like from our nation's governors and from our nation's chief executives and so- so the thing that we know about this this is a direct attack and a direct assault on law enforcement, a direct attack on the FBI, because Maryland is the place and we've gone- we went through this process, not just for these past couple years, since I've been the governor, but for the past decade, where Maryland- where Maryland won this- this element, this competition, fair and square, quantitatively, where we showed that we could be the place that it was the only site-ready place to build, build-ready site. That we're the place that we could actually have national security assets that they could leverage, particularly when you're talking about the future mission of the FBI, which a lot of it is cyber. That we were the only place that had transportation assets that were close and nearby, that the workers could be able to benefit from. And the place that could get it done cheapest to the American taxpayer by talking about putting it anywhere else, you're talking about adding over a billion dollars in costs to the American taxpayer than what we have already gone through this process with the GSA, the General Service Administration for the state of Maryland. So the building is ready to go in the state of Maryland, but the President has just decided to politicize it by talking about- but he doesn't want it to go to a liberal state. We cannot continue to politicize national security when it is too important to the people who are serving us--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Have you called him? Have you called the White House?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: We tried calling the White House before, and there's- there's- there's no response. And frankly, it just highlights the fact that, again, I found out about this announcement via news break\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe it?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: I did not find out about this announcement from the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe it?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: The announcement?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: \u00a0Well, I believe that the President thinks he has the authority to do this, but I also think that that falls into line of a collection of other things that the President does not have the authority to do. Congress is the one who actually allocates the capital towards where federal agencies are going to go. It's the GSA that made the decision that the new FBI building should be going to the state of Maryland, after going through a thorough and a very transparent process. And so I believe the President of the United States thinks that he can do this. But there's one thing that I know, and I say this on a Sunday morning, I know there is a King of Kings and a Lord of Lords, and I know he does not live in the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0I want to ask you about a speech you gave last night. You represented your party at the Gridiron Dinner, an annual gathering of journalists here, and you dedicated your remarks to federal workers. You said there was dignity in the work that they do. You also spoke about your party, though, and the struggles that it is having. You said Democrats used to be the cool ones. You joked about the advanced age of your party's leaders, saying their staff has to stand around with defibrillators. I know these are jokes, but- but you're acknowledging something here. Is the issue with your party age? Or a lack of vision? And is the reset underway to fix those things?",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0I think we need to be very clear about who we're fighting for. And I think we need to be very clear about the vision that we are offering. You know, I think about what's happening, you know, in this moment, even the conversation around the continuing resolution where- where we all know that the consequences of a federal government shutdown would have been disastrous on the state of Maryland, that we would have not only seen our economy completely downturn into- into a recession, that we would have seen our nation's credit being downgraded, and along those lines, each and every one of us as states, our credit would have been downgraded as well because The United States decided that it's now no longer paying its bills. And we would have seen thousands of federal workers unfairly now being laid off or furloughed. So we know the consequences. But one thing we did not do was offer an alternative. One thing we did not do was articulate the terms for the American people. And so I think when the American people, when they do not have an option, or they're not seeing people fighting on their behalf, then yes, there is going to be a measurement of frustration. So we've got to do everything in our power. I know in the state of Maryland, we are mobilizing to make sure we're protecting our federal workers, that we're streamlining them into not just private sector jobs, but also state jobs that are open and available. That we're making sure we're increasing our unemployment insurance, and we are doing things like lowering the price of prescription drugs, and we're doing things like increasing housing inventory, which is going to decrease the housing price. We're doing everything in our power to fight for the people, and I think it becomes incredibly important, because people are paying attention who their fighters are and who their fighters are not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0Well, there were voices within your party on Capitol Hill who awful- offered alternatives. They just weren't listened to. Do you think there is just no leader--",
      "GOV. MOORE: I don't see a difference--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --in the party?",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0I don't- I don't see a difference. And frankly, I don't think the American people see a difference. If they are not hearing an alternative, if they're not hearing an alternative plan, if they're not hearing the plan to push back and fight back, if they're not seeing what we are doing in the streets and in the communities and in the neighborhoods to fight for their best interest, I think for the American people, they just look at it as theater. And that is the frustrating thing, the performative politics. People are done, and they are exhausted by it. They just want to see results, and that's exactly what we're trying to provide here in the state of Maryland.",

    "summary": "The Senate on Friday passed a Republican-led stopgap measure to keep the government funded ahead of a midnight deadline.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed a Republican-led stopgap measure to keep the government funded Saturday, averting the threat of a government shutdown following a contentious week in Washington.",
      "The signing came after the Senate passed the bill in a 54 to 46 vote, with one Republican opposing it and two Democrats supporting it after 10 Democrats provided the votes earlier Friday to advance the measure through a key procedural hurdle. Senate Democrats spent days debating the uncomfortable choice of whether to allow the bill to pass or let the\u00a0government shut down.",
      "The vote came after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer initially signaled that his caucus would fight back against the partisan measure to keep the government funded through September. But instead he reluctantly pledged on Thursday to advance it, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel it to passage. He warned of the larger threat a shutdown would pose for the American people.",
      "\"For sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option,\" the New York Democrat said, calling the bill \"deeply partisan\" and urging that \"it doesn't address far too many of this country's needs.\" \"But I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.\"",
      "After his remarks Thursday night, Schumer wouldn't say whether other Democrats would join him in voting to advance the measure, telling reporters that \"each is making his or her own decision.\" But Schumer's support for the continuing resolution gave other Democrats political cover to do the same, diminishing the threat of a shutdown.",
      "Ultimately, Schumer was joined in voting to advance the measure by Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Gary Peters of Michigan, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the sole Republican to oppose advancing the measure and he voted against it on final passage. Shaheen and King voted in favor of final passage.",
      "On Tuesday, the House passed the measure, which increases defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. Republicans have praised additional funding in the measure for programs like nutrition assistance for women, infants and children, while Democrats have railed against cuts to medical research and housing programs \u2014 and more than $1 billion in cuts to D.C.'s local government spending. The Senate also voted to reverse the cuts following the vote to keep the government funded, but the measure still must be taken up by the House.",
      "Just one House Democrat joined the Republican majority in support of the measure. And while the House requires only a simple majority, a 60-vote threshold is required to invoke cloture and advance most measures in the Senate, meaning the support of Democrats was needed to get the measure to ultimately pass.",
      "Still, the party had been split on how to proceed. Democrats widely oppose the House-passed measure and have expressed frustration with the spending reductions, and they warn that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts.",
      "Democrats had been pushing for a 30-day continuing resolution that had little chance of earning enough support for passage. And with the House having already left town, the option would almost certainly have resulted in a funding lapse. But some progressives suggested that the shorter option was more favorable, letting the onus for a government shutdown fall on Republicans, arguing that it would have further illuminated the chaos that has ensued in the federal bureaucracy and beyond under the Trump administration and DOGE.",
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez told reporters Thursday night that Schumer's move to back the continuing resolution \u2014 known as a CR \u2014 was a \"huge slap in the face,\" adding that there is a \"wide sense of betrayal\" among the party.",
      "\"What voting for the CR does is that it codifies the chaos and the reckless cuts that Elon Musk has been pursuing,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"The robbing of our federal government in order to finance tax cuts for billionaires, is what is happening, and that is what Senate Democrats will be empowering if they vote for the CR.\"",
      "Schumer told reporters following his floor remarks that Democrats should keep the attention on their message \u2014 that Republicans are hurting the middle class \u2014 rather than on what the Trump administration could pursue during a shutdown. Schumer said the message is \"beginning to work.\"",
      "The president congratulated Schumer Friday morning for \"doing the right thing,\" saying in a post on Truth Social that it took \"courage.\"",
      "The minority leader first informed Senate Democrats that he planned to vote to advance the GOP funding measure during a closed-door meeting Thursday afternoon, a source familiar told CBS News. As the meeting let out, frustrations appeared high among Senate Democrats, and a number of them \u2014 including many who hail from battleground states \u2014 quickly released statements on social media announcing they would vote \"no\" on the House-passed continuing resolution.",
      "Besides Schumer, only Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, had pledged to support the continuing resolution heading into the day on Friday. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada became the third Democrat to pledge to support the measure to avert a shutdown ahead of the vote.",
      "Democrats continued to rail against their options on Friday morning. Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator who had been engaged in bipartisan talks to fund the government, said the choice between a shutdown and letting the GOP bill pass \"has always been a false choice.\" She accused Republicans of pulling out of bipartisan negotiations and sending \"a deeply partisan bill here to the Senate today.\"",
      "\"Democrats did not have an ounce of input into writing this bill,\" Murray said. \"In my time in Congress, never, ever has one party written partisan full-year appropriations bills for all of government and expected the other party to go along without any input.\"",
      "Murray said the Senate could still pass the short-term funding measure that she introduced earlier this week, saying House Republicans could get on a plane to come back and vote.",
      "Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders returned to the Capitol Friday to express their opposition to the continuing resolution, calling this an \"unprecedented situation and an unprecedented disaster\" for the American people.",
      "\"We've been very clear: we strongly oppose the reckless Republican spending bill,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.",

    "summary": "President Trump's extraordinary order is breathtaking in its scope and has little precedent in U.S. history.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the swift detention and deportation of all Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang, treating them like wartime enemies of the U.S. government.",
      "In his proclamation, the president argued the Venezuelan gang was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" the legal threshold for invoking the 227-year-old war authority.",
      "The president directed the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to \"apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every\" Venezuelan migrant, 14 or older, who is deemed to be part of Tren de Aragua and who lacks U.S. citizenship or permanent residency.",
      "Those subject to the law would be eligible to be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without any of the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, which include opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they would be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws.",
      "But Mr. Trump's directive was dealt an almost immediate blow on Saturday, after a federal judge agreed to block the government from deporting anyone in U.S. immigration custody subject to the president's Alien Enemies Act proclamation.",
      "At the request of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, James Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked those deportations through a 14-day temporary restraining order. Deportation flights in the air with deportees subject to Mr. Trump's decree should return to the U.S., Boasberg indicated during a hearing Saturday evening.",
      "Earlier Saturday, Boasberg issued another order blocking the deportation of five Venezuelan migrants in immigration detention who the ACLU said we were at risk of being expelled under Mr. Trump's directive.",
      "\"We are thrilled the judge recognized the severe harm our plaintiffs would face if removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney leading the lawsuit against Mr. Trump's proclamation. \"The President's use of the Alien Enemies Act is flat out lawless.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement responding to the ruling that, \"Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans. TdA is represented by the ACLU. This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump's power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's extraordinary order is breathtaking in its scope and has little precedent in U.S. history. The law it cites, enacted 22 years after the Declaration of Independence, references invasions and incursions staged by \"any foreign nation or government.\"",
      "The centuries-old statue has been invoked only a few times in American history, including during World War I and World War II, when U.S. officials cited it to surveil and detain foreigners from Italy, Germany and Japan.",
      "But never before has the Aliens Enemies Act been invoked to target migrants from countries with which the U.S. is not actively at war or with the premise that a non-state actor is staging an invasion or incursion of the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in his order argued Tren de Aragua is \"closely aligned\" with the repressive government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "\"(Tren de Aragua) has engaged in and continues to engage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens, undermining public safety, and supporting the Maduro regime's goal of destabilizing democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States,\" Mr. Trump said in his order.",

      "A federal judge on Saturday night temporarily blocked President Trump from removing immigrants under a wartime law known as the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act of 1798\u00a0after the president announced earlier in the day that he would enforce the law.",
      "The judge's ruling was in response to a federal civil lawsuit filed Saturday by a group of five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails against President Trump and other administration officials.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the 227-year-old wartime law earlier Saturday.",
      "The lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., by attorneys with the ACLU and Democracy Forward argues the Alien Enemies Act is \"a wartime measure that has been used only three times in our Nation's history: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\"",
      "Presidents are given the extraordinary power by the\u00a0227-year-old law\u00a0to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the District Court for the U.S. District of Columbia, on Saturday implemented a temporary restraining order preventing their deportations for 14 days. The Justice Department appealed that decision, arguing the D.C. court has no authority over the case because none of the five men are in the district. Four are being held in detention in Texas and one in New York. They further argued that invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is \"speculation.\"",
      "Then, following an emergency hearing Saturday evening, Boasberg expanded his order to include \"all noncitizens in U.S. custody\" who are covered by Mr. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"We are thrilled the judge recognized the severe harm our plaintiffs would face if removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney leading the lawsuit against Mr. Trump's proclamation, following Boasberg's decision. \"The President's use of the Alien Enemies Act is flat out lawless.\"",
      "Boasberg also appeared to indicate that any deportation flights that were currently in the air with migrants subject to this order on board should be returned to the U.S.",
      "The lawsuit states that Mr. Trump is \"expected to authorize immediate removal of noncitizens that the Proclamation deems to be alien enemies, without any opportunity for judicial review.\"",
      "\"It also contorts the plain language of the Act: arrivals of noncitizens from Venezuela are deemed an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' by a 'foreign nation or government,' where Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, is deemed to be sufficiently akin to a foreign nation or government,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "As such, the government can identify any Venezuelan in the U.S. as a member of that gang, regardless of facts, and seek to deport them, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement responding to the ruling that, \"Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans. TdA is represented by the ACLU. This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump's power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk.\"",
      "The lawsuit further argued that the Alien Enemies Act \"has only ever been a power invoked in time of war, and plainly only applies to warlike actions: it cannot be used here against nationals of a country \u2014 Venezuela \u2014 with whom the United States is not at war, which is not invading the United States, and which has not launched a predatory incursion into the United States.\"",

      "Hussein referred to an operations room formed by Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon at a recent meeting in Amman to confront IS, and said it would soon begin work.",
      "The relationship between Iraq and Syria is somewhat fraught after the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Al-Sudani came to power with the support of a coalition of Iran-backed factions, and Tehran was a major backer of Assad. The current interim president of Syria, Ahmad al-Sharaa, was previously known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani and fought as an al-Qaida militant in Iraq after the U.S. invasion of 2003, and later fought against Assad's government in Syria.",
      "But Syrian interim Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani focused on the historic ties between the two countries.",

      "The operation and the visit come at a time when Iraqi officials are anxious about an Islamic State resurgence in the wake of the fall of Assad in Syria.",
      "While Syria's new rulers \u2014 led by the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 have pursued Islamic State cells since taking power, some fear a breakdown in overall security that could allow the group to stage a resurgence.",
      "The U.S. and Iraq announced an agreement last year to wind down the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by September 2025, with U.S. forces departing some bases where they have stationed troops during a two-decade-long military presence in the country.",

      "The decision from a three-judge panel allows the orders to be enforced as a lawsuit challenging them plays out. The appeals court judges halted a nationwide injunction from U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson in Baltimore.",
      "Two of the judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that Mr. Trump's anti-DEI push could eventually raise concerns about First Amendment rights but said Abelson's sweeping block went too far.",
      "\"My vote should not be understood as agreement with the orders' attack on efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion,\" Judge Pamela Harris wrote. Two of the panel's members were appointed by former President Barack Obama, while the third was appointed by Mr. Trump.",
      "Abelson had found the orders likely violated free-speech rights and are unconstitutionally vague since they don't have a specific definition of DEI.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all \"equity-related\" grants or contracts. He signed a follow-up order requiring federal contractors to certify that they don't promote DEI.",
      "The city of Baltimore and other groups sued the Trump administration, arguing the executive orders are an unconstitutional overreach of presidential authority.",
      "The Justice Department has argued that the president was targeting only DEI programs that violate federal civil rights laws. Government attorneys said the administration should be able to align federal spending with the president's priorities.",
      "Abelson, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, agreed with the plaintiffs that the executive orders discourage businesses, organizations and public entities from openly supporting diversity, equity and inclusion.",

      "President Trump delivered a rambling campaign-style speech at the Justice Department on Friday to lay out his vision for the department, in which he aired his grievances over the federal investigations into him and vowed retribution against his political foes.",
      "Mr. Trump referred to a \"corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government\" who he said had \"obliterated\" trust and goodwill over generations, but promised \"those days are over\" and are \"never coming back.\" Opening his remarks, he said the Justice Department is starting a \"proud new chapter in the chronicles of American justice.\"",
      "\"We're turning the page on four long years of corruption, weaponization and surrender to violent criminals,\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"And we're restoring fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has been a regular critic of the Justice Department for years, even before special counsel Jack Smith indicted him in two criminal cases after he left office. The president praised one of the judges in those cases during his remarks. Mr. Trump said federal judge Aileen Cannon, who he appointed during his first term and who ultimately dismissed the classified documents case against him, as \"the absolute model of what a judge should be.\"",
      "In January, about a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for\u00a0Smith\u00a0on the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Trump were fired. The federal prosecutors were informed of the decision to terminate their positions by email after department leadership determined they were unable to carry out Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "Earlier this month, the president moved to suspend the security clearances of attorneys at Perkins Coie, a law firm linked to Democratic-funded opposition research during the\u00a02016 presidential campaign\u00a0into any ties between Mr. Trump and Russia. Mr. Trump's order also instructs agency heads to restrict access to government buildings by the firm's attorneys \"when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States\" and to identify, and cancel, contracts they have with the firm.",
      "His appearance at the department was notable given that no president has appeared there in a decade. In 2015, President Barack Obama made the last known public appearance by a sitting U.S. president at the Justice Department, when he paid tribute to departing attorney general Eric Holder. Before that, President George W. Bush in 2001 visited the department in order to formally change the name of the building to honor Robert F. Kennedy, who served as attorney general under the administration of his brother, President John F. Kennedy.",
      "The Justice Department, in order to protect its independence and integrity in law enforcement decisions, traditionally doesn't advise the White House about pending or possible criminal or civil investigations or cases, unless it's important to the president's duties, according to the Justice Manual.",
      "Mr. Trump also spoke of his vision for Washington as a capital that is \"the talk of the world,\" then trailed off about men's college basketball coach Bobby Knight, inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war and the 2020 election. He rounded out his lengthy remarks by putting drug cartels on notice and acknowledging family members of Americans who died from fentanyl.",
      "The president was introduced by Attorney General Pam Bondi, and FBI Director Kash Patel was also in attendance.",
      "Ahead of the president's remarks, some Democrats criticized Mr. Trump and alleged he has broken the law since he took office.",
      "\"President Trump began breaking the law on day one of his term, and immediately pardoned hundreds of violent criminals upon taking office,\" said House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat. \"The Trump administration is breaking the law and undermining the Constitution every day by illegally stealing funds for the programs that help American families and businesses, firing career civil servants without cause, and dismantling agencies created by acts of Congress.\"",
      "\"Restoring law and order starts with respecting the Rule of Law itself and the sacredness of our Constitution,\" Democratic Rep. Grace Meng of New York said in a statement. \"This administration has failed to do so since day one.\"",

      "The GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.",
      "If confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up\u00a0more than a third\u00a0of the budget.",
      "Medicare\u00a0covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers.\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.",
      "CMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.",
      "Oz\u00a0previously worked\u00a0as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University and host of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" until 2022, when he stopped taping new television episodes to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a\u00a0narrow contest\u00a0where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.",
      "Oz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid",
      "Oz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.",
      "\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"",
      "It will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like\u00a0a pricey proposal\u00a0in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.",
      "Oz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.",
      "He also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.",
      "\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.",
      "Oz criticizes Medicare Advantage",
      "During Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.",
      "Just over\u00a0half of seniors\u00a0have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.",
      "He cited\u00a0reports\u00a0showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.",
      "He also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.",
      "\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.",
      "Oz calls for limiting prior authorization",
      "Oz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.",
      "On Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"",
      "\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.",
      "Republicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed",
      "In social media posts last month, Oz\u00a0has touted\u00a0\"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.",
      "\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted\u00a0on Feb. 5.",
      "Oz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House\u00a0withdrew his nomination\u00a0to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "A majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.",
      "Oz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.",
      "Democrats criticized Oz's past",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.",
      "\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.",
      "The president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.",
      "As part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.",
      "After the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.",
      "He has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.",
      "In the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show.",

      "The preliminary results\u00a0show\u00a0the index fell to 57.9, compared with 64.7 a month ago, according to the Friday report. The reading marks the lowest level since November of 2022, researchers that compile the data said. Economists had expected consumer confidence to hold relatively steady, according to financial-data company FactSet.",
      "The results are \"a reflection of the Great Uncertainty around the economic policies put forward by the Trump administration,\" commented Carl Weinberg at High Frequency Economics. \"Consumer spending may become restrained by caution until the Trump economic agenda becomes clear.\"",
      "The White House's \"policy uncertainty has tanked consumer sentiment to its lowest level since inflation peaked more than two years ago, sent the stock market into correction territory and led forecasters to materially raise recession probabilities,\" commented Daniel Hornung, former deputy director of the National Economic Council.",
      "More Americans expressing concern",
      "Consumers anticipate inflation climbing at an annual rate of 4.9% during the next year, their highest expectations since 2022. While inflation abated slightly in February, more Americans are expressing concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's ongoing trade wars, as tariffs are import taxes paid by companies such as Walmart and Target that are often passed onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "\"The klaxon of layoff headlines, a falling stock market and tariff fears were a big blow to consumer confidence in early March,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in an email. \"The pullback in confidence is becoming a real threat to consumer spending which, as is often repeated, accounts for two thirds of U.S. economic activity.\"",
      "Consumers are also now expecting elevated inflation to be a long-term issue, saying they expect prices will increase at an annual clip of 3.9% during the next five to 10 years, the biggest month-over-month jump since 1993, the survey found. That's far higher than the Federal Reserve's inflation goal of driving the annual rate down to 2%.",

    "story": [
      "As Congress mulls potentially massive cuts to federal Medicaid funding, health centers that serve Native American communities, such as the Oneida Community Health Center near Green Bay, Wisconsin, are bracing for catastrophe.",
      "That's because more than 40% of the about 15,000 patients the center serves are enrolled in Medicaid. Cuts to the program would be detrimental to those patients and the facility, said Debra Danforth, the director of the Oneida Comprehensive Health Division and a citizen of the Oneida Nation.",
      "\"It would be a tremendous hit,\" she said.",
      "The facility provides a range of services to most of the Oneida Nation's 17,000 people, including ambulatory care, internal medicine, family practice, and obstetrics. The tribe is one of two in Wisconsin that have an \"open-door policy,\" Danforth said, which means that the facility is open to members of any federally recognized tribe.",
      "But Danforth and many other tribal health officials say Medicaid cuts would cause service reductions at health facilities that serve Native Americans.",
      "Indian Country has a unique relationship to Medicaid, because the program helps tribes cover chronic funding shortfalls from the Indian Health Service, the federal agency responsible for providing health care to Native Americans.",
      "Medicaid has accounted for about two-thirds of third-party revenue for tribal health providers, creating financial stability and helping facilities pay operational costs. More than a million Native Americans enrolled in Medicaid or the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program also rely on the insurance to pay for care outside of tribal health facilities without going into significant medical debt. Tribal leaders are calling on Congress to exempt tribes from cuts and are preparing to fight to preserve their access.",
      "\"Medicaid is one of the ways in which the federal government meets its trust and treaty obligations to provide health care to us,\" said Liz Malerba, director of policy and legislative affairs for the United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund, a nonprofit policy advocacy organization for 33 tribes spanning from Texas to Maine. Malerba is a citizen of the Mohegan Tribe.",
      "\"So we view any disruption or cut to Medicaid as an abrogation of that responsibility,\" she said.",
      "Tribes face an arduous task in providing care to a population that experiences severe health disparities, a high incidence of chronic illness, and, at least in western states, a life expectancy of 64 years \u2014 the lowest of any demographic group in the U.S. Yet, in recent years, some tribes have expanded access to care for their communities by adding health services and providers, enabled in part by Medicaid reimbursements.",
      "During the last two fiscal years, five urban Indian organizations in Montana saw funding growth of nearly $3 million, said Lisa James, director of development for the Montana Consortium for Urban Indian Health, during a webinar in February organized by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families and the National Council of Urban Indian Health.",
      "The increased revenue was \"instrumental,\" James said, allowing clinics in the state to add services that previously had not been available unless referred out for, including behavioral health services. Clinics were also able to expand operating hours and staffing.",
      "Montana's five urban Indian clinics, in Missoula, Helena, Butte, Great Falls, and Billings, serve 30,000 people, including some who are not Native American or enrolled in a tribe. The clinics provide a wide range of services, including primary care, dental care, disease prevention, health education, and substance use prevention.",
      "James said Medicaid cuts would require Montana's urban Indian health organizations to cut services and limit their ability to address health disparities.",
      "American Indian and Alaska Native people under age 65 are more likely to be uninsured than White people under 65, but 30% rely on Medicaid compared with 15% of their White counterparts, according to KFF data for 2017 to 2021. More than 40% of American Indian and Alaska Native children are enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, which provides health insurance to kids whose families are not eligible for Medicaid. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "A Georgetown Center for Children and Families report from January found the share of residents enrolled in Medicaid was higher in counties with a significant Native American presence. The proportion on Medicaid in small-town or rural counties that are mostly within tribal statistical areas, tribal subdivisions, reservations, and other Native-designated lands was 28.7%, compared with 22.7% in other small-town or rural counties. About 50% of children in those Native areas were enrolled in Medicaid.",
      "The federal government has already exempted tribes from some of President Trump's executive orders. In late February, Department of Health and Human Services acting general counsel Sean Keveney clarified that tribal health programs would not be affected by an executive order that diversity, equity, and inclusion government programs be terminated, but that the Indian Health Service is expected to discontinue diversity and inclusion hiring efforts established under an Obama-era rule.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also rescinded the layoffs of more than 900 IHS employees in February just hours after they'd received termination notices. During Kennedy's Senate confirmation hearings, he said he would appoint a Native American as an assistant HHS secretary. The National Indian Health Board, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for tribes, in December endorsed elevating the director of the Indian Health Service to assistant secretary of HHS.",
      "Jessica Schubel, a senior health care official in former President Joe Biden's White House, said exemptions won't be enough.",
      "\"Just because Native Americans are exempt doesn't mean that they won't feel the impact of cuts that are made throughout the rest of the program,\" she said.",
      "State leaders are also calling for federal Medicaid spending to be spared because cuts to the program would shift costs onto their budgets. Without sustained federal funding, which can cover more than 70% of costs, state lawmakers face decisions such as whether to change eligibility requirements to slim Medicaid rolls, which could cause some Native Americans to lose their health coverage.",
      "Tribal leaders noted that state governments do not have the same responsibility to them as the federal government, yet they face large variations in how they interact with Medicaid depending on their state programs.",
      "Mr. Trump has made seemingly conflicting statements about Medicaid cuts, saying in an interview on Fox News in February that Medicaid and Medicare wouldn't be touched. In a social media post the same week, Mr. Trump expressed strong support for a House budget resolution that would likely require Medicaid cuts.",
      "The budget proposal, which the House approved in late February, requires lawmakers to cut spending to offset tax breaks. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees spending on Medicaid and Medicare, is instructed to slash $880 billion over the next decade. The possibility of cuts to the program that, together with CHIP, provides insurance to 79 million people has drawn opposition from national and state organizations.",
      "The federal government reimburses IHS and tribal health facilities 100% of billed costs for American Indian and Alaska Native patients, shielding state budgets from the costs.",
      "Because Medicaid is already a stopgap fix for Native American health programs, tribal leaders said it won't be a matter of replacing the money but operating with less.",
      "\"When you're talking about somewhere between 30% to 60% of a facility's budget is made up by Medicaid dollars, that's a very difficult hole to try and backfill,\" said Winn Davis, congressional relations director for the National Indian Health Board.",
      "Congress isn't required to consult tribes during the budget process, Davis added. Only after changes are made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and state agencies are tribes able to engage with them on implementation.",
      "The amount the federal government spends funding the Native American health system is a much smaller portion of its budget than Medicaid. The IHS projected billing Medicaid about $1.3 billion this fiscal year, which represents less than half of 1% of overall federal spending on Medicaid.",
      "\"We are saving more lives,\" Malerba said of the additional services Medicaid covers in tribal health care. \"It brings us closer to a level of 21st century care that we should all have access to but don't always.\"",

      "\"This especially hurts anyone who's lost their jobs, including federal workers,\" said Natalia Abrams, founder and president of the Student Debt Crisis Center. \"A few months ago, they would have been able to get on a zero-dollar income-driven repayment plan.\"",
      "The removal of application materials also has caused confusion around the recertification process for borrowers already enrolled in repayment plans, experts say. Income-driven repayment plans take a borrower's finances and family size into account when calculating monthly payments, but borrowers must periodically demonstrate they still qualify.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty are layoffs at the Education Department, which oversees the federal loan system. The federal website for student loans and financial aid, StudentAid.gov, suffered an hours-long outage Wednesday, but the department has said it will continue to deliver on its commitments.",
      "\"It's been wave after wave of bad news for student borrowers,\" said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "Guidance for those with student loans",
      "All borrowers currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans should \"get a sense of when your recertification deadline is and get a sense of what options are available to you if the form is not available online to recertify your income,\" Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "Recertification confirms a borrower's financial situation. With some forms not currently available, borrowers who are unable to complete that process could be in jeopardy.",
      "If borrowers are already on an income-driven repayment plan, they should still be allowed to remain on that repayment plan if they are able to recertify their income.",
      "Abrams said it's also a good idea to take screenshots of your account's current status on the student aid website.",
      "State-specific and state-level resources are available for student borrowers. Congress members have teams charged with helping constituents if they are having trouble with a federal agency or struggling to contact a federal student loan servicer.",
      "Borrowers may contact their representatives in Congress and open a casework file by going onto their website or calling their office.",
      "\"Try saying something like, 'I need your help to understand how to get into an affordable repayment option, which I'm entitled to under the law,'\" Ba\u00f1ez said. \"'Even though this federal department has taken down these applications, I need your help.'\"",
      "Despite the thinning of the Education Department and President Donald Trump's dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, loan servicers still must consider a borrower's financial situation, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "\"You can see if you can get temporary forbearance or a deferment of payments for financial hardship,\" she said.",
      "State attorneys general also take inquiries from student borrowers.",
      "Jessica Fugate, a government relations manager for the city of Los Angeles, said she was less than a year from student loan forgiveness under the Biden-era Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives outstanding loans after 120 payments.",
      "With an ongoing court challenge to her former SAVE payment plan, though, Fugate hoped to switch to an income-driven plan before Trump took office. She applied in January.",
      "\"It's the most affordable option to repay my loans while living in Los Angeles working for the government on a government salary,\" said Fugate, 42. \"And it would mean my payments counted towards forgiveness.\"",
      "In February, Fugate received confirmation that her application was received and had been notified of its status, but they didn't say when she would know if she was approved.",
      "\"And when I called recently, the machine said there was a four hour wait,\" she said.",
      "With income-driven repayment plans in limbo, Fugate isn't sure what her options are and hopes to one day have her federal loans behind her.",
      "\"I've been working for government for almost 10 years. After that much time, you don't do it for the glory,\" she said. \"I've spent most of my career giving back to other people. I don't mind serving people. I just feel this was an agreement they made with the public, and so we're owed that. And it's a lot of us. And we're not just numbers.\"",
      "Debbie Breen, 56, works at an agency on healthy aging in Spokane, Washington. Breen said she has worked in the nonprofit sector for more than 10 years and that nearly all those years counted toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "Breen also was on the Biden-era SAVE plan, which means she was placed in forbearance when the court challenge to that plan was upheld. Like Fugate, she had planned to switch to an income-driven repayment plan to have her payments count towards forgiveness.",
      "\"I was months away from ending this nightmare,\" she said. \"Now I don't think that's going to happen. I'm kind of in panic mode because I know that if they stop income-driven repayment plans, I don't know that I'm going to be able to afford the payments each month.\"",
      "Breen said she has two kids who also have student loans.",
      "\"They're dealing with the same thing,\" she said. \"It's scary. It's absolutely scary.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doge-cuts-hundreds-federal-offices-start-empty-summer/",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 07:35:18 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices nationwide this summer under a frenetic and error-prone push by DOGE to scrap leases it says waste money.",
    "story": [
      "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer under a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk's budget-cutting advisers to terminate leases that they say waste money.",
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk heads, maintains a list of canceled real estate leases on its website, but internal documents obtained by The Associated Press contain a crucial detail: when those cancellations are expected to take effect. The documents from inside the General Services Administration, the U.S. government's real estate manager, list dozens of federal office and building leases expected to end by June 30, with hundreds more slated over the coming months.",
      "The rapid pace of cancellations has raised alarms, with some agencies and lawmakers appealing to DOGE to exempt specific buildings. Several agencies are facing 20 or more lease cancellations in all, including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Many of the terminations would affect agencies that aren't as well-known but oversee services critical to many Americans.",
      "They span from a Boise, Idaho, office of the Bureau of Reclamation - which oversees water supply and deals with disputes across the often-parched American West, to a Joliet, Illinois, outpost of the Railroad Retirement Board, which provides benefits for railroad workers and their survivors.",
      "The lease terminations don't mean all the locations will close. In some cases, agencies may negotiate new leases to stay in place, downsize their existing space or relocate elsewhere.",
      "\"Some agencies are saying: 'I'm not leaving. We can't leave,'\" said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official who now represents building owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions. \"I think there's going to be a period of pushback, a period of disbelief. And then, if necessary, they may start working on the actual execution of a move.\"",
      "DOGE says GSA has notified landlords in recent weeks that it plans to terminate 793 leases, focusing mostly on those that can be ended within months without penalty. The group estimates those moves will save roughly $500 million over the terms of the leases, which in some cases were slated to continue into the 2030s. The Bureau of Reclamation cancellation in Boise, for instance, would take effect Aug. 31 and is expected to save a total of $18.7 million through 2035.",
      "But DOGE's savings estimates - a fraction of Musk's $1 trillion cost-cutting goal - haven't been verified and don't take into account the costs of moves and closures. The group hasn't released any information about what they would mean for agencies.",
      "\"My initial reaction is this is just going to cause more chaos,\" said Jim Simpson, an accountant in Arizona who helps low-income people file taxes and serves on an IRS panel that advocates for taxpayers. \"There's a lot of room to help with government efficiency, but it should be done surgically and not with a chainsaw.\"",
      "Simpson said he was surprised to learn that dozens of IRS offices, including local taxpayer assistance centers, were facing upcoming lease cancellations. He refers clients there to get paperwork to file returns and answer IRS inquiries, and he said losing services would \"cause a lot of anxiety\" and delay refunds.",
      "DOGE scrapping some lease cancelations due to mistakes",
      "Plans to cancel the leases at several of the IRS centers and other sites were in error and have been rescinded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the changes who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid retaliation. Those changes aren't reflected yet on DOGE's list, which only removed one and added dozens more in its latest update published Thursday.",
      "The GSA walked back the cancellation of a Geological Survey office in Anchorage, Alaska, for instance, after learning it didn't have termination rights, according to the person familiar with the matter.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Monday that he'd convinced DOGE to back off lease terminations planned for the National Weather Center in Norman, a Social Security office in Lawton and the Indian Health Services office in Oklahoma City. But all three leases remained on DOGE's list of cancellations as of Thursday.",
      "GSA's press office didn't respond to inquiries.",
      "DOGE push took many by surprise",
      "While there was already a bipartisan push to reduce the government's real estate footprint, the mass cancellations blindsided an industry known for its stability.",
      "Landlords who'd been expecting government agencies to remain tenants \u2014 for several more years in some cases under their existing leases \u2014 were stunned. Some agencies learned from building managers, not their federal partners, that their leases were being canceled, according to real estate managers.",
      "Some cancelations could incur extra costs",
      "Becker, whose firm is tracking the DOGE lease cancellations, and other observers said they expect some agencies will be unable to move their personnel and property out of their spaces within such tight timelines. That may force some agencies to pay additional rent during what's known as a holdover period, undermining DOGE's stated goal of saving taxpayer money.",
      "The Building Owners and Managers Association, which represents the commercial real estate industry, told landlords in a recent advocacy alert to be prepared to seek payment from any federal government tenants who stay beyond their leases.",
      "Asked about plans for buildings with leases that will soon expire, the IRS didn't respond. A Social Security Administration spokesperson downplayed the impact of its offices losing leases, saying many were \"small remote hearing sites,\" didn't serve the public, were already being consolidated elsewhere or planned for closure.",
      "Several other agencies provided little clarity - saying they were working with GSA to consider their options, in statements that were nearly identical in some cases.",
      "But a spokesperson for the Railroad Retirement Board expressed concern over the upcoming lease cancellations of its offices in Joliet, Illinois, and eight other states, saying it was working to \"maintain a public-facing office presence for the local railroad community.\"",
      "Trimming federal real estate was already underway",
      "Government Accountability Office official David Marroni told a congressional hearing last week that the push to unload unnecessary federal real estate was \"long overdue,\" saying agencies have for too long held onto unnecessary space. But he warned the downsizing must be deliberate and carefully planned to \"generate substantial savings and mitigate the risk of mistakes and unexpected mission impacts.\"",
      "That process had already started before Musk's team arrived, with the federal government's real estate portfolio steadily declining over the last decade. Indeed, critics of DOGE say if it were truly interested in cost-cutting it could learn from GSA, whose mission even before Mr. Trump took office was to deliver \"effective and efficient\" services to the American public.",
      "A law signed by former President Joe Biden before he left office in January directed agencies to measure the true occupancy rates of leased spaces by this summer. Those that didn't meet a target of 60% use rate over time would be directed to dispose of their excess space.",
      "\"There is a logical and orderly way to do this,\" Rep. Greg Stanton, an Arizona Democrat, said at last week's hearing. Instead, he said, DOGE is pursuing a reckless approach that threatens to harm the delivery of public services.",
      "Industry observers cautioned that each situation is different and it will take months or years to understand the full impact of the lease cancellations.",
      "\"It really depends on the terms. But it is a shock, there is no question, that all of a sudden, boom, in six weeks all these things have happened,\" said J. Reid Cummings, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of South Alabama. \"It's like a blitzkrieg.\""

      "The order from U.S. District Judge James Bredar came late Thursday in a lawsuit filed by 19 states and the District of Columbia against multiple federal agencies alleging the mass firings are illegal.",
      "\"In this case, the government conducted massive layoffs, but it gave no advance notice,\" Bredar wrote. \"It claims it wasn't required to because, it says, it dismissed each one of these thousands of probationary employees for 'performance' or other individualized reasons. On the record before the Court, this isn't true. There were no individualized assessments of employees. They were all just fired. Collectively.\"",
      "The states contend the Trump administration blindsided them by ignoring laws set out for large-scale layoffs, which already are having an impact on state governments as they try to help the suddenly jobless. At least 24,000 probationary employees have been terminated since President Trump took office, the lawsuit alleges, though efforts by the judge to get an estimate from a government attorney at a hearing Wednesday were unsuccessful.",
      "The Trump administration argues that the states have no right to try and influence the federal government's relationship with its own workers. Mr. Trump has said he's targeting fraud, waste and abuse in a bloated federal government.",
      "In his temporary restraining order, Bredar issued a 14-day stay on what he called \"illegal\" reductions in force. His order, however, did not apply to firings at the Department of Defense, the National Archives and Records Administration and the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "\"So, although it is a close call, at this early stage, and given that a TRO is 'an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief,'...there is insufficient basis in the record for the Court to conclude that RIFs likely occurred at these three agencies,\" Bredar wrote.",
      "Earlier Thursday, a federal judge in San Francisco also ordered the Trump's administration to rehire thousands, if not tens of thousands, of probationary workers let go in mass firings across multiple agencies.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup said that the terminations were directed by the Office of Personnel Management and its acting director, Charles Ezell, who lacked the authority to do so.",
      "The administration immediately filed an appeal of the injunction with the Ninth Circuit Court. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt earlier Thursday cast the ruling as an attempt to encroach on executive power to hire and fire employees.",
      "\"The Trump Administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Alsup's order tells the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, the Interior and the Treasury to immediately offer job reinstatement to employees terminated on or about Feb. 13 and 14. He also directed the departments to report back within seven days with a list of probationary employees and an explanation of how the agencies complied with his order as to each person.",

      "If it looks like the set of some Hollywood sci-fi show, perhaps that's fitting, because what they are doing here is making stars on Earth. \"We are able to make miniature stars, 'cause fusion is the same reaction that powers the Sun and stars,\" said Tammy Ma, who leads the Fusion Energy Initiative at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, California. It's part of the same government laboratory that ensures the safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile.",
      "\"Every time we do a fusion experiment on the NIF, we are actually the hottest place in the entire solar system, hotter than the center of the Sun,\" Ma said.",
      "The scientists here are using the largest laser ever built. It's 1,000 times more powerful than the entire U.S. electrical grid, and is housed in a massive room the size of a three football fields. Here, 192 laser beams travel nearly a mile, and then focus in on a tiny target, or fuel pellet, smaller than a peppercorn. \u00a0When the lasers hit the pellet, the atoms \"fuse\" together, releasing energy in the process.",
      "That little fuel pellet is only about two millimeters in diameter. But the consequences could be huge.",
      "Fusion is a process that merges atoms together, and releases more energy than fission (which splits atoms apart). Fission is used by today's nuclear power plants and creates hazardous nuclear waste; fusion does not.",
      "Fusion would theoretically provide a nearly-limitless source of clean and safe energy, powering our world without the fossil fuels that are warming the planet and contributing to climate change. It would make energy-intensive technologies like vertical farming and water desalination much cheaper, potentially solving the world's food and water problems. Ma said, \"It is completely clean. There's no carbon anywhere in the equation. There's no high-level nuclear waste. You can place fusion power plants nearly anywhere. It could help meet all of the energy needs for the U.S. now and into the future, even as our energy needs rise.\"",
      "But fusion is hard. After 60 years of research by scientists at NIF, they finally generated a reaction (also called \"ignition\") that produced more energy than it consumed.

      "Bob Mumgaard is CEO and co-founder of Commonwealth Fusion Systems outside of Boston, one of more than two dozen fusion startups getting billions of dollars in funding from the government and investors. \"It's gonna take time, it's gonna take work, but this is the birth of an industry,\" Mumgaard said.",
      "Instead of lasers, Commonwealth uses a cloud of super-heated plasma that burns at around 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, held in place by massive magnets that the company manufactures on site. \"The magnets in this machine will be the strongest magnets in the world,\" Mumgaard said. \"[They] could lift up an aircraft carrier.\"",
      "Commonwealth expects to complete its demonstration reactor next year. It just announced plans to build its first full-scale power plant in Virginia, but that won't deliver energy to the grid until sometime next decade. The demonstration reactor, Mumgaard said, \"is the penultimate step to that.\"",
      "Critics point out that fusion power has been an ever-elusive holy grail, always 20 to 30 years away. But startups like Commonwealth say this time is different. The technology is advancing as fast as the need for clean energy is rising \u2013 stars aligning in the quest to create stars here on Earth.",

    "story": [
      "A volcano near Alaska's largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday\u00a0it had measured during recent overflights \"significantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\" and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\"We expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\" the observatory said in a statement. \"Such stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\"",
      "However, the observatory warned that it was possible that an eruption could happen with little or no warning.",
      "\"While we expect additional changes to monitoring data prior to an eruption, it is also possible that an eruption could occur with little or no additional warning,\" the observatory wrote. \"This would be extremely hazardous for recreators on Mount Spurr or near its drainages as well as those overflying the volcano.\"",
      "What is Mount Spurr?",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents and is 11,070 feet (3,374 meters) tall. It is covered in ice and snow and is located roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "When did Mount Spurr last erupt?",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "\"It is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\" John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "What impacts could an eruption have?",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "CBS affiliate WGME-TV reported that the ash could drift all the way to the East Coast, but that would depend on the jet stream, and it probably would not have a major impact.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bird-species-us-need-conservation-help-new-report/",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 10:00:02 -0400",
    "summary": "The 2025 State of the Birds report identifies 112 \"tipping point\" species \u2014 those that have lost more than half their populations in the past five decades.",
    "story": [
      "A new report on the state of birds in the United States has an urgent warning: bird populations across nearly every habitat are declining, with about one-third of U.S. bird species in critical need of conservation action.",
      "A total of 229 out of 718 bird species in the U.S. are now classified as high or moderate conservation concerns, according to the 2025 State of the Birds report, which was produced by a consortium of scientific and conservation organizations led by the North American Bird Conservation Initiative. This includes 112 \"tipping point\" species \u2014 those that have lost more than half their populations in the past five decades. Some, like the Allen's hummingbird, tricolored blackbird and saltmarsh sparrow, are at extreme risk without immediate intervention, says the report, released Thursday.",
      "The population of grassland birds in the U.S. has dropped by 43% since 1970, as row-crop production, drought and habitat loss take their toll, the report says. Aridland birds have declined 41% in the same period due to drought, wildfires and invasive species. Even forest birds, facing habitat degradation from fire suppression and industrial timber practices, are seeing widespread declines. Waterfowl, once considered a conservation success, have declined by 20% since 2014 from the loss of wetlands and grasslands.",
      "The findings continue a downward trend. A 2019 study published in Science, an academic journal, found that North America lost nearly 3 billion birds over the previous 50 years, including 90 \"tipping point\" species of 529 bird species that were examined.",
      "\"The 2025 State of the Birds report shows those losses are continuing, with declines among several bird trend indicators,\" the new report says. \"Notably duck populations\u2014a bright spot in past State of the Birds reports, with strong increases since 1970\u2014have trended downward in recent years.\"",
      "Conservationists have previously warned that bird populations are in steep decline due to habitat loss and climate change, and they're further alarmed after the U.S. Interior Department last month suspended a legal opinion from the Biden administration that held companies accountable for accidentally killing birds through industrial activities like oil and gas drilling, wind energy production and construction \u2013 in a victory for the energy sector.",
      "Birds play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. They help control pests, disperse seeds and pollinate plants, contributing to crop yields and supporting biodiversity, says Amanda Rodewald, faculty director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Center for Avian Population Studies",
      "And declining bird populations signal larger environmental problems, experts say.",
      "\"There's a really long history and a lot of evidence that shows that birds can be excellent indicators of environmental conditions,\" Rodewald told CBS News. \"We share the same environments with birds, if they're not healthy for bird populations, they're not likely to be healthy for us either.\"",
      "Beyond their ecological role, birds bring significant economic and mental health benefits. Birdwatching contributes $279 billion to the U.S. economy and supports 1.4 million jobs, according to the report. Encounters with birds have also been linked to reduced stress and improved mental well-being, further underscoring their importance.",
      "Experts stress that conservation efforts can succeed when adequately funded. The bald eagle, once nearly wiped out by the pesticide DDT, has rebounded thanks to concerted efforts. In December, the species even gained bipartisan recognition as the official U.S. bird.",
      "Strategic habitat conservation efforts \u2014 such as conservation ranching, coastal restoration and seabird translocation \u2014 are already making a difference in some regions.",
      "The new report calls for increased investment in conservation programs, stronger habitat protections, and policies that promote sustainable land management. Without swift action, scientists warn, the next State of the Birds report could bring even graver news.",
      "\"Birds unite us across the hemisphere and across the political spectrum,\" said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society. \"There should be no hesitation in moving to protect them today and in the future.\""

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:15:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The prehistoric facial bones were found buried in 50 feet of mud and silt, and are believed to be 1.1 to 1.4 million years old, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",
      "Research at the excavation site will continue, the scientists said.",

    "story": [
      "The Crew 10 Dragon capsule caught up with the International Space Station and moved in for a textbook docking early Sunday, bringing four fresh crew members to the lab and clearing the way for the Starliner astronauts to return to Earth after nearly 300 days in space.",
      "Approaching from behind and below, the Crew Dragon, launched Friday evening from the Kennedy Space Center, passed 1,300 feet directly under the station before looping up to a point 720 feet directly ahead of the outpost. From there, it glided straight in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port at 12:04 a.m. EDT.",
      "Motorized latches then engaged to pull the capsule into the docking mechanism for an airtight structural seal. After standard leak checks and umbilical connections, the crew opened the Dragon's forward hatch at 1:35 a.m. and floated into the space station.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, an Army colonel and former combat helicopter pilot, told flight controllers she and her fellow fliers had a \"great trip\" from the launch pad to the space station, adding \"I cannot tell you the immense joy of our crew when we looked out the window and we saw the space station for the first time.\"",
      "\"Let me tell you, that is such an amazing journey, you can hardly even put it into words,\" she said. \"The ride up on the Falcon 9, orbiting the Earth for the last couple of days, it's been absolutely incredible ... Thank you very, very much.\"",
      "\"Thank you to SpaceX for the awesome ride up here,\" said co-pilot Nichole Ayers, an Air Force major and F-22 Raptor pilot. \"As a (space) rookie, that was one of the coolest things I've ever done. I can't wait to get to work up here.\"",

      "Three other crew members, cosmonauts Aleksey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, were launched to the station last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. They're scheduled to return to Earth next month.",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner astronaut ferry ship. The flight was originally expected to last about eight days.",
      "But during rendezvous with the space station, the Starliner experienced propulsion system problems and NASA eventually ruled out bringing the crew down on the Boeing spacecraft.",
      "Instead, the astronauts were told to remain aboard the station while the Starliner returned to Earth on its own. NASA then bumped two astronauts from the next station flight \u2014 Crew 9 \u2014 freeing up two seats for use by Wilmore and Williams.",
      "When Hague and Gorbunov reached the station, Wilmore and Williams joined them to become part of Crew 9 for a normal six-month tour of duty.",
      "Now that Crew 10 has arrived, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams will help familiarize their replacements with space station operations before undocking and returning to Earth next week with a splashdown in the Gulf near the coast of Florida.",
      "At landing, Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in space since launch last June. While a long flight by any standard, it's still well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days \u2014 set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with around 570 days in space overall, depending on the actual launch date.

      "Hague and Gorbunov were launched aboard the Crew 9 Dragon in\u00a0September. Two NASA astronauts who originally planned to be on that flight were bumped from the mission to free up two seats for Wilmore and Williams. They became part of Crew 9 and worked with Hague and Gorbunov for the duration of their six-month mission.",
      "The Crew 9 fliers plan to spend two days familiarizing their replacements with the intricacies of space station operation before boarding their own Crew Dragon, the same one that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, for the trip home.",
      "The flight plan calls for undocking Tuesday, setting the stage for re-entry and splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast next weekend. By that point, Wilmore and Williams will have logged about 290 days \u2014 9.7 months \u2014 in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to around 174 days, depending on the landing date.",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule on June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "The astronauts originally planned to spend about eight days in space, but NASA and Boeing, the Starliner's builder, carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers ruled that option out. Instead, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew 9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of their mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "President Trump blamed the extended mission on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the Starliner crew.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon (Musk), I said, 'Do me a favor, can you get 'em out?' He said 'Yes.' He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon that Mr. Trump was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It it is assigned to the Crew 10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew 9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth along with Hague and Gorbunov.",
      "Musk said earlier he offered to launch a mission to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but the offer, he said, was turned down for political reasons. NASA managers say they never heard of such an offer and that the current plan causes the least disruption to station operations and downstream crew rotation flights.",
      "While NASA could have brought Crew 9 down earlier aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, but that would have left a single astronaut \u2014 Pettit \u2014 aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Those who glanced up at the sky Thursday night had an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon\u00a0was due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late Thursday night or very early Friday morning, depending on the viewer's time zone. It was visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon technically rose in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon showed a new hue when it happened.",
      "Why was the moon red, orange and yellow?",
      "The moon appeared to turn red as Earth passed directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon takes on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "When was the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse?",
      "This week's \"Blood Moon\" began late Thursday night. The moon moved through Earth's shadow overnight, with the best opportunity to see the reddish moon around 3 a.m. ET Friday.",

      "What is a lunar eclipse?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this March, the entire moon will fall within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth.",
      "There are also partial and penumbral eclipses, which are when the sun, Earth and moon are not perfectly aligned.",
      "Why does the moon look red during the lunar eclipse?",
      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",
      "\"It's as if all the world's sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon,\" NASA explains in a blog post.",
      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",
      "What else can you see during the full Blood Worm Moon?",
      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",
      "Viewers can also look to the western sky on the night of the total lunar eclipse to catch a glimpse of Jupiter and Mars, according to NASA. Constellations may also be easier to spot than usual as Earth's shadow dims the Moon's glow.",

    "story": [
      "A space probe flying past Mars captured images of the red planet's small, mysterious moon.",
      "The space probe, named Hera, was launched on Oct. 7, 2024, and is on a mission to gather close-up data about the Dimorphos asteroid, the European Space Agency said in a news release. The asteroid was the first to have its orbit altered by human action, when it was impacted by NASA's DART spacecraft in 2022. The goal of Hera is to learn more about asteroid deflection so the technique can be refined and used again.",
      "While on a flyby of Mars, Hera was able to use three of its imaging instruments to capture images of Deimos, the smaller of Mars' two moons, the ESA said. Deimos is about 15,000 miles from Mars. Scientists have previously speculated that it may actually be a piece of asteroid, not a moon.",
      "Hera got as close as 1,000 kilometers, or about 620 miles, to Deimos. It used its various instruments to capture the images, characterize the mineral makeup on the moon and chart surface temperatures. These features combined will help scientists learn more about the lunar body, the ESA said.",
      "\"These instruments have been tried out before, during Hera's departure from Earth, but this is the first time that we have employed them on a small distant moon for which we still lack knowledge \u2013 demonstrating their excellent performance in the process,\" ESA Hera mission scientist Michael Kueppers said in the news release.",
      "The ESA's Mars Express, which has been orbiting the red planet for over 20 years, also contributed observations of the moon. Results from the encounter should help guide operational planning for a mission set to explore Martian moons in 2026, the ESA said. That mission, in conjunction with NASA and French and German space agencies, will collect detailed measurements of Mars' two moons and land on Phobos, the larger lunar body, to collect a sample that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Hera also used the flyby of Mars to adjust its trajectory through deep space. That maneuver shortened Hera's travel time to Dimorphos, the ESA said. Hera will also collect information about Didymos, the asteroid that Dimorphos orbits around. Hera is expected to reach the Didymos in December 2026, the ESA said.",
      "\"This has been the Hera team's first exciting experience of exploration, but not our last,\" said Hera mission manager Ian Carnelli in the news release. \"In 21 months the spacecraft will reach our target asteroids, and start our crash site investigation of the only object in our Solar System to have had its orbit measurably altered by human action.\"",

    "story": [
      "With the countdown within 45 minutes of launch, NASA called off an attempt to send the next crew to the International Space Station Thursday evening to allow more time to troubleshoot a ground system hydraulics issue. If the problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX will make another attempt to launch the crew Friday evening.",
      "The scrub will add at least two more days to the eventual return to Earth of Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams, along with two other outgoing space station crew members.",
      "Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov were strapped in and ready for blastoff from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:48 p.m. EDT Wednesday.",
      "But throughout the final few hours of the countdown, SpaceX engineers were troubleshooting an apparent problem with one of two clamp arms that hold the Falcon 9 rocket to its launch support gantry. Hydraulics are used to retract the two clamps prior to launch, and while the system appeared to be working normally, it wasn't clear whether one of the arms would retract fully.",
      "A launch opportunity Thursday was ruled out due to expected high winds and to give engineers more time to assess data and determine what, if any, repairs are needed. If the hydraulics problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX could be ready to press ahead with a launch attempt at 7:03 p.m. Friday.",
      "Whenever Crew-10 takes off, rendezvous and docking with the space station is expected the following day.",
      "Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew-9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "McClain and her crewmates will spend two days getting briefed by Crew-9 on the intricacies of space station operations before Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams undock on March 19\u00a0for their return to Earth. The normal \"handover\" period is five days or so, but mission managers shortened it this time around to maintain the lab's food reserves.",
      "While the ongoing saga of the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts has overshadowed the Crew-10 mission, McClain said she and her crewmates began training for their mission in 2023 and they were all eager to finally get into space. McClain and Onishi are space station veterans while Ayers and Peskov are making their first flight.",
      "All four are veteran military or commercial pilots. Before joining NASA, McClain, an active-duty Army colonel, served as a combat helicopter pilot while Ayers, an Air Force major, is a veteran F-22 Raptor pilot. Onishi served as a commercial pilot in Japan, flying Boeing 767 jetliners, and Peskov is an experienced commercial 757 pilot.",
      "\"We're going to have planned and unplanned maintenance to keep the space station running,\" McClain said. \"We have a plethora of science experiments, both inside and outside of the space station. We have spacewalks. We have visiting vehicles (and) the potential of (hosting) private astronaut missions.\"",
      "\"They're ready to come home\"",
      "As for Wilmore and Williams, McClain said, \"honestly, I'm kind of most looking forward to breaking bread with those guys, talking to them, giving them big hugs. We go way back. ... We're ready to go up there. They're ready to come home.\"",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10 Friday, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 19 and land as early as March 20 or 21. If so, the Starliner astronauts will have logged 288 days or so \u2014  9.5 months \u2014  \u00a0in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to about 173 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew-10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew-9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew-9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew-9 or Crew-8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew-9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew-9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew-9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew-10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew-9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew-10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",
      "\"But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who's interested in what we're doing.\"",

      "The cone-shaped Spherex \u2014 at 1,110 pounds or the heft of a grand piano \u2014 will take six months to map the entire sky with its infrared eyes and wide field of view. Four full-sky surveys are planned over two years, as the telescope circles the globe from pole to pole 400 miles up.",
      "Spherex won't see galaxies in exquisite detail like NASA's larger and more elaborate Hubble and Webb space telescopes, with their narrow fields of view.",
      "Instead of counting galaxies or focusing on them, Spherex will observe the total glow produced by the whole lot, including the earliest ones formed in the wake of the universe-creating Big Bang.",
      "\"This cosmological glow captures all light emitted over cosmic history,\" said the mission's chief scientist Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology. \"It's a very different way of looking at the universe,\" enabling scientists to see what sources of light may have been missed in the past.",
      "By observing the collective glow, scientists hope to tease out the light from the earliest galaxies and learn how they came to be, Bock said.",
      "\"We won't see the Big Bang. But we'll see the aftermath from it and learn about the beginning of the universe that way,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "When British novelist J.B. Priestley visited the Grand Canyon in the 1930s, he described it as \"all of Beethoven's nine symphonies in stone and magic light.\"",
      "\"If I were an American,\" he wrote, \"I should make my remembrance of it the final test of men, art, and policies \u2026 Every member or officer of the federal government ought to remind himself, with triumphant pride, that he is on the staff of the Grand Canyon.\"",
      "In February, as part of the Trump Administration's effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce, approximately 1,000 employees were laid off across the Park Service. When the federal government fired some of the Park Service staff who work at the canyon, this was the scene near the South Rim:",
      "In the weeks since, there have been protests at hundreds of park service sites, from Acadia to Zion.",
      "Jim Landahl worked as a seasonal ranger for years, until he got a promotion to a permanent posting at Grand Canyon six months ago. Then came the termination email. He said it stated that \"we lacked the necessary skills, qualifications, fitness to perform this job. And I didn't take that personally at all, because I knew that was a lie. I knew that was false. Whoever wrote that letter wasn't hiking with me down into the canyon in a hundred-degree heat to do our job.\"",
      "Landahl's work involved restoring habitat disturbed by the reconstruction of the park's failing Transcanyon Waterline, which provides water to lodges and other infrastructure. Since he'd been in this position for less than a year, he was classified as a \"probationary employee.\"",
      "\"The project is a critical infrastructure project for Grand Canyon,\" said archeologist Leah Gallo. \"And without it, there would be pretty much no Grand Canyon.\"",
      "Gallo had only been working on the project for two weeks when she was let go. \"I spent pretty much every dime to move here,\" she said.",
      "But this past Thursday, two federal judges ruled that the government must reinstate thousands of fired probationary workers across several agencies, finding that the layoffs were carried out under false pretenses \u2013 that performance wasn't a factor.",
      "It's currently unclear if and when Park Service staff might be back on the job.",

      "Judge orders 6 agencies to rehire fired federal probationary workers after \"unlawful\" terminations",
      "Mindy Riesenberg is the chief of communications for the Grand Canyon Conservancy, a non-profit group that supports the park. As we enter the busy season, she says she's worried about people having to wait in several-hour-long lines just to get into the park. \"We had almost five million visitors last year at Grand Canyon,\" she said. \"And now I think we're down to about 11 fee collectors for the South Rim, for five million people a year.\"",
      "When we visited the canyon last weekend, visitors were waiting up to an hour-and-a-half to enter the park. In New Mexico, Carlsbad Caverns National Park had cancelled all ranger-led tours. Colorado's Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument announced it would be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays due to the staffing cuts.",
      "Cuts also impact ongoing projects visitors might not see, like the Transcanyon Waterline. Riesenberg said, \"That project is going to be held up, because scientists and botanists and arborists who were replanting trees down there for shade, for safety, after that project, and that's all gonna stop. It's gonna hold the project up.\"",
      "Chuck Sams, who served as the 19th director of the National Park Service, stepped down in January. He said, \"To me, it looks like there's no rhyme or reason about why these things are taking place.\"",
      "During his time as director, Sams said, \"I absolutely felt that we needed more employees. National Park Service needs at least 15% to as much as 25% more staff on the ground in order to fully meet its mandate. It's important that these folks are out there. And now, we've seen a 10% reduction in staff. So it's gonna be detrimental to people's experiences in the parks.\"",
      "Asked for comment, the National Park Service's Office of Public Affairs told \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" \"The National Park Service remains steadfast in its commitment to serving the American public and preserving the natural and cultural resources entrusted to our care. However, NPS policy is to not comment on litigation related to personnel matters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a group of current employees known as the \"Resistance Rangers\" has been tracking the cuts, speaking out on behalf of their fired coworkers.",
      "One ranger, who asked that we conceal their identity out of fear of retaliation, told us, \"None of us want to be doing this. We're public land servants. We're civil servants who just want to be doing our job. I cannot separate myself from the mission. I am doing this for the love of public lands. I'm doing this for my nieces and nephews. I'm doing this for the people to come in 150 years.\"",
      "The ranger is especially worried about the crush of visitors who will be headed to understaffed parks this spring and summer. \"We were hobbled to begin with, and now our kneecaps are cut off,\" they said. \"In addition to that, we have $12 billion in maintenance deficit. Like, every single national park you ask me about that I've been to, I can point out six or seven high-priority products that need to happen in order to protect the integrity of that place. We just had our highest visitation year ever in history; 331 million people went to parks last year. That is an absurd number of people.\"",
      "Americans love their national parks. Last year, a Pew Research Center opinion poll found that, when it comes to federal agencies, the public has the most favorable view of the National Park Service. It ranked highest with Democrats AND Republicans.",
      "Sams said, \"During my service as the National Park Service director, I had never met a member of Congress that didn't love the park that was in their home state. And I generally saw bipartisan support for the National Park Service. Moving forward, there has to be a strong understanding that parks aren't partisan. The flora and fauna, the natural and cultural resources inside of the park don't belong to any political party.\"",
      "Fired training specialist Lynda Jones joined the Park Service to serve her country. \"Both my parents are veterans,\" she said. \"They served in the military. And they instilled in me the importance of public service.\"",
      "While Thursday's court rulings have reinstated her position at Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (at least temporarily), the Trump administration has appealed \u2013 and a larger reduction in force is still possible.",
      "Which leaves park staff like Jones dealing with an uncertain future, worried about what's to come. \"This is the story of America,\" Jones said, tearing up. \"The story of the people who live here. And it doesn't matter your background or where you're from. These places belong to all of us. And they really are America's best idea.\"",

    "summary": "Trump campaign funder and government disrupter Elon Musk has used unprecedented power to quickly eliminate thousands of federal jobs and shutter entire programs and agencies, using tactics that have raised questions about transparency.",
    "story": [
      "It was a remarkable moment last Tuesday: President Trump standing beside a shiny electric car at the White House making a pitch for the car's maker, Elon Musk: \"This man has devoted his energy and his life to doing this. I think he's been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people.\"",
      "For Musk \u2013 who spent about $300 million to help Trump win the White House, and who has reportedly pledged millions more to Trump's political efforts \u2013 it was a boost for Tesla's image, and a show of solidarity from the president. As he climbed into the driver's seat, Mr. Trump gushed, \"Everything's computers!\"",
      "Tesla protests across the country have been a response to the \"Department of Government Efficiency\" initiative, known as DOGE. And as the man at its helm, Musk has been presidential confidant, cost-cutter, and government contractor all at once.",

      "Molotov cocktails, arson and graffiti: Tesla facilities attacked in wake of Elon Musk's role in the White House",
      "When asked about possible conflicts of interest given Musk's role in the Trump administration, Katie Drummond, the global editorial director of Wired (the technology publication that has scored recent scoops about Musk and his associates), says, \"It is very clear that there are conflicts of interest across the board. I mean, Elon Musk himself is one giant conflict of interest.",
      "\"When you think about SpaceX, Starlink, Tesla, you think about all of these companies that are in some way, shape or form regulated and overseen by different agencies of the federal government,\" Drummond said. \"And then you remember that the person who owns and runs all of these companies is flying on Air Force One with President Trump. Of course it's a conflict of interest.\"",

      "After years of covering Silicon Valley, Wired was ready to cover the ascent of tech billionaires into politics. [Last year, the magazine endorsed Trump's opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.]",
      "But in January, present at Trump's inauguration were Musk and other Silicon Valley billionaires.",
      "Asked if that represented a new power structure in this country, Drummond said, \"It's a power structure that has been growing for a while now. But I thought that the inauguration was such a stark moment of realization \u2013 I think should be a moment of realization for everyone in the United States \u2013 about who really runs this country.\"",
      "And who is running it? Elon Musk? Or President Trump?",
      "\"The technology industry,\" Drummond replied. \"You think about the trillions of dollars involved in all of those companies and those businesses. There is so much power in the technology industry, and when you combine that with, you know, essentially collusion with the federal administration, or at least a willingness to work hand-in-hand with the Trump administration, that's what we're about to see.\"",
      "Newt Gingrich is a Republican former Speaker of the House, and a long-time Trump ally. Asked if he is concerned about possible conflicts of interest  given the world's richest man's many business dealings with the federal government, Gingrich said, \"Well, I think you always have to look at the danger of conflicts of interest with anybody. But at the same time, I would say that one of the virtues of being as wealthy as he is, is he hardly needs to rig the game.\"",
      "Asked who has oversight over Musk at this point, Gingrich replied, \"Donald J. Trump. He is the chief executive officer of the United States. He was elected by the American people, and he's acting as the President of the United States.\"",
      "Gingrich became a household name three decades ago for his own push to shrink the federal government. Asked how today is different, Gingrich opined that the government is \"much sicker\" now than it was in 1995. \"It's had a huge growth of bureaucracy, a huge growth of left-wing ideology, much bigger deficits,\" he said. \"Trump has been campaigning for 10 years. He's found in Elon Musk the kind of person who has the drive, the toughness, the intelligence to really fundamentally take on the 'deep state' and change it in ways that would normally be unthinkable.\"",
      "In the 1990s, Gingrich pressured the Democratic administration of President Bill Clinton to embrace conservative budget cuts. But in the Clinton-era, most reforms came only after months of deliberation and Congressional action \u2013 in stark contrast to what's happening today.",
      "What is DOGE? Here's what to know about Elon Musk's latest cost-cutting effortsMusk is not an employee of DOGE and \"has no actual or formal authority,\" White House says",
      "What is DOGE? Here's what to know about Elon Musk's latest cost-cutting efforts",
      "Musk is not an employee of DOGE and \"has no actual or formal authority,\" White House says",
      "\"Let's be clear: Some people are gonna get hurt, let's be honest,\" Gingrich said of DOGE's broad cuts to federal programs and staff in virtually every agency. \"There'll be some people laid off that probably shouldn't have been. There'll be some contracts that are dropped that probably shouldn't have been.\"",
      "\"Or some things that happen where the government just isn't functioning well,\" I said.",
      "\"Then the question you have to ask yourself is, on balance, does this system need to be fixed, even if the risk of fixing is gonna be some things that aren't totally a hundred percent?\" Gingrich said. \"Because you slow down enough to try to avoid any possible mistake, you'll get nothing done.\"",
      "But Elaine Kamarck, a scholar at Washington's Brookings Institution, countered, \"You can't just start lopping off whole categories of workers.\"",
      "And what is the outcome if the table of government is tipped over? \"People will die,\" Kamarck said. \"It's that serious.\"",
      "In the 1990s, Karmack was effectively the Clinton administration's counterpart to Gingrich, administering what was called Rego: Reinventing Government. She said it was very different from what is being implemented by DOGE and the White House. \"What Musk is doing, and Trump, is they're testing the limits of executive power in a way that we did not,\" she said. \"We went through it the old-fashioned way: If we thought a law needed to be changed, we went to Congress and asked them to change it.\"",
      "Asked whether Democrats should work with Musk and President Trump, as Democrats tried with Republicans in the '90s, Karmack said, \"I think Democrats should try where they can, absolutely. I think they should try to work with Musk. The problem is there's a total lack of transparency. We don't know who they're cutting. There's no rationale for why they're cutting. They're saying these people are wasteful? What do you mean? What are they doing that is a waste of taxpayers' money? We've gotten none of this.",
      "\"This is just a sort of slash-and-burn exercise,\" Karmack said. \"This is not a thought-out exercise.\"",
      "In a statement to \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that DOGE has been \"incredibly transparent,\" and that \"President Trump has stated he will not allow conflicts, and Elon himself has committed to recusing himself from potential conflicts.\"",
      "But Katie Drummond of Wired says concerns about Musk are not going away \u2026 and Elon Musk, for now, remains empowered.",
      "\"It's very clear, and I think should be very clear to anyone who has watched Elon Musk and how he operates for any period of time, his work ethic and his ambitions are limitless,\" said Drummond. \"I think we are really sort of only at the beginning of what has the potential to be a much more seismic transformation of these federal agencies, of the federal infrastructure, for as long as Elon Musk is involved in this transformation.\"",

From there, it glided straight in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port at 12:04 a.m. EDT.",
      "Motorized latches then engaged to pull the capsule into the docking mechanism for an airtight structural seal. After standard leak checks and umbilical connections, the crew opened the Dragon's forward hatch at 1:35 a.m. and floated into the space station.",

      "\"Let me tell you, that is such an amazing journey, you can hardly even put it into words,\" she said. \"The ride up on the Falcon 9, orbiting the Earth for the last couple of days, it's been absolutely incredible ... Thank you very, very much.\"",

      "That lawsuit lists multiple failures to arrest Chris Prichard. O'Brien says this led to what's called a \"state-created danger,\" meaning the officers' alleged inaction and indifference actually increased the threat to Angela Prichard.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Can a police officer decide, should I arrest him or not? Is that up to their discretion?",
      "Dave O'Brien: Absolutely not. \u2026 Here in Iowa \u2026 only a judge can show discretion not to enforce this restraining order.",
      "Starting Sept. 1, 2022, when Angela's second protection order was issued \u2014 until her murder 37 days later \u2014 O'Brien says Chris Prichard continued to violate the no-contact order with no consequences.",
      "Dave O'Brien: A dozen times during this relevant time period, Angela Prichard called the Bellevue Police Department, and they failed to follow that law, that judge's order.",
      "That's because, O'Brien says, the Bellevue police officers showed Chris Prichard favoritism.",
      "Dave O'Brien: We have reason to believe that he was friendly with law enforcement officers.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: To prove this \u2026 you must prove that the police officer's failure to enforce the protection order was intentional and reckless. How can you do that?",
      "Dave O'Brien: Well, just by the sheer number of times that it was not enforced.",
      "In October 2024, Chief Federal Judge C.J. Williams dismissed the lawsuit in its entirety. The Bellevue Police Department, he ruled, \"Did not put Angela in a more dangerous situation,\" and the three officers, \"simply did not commit outrageous conduct.\"",
      "The judge added there was no evidence of police favoritism: \"The alleged facts, even taken as true \u2026 are a far cry from establishing that any of the defendants were friends with Christopher.\"",
      "O'Brien was granted a hearing in December 2024 after learning, he says, the three Bellevue officers had withheld evidence and made false statements, allegedly concealing their friendships with Chris Prichard \u2014 accusations they deny.",
      "O'Brien argued the officers were well aware Chris Prichard was a serious threat to his wife. Nine days before her murder, the Jackson County attorney warned the Bellevue Police Department in an email that Chris Prichard had 24 hours to turn himself in:",
      "JACKSON COUNTY ATTORNEY EMAIL: \"If he does not report I will be requesting a warrant. I wanted all of you to be aware as I'm afraid he might try to do something tonight.\"",
      "The next day, when Prichard failed to appear at the county jail, the arrest warrant was issued. Seven days before her murder, O'Brien says \u00a0bodycam footage of a Bellevue police officer speaking with Wendy and Angela confirms police knew Angela was in danger.",
      "CHIEF SCHROEDER (bodycam | to Angela Prichard and Wendy Budde): \"Because right now I guarantee he's not thinking straight.\"",
      "WENDY BUDDE: No, not at all.",
      "CHIEF SCHROEDER: That's my biggest fear. That's my department's biggest fear is he's going to try to hurt you and then hurt himself.",
      "CHIEF SCHROEDER: My job is to protect you at all costs.",
      "During the final week of Angela's life, O'Brien says Bellevue police could have protected her by finding and arresting Chris Prichard. But they never did.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Is it hard to find Chris?",
      "Joshua Close: Shouldn't be. \u2026Everybody knew his Jeep \u2013 had a customized tag that says \"0Dark30\" on it. \u2026 So, you can't miss it.",
      "Dave O'Brien: We have not been provided with any record showing there was any effort made to enforce the arrest warrant once it was issued on the 30th of September.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Had that arrest warrant been executed, would Angela be here today?",
      "Dave O'Brien: Absolutely. \u2026 He should have been in jail.",
      "At the December hearing, defense attorneys insisted the new information presented by O'Brien was \u2026\u2026 \"improper, should be stricken and not considered by the Court.\"",
      "Dave O'Brien: Our ideal outcome would be just a complete reversal of the judge's decision.",
      "In January 2025, Judge Williams refused to reverse his dismissal. Bellevue Police Chief Dennis Schroeder issued this statement to a local newspaper, which read in part : \"We are pleased with the decision \u2026 \u2026 We continue to strengthen our services and response efforts to prevent domestic violence and provide support to those in need.\"",
      "Dave O'Brien: I've heard people say that \u2026 no-contact orders aren't worth the paper they're written on. And in this case that was true. But I firmly believe that they are worth something, but they have to be enforced.",
      "Wendy Budde: I still, to this day, I have a lot of, um, I guess it's guilt, because I think in my mind, what if I would've went with her that day? Maybe I could have saved her. \u2026\u00a0 But part of me was so proud of her for like being as strong as she was in that time. \u2026 She \u2014 she named her killer. And so, she helped them bring him to justice.",
      "Chris Prichard's life sentence also helped bring her family some comfort, and the courage to move forward. They believe Angela would want them to make this public plea.",

      "Soon after, that's when a neighbor came across Sara's bike hidden in the bushes on the side of the road \u2013 less than a half mile from the family's home. Police were called. Around 6 p.m., New York State Police Trooper Timothy Blaise, who is now retired, arrived at the scene.",
      "Erin Moriarty: So, Tim, where was her bicycle found?",

      "\"48 Hours\" was invited by Sara and Dusty's parents, Bob and Frances Wood, to witness those early days of the investigation in hopes that the media attention would help find Sara. It would become one of the largest searches for a missing child during that time.",
      "Pastor Bob Wood (1993): The first day was the worst \u2014 the first night.",
      "Pastor Bob Wood (1993): The first night, of course, you know, I was up on the road all night \u2014 out in the woods all night. The second day I was on the road all night, watching.",
      "Bob Wood's tiny church was turned into a state police command post.",

      "Major Pylman (1993): The big thing, as far as the uniformed troopers are concerned, is the door-to-door.",
      "Major Pylman (1993): The thing that keeps everybody going is the uncertainty, not knowing whether she's dead, whether she's alive, whether she's a mile away or whether she's 120 miles away.",

      "Det. Frank Lawrence: Somebody took her we didn't know. So, when you don't know, you have to eliminate everything, every possibility and you start local.",

      "And they still had nothing despite the long hours and heavy manpower until a bitterly cold day in January 1994 \u2013 five months after Sara disappeared. Officer Timothy Blaise was working in the command center when a message came in via teletype \u2013 a device that police departments used at the time to share information.",

      "Despite the snowstorm, a Pittsfield officer spotted a truck with those three digits in its license plate sitting in a driveway in a residential area. The officer quickly called for backup.",
      "Det. Reece Treen: And they \u2026 knocked on the door and said, \"Yeah, who was driving this truck earlier?\"",
      "The homeowner told the officers a friend named Lewis Lent had borrowed the truck and he just happened to be sitting in the kitchen. When police entered the house to question Lent, he denied knowing about Becky, but willingly agreed to come down to the police station.",

      "Det. Reece Treen: They found, Rebecca's backpack. They found a gun. They found \u2026 duct tape and a clothesline rope. \u2026 basically his, his kidnapping abduction kit.",
      "Although the attempted abduction was 100 miles away in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, everyone wondered if Lent could have also taken Sara.",

      "QUESTIONING LEWIS LENT",
      "Almost 12 hours after the attempted abduction of 12-year-old Becky Savarese, New York State Police Detective Frank Lawrence struggled through a snowstorm and finally arrived at Pittsfield, Massachusetts \u2014 eager to speak to Lewis Lent. But he would have to wait his turn.",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: There's similarities, but it's a Pittsfield case, OK. \u2026 They would talk to him then \u2026 we'd get him in between.",
      "Erin Moriarty: And he was willing to talk to you?",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: Yeah. He talked to us.",
      "And during their conversations, Lawrence says he and two other New York investigators made sure Lewis Lent understood why they were there.",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: I actually showed him this poster. And I said to him, \"Lew, this is who I'm here to talk to you about.\" (points to a photo of the poster shown above) So he knew that eventually we're gonna be talking about this, OK?",
      "Erin Moriarty: How did he react? Did he \u2013",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: He, he was, he was \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0 he was flat.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Flat?",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: Yeah. He was flat to the whole thing.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did that make you think he had no idea who she was?",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: I didn't really care. \u2026 I was gonna find out. That's what we were there for.",
      "But getting Lewis Lent to admit anything was not going to be easy. Although Becky Savarese and a witness picked him out of a lineup, it took Lent until the next morning to admit he had tried to take her.",
      "Lewis Lent was arrested and charged with kidnapping and assault with a deadly weapon. But New York investigators were not done with Lent. They started to ask him questions about other missing kids.",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: We talked to him. We spent a lot of time with him.",
      "And that's when Lawrence says he and New York investigators came up with a strategy.",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: We \u2026 found out that he was religious.",
      "So, he says, they brought a Bible into the interview room.",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: That Bible sat on the table in front of him \u2026 Any time he would wander, OK, we would use the Bible and we'd go \"Lew you gotta tell the truth. And it comes from the heart and you gotta tell us the truth.\" \u2026 We would go back to the Bible.",
      "And Lawrence says the strategy appeared be working because as the hours went by, Lent started to reveal things about himself and some very disturbing plans for the future that involved kidnapping young victims.",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: He told us about his \"master plan.\" \u2026 Once he found the acceptable vulnerable individuals, he was gonna bring 'em back to his house and put 'em in, \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0I describe it as a coffin, but keep them alive. So he could use them and have them whenever he wanted them.",
      "Investigators would later find the beginning of his horrifying construction project when they searched Lent's bedroom and found a wooden partition wall. And things only got worse.",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: He wanted to talk about Jimmy Bernardo.",
      "Jimmy Bernardo was a 12-year-old boy who had gone missing three years earlier in Pittsfield. A month later, hunters would find his body. The case had stumped local investigators for years, but now Lent was about to tell everyone what had happened to Jimmy.",
      "Det. Reece Treen: He was riding his bike through a strip mall in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Lewis Lent was a janitor at the cinema center there in Pittsfield.",
      "When Jimmy stopped in front of the cinema to wait for a friend, that's when Lent said he offered him money to help him clean the movie theatre. Jimmy agreed.",
      "Det. Reece Treen: And then once Lent got him inside, he overpowered him and kidnapped him.",
      "Lent told investigators he drove Jimmy 200 miles to a rural and isolated area near his hometown of Reynoldsville, New York. Then he said he strangled Jimmy to death and left him there.",
      "Det. Reece Treen: He had details that only the killer and the police knew.",
      "As horrific as that revelation was, investigators kept pressing him about Sara Wood.",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: The more we talked about Sara, we're probing, he's responding.",
      "And then five months after she went missing, Lewis Lent finally confessed. Lent admitted that he had kidnapped, raped and then murdered Sara Anne Wood.",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: She was vulnerable. He was hunting and he found a victim.",
      "And just like Jimmy Bernardo, Lawrence says Lent's account matched details only known to investigators. Lent knew specifics about what Sara had been wearing and details about her bike that had not been made public.",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: He knew that the chain on the bike was broken. \u2026 And he also said that the bike was a little bit big for her. I didn't know that. I found out later that it was \u2026",
      "Then Lawrence says Lent drew them a map showing where he said he buried Sara's body.",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: This is just a copy, obviously. (referencing the map shown above).",
      "Erin Moriarty: Right. But this is actually what Lewis Lent did.",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: Drew. He drew that. \u2026 I handed him a piece of paper and this is what he drew.",
      "Erin Moriarty: And where did he say he put her?",
      "Det. Frank Lawrence: Off Route 28, up by Blue Mountain Lake.",
      "Blue Mountain Lake is located in a remote, woody area near Raquette Lake in New York's Adirondack Mountains. Within hours, police from all over New York state were dispatched and searched the area. Bob Wood was there, along with Dusty, who was a senior in high school.",
      "Dusty Wood: It was very cold. It was ridiculous. And it was tons of snow. \u2026 I remember a lot of help. A lot of people. (emotional)",
      "Erin Moriarty: Was this a time when you thought you might be able to bring Sara home?",
      "Dusty Wood: Yeah.",
      "For over 50 days they searched for Sara in the Adirondacks.",
      "Timothy Blaise: It was 30 below zero. We could only stay outside for 20 minutes at a time.",
      "Timothy Blaise: We were in waist high snow. We had shovels, we're digging, we're looking for any evidence at all having anything to do with Sara. \u2026 You know we were hoping somebody would come up with something, that had something to do with her. That just didn't happen.",
      "As investigators continued to look for Sara's body, Lent would face murder charges in both Massachusetts and New York.",
      "Dusty Wood: It was a rare occasion where everyone was laser focused on one event which was find Sara \u2026 bring him to justice.",
      "THE TWO SIDES OF LEWIS LENT",
      "Before Lewis Lent could be tried for Sara Wood's murder in New York, he first had to face charges in Massachusetts.",
      "In 1995, Lent went on trial and was ultimately convicted for Becky Savarese's attempted kidnapping and was sentenced to 17 to 20 years. Almost a year-and-a-half later, after taking a plea, he was given a life sentence for murdering Jimmy Bernardo.",
      "And then on June 6, 1996,\u00a0 Lent arrived at Herkimer, New York, to a media frenzy.",
      "DA Jeffrey Carpenter: The District Attorney wanted justice for Sara Anne Wood and her family.",
      "Jeffrey Carpenter is Herkimer County's District Attorney. He wasn't in office when Sara Wood was murdered, but he has studied Lewis Lent's case files. He says the DA's office thought Lent was going to plead guilty to killing Sara. But without warning, Lent changed his mind.",
      "DA Jeffrey Carpenter: It's my understanding that when he entered the courtroom, and he saw certain members of the public, especially I think her family, he decided on that day he did not want to enter a plea.",
      "Days later, Lent would change his mind again, and finally entered a guilty plea.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What do you remember of him sitting there?",
      "Dusty Wood: I couldn't believe \u2026 how small a man. You know, I couldn't believe it. Not imposing.",
      "Almost four years after Sara Wood was abducted and murdered, Lewis Lent was sentenced to 25 years-to-life. He was sent back to Massachusetts to serve the rest of his life in prison.",
      "Dusty Wood: He will never cause harm to anyone else.",
      "But it was not over for the Wood family and New York State police investigators. They still needed to find Sara.",
      "Det. Reece Treen: He changes his story so often. It's hard to \u2014 hard to tell what's the truth and what's fiction.",
      "In fact, Treen says Lent's original story that he buried her in the Raquette Lake area turned out to be a lie.",
      "Det. Reece Treen: He cashed a check on August 18th \u2026 in Pittsfield at 6:18 p.m. So he did not physically have time to abduct Sara at around 2:30 p.m. and then drive to the Adirondacks, dig a grave, bury her, and then drive back to Pittsfield \u2026 to cash a check.",
      "So, investigators continued to visit Lent in prison, hoping, that over time, he would reveal where he buried Sara \u2026 and perhaps even disclose the murders of other victims.",
      "Det. Reece Treen: I do believe that there's other ones that \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0that he is responsible for, other murders of children.",
      "Detectives Fallon and Treen say they visited Lent in prison about 20 times.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Isn't it difficult at times though \u2026 for the two of you not to just jump across the table and grab him?",
      "Det. John Fallon: No. \u2026 One of the things you have to do is you have to leave hate outside of the room when you go in.",
      "They didn't push him, but during their conversations, Lent revealed that he often suffered from blackouts and claimed he had an evil alter ego that he called \"Steven.\"",
      "Det. Reece Treen: He has this dichotomy \u2014 \u00a0this is the word he used. \u2026 He has a really good side that studies the Bible and actually was a traveling minister \u2026 but then he has this evil side. And he has these uh, uncontrollable compulsions. This is the way he put it, to do terrible things, that he could not stop.",
      "Somehow Lent managed to hide that \"evil\" side from nearly everyone he knew. Back in 1994, \"48 Hours\" correspondent Richard Schlesinger interviewed some of Lent's friends.",
      "To Phil Shallies, who is legally blind, Lent was a good Samaritan.",
      "Phil Shallies (1994): He just came over and said, \"Well, I'd be glad to give you a hand. I hear you're doing work on your foundation.\" He said, \"I'd be glad to help you out.\" We built a border all the way around. We put in probably hundreds of hours working together in that cellar. It was definitely hard work.",
      "Richard Schlesinger (1994): He \u2014 and he did that all out of the goodness of his heart?",
      "Phil Shallies (1994): Yes, he did.",
      "To Frank Colet, the dean of students at a Bible school that Lent attended, he was a gentleman.",
      "Frank Colet (1994): He was intelligent, he was unassuming, he was quiet. One thing about Lewie that everyone remembered was he always had his hand out to \u2014 to shake your hand to \u2014 when you were meeting him. And if you didn't watch out, he'd give you a big bear hug.",
      "Richard Baumann (1994): He had a lot of children with him, young kids. The kids would play video games and then they would come in and go to the movies and he would bring them home.",
      "To Richard Baumann, who employed him, Lent seemed like a mentor to children, who called Lent \"the Big Brother.\"",
      "Baumann owned the movie theater where Lent worked as a janitor for six years, and he thought he knew Lent very well.",
      "Richard Baumann (1994): I \u2014 I hired him. I worked side by side with him. (breaks down and cries)",
      "Richard Schlesinger (1994): What's \u2014 what's \u2014 tell me what's going on?",
      "Richard Baumann (1994): I just feel as though I may have missed something that he might have said or done that would have keyed me.",
      "Richard Schlesinger (1994): That would have let you know?",
      "Richard Baumann (1994): Just \u2014 just give me a clue that there was something wrong with this guy.",
      "Julia Cowley: People have trouble understanding that you can have this very religious, God-fearing, nice polite man in contrast that to his other side where he is \u2026 hunting and preying on and killing children. \u2026 those can exist in one person.",
      "Julia Cowley is a retired FBI agent and profiler who worked on cases like the Golden State Killer. She now hosts a true-crime podcast called \"Consult: Real FBI Profilers.\"",
      "Cowley has never met Lewis Lent, but at \"48 Hours\"' request, she reviewed his background and studied his confessions. She says that what appeared to be Lent's desire to help people could actually have served a selfish purpose.",
      "Ex-FBI agent says child killer is playing games with victim's family",
      "Ex-FBI agent says child killer is playing games with victim's family",
      "Julia Cowley: By helping all these people, this is a way to maybe hide who he really is, to gain people's trust. When you do that, you can manipulate them. You can control them. \u2026 It's strategically motivated as opposed to being motivated by true emotion.",
      "Just like other serial killers she has studied, Cowley says Lent is completely self-centered.",
      "Julia Cowley: His needs come before anyone else's obviously. He had no regard for his victims, he has no regard for victims' families.",
      "Something Reece Treen says he has seen firsthand.",
      "Det. Reece Treen: He knows what emotions are that other people have \u2026 but he doesn't feel them himself. \u2026 One of the things that he said in the past that is that the murders \u2026 ruined his life. \u2026 He's remorseful that he got caught, that it ruined his life, but he doesn't think in terms of it ruined anybody else's life. He just doesn't think that way.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Lewis Lent so quickly admits to kidnapping and killing \u2026 Sara Wood. Why not tell it all? Why not give all the details?",
      "Julia Cowley: It's just a secret he wants to hold onto. It's his. It's the only thing he has that's his own that he can control. \u2026 And \u2026 a bit of sadism. Knowing that family members want answers \u2026 continuing to hurt them is something I think that he feeds off of\u2026 It's \u2014 it's \u2014 there's some enjoyment in there. \u2026 most killers don't tell us everything. \u2026 They rarely give the full story.",
      "Instead, Lent reveals what he wants when he wants, on his own timetable. In 2013, he revealed something new.",
      "DA Jeffrey Carpenter: I've described it \u2026 as speaking directly to the devil. He really is the devil.",
      "FAMILY HONORS SARA ANNE WOOD",
      "As Detectives Fallon and Treen continued to question Lewis Lent about Sara Wood and other possible victims, in 2013 he made yet another confession.",
      "Det. John Fallon: He ended up admitting to uh, killing Jamie Lusher.",
      "Nine months before Sara was abducted, Jamie Lusher, a 16-year-old teen with disabilities, disappeared in Westfield, Massachusetts \u2014 \u00a0just 40 miles from the Pittsfield area,",
      "Det. Reece Treen: Again he was riding his bike um, through a parking lot of a Friendly's restaurant.",
      "His bicycle was later found in a wooded area close by. Lent told investigators that after he kidnapped and murdered Jamie, he discarded the teenager's remains in Greenwater Pond in Becket, Massachusetts.",
      "Det. John Fallon: We had divers go actually with the Massachusetts State Police divers. \u2026 and they all dove the pond. \u2026 and, uh, nothing was found.",
      "As he has done many times before, Lent would later recant his confession. Authorities decided not to charge Lent with Jamie's murder \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0hoping that one day he will lead them to his body.",
      "Det. John Fallon: At this point, we are not interested in further prosecution. \u2026 He's not going anywhere.",
      "At a press conference shortly after the confession, Jamie's sister talked about the grief she endured since her brother went missing.",
      "JENNIFER NOWAK (Jamie's sister to reporters | emotional): Anybody that knows me knows that I talk about this, I think about this every day.",
      "It's this searing heartache, in part, that keeps authorities motivated to find the missing. So, soon after Lent confessed to killing Jamie, District Attorney Jeffrey Carpenter got permission to take Lent \u2014 who was serving his life sentence in Massachusetts \u2014 out of prison and back to New York. This time they drove him around hoping he would reveal anything that would help them find Sara.",
      "DA Jeffrey Carpenter: So really what did we have to lose? \u2026 We had to do it. \u2026 We drove to the Massachusetts border. We drove to the Vermont border. He took us to where she was abducted. He took us to where he claimed he murdered her.",
      "But after three long days and over 600 miles of driving, Carpenter says, New York authorities ended the operation.",
      "DA Jeffrey Carpenter: The consensus was, he absolutely knew where she was. He just was not gonna tell us.",
      "Before Carpenter sent Lent back to Massachusetts, he recorded this conversation with him:",
      "DA JEFFREY CARPENTER: You know, we spent some time here the last couple of days. I hope you feel like you were treated with respect.",
      "LEWIS LENT: Oh, all the way.",
      "DA JEFFREY CARPENTER: Yeah. Treated well?",
      "LEWIS LENT: Yes.",
      "DA JEFFREY CARPENTER: Well that was our end of the bargain right?",
      "LEWIS LENT: Yes.",
      "DA JEFFREY CARPENTER: Right?",
      "LEWIS LENT: Yep.",
      "DA JEFFREY CARPENTER: What was your end of the bargain?",
      "LEWIS LENT: Do the very best I can to find Sara.",
      "DA JEFFREY CARPENTER: Yeah.",
      "LEWIS LENT: Yeah.",
      "DA JEFFREY CARPENTER: Is that what we've done?",
      "LEWIS LENT: That's what we've done. \u2026 \u00a0I would say that, uh, that I tried. I was absolutely sure that I knew the route but when it came down to it, I could only get partial of what I, where I actually, where I actually went.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What was going through your head when you were talking to him?",
      "DA Jeffrey Carpenter: Anger. \u2026 He does not forget details. He recalls details. He recalls many things until he wants to pretend he doesn't remember.",
      "A decade after that fruitless search, in November 2023, investigators were back out looking again \u2014 this time at the Green Mountain National Forest in Vermont after Treen identified an area with landmarks that Lent had talked about during their many conversations.",
      "Det. Reece Treen: Just too many things matched up. \u2026 A lot \u00a0\u2014 a lot, a lot of boxes were checked.",
      "What's more, search and rescue dogs taken to the area had alerted to a possible body there.",
      "Det. Reece Treen: So we were hopeful, optimistic, that we would find something there. \u2026 And we never, never found anything.",
      "But authorities kept looking. Earlier this year, detectives went back to the cellar that Lent worked in with Phil Shallies to see if they missed something in 1994. The search turned up no new evidence.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you feel in a way that you might be running out of time? Lewis Lent is in his 70s.",
      "Det. John Fallon: It's a concern. But that's one of many things we can't control.",
      "Regardless of the challenges, authorities say they will never stop looking for Sara Wood and Jamie Lusher.",
      "Dusty Wood says he chooses not to think about Lewis Lent.",
      "Dusty Wood: Every day I'm less angry because I devote my energy to positive things.",
      "Every year, Dusty and some family members participate in the Ride for Missing Children, a 78-mile bike ride that was created in Sara's honor by Bob Wood.",
      "The riders wore turquoise and pink \u2013 the colors that Sara wore when she was abducted. Riders stop at schools along the way to talk about abduction prevention.",
      "Dusty Wood: The most important thing for us as a family is to protect kids \u2026 and make sure that if there's anything that can be done to protect them from monsters like Lewis Lent, that it be done.",
      "Brother keeps his sister's legacy alive 30 years after her death",
      "Brother keeps his sister's legacy alive 30 years after her death",
      "Riders pay silent tribute to those children whose families hold out hope that they will be found alive, and to children who went missing and are never coming home \u2026 like Sara Anne Wood.",
      "Dusty Wood says he and his family are grateful to their community who have supported them since the beginning.",
      "Dusty Wood: There'll be never a way to repay the kindness, of strangers that opened up the possibility of giving the best chance to my sister.",
      "He's not sure if they will ever find his sister's body, but he is at peace.",
      "Dusty Wood: \u00a0I'm waiting for the day I see Sara in heaven. And I know that day is coming. And that makes me feel good",

      "All full-time employees with the government-funded Voice of America, the nation's largest international broadcaster, were informed Saturday that they have been placed on administrative leave, multiple sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The employees were notified in an email sent out by Crystal G. Thomas, director of human resources for the U.S. Agency of Global Affairs Media, which oversees the VOA and several other state-funded news agencies, such as Radio Free Asia.",
      "The notice was sent to all \"full-time VOA employees,\" including reporters and \"all the way up to senior managers,\" but not to contractual employees, whose contacts expire in June, a source with VOA told CBS News in a phone interview.",
      "However, a second source later told CBS News that VOA personal services contractors, who are also full-time, had received the same administrative email as federal employees. As of Saturday, all employees could not access VOA headquarters in Washington, D.C.",
      "All VOA freelancers and stringers worldwide, and those with monthly contracts or assignments, have to stop working because there is now no way to pay them, the source added.",
      "Some VOA employees were walking to their studios when they received the notice and were told \"No, go home.\"",
      "The move comes after President Trump signed an executive order late Friday that seeks to make sweeping cuts at USAGM and several other agencies, including the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Minority Business Development Agency.",

But today's action will leave Voice of America unable to carry out its vital mission. That mission is especially critical today, when America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States.\"",
      "VOA first began broadcasting in 1942 and reaches an audience of 361 million worldwide in 49 languages and some regions that are \" deeply underrepresented.\" Prior to Saturday's action, it had a total of about 2,000 employees and an annual budget of approximately $260 million.",

      "\"Abu Khadijah was one of the most important ISIS members in the entire global ISIS organization,\" said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, commander of CENTCOM, in a statement. \"We will continue to kill terrorists and dismantle their organizations that threaten our homeland and U.S., allied and partner personnel in the region and beyond.\"",
      "The announcement came on the same day as the first visit by Syria's top diplomat to Iraq, during which the two countries pledged to work together to combat the Islamic State.",
      "Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein said at a news conference that \"there are common challenges facing Syrian and Iraqi society, and especially the terrorists of IS.\" He said the officials had spoken \"in detail about the movements of ISIS, whether on the Syrian-Iraqi border, inside Syria or inside Iraq\" during the visit.",
      "Hussein referred to an operations room formed by Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon at a recent meeting in Amman to confront IS, and said it would soon begin work.",
      "The relationship between Iraq and Syria is somewhat fraught after the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Al-Sudani came to power with the support of a coalition of Iran-backed factions, and Tehran was a major backer of Assad. The current interim president of Syria, Ahmad al-Sharaa, was previously known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani and fought as an al-Qaida militant in Iraq after the U.S. invasion of 2003, and later fought against Assad's government in Syria.",
      "But Syrian interim Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani focused on the historic ties between the two countries.",
      "\"Throughout history, Baghdad and Damascus have been the capitals of the Arab and Islamic world, sharing knowledge, culture and economy,\" he said.",
      "Strengthening the partnership between the two countries \"will not only benefit our peoples, but will also contribute to the stability of the region, making us less dependent on external powers and better able to determine our own destiny,\" he said.",
      "The operation and the visit come at a time when Iraqi officials are anxious about an Islamic State resurgence in the wake of the fall of Assad in Syria.",
      "While Syria's new rulers \u2014 led by the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 have pursued Islamic State cells since taking power, some fear a breakdown in overall security that could allow the group to stage a resurgence.",
      "The U.S. and Iraq announced an agreement last year to wind down the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by September 2025, with U.S. forces departing some bases where they have stationed troops during a two-decade-long military presence in the country.",
      "When the agreement was reached to end the coalition's mission in Iraq, Iraqi political leaders said the threat of the Islamic State was under control and they no longer needed Washington's help to beat back the remaining cells.",
      "But the fall of Assad in December led some to reassess that stance, including members of the Coordination Framework, a coalition of mainly Shiite, Iran-allied political parties that brought current Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al-Sudani to power in late 2022.",

    "story": [
      "Former central banker Mark Carney was sworn in as Canada's new prime minister on Friday, and will now try to steer his country through a trade war brought by U.S. President Donald Trump, annexation threats and an expected federal election.",
      "Carney, 59, replaces Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader. Carney is widely expected to trigger a general election in the coming days or weeks.",
      "\"We will never, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the United States. America is not Canada,\" Carney said. \"We are very fundamentally a different country.\"",
      "The governing Liberal Party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war and repeatedly has said Canada should become the 51st state. Now the party and its new leader could come out on top.",
      "Carney has said he's ready to meet with Trump if he shows respect for Canadian sovereignty. He said he doesn't plan to visit Washington at the moment but hopes to have a phone call with the president soon.",
      "\"The president is a successful businessman and deal maker. We're his largest client in so many industries,\" Carney said. \"Clients expect respect and working together in a proper commercial way.\"",
      "Carney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis, and then in 2013 when he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England - helping to manage the worst impacts of Brexit in the U.K.",
      "Carney, a former Goldman Sachs executive with no experience in politics, becomes Canada's 24th prime minister. He said protecting Canadian workers and their families in the face of unjustified trade actions and growing the economy will be his top priorities.",
      "Carney said he will travel to Europe to visit French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the coming days. He received invitations from both.",
      "\"We must diversify our trade partners and strengthen our security in so doing,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products April 2. He has threatened economic coercion in his annexation threats and suggested the border is a fictional line.",
      "Carney called the idea \"crazy.\"",
      "The U.S. trade war and Trump's talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.",
      "Carney said he's worked with Trump before at G7 and G20 summits during Trump's first presidency.",
      "\"We share some experiences. I have been in the private sector. I have worked in the real estate sector. I have done large transactions,\" Carney said. \"We will both be looking out for our countries but he knows, and I know from long experience, that we can find mutual solutions that win for both.\"",
      "The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surge.",
      "But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada's next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the U.S.",
      "\"He will do very well. He's respected internationally,\" former Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien told reporters Friday. But, he added: \"There is no magic solution. This is not a normal situation. We've never seen someone who changes his mind every five minutes as president of the United States.\"",

The woman's father expects his daughter to be able to return to Canada\u00a0as early as Friday.",
      "Jasmine Mooney, a 35-year-old business consultant who appeared in several TV and movie roles including 2009's \"American Pie Presents: The Book of Love,\" was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on March 3, her mother Alexis Eagles said Wednesday on Facebook. Eagles said Mooney attempted to cross the border with her visa paperwork and a job offer from a company in the U.S. An ICE spokesperson confirmed Mooney's detainment in a statement to CBS News, saying she didn't have legal documentation to be in the U.S.",
      "Mooney was crossing the border to apply for a temporary visa known as a TN visa, which she had previously obtained successfully, according to Canadian broadcaster Global News. The TN visa is a nonimmigrant visa that allows Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the U.S. in certain professional jobs under the terms of the North American free trade pact known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Her visa was denied, and she was held at the San Ysidro border crossing in Southern California for three nights, according to Eagles. She was then transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego and held for another three nights.",
      "On Sunday, an online detainee locator system showed that Mooney had been released, according to Eagles, but 24 hours later, there was still no sign or communication from her, leaving her family and friends in a state of uncertainty and worry.",
      "\"We eventually learned that about 30 people, including Jasmine, were forcibly removed from their cells at 3:00 am and transferred to San Luis Detention Center in Arizona,\" Eagles said on Facebook. \"They are housed together in a single concrete cell with no natural light, fluorescent lights that are never turned off, no mats, no blankets, and limited bathroom facilities.\"",
      "Mooney's friend Brittany Kors told Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency suddenly informed Mooney of her visa denial and she was detained as she was in the process of booking a flight back to Canada.",
      "\"Without any warning about what was about to transpire, I was literally just taken,\" Mooney told CTV News in a phone interview from the Arizona detention facility. \"I feel like I've been kidnapped.\"",
      "On Friday, the ICE spokesperson told CBS News that Mooney was processed in accordance with one of the many executive orders President Trump signed after starting his second term. \"All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the U.S., regardless of nationality,\" the spokesperson said in the statement.",

      "In a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0on Thursday, Eagles said she purchased a plane ticket for her daughter and was waiting for ICE to approve it. She also said she was cautiously optimistic that Mooney will be home in the next couple of days.",
      "Mooney's mother said she was very concerned about her daughter's living conditions in detention. She called ICE's treatment of her daughter \"inhumane and deeply concerning.\"",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office cast doubt on the offer, accusing the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group of trying to manipulate talks underway in Qatar on the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.",
      "They did not immediately specify when the release of soldier Edan Alexander and the four bodies would occur - or what it expected to get in return.",
      "Alexander was 19 when he was abducted from his post on the border with Gaza in southern Israel during the Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023 that sparked the war.",
      "It was not clear which mediators had proposed the release to Hamas. The United States, led by the Trump administration's hostage envoy Steve Witkoff, has been pushing for a proposal that would extend the truce and see a limited number of hostage for prisoner exchanges.",
      "Following the Hamas statement, Netanyahu's office said Israel had \"accepted the Witkoff outline and showed flexibility,\" but said that \"Hamas is refusing and will not budge from its positions.\"",

      "The White House last week made a surprise announcement, saying that American officials had engaged in \"ongoing talks and discussions\" with Hamas officials, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging with the militant group.

      "The first phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza for the first time since early in the war, and hundreds of trucks of aid entered per day until Israel suspended supplies.",
      "Israel has been pressing Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for an extension of the first phase, and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.",
      "A group that represents the families of most captives said Friday that it welcomed plans to release any but that the focus must remain on returning all.",
      "\"Without a comprehensive deal, we risk sealing the fate of all remaining hostages,\" the Hostage Families Forum said in a statement.",
      "Two weeks ago, Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza and its more than 2 million people as it pressed Hamas to agree. Hamas has said that the move would affect the remaining hostages as well.",
      "Hamas claims, with support cut off to Gaza, some 80% of the population has now lost access to food sources, with aid distribution halted and markets running out of supplies, while 90% are unable to access clean drinking water.",
      "Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace.",
      "The developments came as Jews began celebrating the Purim holiday, and Muslims continued marking the holy month of Ramadan. Some 80,000 Muslim worshippers prayed Friday at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound, according to the Islamic Trust, which monitors the site.

      "Amini's death sparked months of protests and a security crackdown that killed more than 500 people and led to the detention of more than 22,000. After the mass demonstrations, police dialed down enforcement of hijab laws, but it ramped up again in April 2024 under what authorities called the Noor - or \"Light\" - Plan. At least 618 women have been arrested under the Noor Plan, the U.N. investigators said, citing a local human rights activist group in Iran.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran executed at least 938 people last year, a threefold increase from 2021, the U.N. said. While many were convicted of drug charges, the report said the executions \"indicate a nexus with the overall repression of dissent in this period.\"",
      "\"This is in line with the authorities' longstanding use of the death penalty and executions to instill fear and as a tool of political repression against dissenting voices, including protesters and minorities,\" the U.N. report said.",
      "As Iran continues its crackdown over the hijab, it also faces an economic crisis over U.S. sanctions due to its rapidly advancing nuclear program. While U.S. President Donald Trump has called for new negotiations, Iran has yet to respond to a letter he sent to its 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Social unrest, coupled with the economic woes, remain a concern for Iran's theocracy.",

      "Dr. Roger Seheult, a critical care physician, pulmonologist and associate clinical professor at the University of California and Loma Linda University schools of medicine, shared the benefits of sunlight exposure in an interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "Seheult, who recently appeared on Dr. Andrew Huberman\u2019s podcast \"Huberman Lab\" to discuss enhancing the immune system, noted that the light from the sun boosts our ability to regulate sleep, circadian rhythm and mood.",
      "BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WITH THESE 8 SIMPLE STEPS",
      "\"So many people have seasonal affective disorder, and that's a manifestation of the lack of sunlight during winter,\" he said.",
      "Children with tuberculosis were put in an outdoor solarium for periods of rest in 1946. This sanitarium accommodated 200 patients ranging from infants to 20-year-olds. (Alamy)",
      "Sunlight's healing properties",
      "As far back as the 1920s, medical professionals leveraged light exposure to promote healing.",
      "Hospitals made use of sundecks, where patients could be transported for periods of time to take in the sunlight and fresh air, according to Seheult.",
      "JUST ONE NIGHT OF POOR SLEEP COULD HAVE THESE SURPRISING HEALTH EFFECTS",
      "But with the development of penicillin and other advancements in modern medicine, doctors relied less on holistic methods, he said.",
      "The sun's ultraviolet B (UV-B) light produces vitamin D in the body by causing a chemical reaction in the skin, Seheult noted.",
      "Sunlight can boost the body's ability to regulate sleep, circadian rhythm and mood. (iStock)",
      "Vitamin D is a known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant that supports immune health, muscle and brain function, according to Mayo Clinic.",
      "The sun also produces infrared light, which has been shown to relieve pain and inflammation.",
      "Just 15 to 20 minutes of sunlight exposure can help boost the immune system and potentially even ward off chronic disease, according to Seheult.",
      "Balancing risks and benefits",
      "The warnings from medical professionals of sunlight leading to skin cancer may have caused decreased exposure, the doctor suggested.",
      "\"Certainly, if we go outside in the sun for too long for a period of time without protection, we can get those types of skin damage,\" he said.",
      "\"There are some benefits to getting out into the sun, if it's done in moderation and if it's done smartly.\"",
      "But the doctor said some recent studies have found that the more time spent outside in sunlight, the less likely people are to die of all causes, including cancer.",
      "Dr. Richard Weller, a professor of dermatology at the University of Edinburgh, published a piece in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology in August 2024, discussing this data and the need to rethink the influence of the sun.",
      "WHY THE END OF DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUR HEALTH",
      "\"UVR is a skin carcinogen, yet no studies link sun exposure to increased all-cause mortality,\" Weller wrote in the study abstract.",
      "Walking in green spaces can offer even more light exposure, as trees, leaves and plants are \"highly reflective of infrared light.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Growing evidence shows that\u00a0sunlight has health benefits through vitamin D-independent pathways, such as photomobilization of nitric oxide from cutaneous stores with reduction in cardiovascular morbidity,\" he wrote.",

      "Seheult agreed, encouraging people to \"rethink the idea that the sun is a deadly laser and that actually there are some benefits to getting out into the sun, if it's done in moderation and if it's done smartly.\"",
      "People who are fair-skinned or sensitive to sunlight can wear clothing, hats and other protective gear while still getting the benefits.",
      "\"Infrared light, because it is a long-wavelength, low-energy light, is able to penetrate not only through your skin and deep down into your body, but it's also able to penetrate very easily through clothes,\" Seheult said.",
      "Vitamin D from sunlight acts as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, helping to support immune health, muscle and brain function. (iStock)",
      "\"If they're still getting outside, they're going to get quite a bit of infrared light, even in that setting, and not be susceptible to getting [burned]. So, you don't need to have bare skin for sunlight exposure.\"",
      "Sunlight is also still present on cloudy and rainy days and in urban areas, Seheult noted.",
      "WHY HIGHER UV INDEX NUMBERS ARE MORE DANGEROUS DURING SUN EXPOSURE",
      "\"The amount of light inside a building [is] usually no more than 100 lux,\" he said. \"When you go outside on a bright, sunny day, that's 100,000 lux. That's 1,000 times brighter.\"",
      "Although that exposure will be reduced on cloudy days or in the winter, it won't be \"nearly as low\" as indoor lighting, Sehuelt added.",
      "\"Kids are spending so much more time inside,\" Seheult said. \"Any sort of movement that we make toward going outside will be very beneficial.\" (iStock)",
      "To reap the benefits of infrared light without the risk, Seheult recommended going outside and covering up for about 30 minutes, even in the morning or evening while the sun is setting.",
      "\"These are times when there is an abundance of infrared light, far more than you would get inside your home,\" he said.",
      "\"All it takes is about 15 to 20 minutes of infrared light exposure \u2026 and we're seeing effects that last for days.\"",
      "For those who work in an office and spend their daylight hours inside, Seheult suggested taking short breaks and stepping outside into the light or a green space.",

      "\"If you can incorporate strength training as the main source of your workout, you're going to see much better results overall in your everyday life.\"",
      "To counteract these changes, Neill suggested that women \"throw out\" the fitness rulebook they followed in their 20s and 30s.",
      "For people in their 40s, the focus should be more on strength training and less on cardio, according to the expert.",
      "For people in their 40s, the focus should be more on strength training and less on cardio, experts advise. (iStock)",

      "\"Right now, GSA is losing money,\" Murphy said. \"The federal buildings that they own have over $370 billion in deferred maintenance. That's a liability that is just growing and growing and growing because the buildings haven't been maintained. So getting rid of owned space that hasn't been maintained and that isn't occupied, first of all, takes that off the government's books, gets rid of that liability. But it also creates opportunities in communities. Having a building that's unoccupied isn't good for a city. It isn't good for the state. It isn't good for anyone.\"",

      "\"No taxpayer should want the government to be paying for space it doesn't use,\" Murphy said. \"It's billions of dollars a year [that] go out in rent and real estate payments from the federal government. This is a substantial amount of money, and it's a real chance for GSA to do a great job for the American people and reduce the long-term financial obligations of the government and, frankly, free up money for agencies in the short term as well.\"",

      "Senators voted 54-46 to pass the stopgap spending bill, which only needed 51 votes to be approved. Nearly all Republicans backed the measure, with only Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., opposing. All Democrats opposed it, with the exception of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, also voted to pass the bill.",

      "If a spending bill was not passed by the Friday deadline, the government would enter into a partial shutdown.",
      "During a partial government shutdown, federal agencies and non-essential services would be halted. However, government functions deemed \"essential\" would continue. National security protocols, such as border patrol, law enforcement and disaster response, stay active during shutdowns, for example.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Change-of-address scams involve some of the most seemingly harmless personal information getting into the wrong hands. This can lead to a whole host of problems, including financial losses and identity theft, although change-of-address fraud is technically a form of identity theft.",
      "This kind of fraud involves a scammer impersonating you to request a change of address with the United States Postal Service (USPS).",
      "Once they have your mail redirected to an address they control, they can go through it at their leisure, looking for mail they can steal and information they can use to perpetrate further scams, like taking out loans or credit cards in your name or using your identity to defraud others.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW",
      "USPS delivery truck\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Here\u2019s how it works, step by step",
      "This detailed breakdown explains the process of a change-of-address scam, from initial targeting to the potential consequences and warning signs to watch for.",
      "A person with criminal intent gets your postal address and full name, something that\u2019s most easily done using a so-called people search site. People search sites, also known as people finder sites, are a kind of data broker that specializes in collecting, organizing and selling access to personal information.",
      "The scammer then mails a change-of-address request to the USPS, providing your name and a new address he has access to. The\u00a0online change-of-address form is generally more secure, requiring confirmation via a bank account. That\u2019s why scammers will almost always mail in the request.",
      "The form requires a signature, but this is unlikely to be verified when processing the request. So, the scammer will either find an image of your signature somewhere, steal a document that includes your signature or simply sign your name any which way.",
      "Now that they\u2019ve redirected your mail straight into their hands, the scammer just has to patiently wait for sensitive mail to arrive. They\u2019re on the lookout for anything they can use to steal from you or defraud you. Bank statements, tax documents, checks and even your household bills can be used to commit further acts of fraud and identity theft.",
      "One of the scariest things a scammer can do once he has enough of your personal information is to commit deed fraud, otherwise known as\u00a0home title theft. You\u2019re far from helpless, though. There are telltale signs that you can watch for to catch change-of-address scams early.",
      "The most obvious sign to watch for is a sudden and persistent drop in the amount of mail entering your mailbox. This only applies to mail addressed to you by name. Mail delivered to your address without an addressee, including mail addressed to \"homeowner\" or \"occupant,\" won\u2019t be affected by a change-of-address scam.",
      "The other major things to keep an eye on are your credit report, credit card statements and bank statements. You can request a free credit report from one of the three credit bureaus once per year.",

This includes the mail you were expecting, any communication with the senders of the missed mail (such as confirming dispatch dates), suspicious phone calls, texts or emails, and any unusual activity in your online accounts, bank accounts or credit reports.Reach out to the USPS for help: Use the\u00a0online locator to find and contact your local U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) office.

      "1. Invest in personal data removal services: Have your personal information removed from data broker databases, including people search sites. They\u2019re the first port of call for many scammers. Without these companies in the mix, scammers aren\u2019t likely to come across your address in the first place.",
      "A reputable personal information removal service can take your data down from hundreds of sites and keep it off by resending removal requests, even as data brokers try to add your information to their databases.",

      "2. Reduce the amount of sensitive mail in your mailbox: Start by switching to paperless options wherever available. This will dramatically reduce the amount of sensitive mail heading to your mailbox, leaving criminals with little value to steal. Check your mail daily, as soon as possible after it\u2019s delivered. Get someone to do this for you if you\u2019re away. Some redirection scams start with mail being stolen from your mailbox. Definitely avoid allowing your mailbox to overflow.",

      "3. Secure your mailbox: Consider upgrading to a\u00a0locked mailbox\u00a0to prevent mail theft. If you live in an area prone to mail theft, this simple step can stop criminals from intercepting sensitive documents before they even reach you.",
      "4. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. Set up USPS Informed Delivery: Enroll in\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery, a free service that lets you preview images of incoming mail before it arrives. This can help you spot missing mail early and identify potential issues with mail redirection.",
      "6. Report suspicious activity immediately: If you notice anything unusual, such as missing mail or unauthorized changes to your accounts, report it right away. Contact the USPS, your bank and the Federal Trade Commission to ensure the issue is documented and addressed promptly.",

      "6. Consider using a personal data removal service: Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure to smishing attacks by removing your sensitive information \u2014 like phone numbers, addresses and email details \u2014 from data broker websites. Scammers often rely on these publicly available databases to target victims with personalized phishing texts. These services aren\u2019t foolproof, but they can make it harder for cybercriminals to find and exploit your information.

      "These innovative devices promise to make roads safer and operations more efficient, but they also raise some important questions about privacy.",

      "The promise of AI dashcams",
      "AI dashcams are transforming road safety and fleet management through advanced computer vision technology. These smart devices, equipped with both inward- and outward-facing cameras, can detect a wide range of unsafe driving behaviors.",
      "The outward-facing cameras are capable of detecting rolling stops, unsafe lane changes and potential collisions, while the inward-facing cameras monitor driver drowsiness, distraction, seatbelt violations and smoking. The accuracy of these systems is impressive, with detection rates ranging from 88% to 99.5% and false positives as low as 0.5% to 12%.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "FusionSite Services, a waste management provider, installed\u00a0Motive's AI dashcam system across their 800-unit fleet, resulting in a significant reduction in accidents and unsafe behaviors.

      "BIG RIGS DELIVER CARGO WITH NO HUMANS AT THE WHEEL",
      "Privacy concerns",
      "Despite the safety benefits, the installation of AI dashcams raises significant privacy issues. Many truck drivers view their vehicles as second homes, especially long-haul drivers who spend extended periods on the road. The constant presence of cameras in their workspace raises concerns about perceived invasion of privacy in personal space, fear of constant surveillance and micromanagement and worries about data security and potential misuse of collected information.",
      "The use of outward-facing cameras also affects the privacy of other road users because they may record private citizens without consent. There is a risk of data breaches exposing personal information or location data and concerns about how footage might be used or shared. These concerns underscore the need for careful consideration of privacy rights when deploying such technology.",
      "To address some of these privacy concerns, Motive has implemented features such as Driver Privacy Mode, which allows drivers to disable the driver-facing camera while off duty. Additionally, Motive's AI dashcam system includes privacy controls and the option to activate Driver Privacy Mode for individual drivers, groups or entire fleets. Motive's AI dash cam also incorporates blurring technology to protect the privacy of individuals captured in the footage, further addressing concerns about recording private citizens without consent.",

In some jurisdictions, like California, the use of such cameras is not considered a violation of state laws. However, in Illinois, a lawsuit has been filed against Samsara, alleging violations of the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) for capturing and storing drivers' facial scans without proper consent.

Cameras should only record during specific events rather than continuously, and robust data security measures must be established to prevent breaches and misuse.",
      "Providing comprehensive training to drivers on the purpose and benefits of the technology is also crucial. Open communication and trust between management and drivers are essential for fostering a positive environment where both safety and privacy are respected.",
      "As reported by\u00a0The Trucker, an authority on all things in the trucking and freight industry, \"Truck drivers are not much different than the rest of us in our desire to adapt to technological advances. At first, they don't want to, and some may go as far as getting out of the business. Eventually, like many of us, once we do adapt to the changing landscape, it soon becomes second nature.\u00a0However, a driver-facing camera may be too much of an invasion of personal privacy.\"",

      "This vulnerability resides in WebKit, the open-source browser engine that powers Safari, Mail, App Store and other apps on Apple devices. The flaw is an out-of-bounds write issue, which allows attackers to use maliciously crafted web content to bypass the Web Content sandbox, a key security layer that isolates web content from accessing sensitive system resources.

    "summary": "Kurt the CyberGuy explains how to protect yourself from malicious Chrome extensions that can steal sensitive information like password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy explains how to increase your security and privacy through Google Chrome on your devices when browsing the web.",
      "Chrome extensions are incredibly useful, whether you want to block ads, track the best deals or\u00a0enhance your browsing experience. They can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store, which functions like the Play Store but for extensions. However, extensions are easier to mimic and turn into malicious software compared to apps.",
      "As we just reported, over 3.2 million users were victimized by a security breach tied to\u00a016 malicious browser extensions, highlighting how attackers exploit tools that seem legitimate to spread malware or steal sensitive data.",
      "Now, security researchers have discovered a polymorphic attack that allows malicious Chrome extensions to transform into other browser extensions, including password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information.",
      "Keep reading to learn how this attack works and how to protect yourself from it.",

      "Chrome browser on smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the malicious polymorphic attack works",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0SquareX Labs have found a new attack that lets malicious Chrome extensions disguise themselves as legitimate ones, like password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information. This \"polymorphic\" attack takes advantage of Chrome\u2019s extension system to trick users while staying under the radar.",
      "The attack starts with hackers uploading what looks like a harmless extension to the Chrome Web Store. It might even have real features, like an AI-powered marketing tool, to convince users to install and pin it to their browser.",
      "Once installed, the malicious extension scans the victim\u2019s browser for other extensions. It can do this in two ways. If it has permission to use the \"chrome.management\" API, it grabs a list of installed extensions directly. If not, it injects code into web pages to check for unique files or resources tied to certain extensions.",
      "If it finds a targeted extension, like 1Password, the malicious extension reports back to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker then tells it to impersonate the real extension by disabling it if permissions allow, changing its name and icon and displaying a fake login popup that looks just like the real thing.",
      "Fake extension page (SquareX)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Social engineering makes things worse",
      "To steal user credentials, the malicious extension triggers a fake \"Session Expired\" prompt when the victim tries to log in to a website. This tricks them into thinking they need to reenter their credentials for their password manager or banking app. When they do, the stolen data is sent straight to the attackers.",
      "After collecting the credentials, the extension switches back to its original form. It restores the legitimate extension, making everything look normal so the victim doesn\u2019t suspect anything. This shows just how dangerous malicious Chrome extensions can be and why stronger security measures are needed to protect users.",
      "We reached out to Google, and a spokesperson told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"We appreciate the work of the research community and we've received the report. We are constantly investing in ways to improve the security of the Chrome Web Store, and we take appropriate action when we learn of emerging threats.\"",

      "5 ways you can protect your personal data",
      "Here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser; don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the extension and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: If your personal data gets stolen by the extension, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The malicious extension highlights that Google isn\u2019t doing enough to keep malware off its platform. Security researchers pointed out that the Chrome Web Store lacks protections against these types of attacks, such as blocking sudden changes to an extension\u2019s icon or HTML, or at least alerting users when such changes occur. The problem isn\u2019t limited to the Chrome Web Store. The Play Store also hosts malicious apps from time to time, affecting millions of users. Google needs to step up its security efforts and put user privacy front and center.",

      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. Antivirus software can help detect and prevent infostealer malware infections. Be sure to perform regular scans to identify and remove potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware potentially accessing your private information is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Use virtual cards for online payments: Instead of using your actual bank card, generate virtual cards through your bank or a service like Privacy.com. These temporary cards limit exposure in case of a data breach.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Enable transaction alerts and spending limits:\u00a0Set up real-time alerts for transactions and daily spending limits on your cards. This way, you\u2019ll be notified immediately of any unauthorized activity.",
      "4. Never store card details in browsers:\u00a0Infostealers target autofill data in Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Always deny the pop-up that asks to \"save payment info\" and use a secure password manager instead. You may also want to take advantage of additional digital security measures such as\u00a0two-factor authentication. Newer types of authentication, such as Face ID and Touch ID, are slowly replacing passwords as a legitimate means to grant a person access to sensitive financial information.",
      "5. Be smart about passwords: Simply employing all the password rules won\u2019t prevent a breach, but since you don\u2019t know exactly what information thieves are looking for, it can\u2019t hurt. You should use strong passwords and change them frequently. I recommend using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Infostealers are a major threat to everyone online, and they are also quite common. However, since this malware often disguises itself as legitimate apps or uses social engineering tricks, it\u2019s easy to get fooled. Even the most cautious individuals can fall victim to a well-executed campaign. The best way to stay safe is to exercise caution when browsing online, downloading apps or making online transactions. Using tools like a password manager and antivirus software can also help enhance security and make your life easier.",

      "SpyLoan apps are everywhere and\u00a0yet people keep falling for them. They promise easy loans with flexible repayment, but what they actually do is steal your personal data, including contacts, sensitive images and files. The moment you take a loan, they start blackmailing you using your own data against you.",
      "Some of these apps do not even bother giving loans. They just grab your data and start the harassment. One such app has been making the rounds on the Play Store, racking up more than 100,000 downloads and putting thousands of Android users at risk of blackmail and extortion.",

      "SpyLend spread by posing as a credible financial management tool, \"Finance Simplified,\" on the Google Play Store, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. It attracted financially vulnerable individuals by offering fast loans with minimal documentation.",
      "The app surged from 50,000 to 100,000 downloads in a single week despite red flags in user reviews about harassment and blackmail.",
      "Once downloaded, the app requested excessive permissions far beyond what a typical financial app would need, including access to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, photos and location data. This allowed the malware to silently collect personal information from users' devices.",
      "The stolen data fueled a vicious cycle of scams and extortion. SpyLoan apps like SpyLend lure users with attractive loan terms, only to exploit their data for predatory lending practices. If users fail to meet repayment demands, the operators weaponize their information by harassing them, blackmailing them with threats of leaking private photos or contacting their friends and family, and creating a climate of fear and coercion.",
      "In some cases, the extortion escalated to public shaming or even deepfake creation using stolen images, amplifying the psychological and financial toll on victims.",
      "We reached out about this incident, and a Google spokesperson told us, \"The app has been removed from Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by\u00a0Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services.

However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "4) Review app permissions carefully: If an app asks for unnecessary permissions, like access to your contacts, call logs or storage, do not install it. A legitimate loan app should only require essential permissions related to financial transactions.",
      "5) Check reviews and red flags: Before installing any financial app, read user reviews carefully. If multiple people report harassment, blackmail or excessive permissions, avoid the app entirely.",
      "6) Report and uninstall suspicious apps: If you encounter a SpyLoan app, immediately\u00a0uninstall it and revoke its permissions. Report it to the Google Play Store, cybersecurity authorities and financial regulators to help prevent further victims.",
      "If you\u2019ve shared sensitive information, consider changing passwords and securing your accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The promise of quick and easy money can be tempting, especially during tough times, making it easy to fall for these scams. However, there are safer and more reliable ways to take loans. As a general rule, it is best to avoid borrowing money through online apps unless they are from well-known financial institutions. Google also needs to take responsibility for allowing SpyLoan apps on the Play Store, even when user reviews clearly indicate they are malicious.",

      "Clone Robotics, a Polish-American company, has recently unveiled its groundbreaking humanoid robot, Protoclone, sparking both fascination and unease across the internet. This eerily lifelike android represents a significant advancement in biomimetic robotics, closely replicating human anatomy and movement in ways never before seen.",
      "With its unsettlingly realistic movements, Protoclone is pushing the boundaries of what we expect from robots, raising both intrigue and questions about the future of robotics.",

      "The anatomy of this robot",
      "Protoclone stands at an impressive 6 feet tall and boasts a skeleton made of 206 polymer bones, mirroring the human skeletal structure. What truly sets this robot apart is its muscular system, featuring over 1,000 artificial muscles powered by\u00a0Clone Robotics' proprietary \"Myofiber\" technology.",

When hydraulic fluid is pumped into the balloon, it expands, causing the mesh to contract, much like a human muscle. This system is powered by a 500-watt electric pump, Protoclone's mechanical \"heart,\" capable of circulating fluid at a rate of 40 liters per minute.",

      "Clothier said the plan for \"Walmart Washes\" that he came up with last month had the backing of store managers at the Walmart in Grand Blanc Township. Walmart headquarters in Arkansas supported the idea but said the car wash could not be offered on store property, so the judge believed he could just find an alternative location for the car wash, which he wanted to take place in the spring.",

      "South Carolina has scheduled the execution of an inmate convicted of fatally shooting an off-duty police officer, which would make him the fifth person the state put to death since it resumed executions in the fall following an involuntary 13-year pause.",
      "Mikal Mahdi, 41, is set to be executed on April 11 at 6 p.m. at a prison in Columbia, the state Supreme Court announced Friday.",
      "Mahdi can choose to die by lethal injection, the electric chair or a firing squad. He must make a decision by March 28, or he will be killed by the electric chair.",
      "On March 7, Brad Sigmon became the first prisoner executed by firing squad in the U.S. in 15 years when he was killed in South Carolina. Only three other inmates in the U.S. have been executed by this method since 1976, and all were in Utah.",
      "CONVICTED DOUBLE MURDERER EXECUTED BY FIRING SQUAD IN SOUTH CAROLINA",
      "Mikal Mahdi, 41, is set to be executed on April 11 at 6 p.m. at a prison in Columbia. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP)",
      "Three other prisoners have been put to death in South Carolina since the state resumed executions in September. Freddie Owens on Sept. 20, Richard Moore on Nov. 1 and Marion Bowman Jr. on Jan. 31 all died by lethal injection. Sigmon chose the firing squad due to concerns about the prolonged suffering the three other inmates had faced when they were killed by lethal injection.",
      "The court postponed a potential sixth execution for Steven Bixby, who was convicted in the killing of two police officers in an Abbeville County land dispute in December 2003. Bixby was set to be put to death in May, but the court ruled that a judge must first determine if he is mentally competent.",
      "A psychologist said Bixby understands what led to his death sentence, but that he also believes blood found on his clothes the night of the killings contains the DNA of Jesus Christ.",
      "Mahdi's attorney, David Weiss, said his client had a long history of troubled behavior starting as a child.",
      "As early as the second grade, Mahdi suffered from mental despair and discussed self-harm, Weiss said. He already had a criminal record by the time he was a teenager, spending weeks in solitary confinement after being convicted of breaking and entering and attacking a police officer in Virginia.",
      "\"He was repeatedly failed by his own family and the justice system, who neglected to see him for who he was: a wounded child in need of support,\" Weiss said in a statement. \"Mikal\u2019s story is one of trauma, neglect, and the many missed opportunities for providing him the safety and compassion that every child should have.\"",
      "Mahdi stole a gun and a car in Virginia on July 14, 2004, when he was 21, arrest records show. The next day, he shot and killed a North Carolina store clerk as the clerk was checking his identification. A couple of days later, he carjacked someone at an intersection in Columbia, South Carolina.",
      "On July 18, 2004, while on the run after those crimes, Mahdi hid in Orangeburg, South Carolina, public safety officer James Myers' shed. Mahdi ambushed Meyers when the officer returned from a birthday celebration for his wife, sister and daughter, prosecutors said.",
      "The potential sixth execution for Steven Bixby, who was convicted in the killing of two police officers in 2003, has been postponed. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP)",
      "Myers, 56, was shot eight or nine times, including twice in the head after falling to the ground. A pathologist testified that at least seven of the shots would have been fatal.",
      "Mahdi then set Myers' body on fire and ran away. Myers' wife discovered her husband's dead body in the shed, which they had used for the backdrop of their wedding.",
      "On July 21, 2004, Mahdi was taken into custody in Florida. When one of the officers involved in his arrest learned what he was wanted for in South Carolina, he thanked Mahdi for not shooting at him. Mahdi told him that the only reason he did not was because he was skeptical that he could successfully shoot two officers and their K-9 and get away with it.",
      "While behind bars, Mahdi was caught three times with tools he could have used to escape. One was an Allen wrench and the others were homemade handcuff keys, including one that was found under his tongue at his trial.",
      "On death row, Mahdi stabbed a guard and struck another worker with a concrete block. On three occasions, prison staff found sharpened metal in his cell that could be used as a knife.",
      "During his trial, Mahdi\u2019s lawyers said their client was the second son of a woman who was wedded in an arranged marriage at 16-years-old. His family described a chaotic childhood, although nobody testified about abuse or mental illness.",
      "Mahdi pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced by Judge Clifton Newman, who at the time told The Post and Courier that he was not sure he believed in the death penalty, but the case became bigger than his beliefs.",
      "SOUTH CAROLINA SCHEDULING EXECUTIONS AGAIN AFTER A PAUSE FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "This photo provided by the South Carolina Department of Corrections shows the state's death chamber in Columbia, South Carolina, including the electric chair, right, and a firing squad chair, left. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP)",
      "\"My challenge and my commitment throughout my judicial career has been to temper justice with mercy and to seek to find the humanity in every defendant that I sentence,\" Newman said as he handed down Mahdi\u2019s punishment. \"That sense of humanity seems not to exist in Mikal Deen Mahdi\"",
      "Once one of the busiest for executions, South Carolina resumed executions in September after a 13-year pause caused in part by the state having difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs due to pharmaceutical companies' concerns that they would have to disclose they had sold the drugs to state officials.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The state legislature then passed a shield law allowing officials to keep lethal injection drug suppliers private. The legislature also approved the firing squad as another execution method over difficulties obtaining the drugs.",
      "South Carolina has executed 47 inmates since the death penalty was resumed in the U.S. in 1976. In the early 2000s, the state was carrying out an average of three executions per year. Only nine states have killed more inmates.",

    "story": [
      "In an exclusive interview with Fox News, former Israeli hostage Tal Shoham describes the first moments of being captured by Hamas terrorists.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: After surviving nearly a year and a half deep underground, with barely enough air to breathe and no light, and sharing an 18-square-foot space with three other men, recently released hostage Tal Shoham shared with Fox News Digital his harrowing story of captivity at the hands of Hamas.",
      "Shoham was forcibly taken from Kibbutz Be\u2019eri on\u00a0October 7, 2023. His wife and children, ages four and eight, were also kidnapped that day, but he didn\u2019t know that when he was thrown into the trunk of a car and driven into Gaza by Hamas terrorists. He didn\u2019t even know whether his family was alive; hoping to save them, he surrendered to the terrorists just before they set fire to the house where his family was hiding.",
      "He would spend the eight-and-a-half months in an underground tunnel and another five months captive in five different houses deep inside Gaza, where his captors kept him shackled, starved him and deprived him of basic human comforts.",
      "REMAINS OF SHIRI BIBAS, MOM OF TWO KILLED, ALLEGEDLY RETURNED TO ISRAEL FOLLOWING HAMAS' BROKEN PROMISE",
      "Tal Shoham sitting next to his wife, Adi, as he holds up a poster of his two friends, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, who are still hostages in Gaza.\u00a0 (Georges Schneider)",
      "But he gave himself a mission: He was determined not to lose his humanity. Even in moments when he feared that he was facing death, he tried to stay focused. \"I am not a victim. Even if this ends, I will end it with my head high, looking death in the eyes. They won\u2019t break me, and I will not surrender to self-pity. We are stronger than the other side,\" he said.",
      "It has been three weeks since he came home, and he is ready to speak. Kibbutz Be\u2019eri is just nine kilometers \u2014 about five-and-a-half miles \u2014\u00a0from Gaza, but that short distance is practically an ocean between what he describes as two worlds. \"Half-an-hour\u2019s drive, two separate worlds,\" he said. \"The first \u2014 unbelievably surreal, cruel beyond reason. And just 30 minutes away [on this side of the border], a world of sanity, logic, dignity and compassion.\"",
      "He remembers every detail of his 505 days in captivity. Tal wants to tell his story for the sake of the two fellow captives\u00a0who remain behind, starving, abused and at constant risk of death. \"Just as someone emerges from a womb alive, I emerged from the tunnel I was held in and was born again,\" he says. But the men he calls his \"brothers,\" Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, are still held underground. \"I can\u2019t sleep at night knowing they are still there,\" he says.",

      "Tal and his wife and children had come from the north of Israel to Kibbutz Be\u2019eri to spend the Simchat Torah holiday with his wife\u2019s parents and were in the home when the terror attack began. He said everyone entered the safe room, and as the sounds of gunfire drew closer, they tried to barricade themselves inside. But the terrorists pried open the window, and Tal feared they might toss in a grenade if the family did not surrender. On the same street, the terrorists set fire to every other home, burning the people inside alive.",
      "\"I went out and raised my hands,\" he said. \"A man with murder in his eyes led me onto the road and to a vehicle. I saw about 40 heavily armed terrorists. Some of them were filming me on their phones. I was in shock \u2014 there was an entire battalion of Hamas terrorists inside our kibbutz, bodies of people I knew who were murdered on the ground, and they are laughing, unafraid.\"",

      "Former Israeli hostage Tal Shoham standing in the destroyed house of his in-laws on Kibbutz Be'eri. (Georges Schneider)",
      "The terrorists threw him into the trunk of a car and drove him across the border, into Gaza. There, a crowd gathered. \"Teenagers with sticks ran toward me, trying to beat me from all sides,\" he says. Taking him from the car, his captors pointed a rifle at him, ready, he believed, to execute him, and tried to force him to kneel. \"I said, \u2018I can\u2019t control whether you kill me or not,\u2019 and I raised my hands \u2014 but I refused to kneel. \u2018If you want to kill me, kill me, but you will not execute me like ISIS.\u2019\"",
      "He was then paraded through the streets in what he described as a \"victory march.\" \"They were shouting, \u2018Soldier! Pig! Zionist!\u2019 A mob gathered around, boys with wooden clubs trying to hit me. But I just waved and smiled. I didn\u2019t show fear. \u2018You\u2019ve captured me, but you won\u2019t see terror in my eyes.\u2019\"",
      "He was first taken to the home of a family, where he was held, alone and always shackled, for 34 days. Though he was allowed to periodically shower, the captivity was otherwise severe.",
      "His food was strictly rationed. \"For the first three days, I had pita bread. Then, they stopped giving me that,\" he says. \"Food supplies dwindled. Some days, I would receive three spoons of avocado and three dates, or half an orange from a tree in the yard.\"",
      "But the worst torment was not knowing whether his family was alive. \"I am 40 years old. Never in my life have I experienced suffering like this. The isolation, being alone with relentless thoughts \u2014that was worse than even extreme hunger.\"",
      "To endure, he made a heartbreaking decision. \"I had to accept that my family was dead,\" Tal says. \"I sat on the floor and imagined myself at their funeral. I stood in front of a grave \u2014 one large for my wife, and two small for my children \u2014 and I eulogized each of them. I thanked them for the time we had. I told them to move on. I sobbed but didn\u2019t let my captors see me cry. That was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done \u2014 burying my family in my mind.\"",

      "Tal Shoham stands in the burned-out house of his in-laws in Kibbutz Be'eri.\u00a0 (Georges Schneider)",
      "On the 34th day of his captivity, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal were brought to the home. The Hamas terrorists tortured them daily, hitting them, denying them food while eating in front of them. The hostages were allowed only about 300 calories a day \u2014 Shoham's weight dropped from 174 pounds to 110 pounds when he was released \u2014 and speaking was forbidden. \"We couldn\u2019t move from our beds or talk. We whispered everything,\" he said.",
      "Then came some glimmer of hope. On the 50th day of his captivity, Tal received proof of life from his wife \u2014 a letter telling him she and the children had been held hostage but were being released. \"I read it, my hands shaking,\" he said. \"The most important thing had happened \u2014 my family was safe. I didn\u2019t need to be a father and husband protecting them anymore. Now, I could focus on my war, the one I knew how to fight, the one for survival.\"",
      "Evyatar David is still being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas terrorists.\u00a0 (Courtesy: Bring Them Home Now)",
      "The Tunnel",
      "By June 2024, Tal, Guy and Evyatar were moved by an ambulance\u00a0that Hamas used\u00a0for discreetly transporting hostages, to an underground tunnel, where there already was another captive, Omer Wenkert. There were four mattresses on the floor and a hole in the ground for a toilet. The space was illuminated by a single, dim lightbulb. \"It took me weeks to stop feeling like the walls were closing in, to adapt to the oxygen deprivation,\" Tal says.",
      "They were given just 300 milliliters of water a day \u2014 a little more than 10 ounces. They could use it to either drink or wash their hands. Rice was all they had to eat. Months passed. They were beaten, monitored by cameras, randomly deprived of food and sleep. The guards were Hamas tunnel diggers \u2014 digging every day, even as war raged above. \"Hamas never stopped digging tunnels,\" Tal Says. \"Not for a single day.\"",
      "The conditions were so bad that both he and Evyatar developed severe infections. But it would be months before a doctor would come to see them. \"My leg turned blue, yellow, and purple with internal bleeding,\" He recalls. \"They gave us all blood thinners, fearing we might develop clots from prolonged immobility. Eventually, they realized the issue was malnutrition and provided us with vitamin supplements for seven days. It tasted like dog food, but it dramatically improved our condition.\"",
      "ISRAEL SAYS HAMAS SENT A TODDLER TO A MILITARY OUTPOST",
      "Guy Gilboa-Dalal is still being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists. \u00a0 (Courtesy: Bring Them Home Now)",
      "But the abuse continued. A new guard arrived, even more violent than the previous ones. \"He made some of us kneel like dogs and beat us,\" he says. \"He would come in screaming that we were filthy Jews, hit us, and then 10 minutes later, he would smile and bring food.\"",
      "Then, what seemed like a miracle. Tal and Omer were named as part of the\u00a0hostage-release deal\u00a0in February. When he was led outside after many months underground, still blindfolded, he felt moisture on his face. \"Is it rain?\" he asked. \"No,\" his captors responded, \"\u2019It is dew.\u2019 And I realized, my name, Tal, is \u2018dew\u2019 in Hebrew. I felt the morning dew on my skin.\"",
      "There were humiliations to come before he was handed over to the Red Cross and returned to Israel: a procession on a stage in the heart of Rafah where he was forced to repeat Hamas propaganda.\u00a0 But he said he didn\u2019t care \u2014 he was going home. When he arrived in Israel, he was taken to the Re\u2019im base, where his wife, Adi, and their two children, Nave and Yahel, were waiting for him. \"It was a dream come true, yet it still felt like a dream,\" Tal says. \"It took a few days to fully grasp that it was real. It was hard to take in. The emotions flooded me, like I was floating above everything.\"",
      "And there was tragic news to absorb. Eleven members of Tal\u2019s family were kidnapped or murdered on October 7. Adi\u2019s father, Avshalom Haran, and two uncles, Lilach and Evyatar Kipnis, were killed. His mother-in-law, Shoshan Haran, was taken, along with two other relatives \u2014 Sharon Avigdori and her daughter, Noam Avigdori \u2014 who were later released in the first hostage deal. Two other relatives who had come from the United States to celebrate a birthday, 59-year-old Judith Raanan, and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie, were also kidnapped from Kibbutz Nahal Oz.",

      "And there was joy. During his captivity, four new babies were born into the family. \"Among us, the Jewish hostages, there was purity,\" he said. \"There was dignity. The terrorists brought in whatever horrors they wanted, inflicted whatever cruelty and pain they could, imposed their inhumanity on us. But within our space, we preserved our inner cleanliness, our humanity between one another. And that was crucial to making it out unbroken.\"",

      "One of President Donald Trump\u2019s first actions upon entering the White House was to order federal employees to return to the office.",
      "The government workforce, he has repeatedly contended, could not be productive from home.",
      "\u201cI happen to be a believer that you have to go to work. I don\u2019t think you can work from home,\u201d Trump said on Feb. 11. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to work from home, they\u2019re going to be going out, they\u2019re going to play tennis, they\u2019re going to play golf. They\u2019re going to do a lot of things. They\u2019re not working.\u201d",
      "Three days later, Trump traveled to his sprawling Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach, where he remained for parts of six consecutive days, according to an NBC News tracker. On one of the days, Trump signed two executive orders and a memorandum. He also held an impromptu press conference.",
      "In other words, he worked from home.",
      "That weekend, he did what he accused federal workers of doing: He went golfing. Between Feb. 14 and Feb. 19, he golfed on four different days.\u00a0While he is far from the first president to do so, each golfing trip is a cost to taxpayers.",
      "Before that, Trump hosted Republican senators at Mar-a-Lago in early February, where he delivered remarks including an update on his administration\u2019s cost-cutting efforts.",
      "Some federal workers said Trump\u2019s frequent trips to his luxury estate in Florida \u2014 racking up millions of dollars in security and transportation costs \u2014 while ordering millions of government employees back to the office, reeked of hypocrisy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear and should be to the rest of Americans that it\u2019s never about \u2018the rule,\u2019 it\u2019s about who\u2019s making the rules,\u201d said a federal employee with the Department of Education who is also a disabled veteran. \u201cThis all fits in so perfectly to the power dynamics installed by this administration \u2014 a dynamic where Trump does what he wants, to who he wants, without repercussions.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe return-to-office mandate was never about effectiveness, collaboration or cohesion,\u201d the employee added. \u201cIt was always about federal employees being \u2018traumatically affected,\u2019 as Russell Vought put it.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment.",
      "Vought was a principal author of Project 2025, which came up frequently in the 2024 presidential election. Among the many tenets in the vast conservative governing blueprint is a call to significantly shrink the workforce and expand presidential power, both of which are playing out as central thrusts of the Trump administration so far. Trump has empowered billionaire Elon Musk, his biggest donor who is also a defense contractor, to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to root out what it deems wasteful and unnecessary spending.",
      "Trump and Musk have said the federal government is bloated, and the administration has slashed tens of thousands of federal jobs already. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s agenda would add trillions of dollars to the federal debt, budget experts say.",
      "At the same time, Trump has hit the links 14 times to date in his second term, with a potential for more rounds expected in the immediate future. Just since January, the cost of Trump\u2019s golf weekends to taxpayers is more than $18 million, according to one analysis.",
      "Trump has spent five of his seven weekends as president at Mar-a-Lago, and during a sixth, he overnighted at another Trump property in Miami. This Friday, according to a Federal Aviation Administration notice, the president was back at Mar-a-Lago, where he\u2019s expected to remain until Sunday evening. His motorcade was heading to his golf club Saturday afternoon. That would then be the seventh of eight weekends that he would spend entirely or partly away from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.",
      "At the same time, since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump and Musk have regularly denigrated the federal workforce as lazy and emblematic of waste and fraud.",
      "\u201cI feel very badly, but many of them don\u2019t work at all,\u201d Trump said of fired federal workers on Wednesday while providing no basis for those comments. \u201cMany of them never showed up to work. That\u2019s not good.\u201d",
      "A\u00a0report compiled by the White House budget office\u00a0said that as of May 2024, 54% of the 2.28 million-strong civilian federal workforce worked in person, while 46.4% were eligible to work remotely. The report said 10% of civilian personnel actually worked in remote-only positions.",
      "One Health and Human Services employee panned Trump\u2019s comments as false and argued that critics of federal workers don\u2019t realize that the public is actually getting more work from employees who are based at home and not having to spend time commuting. She also called Trump\u2019s frequent trips to Mar-a-Lago \u201ca bad look\u201d when considering he says he wants to send a message about saving taxpayer money.",
      "Another jabbed at Musk\u2019s negative comments toward federal workers in light of a Politico report that, at Musk\u2019s request, a \u201cmassive TV\u201d was installed in the billionaire\u2019s office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building so he could play video games.",
      "\u201cI personally work my a-- off. I know everyone else is. I routinely work 50 to 60 hours a week,\u201d and longer whenever needed, the HHS employee said. \u201cWho is going to do all this work when they\u2019re done with these cuts? Do people think that the public won\u2019t be affected?\u201d",
      "Another worker told of colleagues attempting to quickly sell their homes to move closer to a train stop, while others were struggling to find extended hours of day care to cover the extra time for commuting. Some \u2014 including those who were exclusively hired to work remotely \u2014 will likely be forced to quit.",
      "\u201cEveryone built their lives around these remote positions,\u201d said a Veterans Affairs employee who is on leave with a newborn. \u201cMy supervisor lives in [Florida] and was hired as a remote employee. She can\u2019t relocate.\u201d",
      "As far as presidents, Trump is not alone in his travels home. As president, Joe Biden frequently traveled to his home in Wilmington, Delaware, on the taxpayer dime. Then-first lady Jill Biden was also called out for a costly trip as she was attempting to be at Hunter Biden\u2019s side during his trial. Amid criticism, Joe Biden at the time said he continued to hold meetings and work while home. One analysis in 2022 found that Biden\u2019s Delaware trips at that point cost taxpayers $11 million. Barack Obama would also travel to Hawaii for vacations, which was far more costly of a journey than Palm Beach would be, said Tom Fitton, president of the legal group Judicial Watch.",
      "The group has tracked the costs of presidential travel since Obama\u2019s presidency and calculated that his vacations over eight years cost taxpayers at least $85 million. In an interview, Fitton said that figure may be conservative given that it was not as inclusive of ancillary costs that are often part of calculations today.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a point. It\u2019s not a big one,\u201d Fitton said of Trump working from Mar-a-Lago even though he ordered employees back to the office.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s obviously president 24/7. There\u2019s really no comparison between a president golfing on the weekend versus an employee who doesn\u2019t really have to go into the office at all. Or whose job duties and responsibilities are [not] essential to the government,\u201d Fitton said.",
      "He also noted: \u201cPresidential golfing is a perennial issue.\u201d",
      "Trump had said he wouldn\u2019t golf when president. In his first run for office in 2016, Trump bashed Obama for his golfing habits and repeatedly contended that the public wouldn\u2019t see him on the course if he were president.",
      "\u201cI love golf, but if I were in the White House, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see Turnberry again,\u201d he said in February 2016, in a reference to a course he owns in Scotland. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see Doral again,\u201d he also said, in a reference to his course in Miami. \u201cI don\u2019t ever think I\u2019d see anything \u2014 I just want to stay in the White House and work my a-- off.\u201d",
      "Already this year he has golfed on the Doral course in Miami that he once said he wouldn\u2019t have time to visit.",
      "Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said every president is expected to take days off to recharge while getting Secret Service protection. Bookbinder said the tension, though, is Trump\u2019s current emphasis on cutting waste even while frequently golfing. Bookbinder also pointed to another unusual circumstance involving Trump.",
      "\u201cHe is not just going to his home. He\u2019s going to the business that he owns. And so every time he makes a trip, that brings money into his business, which puts money in his pockets,\u201d Bookbinder said. \u201cAt the same time that he is bemoaning waste and fraud in the federal government, he\u2019s actually through this travel having taxpayers pay his businesses, which makes him richer. That seems problematic and like a real level of irony when there\u2019s so much emphasis on cutting down on government, police, fraud and abuse.\u201d"

Twelve of the 26 aquatint prints from \u201cLa Tauromaquia,\u201d a rare portfolio he produced in 1957, showcase his deep fascination with bullfighting culture in Spain.",
      "They are part of a remarkable modern art collection of nearly 4,000 works held by the museum in Iran\u2019s capital, most of which have remained out of the public eye since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.",
      "\u201cThe themes of our exhibitions often depend on showcasing part of our collection, and currently we are focusing on works by Picasso, a name that doesn\u2019t need an introduction,\u201d Hassan Nouferasti, TMoCA\u2019s public relations director, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "Alongside Picasso, the museum displays other works, including paintings by prominent American artists such as Alexander Calder, Nouferasti said.",
      "\u201cIt can\u2019t be better than this,\u201d said Parisa Hosseini, a 33-year-old painter and musician who visited the exhibition after it opened to the public on Wednesday.",
      "At an event Tuesday evening, Nadereh Rezai,\u00a0Iran\u2019s deputy culture minister for artistic affairs, was quoted by the state-controlled Tehran Times newspaper as saying, \u201cartists like Picasso, with their unique styles, revolutionized global art.\u201d",

      "Last year, on the many nights when Missouri coach Dennis Gates was awake well past midnight processing how his Tigers were on their way to an 0-18 regular-season record against conference opponents \u2014 the school\u2019s worst in more than a century \u2014 he didn\u2019t pass them alone. He dialed longtime mentor Leonard Hamilton, the head coach at Florida State.",
      "Gates had hung on Hamilton\u2019s every word as a Seminoles assistant for eight years before leaving in 2019, from listening to his press conferences to taking notes on his laptop as Hamilton told stories in his office. One that Hamilton relayed during those sessions was about his 1993-94 season coaching Miami, as the Hurricanes endured an 0-18 record in Big East play.",
      "Facing his own winless winter last year, the 45-year-old Gates\u00a0\u201ccalled his cellphone at 2 in the morning,\u201d Gates told NBC News.",
      "\u201cIf he\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0pick that up,\u00a0I called\u00a0his house 2 in the morning, 3 in the morning.\u00a0You can hear him clear his throat. I said, \u2018Coach, you asleep?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, I\u2019m waiting on your call.\u2019\u201d",
      "Said Hamilton: \u201cMost times, I answered on the first ring.\u201d",
      "Sparked in part by the guidance Gates took from those calls, together with a healthier roster and a buzz saw offense, Missouri this season has authored a historic turnaround that will continue Sunday when Missouri is projected to hear its name called as one of the 68 teams in the bracket for the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament.",
      "One year after going 0-18 in the Southeastern Conference \u2014 0-19 when including its first-round loss in the conference tournament \u2014 and 8-24 overall, the Tigers now enter the NCAA tournament at 22-11, having gone 10-8 and tied for sixth in the SEC, the nation\u2019s deepest conference this season.\u00a0It marks the first time in SEC history that a school has gone winless in conference play one season and then recorded double-digit conference victories in the next, according to research by Missouri.The Tigers have beaten three teams ranked in the top five \u2014 Alabama, Florida and Kansas \u2014 thanks to an offense that has leaped up the national rankings from 215th in scoring offense (72.2 points per game) to eighth (84.5).",
      "Madness, indeed.",
      "Kentucky coach, Mark Pope, this month\u00a0called\u00a0the Tigers \u201cone of the great stories in college basketball.\u201d",
      "Gates, whose Tigers had gone 25-10 and made the NCAA tournament\u2019s second round during his first season at the school in 2023, \u201cdidn\u2019t forget how to coach in one year,\u201d Hamilton told NBC News.",
      "\u201cI think that the [transfer] portal and how that works, sometimes you can recruit good players and good kids that don\u2019t fit your system, and once you understand that out there, it\u2019s not like the players are wrong or the coaching system is wrong. It\u2019s just that when you caught in those situations, you have to find who fits the way you want to play,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what he did. He thoroughly evaluated what he needed and what he didn\u2019t have, of those things that are important to him, and I think they became wiser.\u201d",
      "They certainly became healthier.",
      "Tigers players missed 111 games to injury last season, including a foot injury that sidelined top contributor John Tonje for last season\u2019s final two months \u2014 Tonje, who has since transferred to Wisconsin, is one of the Big Ten\u2019s leading scorers \u2014 and key reserve Caleb Grill, who played nine games before a wrist injury.",
      "\u201cUnheard of,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI would like to see any coach at this level withstand that storm of injuries.\u201d",
      "Also nearly unheard of was the patience shown by Missouri\u2019s administrators amid the downturn at a time when \u201cyou have a lot of knee-jerk reactions going on in our sport,\u201d Hamilton said. Although the athletic director who had hired Gates at Missouri had departed, leaving Gates with a new boss, the coach not only did not lose his job but did not gut his staff, either.",
      "Asked to explain the turnaround, Gates spent much of an interview crediting those around him, from the school\u2019s president to his assistants and their specific areas of expertise.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t second-guess what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Gates said. \u201cWe got some talented coaches who got a blueprint that ADs and other institutions covet: how to build something that is at the bottom. ... It\u2019s easy to start on third base. It\u2019s easy. But what happens when you start outside the ballpark, not even in a dugout, outside the ballpark?\u201d",
      "But Gates, too, \u201cdeserves a lot of credit,\u201d said\u00a0Garth Glissman, an associate commissioner who oversees the SEC\u2019s basketball operations.",
      "\u201cA\u00a0lot of coaches in that scenario would just completely clean house, and that\u2019s not what he did,\u201d Glissman told NBC News.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not the kind of guy to run a bunch of kids off at the first sign of adversity,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd so he stayed with the kids in this program who wanted to stay with him, and he went out and supplemented the roster with some impactful transfers. But by no stretch of the imagination is this Missouri team a completely different roster than last year. There\u2019s a lot of key pieces that returned, and that\u2019s credit to coach Gates.\u201d",

      "Having recovered from his wrist injury, Grill is averaging 14.2 points per game off the bench while shooting 42% from 3-point range and nearly 50% from the field overall. Voted the SEC\u2019s Sixth Man of the Year, Grill is \u201cone of the most improved players in the country, but also, there\u2019s no better sixth man in our country,\u201d Gates said.\u201cThey\u2019re deep,\u201d ESPN analyst Fran Fraschilla told NBC News. \u201cThey have two go-to scorers in Mark Mitchell and Tamar Bates, they have a young point guard who is a sophomore, Anthony Robinson, who I love, and they\u2019re a terrific offensive team. They\u2019re very much up-tempo, and they take care of the ball. They\u2019re a complete offensive team right now.\u201d",
      "Mitchell transferred from Duke and immediately became the Tigers\u2019 leading scorer and a third-team all-conference honoree. Bates, a 6-foot-5 guard who played with Mitchell in high school, has shot a career-high 60% inside the 3-point arc, and a career-high 39% outside it. Robinson was named to the SEC\u2019s all-defensive team.",
      "Missouri had not scored more than 100 points in any of its first 226 SEC games since joining the conference in 2012, yet this year has hit triple-digits twice. Not surprisingly, the Tigers are on pace to record their highest-scoring season since 1989-90.",
      "This isn\u2019t Gates\u2019 first quick rebuild. Cleveland State had not played in an NCAA tournament in 11 years when it hired Gates in 2019, yet made the tournament in only his second season. The blueprint Gates used there, and at Missouri again this season, was developed from the lessons he\u2019d learned in part by observing Hamilton at Florida State. Though the transfer portal has allowed teams to make wholesale roster changes during a single offseason, the \u201cfit\u201d of those players is paramount, Hamilton said.",
      "Hamilton, who is retiring at Florida State this season after a career spanning 37 seasons and 660 victories, said it was only right that he pick up the phone to pay forward the type of help he received as a young coach when he would bounce ideas off mentors including John Thompson, the late NCAA title-winning Georgetown coach, and George Raveling, a former college coach and longtime Nike executive.",
      "\u201cWe have talked about things on a regular basis for a number of years,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI think that has allowed him to relate to some of my journeys. But I think that you gather all your information, you evaluate what you think the challenges are, and you move on. I mean, Dennis is a great coach.\u201d"

    "summary": "A 5-year-old's death in a Michigan hyperbaric chamber has sparked calls for more oversight of unsupervised hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the wellness industry.",
    "story": [
      "The death of a 5-year-old in a hyperbaric chamber in Michigan has prompted calls for more oversight of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the largely unsupervised wellness industry before another tragedy occurs.",
      "Thomas Cooper was killed Jan. 31 when a fire broke out in a hyperbaric chamber at the Oxford Center, an alternative medicine clinic in the Detroit suburb of Troy. On Monday, the Oxford Center founder and CEO and three of her employees were charged in Thomas\u2019 death.",
      "Hyperbaric chambers are pressurized, tubelike devices that people lie or sit in for treatment, depending on the type of chamber. The therapy involves breathing in air that consists of 100% oxygen, which helps the body heal more quickly but also creates a highly combustible environment. The treatment method has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration to help over a dozen conditions including carbon monoxide poisoning, severe wounds and decompression sickness in scuba divers.",
      "The Oxford Center\u2019s website lists over 100 conditions it says it treats, including many that the FDA has not approved for hyperbaric oxygen therapy, such as cancer, dyslexia, Alzheimer\u2019s, Lyme disease and autism \u2014 though it is not illegal to use hyperbaric chambers for these purposes. In a statement to NBC News, an attorney for the Oxford Center said the center was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the charges filed against four staff members.",
      "\u201cThe timing of these charges is surprising, as the typical protocol after a fire-related accident has not yet been completed. There are still outstanding questions about how this occurred,\u201d Sam Vitale said via email about Thomas' death.",
      "Thomas was receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy for sleep apnea and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, according to his family\u2019s attorney, which are not among the conditions approved by the FDA for such treatment. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said the boy died within seconds after a single spark started a fire in the hyperbaric chamber he was in. Officials have not said yet what the cause of the fire was.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Nessel accused Oxford Center staff of holding \u201csafety among their lowest considerations\u201d but said officials had no way of knowing about the danger until it was too late, and cannot proactively investigate other facilities.",
      "\u201cMichigan law doesn\u2019t require any oversight over the use of hyperbaric chambers, so without having some sort of probable cause to believe that there are crimes being committed involving hyperbaric chambers in other places in the state, we wouldn\u2019t have the authority to go in and perform an inspection,\u201d Nessel said.",
      "The Oxford Center was subject to inspections every few years by the Troy Fire Department, said Michael Koehler, the fire department\u2019s deputy chief. He said the center applied for a permit when it opened, indicating it would be using hyperbaric chambers, and was last inspected in March 2023.",
      "\u201cBut our inspections are fire- and life-safety focused,\u201d Koehler said in a phone interview Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that covers the operation or the maintenance of the chambers themselves.\u201d",
      "While hospitals that use hyperbaric chambers abide by codes developed by the National Fire Protection Association, a standards development organization, Michigan is not unique in lacking a regulatory framework for hyperbaric oxygen therapy outside of traditional health care facilities, said John Peters, executive director of the Undersea & Hyperbaric Medical Society, a nonprofit organization that accredits hospitals and freestanding facilities with hyperbaric chambers in the absence of government regulation.",
      "At the moment, nearly 150 facilities across the country are accredited by the group, with two in Michigan.",
      "The accreditation process involves on-site inspections and verification that equipment is maintained and specialists are properly trained, and costs about $10,000 for an accreditation that lasts for three to four years, Peters said.",
      "He estimated that thousands of spas, wellness companies and other storefronts are operating hyperbaric chambers in the U.S. without having undergone accreditation, and he said he fears many may not be upholding stringent standards.",
      "Two Democratic legislators in Michigan, state Sen. Stephanie Chang and state Rep. Sharon MacDonell, are working together to explore regulatory options after Thomas\u2019 death.",
      "Chang said she was alarmed by what appeared to be a myriad of problems that led to the fire, based on what the Michigan attorney general outlined, including allegedly not having a properly trained technician operating the hyperbaric chamber.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s fix all of those loopholes,\u201d Chang said. She said she and MacDonell are aiming to introduce legislation in the spring.",
      "MacDonell said it was important not just to make hyperbaric chambers safer but also to stop businesses from making unproven claims about what the therapy can do.",
      "\u201cPeople are taking advantage of parents with children with hard-to-treat conditions, and just kind of monetizing the desperation of the parents,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just incomprehensible.\u201d",
      "Thomas\u2019 death comes as the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy has proliferated, gaining steam in recent years thanks to celebrities who have touted it for everything from anti-aging to boosting their mental health. The FDA has warned that some claims about what hyperbaric chambers can do are \u201cunproven\u201d and encourages patients to only go to accredited facilities.",
      "Hyperbaric chamber fires are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2009, a 4-year-old and his grandmother died after a blaze at an unaccredited Florida clinic where the boy was receiving treatment for cerebral palsy. Two staff members were charged in their deaths, one of whom was a doctor who lost his medical license.",
      "The 2009 case did not prompt national safety regulations, Peters said. He is hopeful that Thomas\u2019 death will.",
      "\u201cWe desperately need mandatory accreditation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this will turn the page.\u201d",
      "While there are guidelines for how to safely construct and operate hyperbaric chambers, there is no consistent federal, state or local oversight of the practice outside of hospitals. The FDA said in an email last month that it regulates certain hyperbaric chambers that meet the agency\u2019s definition of Class II medical devices, which are \u201cintended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.\u201d But it does not regulate the practice of medicine and referred NBC News to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, The Joint Commission and state medical licensing agencies for more information.",
      "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires Medicare and Medicaid providers to comply with parts of the National Fire Protection Association code, but that does not apply to other facilities, which must still adhere to local building and fire codes, said Brian O\u2019Connor, a senior engineer at the National Fire Protection Association.",
      "The Joint Commission, a nonprofit organization that accredits over 24,000 health care programs around the world, said in an email that it has emergency procedures and training drills for hospitals that have hyperbaric chambers but does not accredit places such as the Oxford Center.",
      "Meanwhile, Michigan\u2019s health department, its occupational safety agency and the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs all said they do not have oversight of hyperbaric chambers. The licensing agency said facilities using hyperbaric chambers are not required to be licensed, which Peters said was shocking.",
      "\u201cWhy?\u201d he said. \u201cEven a hairstylist has to have a license, and she\u2019s not going to blow up her whole salon.\u201d"

Along with the nearby Gigafactory, Tesla\u2019s first production center outside the United States, the new $200 million Megapack battery plant that opened last month is critical to Musk\u2019s continued success in China and beyond.",

      "Through Musk\u2019s work with his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, he has gained tremendous sway over the U.S. government, even as he retains substantial financial interests in China, which the U.S. considers its main strategic competitor.",

      "\u201cIt would be very striking and unlikely if Beijing doesn\u2019t see this as a great gift,\u201d said Isaac Stone Fish, chief executive of Strategy Risks, a research firm based in New York.",
      "\u201cBeijing is long used to using what it calls friends, the technical Chinese term for \u2018useful idiots,\u2019 for folks who can advance the interests of the Communist Party,\u201d Stone Fish said. \u201cBeijing is very used to using people like Elon Musk to do that.\u201d",
      "Though Musk is widely admired in China as an innovator and businessman, his fortunes here could also shift rapidly if U.S.-China relations sour and the public begins to associate him more with Trump administration policies.",
      "The White House, DOGE and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The White House has said Musk\u2019s cost-cutting initiative is unrelated to U.S. foreign policy, while the Chinese Embassy in Washington says the U.S. business community has long been a \u201cstaunch force\u201d for U.S.-China relations.",
      "\u201cWe welcome American companies to continue investing and developing in China, playing an active role as a bridge and contribute to a stable, sound and sustainable China-U.S. relationship,\u201d embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement.",

      "Musk broke ground on the Gigafactory in January 2019, making Tesla the first foreign carmaker to set up a factory in China without a Chinese partner.",

      "China now accounts for more than a third of Tesla\u2019s global sales, with more than 657,000 vehicles sold here last year. As of June, Tesla had 520 stores across the country."

According to the\u00a0American Museum of Tort Law, at least 700 other people had been burned before by McDonald\u2019s coffee, yet the company hadn\u2019t changed it\u2019s policy of keeping its coffee between 180 and 190 degrees.",
      "The 79-year-old initially asked McDonald\u2019s to pay her medical bills and only filed suit after the company refused, according to the Journal of Consumer & Commercial Law.",
      "She was initially awarded $2.7 million in punitive damages but a judge reduced the jury\u2019s verdict. Liebeck and McDonald\u2019s settled for an undisclosed amount."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that he was \u201cnot at all\u201d worried about the stock market, which has dipped multiple times amid President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy. They\u2019re normal. What\u2019s not healthy is straight up,\u201d Bessent said during an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "\"You get these euphoric markets. That's how you get a financial crisis,\" he added.",
      "Major stock indexes have have seen drops in recent weeks amid Trump\u2019s tariff threats. CNBC previously reported that the S&P 500\u2019s value had decreased by about $5 trillion in three weeks.",
      "Trump has vacillated on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, two of the United States\u2019 closest trading partners, while threatening steep tariffs on other U.S. allies like the European Union. The president has also implemented sweeping tariffs on aluminum and steel. Bessent also confirmed that Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on other countries will begin on April 2.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not worried about the markets. Over the long term, if we put good tax policy in place, deregulation and energy security, the markets will do great,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "The stock market fluctuations have sparked fears of longer-term economic issues, and Bessent did not rule out a recession in Sunday\u2019s interview.",
      "\u201cYou know that there are no guarantees. Like, who would have predicted Covid, right?\u201d Bessent said.",
      "\u201cSo I can predict that we are putting in robust policies that will be durable, and could there be an adjustment,\u201d he said, adding that the country needed to be weaned off of \u201cmassive government spending.\u201d",
      "Trump had previously declined to rule out the possibility of a recession and acknowledged that Americans may feel some level of economic pain in response to his policies.",
      "\u201cI hate to predict things like that,\u201d Trump said in a Fox News interview this month when asked whether he was expecting a recession this year. \u201cThere is a period of transition, because what we\u2019re doing is very big.\u201d",
      "The president has also said multiple times that the economy could see some level of \u201cdisturbance\u201d in response to his tariff policies.",
      "\u201cTariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again, and it\u2019s happening, and it will happen rather quickly,\u201d he said during his joint address to Congress this month.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019ll be a\u00a0little disturbance, but we\u2019re OK with that. It won\u2019t be much.\u201d",
      "He later repeated that view, telling NBC News that \u201cthere could be some disturbance, a little bit of a disturbance.\u201d",
      "Trump later appeared to backtrack on his recession comments, saying last week that he did not \u201csee it at all\u201d when asked again whether there could be a recession. Trump also said the stock market sell-off did not concern him, adding he was \u201cvery optimistic about the country.\u201d",
      "Bessent on Sunday urged Americans to watch how countries react in the two months following the start of reciprocal tariffs in April.",
      "\u201cEither the tariff barriers come down, the U.S. can export more. Trade is fairer. It\u2019s always been free, but not fair,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cOr if they don\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll take in substantial revenues.\u201d",
      "Bessent also addressed cuts to the IRS after the Trump administration initiated a large-scale federal workforce reduction, including widespread cuts of probationary employees.",
      "The treasury secretary said the IRS had approximately 15,000 probationary employees who could have been fired, but \u201cwe kept about 7,500, 8,500 because we viewed them as essential to the mission.\u201d Late last week, two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to temporarily reinstate thousands of fired probationary workers."

And what I\u2019m telling you is that if we continue to observe norms, if we continue to engage in business as usual, this democracy could be gone,\u201d Murphy told moderator Kristen Welker. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a year to save American democracy.\u201d",
      "Democrats are coming off of a lackluster election season, and a new NBC News poll shows that the party has reached an all-time low in popularity, with just 27% of registered voters reporting positive views of the party.",
      "When asked why Democrats are not connecting with Americans, Murphy said he thinks \u201cAmericans want the Democratic Party to stand up and fight and to take risks.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think Democrats in this country, but I think the broad middle of the public as well, want to see our party fighting in exceptional ways,\u201d Murphy added. \u201cThat is the conversation that has to happen inside of the Democratic Party, inside our caucus.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t get that right, if we continue to work with Republicans, if we continue to hand Donald Trump more power, we are going to lose our democracy,\u201d he continued.",
      "His comments come days after Schumer reversed course last week on a GOP-led temporary government funding bill. After saying that Democrats would block the bill, Schumer said he would support letting the bill move forward, leading to a public split among Democrats.",

      "He ultimately voted against the bill\u2019s final passage.",
      "Schumer\u2019s move prompted criticism from other Democrats as the party grappled with how to respond to the funding bill. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries dodged multiple questions last week about his confidence in Schumer and whether he should remain the party\u2019s leader in the Senate, responding instead with \u201cnext question.\u201d",
      "Murphy said Sunday that he still supported Schumer as Democrats\u2019 leader, but added that \u201cthe only way that we are going to be effective as a caucus is if we change our tactics.\u201d",
      "\u201cLeader Schumer has a very difficult job. I don\u2019t envy the job that he has,\u201d Murphy said earlier in the interview. \u201cAnd the question is really for the members of his Democratic caucus: Are we willing to fight? I admit that it would take some risk-tolerant behavior in order to effectively stand up to this president. And so the question really is for my party writ large, are we willing to do the very difficult things necessary to meet this moment?\u201d",
      "Current and former Democratic leaders typically strive to project unity, but Schumer\u2019s move prompted former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to issue a statement urging Democratic senators to instead listen to the party\u2019s top members on the House and Senate Appropriations Committee, who opposed the bill.",
      "While not explicitly naming Schumer, Pelosi referred to a \u201cfalse choice between a government shutdown or a blank check that makes a devastating assault on the well-being of working families across America.\u201d",

      "Buoyed by jubilant and unified Republicans, who are standing in lockstep with Trump and the expansive agenda he and congressional leaders are pushing in Washington, more registered voters see the U.S. as heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004, though a majority still say the country is on the wrong track. Trump\u2019s approval rating also equals his best-ever mark as president (47%), though again, a majority (51%) disapproves of his performance.",
      "Meanwhile, driven in part by a pessimistic shift among Democrats since Trump\u2019s election, just 18% of voters rate the economy as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d \u2014 not as low as the poorest economic marks during the Biden administration, according to CNBC polling from 2022, but within a handful of points, and as low as that mark has been in NBC News polling since 2014. Majorities of voters disapprove of Trump\u2019s early job performance on the economy (54% disapprove, 44% approve) and how he\u2019s handling inflation and the cost of living (55% disapprove, 42% approve).",
      "It\u2019s a new development for Trump, who never previously had a majority against his handling of the economy in a national NBC News poll. Now, he is confronting jittery markets and businesses amid his early moves to put tariffs on U.S. neighbors and other allies. Trump also faces questions from voters about whether he is sufficiently focused on their core issue of costs as he pursues other projects like reshaping the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Overall, the poll reflects an America that remains deeply divided in the months following Trump\u2019s 2024 victory, as it was in the months before.",
      "Voters narrowly disapprove of Trump\u2019s overall job performance, but the margin is closer than at almost any point during his first term. His personal ratings and the share of Republicans identifying as part of the MAGA movement have grown, reflecting the unity inside his party giving him wide latitude in a GOP-controlled Washington.",
      "In another change from Trump\u2019s first term in the White House, the public has come around on his deportation-focused immigration policies, though voters are wary of his handling of other issues, including foreign policy.",
      "Voters like the general idea of the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump-blessed effort to slash government jobs and spending. But they harbor reservations about its rapid-fire execution so far, as well as about billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, DOGE\u2019s de facto head.",
      "And voters are split evenly on which party they\u2019d like to see win the 2026 midterm elections, even as the Democratic Party faces record-low popularity and fractious divides over how to respond to Trump.

      "McInturff noted how Trump has fortified his base over the last year. The political story of the next year, he said, will be whether voter dissatisfaction on the economy or other issues takes hold \u2014 \u201cor the strength of the Republican and Trump base has maintained a very competitive election\u201d in 2026, McInturff continued.",
      "Trump's expanded base and key issues",

      "But they are also far below where previous presidents stood during the \u201choneymoon period\u201d of new administrations, marking the polarization that has defined the Trump years. Slightly more disapprove of Trump\u2019s job performance (51%) and view him personally negatively (49%), and 54% see the country as on the wrong track.",
      "Underscoring the deep partisan divide, Trump has the largest gap of any president in the last 80 years between his approval rating among members of his own party (90%) and his approval rating from the opposing party (4%), according to an analysis of three decades of NBC News polling and earlier data from Gallup.",
      "Among independents, 30% approve and 67% disapprove of Trump\u2019s performance in office. A large gender gap still persists, with men approving of Trump\u2019s job performance 55%-43%, while women split the other way, 40%-58%.",

      "But that\u2019s the only one of the five issues tested in the poll \u2014 border security and immigration, foreign policy, the economy, inflation and cost of living, and the war between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 that sees a majority of American voters approve of how Trump is handling it.",
      "Forty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of foreign policy and 53% disapprove of it, while 42% approve of his handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, with 55% disapproving.",
      "Cost concerns dominate on the economy",

      "Just 1% rate the economy as \u201cexcellent\u201d and 17% as \u201cgood,\u201d with 39% calling it \u201conly fair\u201d and 43% rating it \u201cpoor.\u201d While Republicans are more likely to have favorable views of the economy than others, majorities across virtually every demographic still view the economy in an unfavorable light.",
      "About one-third (32%) of voters say their family\u2019s income is staying about even with the cost of living, but 60% say it\u2019s falling behind. Another 7% say their family\u2019s income is rising faster than the cost of living.",

      "Forty-six percent of voters say establishing a Department of Government Efficiency was a good idea, while 40% say it was a bad idea and another 13% do not have an opinion. However, DOGE itself is viewed unfavorably, with 41% holding positive views of the effort and 47% holding negative views.",

      "Democrats at a low point",
      "While Trump\u2019s standing is largely based on overwhelming support from within his own party, the Democratic Party now sits at its lowest favorable rating in the history of NBC News polling. Just 27% of registered voters view the party positively. That includes just 59% of self-identified Democrats.",
      "Meanwhile, 65% of Democrats say they want Democratic lawmakers to stick to their positions even if this means not being able to get things done in Washington, while 32% want them to compromise with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.",
      "Still, voters remain split as to who they want to control Congress after next year\u2019s midterm elections: 48% back Democrats, while 47% back Republicans.",

      "Some of the negative impacts were direct, according to a handful of verbatim responses from poll respondents. One cited a niece at a nonprofit that lost its grant money, another a child who works at the Department of Education, and others mentioned federal government employees who are either at risk of or lost their jobs.",
      "\u201cI know federal workers and projects they worked on for years were cut, and they were for the benefit of the American people,\u201d said one New Jersey woman who works in local government and doesn\u2019t identify with either major party.",
      "Other respondents raised nonspecific concerns about future uncertainty for them or their loved ones. And some who answered yes on already feeling a negative impact conflated DOGE\u2019s early cuts with concerns that congressional Republicans could eye cuts to Medicaid or other programs in their future budget bill.",
      "Fourteen percent of voters say they or someone they know is a federal employee who has been laid off as a result of changes enacted by DOGE.",
      "The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

      "Just over a quarter of registered voters (27%) say they have positive views of the party, which is the party\u2019s lowest positive rating in NBC News polling dating back to 1990. Just 7% say those views are \u201cvery\u201d positive.",
      "\u201cWith these numbers, the Democratic Party is not in need of a rebrand. It needs to be rebooted,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey along with GOP pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.",
      "The slump is partially driven by fed-up Democrats, according to the polling data, after they watched their party lose to Trump in 2024. And now, in a reversal from Trump\u2019s first term, self-identified Democratic voters say they want their party to hold the line on their positions even if it leads to gridlock, rather than focus on finding areas of compromise with the president.",

      "Back in April 2017, 59% of Democrats said they wanted congressional Democrats to make compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation, with 33% saying they should stick to their positions even if that means not being able to get things done in Washington.",
      "Now, that sentiment has completely flipped. Almost two-thirds of Democrats, 65%, say they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions even if that risks sacrificing bipartisan progress, and just 32% want them to make legislative compromises with Trump.",
      "Elizabeth Joyce, a 35-year-old technology project manager from Texas, said she may have supported Democrats compromising with Trump during his first term, but not anymore.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m scared that compromising will lead to the downfall of our democracy, to only be slightly hyperbolic,\u201d said Joyce, who participated in the survey and said she thought Democrats should hold the line even if it leads to gridlock. \u201cIt\u2019s really scary seeing the things being done, the things being slashed left and right without any regard for the outcome.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s more important for Democrats to stick to their guns and kind of put up a fight,\u201d said Samantha Kosloske, a 29-year-old from New York. \u201cI mean, [Trump is] probably not gonna listen either way, but I think that\u2019s gonna be at least more effective.\u201d",

      "While more Democrats are itching for a fight, some are still looking for the party to make compromises to advance legislation.",
      "\u201cIn order to get some wins we will have to give the conservative party some wins as well,\u201d said Jason Howard, a 40-year-old data analyst from Florida. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not going to get anything done in the next two years, or at least until this Congress is over, if we don\u2019t at least approach them with some give and take.\u201d",
      "When Howard spoke with NBC News on Friday afternoon, he was hoping that Senate Democrats would ultimately vote to keep the government open, arguing that a shutdown could hurt the economy.",
      "Other Democrats said they wanted Democrats to hold the line, even if that meant shutting down the government.",
      "The survey was conducted from March 7-11, largely before this week\u2019s standoff over government funding. But it underscores a dynamic that loomed over that debate, where Democrats in Congress were divided over whether to provide votes to allow passage of a GOP-authored funding bill they hate or block it, which would cause a government shutdown.",
      "Dozens of furious Democratic senators tried to draw a line in the sand and argue that the party shouldn\u2019t acquiesce to a government funding process after they were cut out of negotiations around it. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly said the continuing resolution would \u201cgive unchecked power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk,\u201d with others panning it as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201ca terrible deal.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, 10 Senate Democrats including Schumer agreed to end debate on the funding measure, allowing it to pass with Republican votes. Schumer argued that a shutdown would give Trump and Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency even more power to dismantle the federal government, but the move angered House Democrats and many Democratic voters who want to see their party hold the line against Trump.",
      "Kosloske, the Democrat from New York, name-checked Schumer\u2019s decision to advance the funding measure as evidence that Democrats are \u201cnot responding\u201d to Trump.",

      "There are no clear dividing lines among Democratic voters on this question across gender, socioeconomic status and ethnicity, according to the NBC News poll. Suburban Democratic voters are slightly more likely to want congressional Democrats to dig in when compared to rural Democrats, while white male Democrats and those without college educations are slightly more likely to want compromise.",
      "Still, even those who are open to compromise are looking for more action from congressional Democrats.",
      "Howard, the data analyst from Florida, said he wants Democrats to be \u201cmore vocal\u201d and more actively pushing out ideas and legislation.",

      "The Republican Party also has a net-negative image, with 49% of voters saying they view the party negatively and 39% saying they view it positively. But the GOP can at least console itself with control of the White House and Congress. For Democrats, the numbers are another a warning sign for the party as it tries to regroup and navigate the new Trump administration.",
      "The drop in the party\u2019s image is driven in part by independent voters, with just 11% saying they have positive views while 56% say they have negative views.",
      "The poll also finds that some components of the Democratic base have soured on the party as well.",
      "Nearly 20% of Democratic voters say they have negative views of the party, while 10% of Republicans say the same about the GOP.",
      "And a quarter of liberals view the party negatively, double the share of conservatives who view the GOP negatively.",
      "The new low of positive feelings about the Democratic Party is still a few points higher than the Republican Party\u2019s lowest-ever rating, from October 2013, when just 22% said they viewed the party positively amid a government shutdown.",

    "story": [
      "The death of a 5-year-old in a hyperbaric chamber in Michigan has prompted calls for more oversight of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the largely unsupervised wellness industry before another tragedy occurs.",
      "Thomas Cooper was killed Jan. 31 when a fire broke out in a hyperbaric chamber at the Oxford Center, an alternative medicine clinic in the Detroit suburb of Troy. On Monday, the Oxford Center founder and CEO and three of her employees were charged in Thomas\u2019 death.",
      "Hyperbaric chambers are pressurized, tubelike devices that people lie or sit in for treatment, depending on the type of chamber. The therapy involves breathing in air that consists of 100% oxygen, which helps the body heal more quickly but also creates a highly combustible environment. The treatment method has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration to help over a dozen conditions including carbon monoxide poisoning, severe wounds and decompression sickness in scuba divers.",
      "The Oxford Center\u2019s website lists over 100 conditions it says it treats, including many that the FDA has not approved for hyperbaric oxygen therapy, such as cancer, dyslexia, Alzheimer\u2019s, Lyme disease and autism \u2014 though it is not illegal to use hyperbaric chambers for these purposes. In a statement to NBC News, an attorney for the Oxford Center said the center was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the charges filed against four staff members.",
      "\u201cThe timing of these charges is surprising, as the typical protocol after a fire-related accident has not yet been completed. There are still outstanding questions about how this occurred,\u201d Sam Vitale said via email about Thomas' death.",
      "Thomas was receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy for sleep apnea and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, according to his family\u2019s attorney, which are not among the conditions approved by the FDA for such treatment. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said the boy died within seconds after a single spark started a fire in the hyperbaric chamber he was in. Officials have not said yet what the cause of the fire was.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Nessel accused Oxford Center staff of holding \u201csafety among their lowest considerations\u201d but said officials had no way of knowing about the danger until it was too late, and cannot proactively investigate other facilities.",
      "\u201cMichigan law doesn\u2019t require any oversight over the use of hyperbaric chambers, so without having some sort of probable cause to believe that there are crimes being committed involving hyperbaric chambers in other places in the state, we wouldn\u2019t have the authority to go in and perform an inspection,\u201d Nessel said.",
      "The Oxford Center was subject to inspections every few years by the Troy Fire Department, said Michael Koehler, the fire department\u2019s deputy chief. He said the center applied for a permit when it opened, indicating it would be using hyperbaric chambers, and was last inspected in March 2023.",
      "\u201cBut our inspections are fire- and life-safety focused,\u201d Koehler said in a phone interview Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that covers the operation or the maintenance of the chambers themselves.\u201d",
      "While hospitals that use hyperbaric chambers abide by codes developed by the National Fire Protection Association, a standards development organization, Michigan is not unique in lacking a regulatory framework for hyperbaric oxygen therapy outside of traditional health care facilities, said John Peters, executive director of the Undersea & Hyperbaric Medical Society, a nonprofit organization that accredits hospitals and freestanding facilities with hyperbaric chambers in the absence of government regulation.",
      "At the moment, nearly 150 facilities across the country are accredited by the group, with two in Michigan.",
      "The accreditation process involves on-site inspections and verification that equipment is maintained and specialists are properly trained, and costs about $10,000 for an accreditation that lasts for three to four years, Peters said.",
      "He estimated that thousands of spas, wellness companies and other storefronts are operating hyperbaric chambers in the U.S. without having undergone accreditation, and he said he fears many may not be upholding stringent standards.",
      "Two Democratic legislators in Michigan, state Sen. Stephanie Chang and state Rep. Sharon MacDonell, are working together to explore regulatory options after Thomas\u2019 death.",
      "Chang said she was alarmed by what appeared to be a myriad of problems that led to the fire, based on what the Michigan attorney general outlined, including allegedly not having a properly trained technician operating the hyperbaric chamber.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s fix all of those loopholes,\u201d Chang said. She said she and MacDonell are aiming to introduce legislation in the spring.",
      "MacDonell said it was important not just to make hyperbaric chambers safer but also to stop businesses from making unproven claims about what the therapy can do.",
      "\u201cPeople are taking advantage of parents with children with hard-to-treat conditions, and just kind of monetizing the desperation of the parents,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just incomprehensible.\u201d",
      "Thomas\u2019 death comes as the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy has proliferated, gaining steam in recent years thanks to celebrities who have touted it for everything from anti-aging to boosting their mental health. The FDA has warned that some claims about what hyperbaric chambers can do are \u201cunproven\u201d and encourages patients to only go to accredited facilities.",
      "Hyperbaric chamber fires are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2009, a 4-year-old and his grandmother died after a blaze at an unaccredited Florida clinic where the boy was receiving treatment for cerebral palsy. Two staff members were charged in their deaths, one of whom was a doctor who lost his medical license.",
      "The 2009 case did not prompt national safety regulations, Peters said. He is hopeful that Thomas\u2019 death will.",
      "\u201cWe desperately need mandatory accreditation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this will turn the page.\u201d",
      "While there are guidelines for how to safely construct and operate hyperbaric chambers, there is no consistent federal, state or local oversight of the practice outside of hospitals. The FDA said in an email last month that it regulates certain hyperbaric chambers that meet the agency\u2019s definition of Class II medical devices, which are \u201cintended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.\u201d But it does not regulate the practice of medicine and referred NBC News to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, The Joint Commission and state medical licensing agencies for more information.",
      "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires Medicare and Medicaid providers to comply with parts of the National Fire Protection Association code, but that does not apply to other facilities, which must still adhere to local building and fire codes, said Brian O\u2019Connor, a senior engineer at the National Fire Protection Association.",
      "The Joint Commission, a nonprofit organization that accredits over 24,000 health care programs around the world, said in an email that it has emergency procedures and training drills for hospitals that have hyperbaric chambers but does not accredit places such as the Oxford Center.",
      "Meanwhile, Michigan\u2019s health department, its occupational safety agency and the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs all said they do not have oversight of hyperbaric chambers. The licensing agency said facilities using hyperbaric chambers are not required to be licensed, which Peters said was shocking.",
      "\u201cWhy?\u201d he said. \u201cEven a hairstylist has to have a license, and she\u2019s not going to blow up her whole salon.\u201d"

He dialed longtime mentor Leonard Hamilton, the head coach at Florida State.",
      "Gates had hung on Hamilton\u2019s every word as a Seminoles assistant for eight years before leaving in 2019, from listening to his press conferences to taking notes on his laptop as Hamilton told stories in his office. One that Hamilton relayed during those sessions was about his 1993-94 season coaching Miami, as the Hurricanes endured an 0-18 record in Big East play.",
      "Facing his own winless winter last year, the 45-year-old Gates\u00a0\u201ccalled his cellphone at 2 in the morning,\u201d Gates told NBC News.",
      "\u201cIf he\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0pick that up,\u00a0I called\u00a0his house 2 in the morning, 3 in the morning.\u00a0You can hear him clear his throat. I said, \u2018Coach, you asleep?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, I\u2019m waiting on your call.\u2019\u201d",
      "Said Hamilton: \u201cMost times, I answered on the first ring.\u201d",
      "Sparked in part by the guidance Gates took from those calls, together with a healthier roster and a buzz saw offense, Missouri this season has authored a historic turnaround that will continue Sunday when Missouri is projected to hear its name called as one of the 68 teams in the bracket for the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament.",
      "One year after going 0-18 in the Southeastern Conference \u2014 0-19 when including its first-round loss in the conference tournament \u2014 and 8-24 overall, the Tigers now enter the NCAA tournament at 22-11, having gone 10-8 and tied for sixth in the SEC, the nation\u2019s deepest conference this season.\u00a0It marks the first time in SEC history that a school has gone winless in conference play one season and then recorded double-digit conference victories in the next, according to research by Missouri.The Tigers have beaten three teams ranked in the top five \u2014 Alabama, Florida and Kansas \u2014 thanks to an offense that has leaped up the national rankings from 215th in scoring offense (72.2 points per game) to eighth (84.5).",

      "\u201cI think that the [transfer] portal and how that works, sometimes you can recruit good players and good kids that don\u2019t fit your system, and once you understand that out there, it\u2019s not like the players are wrong or the coaching system is wrong. It\u2019s just that when you caught in those situations, you have to find who fits the way you want to play,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what he did. He thoroughly evaluated what he needed and what he didn\u2019t have, of those things that are important to him, and I think they became wiser.\u201d",

      "\u201cUnheard of,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI would like to see any coach at this level withstand that storm of injuries.\u201d",
      "Also nearly unheard of was the patience shown by Missouri\u2019s administrators amid the downturn at a time when \u201cyou have a lot of knee-jerk reactions going on in our sport,\u201d Hamilton said. Although the athletic director who had hired Gates at Missouri had departed, leaving Gates with a new boss, the coach not only did not lose his job but did not gut his staff, either.",
      "Asked to explain the turnaround, Gates spent much of an interview crediting those around him, from the school\u2019s president to his assistants and their specific areas of expertise.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t second-guess what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Gates said. \u201cWe got some talented coaches who got a blueprint that ADs and other institutions covet: how to build something that is at the bottom. ... It\u2019s easy to start on third base. It\u2019s easy. But what happens when you start outside the ballpark, not even in a dugout, outside the ballpark?\u201d",
      "But Gates, too, \u201cdeserves a lot of credit,\u201d said\u00a0Garth Glissman, an associate commissioner who oversees the SEC\u2019s basketball operations.",

      "Missouri had not scored more than 100 points in any of its first 226 SEC games since joining the conference in 2012, yet this year has hit triple-digits twice. Not surprisingly, the Tigers are on pace to record their highest-scoring season since 1989-90.",
      "This isn\u2019t Gates\u2019 first quick rebuild. Cleveland State had not played in an NCAA tournament in 11 years when it hired Gates in 2019, yet made the tournament in only his second season. The blueprint Gates used there, and at Missouri again this season, was developed from the lessons he\u2019d learned in part by observing Hamilton at Florida State. Though the transfer portal has allowed teams to make wholesale roster changes during a single offseason, the \u201cfit\u201d of those players is paramount, Hamilton said.",
      "Hamilton, who is retiring at Florida State this season after a career spanning 37 seasons and 660 victories, said it was only right that he pick up the phone to pay forward the type of help he received as a young coach when he would bounce ideas off mentors including John Thompson, the late NCAA title-winning Georgetown coach, and George Raveling, a former college coach and longtime Nike executive.",
      "\u201cWe have talked about things on a regular basis for a number of years,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI think that has allowed him to relate to some of my journeys. But I think that you gather all your information, you evaluate what you think the challenges are, and you move on. I mean, Dennis is a great coach.\u201d"

      "\"The Electric State,\" which premiered on Netflix on March 14, takes a new spin on the age-old tale of robots taking over.",
      "This time, robots lose the war and are an oppressed class.",
      "To understand the film, which was inspired by a 2018 graphic novel, you need to understand the world's history. Humans invented robots and put them to work doing manual labor and service jobs. Eventually, the robots rebelled and started the Robots Rights' Movement, led by a robot version of Mr. Peanut (voiced by Woody Harrelson). During the Clinton Administration, a deadly war broke out between the humans and the robots.",
      "Technology mogul Ethan Skate (Stanley Tucci) developed Neurocasters, a technology one puts on their head (like VR) which links the human mind to mechanized drone bodies. Neurocasters split your consciousness, a la \"Severance.\" One version of a human can be in a drone body working, while the other version is having fun in the human's original body.",
      "Once humans developed this new technology, they defeated the Robot Equality Coalition, banishing all the robots to Sentre's Exclusion Zone (known as The EX).",
      "Stanley Tucci explained on TODAY March 12 that Neurocasters were \u201coriginally sort of designed to sort of ease people\u2019s pain and suffering, but it\u2019s gotten out of hand.\u201d",
      "\"The Electric State,\" directed by the Russo brothers, takes place in the aftermath of this war in 1994, following Michelle (Millie Bobby Brown) as she races across the country to find her genius brother, Christopher, whom she had previously thought died in a car crash along with their parents.",
      "Accompanying her is a robot named Cosmo (Alan Tudyk). Although he can not fully speak, Cosmo conveys that Christopher is alive and projecting his own consciousness into Cosmo.",
      "Eventually, she teams up with Keats (Chris Pratt) and his own robot friend Herman (Anthony Mackie). Together, the foursome journeys through The EX to find Christopher.",
      "Along the way, they find Dr. Amherst (Ke Huy Quan) who informs them that Christopher is actually the reason that the Neurocasters exist. In fact, Christopher's brain is such a marvel, that in his comatose state after the car accident, his brain was strong enough to power \u2014 and still powers \u2014 all of Sentre's (Ethan Skate's company) technology.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many elements of animation, it\u2019s a massive, epic scope and scale, but really rooted in humanity,\u201d Chris Pratt said on TODAY Oct. 17. \u201cAnd that relationship between these two folks is a big part of that.\u201d",
      "Throughout the film, Michelle befriends many more robots who are voiced by big names like Woody Harrelson, Jenny Slate, Brian Cox and Hank Azaria.",
      "All the while she's on the run from Col. Bradbury (Giancarlo Esposito), a leader in the uprising and now a bounty hunter catching robots (Coleman Domingo also makes a cameo here as a soldier within Bradbury's ranks).",
      "The sci-fi/adventure film ends similar to how the world's history began: a huge battle between humans and robots, but this time the viewer is rooting for the robots. Read on the understand why and what happens.",
      "'The Electric State' ending explained",
      "During a battle in The EX, Col. Bradbury successfully kidnaps Cosmo. He gets ready to fly him back to Sentre when the drone that Ethan is Neurocasting into kills Dr. Amherst. Col. Bradbury still brings Cosmo back to Sentre, but face-to-face, he tells Ethan that he's crossed a line by killing someone and lying to him.",
      "Ethan doesn't care as he has Christopher's essence back, meaning his company won't completely crumble and instead is back at functioning capacity.",
      "This is when Michelle, her friends and a bunch of robots from The EX begin their attack on Sentre's headquarters with the mission of freeing Christopher.",
      "Amherst's computer, which stores all his knowledge, had revealed that removing Christopher's brain from the system would free him and cause a complete system failure for Sentre.",
      "Keats and Herman start the first wave of the attack, launching cars into Sentre's headquarters. Ethan deploys his entire security squad to stop their attack. Michelle, meanwhile, sneaks into Sentre through a backdoor using the code she'd secured.",
      "The second wave of robots then attack Sentre, coming to Keats and Herman's aid and launching a full on war against Ethan's security forces, who are Neurocasting into drones.",
      "Michelle reaches the room holding Christopher. She discovers that she has to put on a Neurocaster and go inside Christopher's mind to speak to him.",
      "While inside, Christopher confirms that if his brain is removed from the system, Sentre dies \u2014 but his physical body cannot survive without Sentre. He tells Michelle that she needs to be the one to save the world from Sentre, meaning that she must kill her own brother.",
      "While Michelle grapples with this realization, unsure of what to do, Ethan fires up his own Neurocaster, which is connected to a giant, lethal drone. He steps into battle in the suit and immediately begins destroying the robots.",
      "Separately on the battle field, Col. Bradbury confronts Mr. Peanut, but instead of fighting him as he had the entire film, he admits he was wrong and tells Mr. Peanut what room and floor Ethan's real body is located on. Col. Bradbury then exits the battle.",
      "Keats and Herman fight Ethan in his drone suit. They defeat him, but Herman dies in the process. As the real Ethan is taking his Neurocaster off, he's confronted by Mr. Peanut inside Sentre to renegotiate the treaty.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelle is still talking to Christopher, unwilling to let him die. Then he tells her that Sentre has put tighter controls over him this time and he doesn't want to live like this forever. Sentre could keep him alive for 100 years. Michelle sayas she doesn't want to lose him again.",
      "\"You can't lose me,\" Christopher tells her. \"But you can lose them. You. You're the one whose gonna change the world.\"",
      "After a final cry, hug, and exchanging of \"I love you's,\" Michelle leaves, pressing three buttons that kill her younger brother. She holds Cosmo's hand and Christopher's chest in both her hands.",
      "The timing is impeccable as Keats is about to be killed by a drone, but all of Sentre's technology ceases to work before the fatal strike.",
      "Despite Christopher dying, there's a happiness to the battle as Herman emerges alive and well after Keats bears his soul to what he believed to be his lifeless friend.",
      "What follows is a montage of Sentre shutting down across the world and news emerging that the company had been experimenting on a little boy to stay afloat. Ethan Skate gets arrested in the aftermath. The media montage ends with a reporter saying, \"You know who I want to talk about? The girl who trucked a ton of bots to Seattle to kick Skate's butt.\"",
      "Cut to Michelle, who films a video for the world saying that the technology Sentre made was bad for everyone, not just robots.",
      "\"I know the war happened and things fell apart and life really sucked,\" she says. \"And maybe for a little while the Neurocasters helped you forget that. We got so used to it that we thought that\u2019s what real life was. But it\u2019s not. Real life, it\u2019s contact. It\u2019s you and me. We\u2019re flesh and bone, yeah, but we\u2019re also electricity. And when we hug and laugh and hold hands and argue, my particles stay with you and yours stay with me. And maybe we stay together forever. But that can\u2019t happen if you close yourself off.\"",
      "Michelle continues on, saying humanity needs to start over. She tells everyone that they need to stick together and help each other to make it work.",
      "\"Look around,\" she says. \"There\u2019s someone near you right now. They\u2019re real and alive. And they need you as much as you need them. And if there isn\u2019t, if you don\u2019t have anyone, then come find us. Because we\u2019re starting over. We\u2019re going to do it right this time.\u201d",
      "What does that last scene mean? Is Christopher alive?",
      "With Michelle saving the world like Christopher had instructed her to do, the movie could end \u2014\u00a0but instead it tacks on one last scene.",
      "Cosmo, the robot Christopher had transferred some of his essence into, is dumped into what looks to be a pile of trash. Nearby, a stray dog laps water from a puddle.",
      "The final shot shows the reflection in the water as Cosmo rises up, hinting that some of Christopher's essence may still be alive within him."

      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"Black Bag.\"",
      "\"Black Bag,\" which hits theaters March 14, has all the themes a compelling spy thriller should: secrets, love, betrayal and, of course, some killer outfits (no pun intended).",
      "Directed by Stephen Soderbergh, the film follows George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender) as he tries to find a mole within his own agency \u2014 the National Cyber Security Center in London.",
      "Unfortunately for him, the prime suspect seems to be his wife Kathryn St. Jean (Cate Blanchett) who also works at the NCSC.",
      "At issue is a secretive software program called Severus, which has been stolen from the NCSC by a mole within the agency. Apparently, the mole is working on a sale with terrorists to give them Severus, which would cause the death of thousands and topple current global power balances. George has one week to figure out who the mole is.",
      "George, who is known for his interrogation skills with a lie detector, spends the film investigating agents who could be possible moles: recently promoted young star Col. James Stokes (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page), lothario Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke), Freddie's girlfriend and technology expert Clarissa Dubose (Marisa Abela) and therapist Dr. Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris), who is dating James.",
      "George, who turned his own father in for wrongdoing in the past, also secretly investigates Kathryn as the clues continue to point towards her. This, however, proves to be a testament to his love.",
      "\"I watch her, I assume she watches me. If she's in trouble, even of her own making, I will do everything in my power to extricate her,\" George says in the film.",
      "Yet as he continues to investigate Kathryn, she answers too many of his questions with two simple words: \"Black bag.\"",
      "For those who need a spy lingo refresh, \u201cblack bag\u201d is a term used to convey that an operation or a piece of information is top secret and the speaker cannot say more.",
      "\"It comes from the tradition of spies putting their documents into a black bag and once that black bag is locked, no one can know what's in it,\" Cate Blanchett told TODAY on March 10. \"So in order for their marriage to function, when they go on separate operations, when they ask one another details, they say 'Sorry, black bag.'\"",
      "After many twists and turns, the traitorous reveal of who the mole truly is comes amid of a flurry of chaos and confusion.",
      "Here's the final dinner party scene broken down and all your questions answered.",
      "'Black Bag' ending explained",
      "For a spy movie, \"Black Bag\" had very few physical action scenes, instead relying on psychologically thrilling turns of events to propel the plot.",
      "As Reg\u00e9-Jean Page told TODAY on March 7, it's a \"super taut psychological thriller.\"",
      "Two of the most tense scenes in the film are dinner parties hosted by George and Kathryn with all the potential moles invited \u2014 which Blanchett described on TODAY as \"quite theatrical\" scenes.",
      "While the first dinner party included a nice meal (dosed with a narcotic that functioned as truth serum, of course) and a side of dramatics (like a hand stabbing), the second dinner party skipped the meal all together, cutting straight to the chase: a game.",
      "George sets a gun on the table, announcing that everyone will play a game as Dr. Vaughan realizes that the couple has changed their carpet to easily dispose of a body if needed.",
      "In typical George fashion, this game will be potentially deadly and meant to expose plenty of secrets. Through careful questions and accusations, George gets everyone to admit to something.",
      "Dr. Vaughan has been secretly sleeping with Freddie as she thought she might need something from him. During this affair, Freddie told her about the cameras being redirected \u2014 which was one of the biggest clues that pointed towards Kathryn being the mole.",
      "However, going into the dinner party, George has already discovered that someone within the agency is framing Kathryn.",
      "The big reveal comes when it's discovered that it wasn't terrorists who initiated the idea to steal Severus, it was an agency worker.",
      "James has been the one working to sell Severus. James did so by putting the program on a hard drive that he stored in a red soccer ball keychain which he\u2019d been seen with throughout the film. James reveals that his boss Arthur Stieglitz (Pierce Brosnan) was the one who suggested the idea.",
      "But then the second twist happens. There were two plans running amok during the movie. James had one plan, while Freddie had another.",
      "James worked to sell Severus to the terrorists, while separately  Freddie was trying to frame George and Kathryn for the crime.",
      "George then reveals photos of James selling Severus. With no way out, James grabs the gun from the middle of the table and says he did it to end the war. He also admits to killing Philip Meacham, an agent and friend of George who was murdered earlier, to cover up his crimes.",
      "James then points the gun at George, narrowing in on his target. But George doesn't flinch. Instead he says that a camera has been filming them this whole time.",
      "But this fact doesn't deter James. He tries to shoot George, but the gun doesn't work. Before James can do anything else, Kathryn pulls a second gun out and shoots James in the head, immediately killing him.",
      "This action proves a point George and Kathryn had been reciting to each other the whole film: they would kill for each other. Blanchett echoed that point on TODAY, telling Savannah Guthrie they would \"literally kill for each other.\"",
      "The rest of the film ties up loose ends smoothly. The couple wraps James' body into the new carpet they'd placed beneath the table. George then dumps James' body into the secluded lake he goes fishing in.",
      "The film then flashes forward to Monday at work. Kathryn tells Arthur that he needs to step away from his position.",
      "He tells her he will leave his job \"feet first,\" to which she responds, \"Anyway you like.\"",
      "There's just one lose end to wrap up by this point. Where did the 7 million pounds go that was transferred about throughout all the chaos?",
      "Well, during a passionate makeout scene, George tells Kathryn the money is in a Swiss bank account that they have access to.",
      "The end leaves viewers with George and Kathryn kissing, perhaps paying homage to the film's message: it's more than just a spy movie. It's a tale about the mysteries of marriage and the lengths of love."

      "The Gigafactory produces 1 out of every 2 Teslas in the world, or about 1 million cars a year. In addition to producing for the Chinese market, it exports cars to Europe and other parts of Asia, though not yet to the U.S.",
      "Musk\u2019s cars have been credited with helping China to create an EV industry that now leads the world. In exchange, China has become Tesla\u2019s biggest market outside the U.S.",
      "\u201cChina is absolutely central to the success story of Tesla globally,\u201d said Michael Dunne, chief executive of the San Diego-based advisory service Dunne Insights. \u201cTake China out of the picture, we have a completely different Tesla.\u201d",
      "That is exactly the problem.",
      "Through Musk\u2019s work with his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, he has gained tremendous sway over the U.S. government, even as he retains substantial financial interests in China, which the U.S. considers its main strategic competitor.",
      "With his role as a Trump adviser and his high profile in China, where he has met with senior leaders including the foreign minister, Musk has been held up as a potential bridge between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. But it remains unclear to whose advantage that will be.",
      "\u201cIt would be very striking and unlikely if Beijing doesn\u2019t see this as a great gift,\u201d said Isaac Stone Fish, chief executive of Strategy Risks, a research firm based in New York.",
      "\u201cBeijing is long used to using what it calls friends, the technical Chinese term for \u2018useful idiots,\u2019 for folks who can advance the interests of the Communist Party,\u201d Stone Fish said. \u201cBeijing is very used to using people like Elon Musk to do that.\u201d",
      "Though Musk is widely admired in China as an innovator and businessman, his fortunes here could also shift rapidly if U.S.-China relations sour and the public begins to associate him more with Trump administration policies.",
      "The White House, DOGE and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The White House has said Musk\u2019s cost-cutting initiative is unrelated to U.S. foreign policy, while the Chinese Embassy in Washington says the U.S. business community has long been a \u201cstaunch force\u201d for U.S.-China relations.",
      "\u201cWe welcome American companies to continue investing and developing in China, playing an active role as a bridge and contribute to a stable, sound and sustainable China-U.S. relationship,\u201d embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement.",
      "A crucial market",
      "Musk broke ground on the Gigafactory in January 2019, making Tesla the first foreign carmaker to set up a factory in China without a Chinese partner.",
      "Ten months later, the factory was up and running in what businesspeople here like to call \u201cChina speed.\u201d",
      "China now accounts for more than a third of Tesla\u2019s global sales, with more than 657,000 vehicles sold here last year. As of June, Tesla had 520 stores across the country."

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use \u201coverwhelming lethal force\u201d until Iranian-backed\u00a0Houthi rebels\u00a0cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said at least 18 civilians were killed.",
      "\u201cOur brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists\u2019 bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cNo terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.\u201d",
      "He also warned Iran to\u00a0stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country \u201cfully accountable\u201d for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S. leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran\u2019s advancing nuclear weapons program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational.",
      "The Houthis reported\u00a0explosions in their territory\u00a0Saturday evening, in the capital of Sanaa and the northern province of Saada, the rebels\u2019 stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia, with more airstrikes reported in those areas early Sunday. Images online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. The Houthis also reported airstrikes early Sunday on the provinces of Hodeida, Bayda, and Marib.",
      "At least 18 people were killed, including 13 in Sanaa and five in Saada, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. At least 24 others were wounded, including nine in Sanaa and 15 in Saada, it said.",
      "Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won\u2019t deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. \u201cSanaa will remain Gaza\u2019s shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges,\u201d he added on social media.",
      "Another spokesman, Mohamed Abdulsalam, on X, called Trump\u2019s claims that the Houthis threaten international shipping routes \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d",
      "The airstrikes come a few days after the\u00a0Houthis said they would resume attacks\u00a0on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel\u2019s latest blockade on Gaza. They described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.",
      "There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.",
      "Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of \u201cadditional consequences\u201d for\u00a0Hamas\u00a0if their\u00a0fragile ceasefire\u00a0in the war isn\u2019t extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase.",

      "The attacks raised the Houthis\u2019 profile as they faced economic and other problems at home amid Yemen\u2019s decade-long stalemated war that\u2019s torn apart the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation.",
      "The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa\u2019s northern district of Shouab. Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children.",
      "\u201cThe explosions were very strong,\u201d said Abdallah al-Alffi. \u201cIt was like an earthquake.\u201d",
      "The Eastern Geraf is home to Houthi-held military facilities and a headquarters for the rebels\u2019 political bureau, located in a densely populated area.",
      "The Houthis reported fresh strikes on the southwestern Dhamar province late Saturday. They said the strikes hit the outskirts of the provincial capital, also named Dhamar, and the district of Abs.",
      "The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel\u2019s military declined to comment.",
      "Saturday\u2019s operation was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration.",

      "The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturday\u2019s mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.",

      "\u201cThe situation is catastrophic,\u201d the letter says. \u201cBeing sent back to Afghanistan would mean the permanent loss of our education and exposure to severe risks, including oppression, insecurity, and a future without opportunities. This is a life-or-death situation for many of us.\u201d",
      "The Afghan students were pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees in Oman under the Women\u2019s Scholarship Endowment, one of numerous programs eliminated in the Trump administration\u2019s effort to drastically scale back USAID.",
      "Secretary of State\u00a0Marco Rubio said Monday\u00a0that 83% of USAID programs had been canceled after a six-week review and that the remaining programs would be merged into the State Department.",
      "\u201cPlease don\u2019t let our dreams be shattered and the Taliban decide our fate,\u201d the students\u2019 letter reads. \u201cWe have fought very hard to get out of their hands, we won\u2019t be living anymore if we have to go back to Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "The program for female scholars was launched in 2019 with a $50 million endowment from USAID, according to Brian Le, deputy legislative director of With Honor, a nonprofit group that works with veterans in Congress from both parties on bipartisan initiatives. Interest from the endowment has covered the cost of the program, which was administered by USAID, without requiring additional annual funding from the U.S. government, Le said.",
      "Nonprofit groups are in discussions with the government of Oman to try to resolve the situation, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to avoid is their return to Afghanistan, which would functionally amount to a death sentence for these women who have been aided by the United States in pursuing higher education opportunities,\u201d Le said.",
      "While the letter from the Afghan students said 83 women were affected, Le said it now appears more than 120 Afghans had their scholarship funding cut off.",
      "Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan, they have reimposed draconian restrictions on women, including banning them from secondary school and higher education,\u00a0prohibiting them from most employment and limiting their freedom of speech and movement, according to human rights groups.",
      "Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said the elimination of the scholarship program was \u201cshameful\u201d and called on the Trump administration to reverse course.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration thinks it\u2019s politically advantageous to villainize USAID, but Americans need to realize that behind the cancelled contracts and mass layoffs are innocent lives now put at risk,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "\u201cIn this case, these bright young women with the world ahead of them could receive what could amount to a death sentence in a matter of days \u2014 simply because they were relying on a US-funded scholarship to get their education abroad.\u201d"

      "Once rare, Israel's use of airstrikes in the occupied West Bank has soared since Oct. 7, 2023, stoking fears that it is deploying the military tactics there that it used in the Gaza Strip, some 60 miles away.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a time in the history of the occupation, not even during the Second Intifada, that the use of airstrikes had become so severe and deadly,\u201d in the West Bank, Shai Parnes, spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem, told NBC News, referring to the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s.",
      "However, by B\u2019Tselem\u2019s count, since Oct. 7, 2023, the Israeli military has increasingly dropped bombs on the territory: at least 69 airstrikes in the West Bank killed 261 people, including 41 under the age of 19. At least 28 of those 261 people have been killed since Jan. 19, Parnes said.",
      "The rise in airstrikes, according to a report published by B'Tselem on Wednesday, speaks to the increasingly destructive path that human rights groups say Israel has taken in the West Bank, with its operations accelerating since the Jan. 19 ceasefire in Gaza."

    "story": [
      "Johns Hopkins University said it would eliminate more than 2,000 jobs after President Donald Trump\u2019s administration rescinded federal funding for thousands of international aid projects, including a program designed to help prevent HIV transmission in India and a clinical trial for diarrheal disease in Bangladesh.",
      "The university, one of the country\u2019s most significant and prestigious scientific research institutions, said in a statement Thursday that it would eliminate 1,975 jobs internationally and 247 in the United States as the result of cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development. An additional 78 U.S.-based and 29 international employees will be furloughed.",
      "\u201cThis is a difficult day for our entire community,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe termination of more than $800 million in USAID funding is now forcing us to wind down critical work here in Baltimore and internationally.\u201d",
      "Researchers leading some of the programs to be shuttered said the cuts could raise the risk of dangerous outbreaks. The changes will also have an economic impact in Baltimore because the university is the largest private employer in Maryland.",
      "About half of Johns Hopkins\u2019 funding last year came from federal research dollars, according to a letter from Ron Daniels, the university\u2019s president.",
      "It\u2019s one of several universities across the country laying off workers or implementing hiring freezes as they reckon with sweeping cuts f to research and higher education from the Trump administration. Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and Notre Dame University have abruptly stopped hiring faculty.",
      "Additionally, the Trump administration canceled about $400 million in grants to Columbia University last week, citing alleged harassment of Jewish students, as well as $30 million in funding to the University of Maine, after the state\u2019s governor clashed with Trump over transgender athletes in sports.",
      "More than 50 universities are under investigation as the administration seeks to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "The White House defended the actions.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is streamlining federal agencies to eliminate wasteful DEI projects and make more funds available for scientific research, not less,\" White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said. \"He will support policies that bolster our public health, cut programs that do not align with the agenda that the American people gave him a mandate in November to implement, and keep programs that put America First.\u201d",
      "Johns Hopkins researchers said they fear the cuts to USAID will have grave consequences for the communities where they had been working.",
      "Dr. Sunil Solomon, an epidemiologist who helped lead an HIV detection and prevention research program in India called Accelerate, said the program provided HIV testing for nearly 120,000 people and diagnosed nearly 20,000 cases since it began in April 2019. The program was also helping to deliver medicine to and improve treatment for about 8,000 children with HIV.",
      "The program was slated to receive about $50 million in total USAID funding through the end of 2026, Solomon said, and had used a little more than $36 million so far.",
      "Solomon said there would be more transmission of HIV in India, more children with HIV who won\u2019t receive timely care and fewer people diagnosed as a result of his program\u2019s closure.",
      "\u201cThere definitely is gonna be a lot of lives lost from this program from the whole global pause and the termination of USAID awards,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see it happen tomorrow or the day after, but these impacts are going to be seen maybe six months down the line when kids have stopped taking their medication, their immune system starts deteriorating, they start picking up new infections.\u201d",
      "Solomon said cutting Accelerate would force the layoffs of nearly 600 people, including four Johns Hopkins staffers in the U.S. and 14 in India, along with hundreds of subcontractors in India.",
      "Dr. Judd Walson, an infectious disease physician and the chair of the department of international health at Johns Hopkins, said other programs had been similarly shuttered or reduced.",
      "These include a tuberculosis research program and a clinical trial in Bangladesh designed to reduce outbreaks of cholera and other diarrheal diseases, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople were enrolled in that study. We had to pause all activities despite that ongoing work,\u201d Walson said.",
      "He added that the cuts could put U.S. residents at more risk for infectious diseases.",
      "\u201cIn many ways, USAID funding has provided a mechanism for us to have eyes on the ground of what\u2019s happening around the world in relationship to disease,\u201d Walson said. \u201cWe\u2019re one plane ride away from the spread of very significant diseases into our country, and this decision to terminate all these programs will have important consequences for global health security.\u201d",
      "In Baltimore, meanwhile, economic effects could ripple. Johns Hopkins paid out about $5 billion in wages in Maryland in the 2022 fiscal year and directly employed nearly 56,500 people in the state, according to university estimates. Johns Hopkins said it was responsible for more than $15 billion in economic impacts in Maryland during that time.",
      "Other pending Trump administration cuts could threaten Johns Hopkins further. The administration last month attempted to limit National Institutes of Health payments to universities for research grants by capping indirect costs, which cover things like utilities and building operations, to 15%.",
      "The policy was challenged in court, including in one case where the university is a plaintiff. Earlier this month, a judge put the administration\u2019s plan on hold.",
      "In a legal filing, Johns Hopkins said it received more than $1 billion in grant funding from NIH in the 2024 fiscal year. Reducing payments for indirect costs could leave the university on the hook for an estimated $200 million, the filing said."

      "Investigators are searching for Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student who went missing on a spring break trip with her college friends in the Dominican Republic last week.",
      "Multiple international agencies have been searching for Konanki since she disappeared March 6 as the investigation nears its second week.",
      "Here's what we know about the case.",
      "Who is Sudiksha Konanki?",
      "Konanki, 20, is a junior in biology at the University of Pittsburgh, according to the Loudoun County, Virginia, Sheriff's Office. She is an Indian citizen and permanent U.S. resident who lives with her family in Chantilly, Virginia, which is in Loudoun County.",
      "She traveled to Punta Cana from Pitt on March 3 with five female friends for spring break, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Konanki is in the South Asian fusion a cappella group Avaaz at college, according to the\u00a0group\u2019s Instagram account.",
      "When was Konanki last seen?",
      "Konanki was last seen early March 6 after she went to the beach with friends.",
      "She disappeared after 4:15 a.m., after her friends left the beach but she stayed behind with people she met on the trip.",
      "Security video showed Konanki and her friends entering the beach area in the Riu Republica Resort, where they were staying, Dominican Republic National Police said.",
      "Loudoun County Sheriff Michael Chapman told\u00a0NBC Washington\u00a0on Monday that Konanki's friends returned to the hotel after about 40 minutes and that Konanki stayed with the others whom she met and who were not friends from college.",
      "One of the last people who had contact with her said that \"a wave hit them while they were on the beach and caused some kind of situation,\" Dominican President Luis Abinader said at a\u00a0news conference Monday, citing local reports. Abinader said at the time that authorities were trying to piece together what happened.",
      "Konanki's friends went on an excursion Thursday and did not realize she had disappeared until they returned, about 12 hours later, at which point they told the hotel about their missing friend, National Police spokesperson Diego Pesqueira said.",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office was then notified of her disappearance, Chapman said.",
      "National Police launched a search effort Friday morning, using drones, helicopters, divers, boats and canine units. The search effort was expanded Monday.",
      "Konanki's friends were supposed to return to the United States on Friday but stayed back to aid in the search,\u00a0sheriff's spokesperson Thomas Julia said.",
      "The hotel said that beach access is always open and that security guards are stationed around the hotel and the area.",
      "What do we know about the investigation?",
      "Multiple agencies are involved in the investigation, which is being led by Dominican police, the Dominican attorney general's office, the FBI and a U.S. Embassy liaison.\u00a0The U.S. Coast Guard is also involved.",
      "The University of Pittsburgh said it was in contact with Konanki's family and offering support in the investigation. The Indian Embassy in the Dominican Republic is also helping in the investigation, Chapman said.",
      "Konanki\u2019s family traveled to Punta Cana to aid in search efforts but returned to Virginia. They declined to comment on the search.",
      "La Altagracia Civil Defense, the local Dominican emergency operations agency,\u00a0shared photos of multiple agencies searching  the beach\u00a0over the weekend. The hotel was also assisting in search efforts, it said.",
      "Authorities have said it's not clear whether Konanki\u2019s disappearance is accidental or whether foul play was involved. No signs of blood or violence were found at the beach, Pesqueira said.",
      "National Police sent teams to monitor the beach overnight at least twice to watch how the water moves to see where a body would drift if someone drowned and to see where the waves crash.",
      "A hotel spokesperson said red flags \u2014\u00a0which indicate \"that the sea had a strong current and very high waves\" \u2014\u00a0were flying when Konanki disappeared.",
      "Dominican authorities said Thursday morning that the search was moving from the Riu Republic Resort to Macao Beach.",
      "Officials are also looking into Konanki's phone and texts, said Chapman, the Loudoun County sheriff. She did not appear to have a history of excessive drinking, he said.",
      "The sheriff's office said it filed for Interpol to issue a yellow notice, a worldwide police alert for a missing person, which will alert authorities if she travels to another country.",
      "\"We are going on the presumption that she\u2019s still alive,\" Chapman said Monday. \"We want to make sure that we're exhausting every possible lead that we can, and we feel we're doing that.\"",
      "Has a person of interest been identified?",
      "A person of interest has been identified and was interviewed at length, Julia, the sheriff's office spokesperson, told NBC News. The sheriff's office has no jurisdiction over the case but sent detectives to the island to assist local investigators.",
      "A person of interest is \"not the same thing as a suspect, as this is not a criminal matter. It is still a missing person case,\" Julia said.",
      "National Police said Thursday morning that they do not use the term \"person of interest\" in their investigations and that no one is considered a suspect at this point.",
      "The man, Joshua Riibe, spoke to local authorities Thursday, a sheriff's spokesperson told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Riibe may have been the last person to see Konanki alive. He told local investigators they were on the beach \"in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little,\" according to a transcript of the interview that NBC News obtained.",
      "Then, a wave crashed, sweeping them both \"out to sea,\" Riibe said in the interview.",
      "\"I kept trying to get her to breathe, but that didn't allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water,\" he said. He told local authorities that he used to work as a lifeguard and that he made sure to get them both back to shore.",
      "That's when she disappeared, he said.",
      "\"The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn't hear her answer,\" he said. \"I looked around and didn't see anyone. I thought she'd grabbed her things and left.\"",
      "According to the interview, Riibe said he was surprised to later learn that Konanki was missing."

      "LA MALBAIE, Canada \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied the U.S. was in a trade war Friday as he wrapped up his trip to a meeting of top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a trade war,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe United States is resetting its trade relations globally to a level of equilibrium, to a level of reciprocity.\u201d",
      "That comment was in direct conflict with M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, who just hours earlier told reporters that the Trump administration \u201cwas engaging in a trade war against Canada\u201d and European countries. On Thursday, President Donald Trump threatened 200% tariffs on alcohol from the European Union after slapping 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada on Wednesday.",
      "Joly said she had a very long conversation with Rubio.",
      "\u201cWe will put maximum pressure on the Americans,\u201d she insisted.",
      "The contradiction between the two diplomats overshadowed the G7 meeting\u2019s official agenda, which included Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and relations with China. Instead, turmoil over tariffs loomed over the gathering. The newly frosty relationship between the longtime allies unfolded as frigid temperatures greeted the foreign ministers when they first arrived for the meeting on Tuesday. On Thursday, Trump once again mocked Canada from the Oval Office as the diplomats met in Qu\u00e9bec.",
      "\u201cCanada only works as a state,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need anything they have.\u201d",
      "On Friday, Joly blasted the comments and insisted she did not take them as a joke \u2014 but instead, as a serious threat.",
      "\u201cCanada\u2019s sovereignty is not up for debate,\u201d she said. \u201cPeriod.\u201d",
      "The diplomatic tussle between the U.S. and Canada also escalated in Ottawa Friday as Mark Carney was sworn in as the new prime minister.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy. His point is crazy. That\u2019s it,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe will never, ever, in any way, shape or form, be part of the United States.\u201d",
      "After initially stressing that the topic did not come up during his conversations with G7 diplomats, Rubio was pressed about whether Trump was serious when he says Canada should become the 51st state.",
      "\u201cThe Canadian government has made their position, how they feel about it clear. The president has made his argument as to why he thinks Canada would be better off joining the United States for economic purposes,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThere\u2019s a disagreement between the President\u2019s position and the position of the Canadian government.\u201d",
      "Rubio also noted the president says he loves Canada.",
      "Joly said she was trying to find an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to the trade dispute, but Rubio claimed there was no need for one because this was about the U.S. resetting its trade policy.",
      "Rubio also said Trump\u2019s tariff policy was not hostile to countries around the world, despite Trump calling the European Union \u201chostile and abusive\u201d Thursday on social media. In the Oval Office later in the day, Trump added: \u201cThe European Union is very, very nasty.\u201d",
      "During an interview with NBC News, Kaja Kallas, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security policy, said it was an overall \u201cgood\u201d G7 meeting and touted the discussions about Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and a variety of issues. But she acknowledged the EU\u2019s diplomats didn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s Thursday comments.",
      "\u201cOf course, these kinds of statements come as a surprise because we have long been friends and allies with the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of good things together.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t really understand how we have deserved\u201d these comments, she said.",
      "Still, on Ukraine, the U.S. drew incrementally closer to its G7 allies Friday \u2014 at least for now. The gathering\u2019s joint foreign ministers\u2019 communique supported Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and warned Russia to accept a ceasefire or face possible further sanctions.",
      "Rubio denied it marked any shift in U.S. policy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never heard President Trump say that Russia has a right to take all of Ukraine and do whatever they want there,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s not inconsistent with that statement.\u201d",

      "The agreement among the G7 nations \u2014 comprising Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.S. \u2014 emphasized the need for \u201csecurity arrangements\u201d to secure a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, although Rubio declined to offer specifics on what those security arrangements might be. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had famously clashed with Trump in the Oval Office over the issue of the U.S. providing security guarantees to move along a peace deal.",
      "Speaking with reporters, Rubio also touted a \u201cpositive and productive engagement\u201d between Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladamir Putin Thursday in Moscow, but he declined to speculate about the next steps in any ceasefire negotiations because Witkoff was still en route back to the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think there was reason to be optimistic,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBy the same token, we continue to recognize this is a difficult and complex situation.\u201d",
      "Rubio was asked by NBC News whether he trusted Putin.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an irrelevant question,\u201d he responded. \u201cI think in foreign policy, it\u2019s not about trusting. It\u2019s about action\u2026You can\u2019t just say you want peace. You have to do peace \u2014 and that\u2019s true for both sides in any conflict.\u201d",

    "summary": "Canadians and Republicans alike are confounded as President Donald Trump increasingly links a trade war to his push to annex Canada.",
    "story": [
      "Eight years ago, President Donald Trump spoke about the U.S.-Canada relationship in glowing terms.",
      "He hosted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House in February 2017 for one of his first joint appearances alongside a foreign leader. Trump opened by noting the nations \"share much more than a border,\" highlighting \"the special bonds that come when two nations have shed their blood together \u2014 which we have.\"",
      "\"America is deeply fortunate to have a neighbor like Canada,\" Trump said. \"We have before us the opportunity to build even more bridges, and bridges of cooperation and bridges of commerce.\"",
      "Fast-forward to Thursday, weeks after Trump initiated a full-scale trade war with Canada, and it\u2019s clear the president doesn\u2019t believe the U.S. should share a border \u2014\u00a0or much else \u2014\u00a0with its Canadian neighbors.",
      "Speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump first mentioned his love for Canadians, including his \u201cmany friends\u201d like hockey legend Wayne Gretzky. Then he riffed about how Canada shouldn\u2019t exist as a sovereign country before getting to what has increasingly become a fixation: wholesale annexation of Canada as a U.S. state.",
      "\"Canada only works as a state,\" Trump said Thursday. \"We don\u2019t need anything they have. As a state, it would be one of the great states anywhere. This would be the most incredible country, visually. If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it, between Canada and the U.S. Just a straight, artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago, many many decades ago. Makes no sense. It\u2019s so perfect as a great and cherished state.\"",
      "\"But why should we subsidize another country for $200 billion?\" Trump continued, adding, \"And again, we don\u2019t need their lumber, we don\u2019t need their energy. We have more than they do. We don\u2019t need anything. We don\u2019t need their cars. I\u2019d much rather make the cars here. And there\u2019s not a thing that we need. Now, there will be a little disruption, but it won\u2019t be very long. But they need us. We really don\u2019t need them. And we have to do this. I\u2019m sorry.\"",
      "Trump has been unapologetic in his quest to conquer the Canadians \u2014\u00a0an effort he said in January would be conducted by \u201ceconomic force.\u201d The result has been a disintegration of the relationship between the U.S. and one of its closest allies, and a stock market plunge over fears of ever-increasing escalation of a trade war. Both Canadian officials and Republicans initially thought the president was merely joking, ribbing Trudeau \u2014 a longtime foil \u2014 after they met at Mar-a-Lago in November. It was after that visit that Trump first publicly floated the notion of absorbing Canada. Few think he\u2019s joking now, and the Canadians have stopped laughing.",
      "A source with direct knowledge of the discussions told NBC News that Trump is heavily focused on Canada in conversations with aides, who believe he is completely serious about making the country the 51st state \u2014\u00a0even with Trudeau out of power and a new prime minister in place.",
      "'No clue where that is coming from'",
      "There isn\u2019t exactly a groundswell of support for the idea. At a heated town hall in his district on Thursday, Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., was pointedly asked whether he supported Trump\u2019s push to annex Canada and Greenland.",
      "\"No,\" Edwards said. \"I do not.\"",
      "While Canadians said Trump did privately joke to Trudeau about Canada becoming a state during the president\u2019s first term, several officials who worked in Trump\u2019s White House said the broad assault on Canadian sovereignty was not born out of any conversations at the time. In fact, these former officials said they have no recollection of Trump ever raising the issue.",
      "\"Never, ever heard him mention it,\" one former White House official said. \"Ever. No clue where that is coming from.\"",
      "Congressional Republicans similarly did not recall such an idea being discussed in his first term.",
      "\"That\u2019s probably three nos,\" Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., said when asked if he recalled Trump expressing interest in acquiring Canada, redrawing borders or renegotiating treaties with the Canadians. \"No. At least in my recollection, this is all kind of new territory.\"",
      "A 68-page national security report Trump signed in December 2017 included only one mention of America\u2019s northern neighbor: \"Canada and the United States share a unique strategic and defense partnership.\"",
      "In private, Trump has made specific demands the Canadians say they could never agree to. The president made clear in a phone call with Trudeau last month that he wants to revise the boundary between the two nations set by a 1908 border treaty, as two Canadian officials said and was previously reported by The New York Times and Toronto Star.",
      "If Trump truly objects to the boundary line, the proper forum to resolve the dispute is the International Court of Justice, a Canadian official said.",
      "The president has also mentioned renegotiating agreements that dictate how the Great Lakes and Columbia River are governed, the official told NBC News, adding that Trump wants to control the Northwest Passage, a maritime path that begins west of Greenland and cuts through Northern Canada to the Arctic Ocean.",
      "\"He wants our water,\" the Canadian official added. \"He wants to take the water.\"",
      "Marc Miller, the Canadian minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, said that for Trump, Canada\u2019s allure is its natural resources. The president separately wants American access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals as compensation for the aid given to the war-torn country.",
      "\"I do think that Mr. Trump looks at our natural resources and has that acquisitive mind behind it,\" Miller said, calling Trump\u2019s claims of the U.S. subsidizing Canada for $200 billion misleading.",
      "Miller said Canadians started truly taking Trump\u2019s threats of annexation seriously after his inauguration. He voiced disappointment that more allies have not spoken up in Canada\u2019s defense.",
      "\"I can\u2019t say this was totally predicted. Nor can anyone,\" Miller said. \"Frustratingly among our allies, everyone is ducking for cover.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A battle to be treated 'fairly'",
      "In recent weeks, Trump has enacted wide-ranging and steep tariffs on a litany of Canadian goods. There have been some walkbacks. And then there has been escalation. Canada has instituted retaliatory measures. And the tit-for-tat trade war has intensified on a near daily basis.",
      "Canada is one of the U.S.\u2019s largest trading partners, with nearly 80% of Canadian exports marked for the U.S. The country provides about 60% of U.S. crude oil imports, 85% of electricity imports and is also the biggest exporter of steel and aluminum into the U.S.",
      "\"Well, I think Canada is a neighbor,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a Tuesday briefing. \"They are a partner. They have always been an ally. Perhaps they are becoming a competitor now.\"",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t provided Canada with an obvious off-ramp for the tensions, either. He has objected to what he describes as steep Canadian tariffs on dairy imports from the U.S. and highlighted the importance of U.S. metals production. But he has also said a lead reason for the trade war is Canada's lack of urgency in dealing with the fentanyl crisis \u2014 even though just 43 pounds of fentanyl were seized by U.S. border agents entering the country from Canada during the last fiscal year, compared to 21,100 pounds coming from Mexico. And he has wrongly claimed American banks are not allowed to do business north of the border; the Canadian Banking Association said last month that 16 U.S. banks currently operate in Canada.",
      "\"Clearly, the president is looking for some results,\" said Amodei, who launched the bipartisan American Canadian Economy and Security Caucus in 2023 and reintroduced a House resolution affirming the U.S.-Canada partnership last month. \"I'm not sure those results are clearly defined.\"",
      "Amodei said Trump is above all looking for the U.S. to be \"treated fairly\" on trade, as Trump has pointed to examples where he believes Canada is not doing so.",
      "\"When you say, well, you want to be treated fairly, the question is, OK, define fairly.\" Amodei said. \"And I don\u2019t think 'fairly' is defined at the moment.\"",
      "Canadians view Trump\u2019s push to expand the U.S. into Canadian territory as beyond unfair. Mark Carney, the former Canadian and British central banker who was sworn in as prime minister on Friday, described \u201cdark days\u201d ahead for his nation after being elected to lead the Liberal Party.",
      "\"These are dark days \u2014 dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust,\" he said. \"We are getting over the shock \u2014 but let us never forget the lessons. We have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other.\"",
      "He has since said he is ready to negotiate a renewed trade deal \u2014\u00a0Trump already renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement during his first term \u2014\u00a0so long as his nation\u2019s sovereignty is respected.",
      "\"If he wanted Canada \u2014 if he really wanted it \u2014 he\u2019s harmed the prospects of Canada being the 51st state by the way he\u2019s approached it,\" said John Bolton, a national security adviser during Trump\u2019s first term who has since broken with him.",
      "'Canada is a sovereign state'",
      "Trump's rhetoric is not necessarily being matched by other members of his administration. During a confirmation hearing on Thursday, Trump\u2019s pick to serve as ambassador to Canada, former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., said \"Canada is a sovereign state,\" suggesting that the president\u2019s push for annexation was due to his relationship with Trudeau.",
      "Asked by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., how he can heal a \"negative relationship that has developed because of the president\u2019s statements,\" while \"addressing tariff issues,\" Hoekstra responded: \"Obviously, I've been spending a lot of time thinking about that myself.\"",
      "Nearly 800 miles north of Washington, D.C., at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Quebec, reporters pressed Secretary of State Marco Rubio about Trump\u2019s push to make Canada the 51st state. Rubio said there would be no such conversation at the G7 gathering.",
      "\"It is not a meeting about how we\u2019re going to take over Canada,\" Rubio said.",
      "Questioned further by NBC News at the conclusion of the gathering of foreign ministers on Friday, Rubio further explained the president's position.",
      "\"I\u2019ll tell you how that came about,\" Rubio said of promoting the annexation of Canada. \"OK, he\u2019s in a meeting with Trudeau, and Trudeau basically says that if the U.S. imposes tariffs on Canada, Canada couldn\u2019t survive as a nation state, at which point the president said, 'well, then you should become a state.'\"",
      "Trump, Rubio said, \"made an argument for why Canada would be better off joining the United States from an economic perspective and the like.\"",
      "\"He\u2019s made that argument repeatedly,\" Rubio continued. \"And I think it stands for itself.\"",
      "A senior State Department official described \"a need to separate out trade policy\" from \"broader cooperation on foreign affairs, and that\u2019s challenging.\"",
      "\"But there is broad agreement that we cannot allow real disagreements on certain issues to prevent us from working together on areas of agreement, especially critical foreign policy issues including migration, China, and of course Russia and Ukraine,\" this person added.",
      "What also confounds Republicans about Trump\u2019s idea is that annexing Canada would potentially add millions more Democrats to American voter rolls. Canada is a liberal-leaning nation with a population larger than California. Were Canada to become a state, it could mean 50 more House seats and two additional senators \u2014 auguring a real power shift in government.",
      "\"They\u2019d have a sizable delegation in the House,\" Amodei said. \u201c\"I don\u2019t think anybody thinks that\u2019s a great idea. Oh, by the way, how many Electoral College votes are they going to get?\"",
      "Trump\u2019s history of managing the U.S.-Canada relationship is intertwined with his own personal relationship with Trudeau who, up until this week, has been his only Canadian counterpart. At times, their relationship has been fruitful, like when they reworked the trade agreement governing commerce between their nations. But there has been animosity, too.",
      "Now, annexation threats have ignited a \"wave of patriotism in Canada\" unlike any Miller has seen.",
      "\"Not hiding the fact that it can do a lot more damage to Canada than the U.S.,\" Miller said, noting the U.S. is Canada\u2019s top trading partner. \"But we have a high pain threshold and we\u2019re ready to fight.\"",
      "There\u2019s a reason Canada believes it can win the fight, too. Its citizenry is united against relinquishing its national sovereignty, while the U.S. is divided over Trump's trade war \u2014 especially as the stock market slides.",
      "\"Trump\u2019s position is vulnerable because he doesn\u2019t have the support of the American business community,\" the Canadian official said. \"And we know that.\""
