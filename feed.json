      "Country singer Bailey Zimmerman is releasing his sophomore album, \u201cDifferent Night Same Rodeo.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- His is a Cinderella story.",
      "Before the big tours and country music award nominations, Bailey Zimmerman was growing up in the small town of Louisville, Illinois, working at the local meat processing plant and laying gas pipeline. Then, in 2020, he decided to upload videos of himself singing to social media \u2014 Black Stone Cherry's \u201cStay,\u201d and, later, an original.",
      "He quickly garnered a fan base on TikTok. It wasn't overnight, but it was fast. Soon, he inked a deal with Warner Music Nashville and released his debut full-length, 2023's \u201cReligiously. The Album.\u201d It peaked at No. 7 on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Now comes Friday, when he follows it up with a sophomore offering, \u201cDifferent Night Same Rodeo.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't know what I'm doing,\u201d Zimmerman, 25, tells The Associated Press through a smile. \u201cI randomly got into music in 2020, 2021, and I\u2019d never sang before. I\u2019d never wrote songs before.\u201d",
      "After \u201cReligiously. The Album.\u201d did well \u2014 something he didn't see coming \u2014 Zimmerman found himself trying to recreate it while writing for his second album. \u201cIt just didn't work,\u201d he says. \u201cI just found myself not really writing that great of songs because I\u2019m trying to write other songs that have already been written.\u201d",
      "So, he took a step back, and asked himself: \u201cWhat am I trying to do with my music? And what is the whole goal of this next album?\u201d The answer was simple: He wanted to tell stories from his life.",
      "\u201cYou didn't know what you were doing the first time. And you don't know what you're doing now,\u201d he told himself. \u201cSo just write songs that you love and try to write songs that you feel like people can relate to, you know, stories from things I\u2019ve been through.\u201d",

      "For his second album, Zimmerman wanted to make sure he worked with artists he had true relationships with.

Then, Combs invited Zimmerman to perform at his Hurricane Helene relief benefit \u201cConcert for Carolina.\u201d They hit it off, and the rest is history.

      "And it's not just the film that's a summer hit. The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack has topped the charts \u2014 debuting at No. 1 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and No. 8 on the all-genre Billboard 200.",
      "Here's how \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d became the year's surprising success story.",
      "The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack utilizes some of the best and brightest in the genre. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 \u2014 empowered girl groups used as references for the film\u2019s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X.",
      "It's one of the many reasons the musical film's soundtrack stands on its own. Filmmakers \u201creally did their homework,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, a music journalist who specializes in K-pop.",
      "Indeed, they did a lot of research. One of the film\u2019s directors, Maggie Kang, said that her team prioritized \u201crepresenting the fandom and the idols in a very specific way,\u201d as to not disappoint K-pop fans.",
      "They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys\u2019 hit song \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d for example, references the \u201990s K-pop group H.O.T.",
      "And it has worked. \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is the highest charting soundtrack of 2025, with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. To put that in perspective: Lorde's \u201cVirgin\u201d and Justin Bieber's \u201cSwag\u201d did the same.",
      "In some ways, it recalls Disney's \u201cEncanto,\u201d which topped the Billboard 200 and produced a No. 1 hit, \u201cWe Don't Talk About Bruno \u201d in 2022. Similarly, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d embraces \u201cthe original soundtrack, which is a lost art form,\u201d adds Benjamin.",
      "Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says the movie succeeds because it embraces animated musical tradition and authentic K-pop music production styles in equal measure. She considers \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d to be \u201ca musical with songs inspired by K-pop,\u201d not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. Where many animated films rely on adapting existing intellectual property, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is original. And it comes from an original perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely Korean, it\u2019s not completely Western and it\u2019s kind of right in that middle,\u201d says Kang. \u201cIt\u2019s like not pulled from one side; it\u2019s kind of flavors of both. So, I think that\u2019s what makes the movie feels a little different.\u201d",
      "And \u201cthe core story is what\u2019s drawing everybody in,\u201d says Kang.",
      "San Francisco-based cosplayer and content creator Nanci Alc\u00e1ntar, who goes by Naanny Lee online agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a K-pop group, but it also tells a story of their journey, of how they transform into powerful warriors,\u201d said Alc\u00e1ntar in Spanish. For her, it goes beyond K-pop \u2014 it\u2019s about the narrative.",
      "Kang\u2019s approach to cultural authenticity, too, may have contributed to the film\u2019s crossover appeal. Rather than explaining Korean elements like HUNTR/X\u2019s visit to a traditional medicine clinic or translating K-pop light stick culture for Western audiences, she opted for full immersion. \u201cWe just wanted everybody to just accept that they were in Korea,\u201d Kang said.",
      "The director said this method of \u201cthrowing people into the deep end of a culture\u201d breaks down barriers better than heavy-handed explanation. \u201cWe just wanted to keep everything feeling normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.\u201d",

      "Blues legend Buddy Guy will release a new album on Wednesday, his 89th birthday",
      "NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy \u2014 a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues \u2014 there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans \u2014 Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. among them.",
      "The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film \u201cSinners\u201d earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album \u201cAin't Done with the Blues.\u201d It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday.",
      "For the eight-time Grammy Award-winning musician, those recognitions aren't priority. The longevity of the music that made his life is his primary concern. \u201cLike I promised B.B. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press over the phone, \u201cI do the best I can to keep the blues alive.\u201d",
      "He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons \u201cAin't Done with the Blues\u201d is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten \u2014 like on the album closer \u201cTalk to Your Daughter,\u201d a rendition of the J.B. Lenoir tune.",
      "In Guy's performance, there's an undeniable universality. \u201cBlues is based on everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cA good time or a bad time.\u201d",
      "Or, another way Guy explains it: \u201cMusic is like a bowl of real good gumbo. They got all kinds of meat in there. You got chicken in there, you got sausage in there. You got a seafood in it. ... When we play music, we put everything in there.\u201d",
      "It's resonating. In its 2025 midyear report, Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, found that U.S. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of \u201cSinners.\u201d",

      "Returning director Pierre Perifel, writers Yoni Brenner and Etan Cohen and the same voice cast have done what all sequels do these days \u2014 amp it all up like everyone is on molly, try to hit the same emotional notes and layer an insane plot with the fate of the world at stake. It's hard to watch a franchise drift so expensively and pointlessly in Earth's orbit.",
      "The gang is all back: Sam Rockwell as Mr. Wolf,Marc Maron as safe-cracker Mr. Snake, Craig Robinson as master-of disguise Mr. Shark, Anthony Ramos as Mr. Piranha and Awkwafina as hacker Ms. Tarantula. We left them in the last movie walking out of prison early after good behavior and trying to turn their back on bad-hood.",
      "It's not that easy since would-be employers these days want to know about gaps in their job experience \u2014 they were robbing banks, after all \u2014 workplace trust issues and salary expectations. No one wants to hire a bunch of ex-cons.",
      "\u201cAnyone who wants to change has to start somewhere,\u201d Mr. Wolf, pushing the George Clooney-like charm offensive, begs one dubious interviewer. \u201cI'm just asking for a chance.\u201d",
      "A life on the straight-and-narrow is hard for four of the former baddies, but not Maron \u2014 so perfectly cast as the grouchy, self-loathing snake. Now he spends his days doing Vinyasa yoga, listening to Sabrina Carpenter's \u201cEspresso,\u201d telling people \"namaste\" and sips wheatgrass kombucha with dandelion. He's even more irritating.",
      "Soon all five are caught in a series of traps and double-crosses by a new robbery crew \u2014 Danielle Brooks\u2019 lollipop-licking venomous snow leopard, Maria Bakalova\u2019s Bulgarian wild boar engineer and Natasha Lyonne\u2019s wry raven, using her same vocal tick as on \u201cPoker Face.\u201d These dames have a plan to get very rich using a substance known as MacGuffinite, a clever \u2014 or lazy \u2014 joke on the object that everyone wants in a movie like this, which drives the plot.",

Then the rocket has to be stopped before a gadget aboard creates a \u201c24-carat catastrophe.\u201d",
      "The animation is amazingly kinetic and with no corners cut, from tiny bugs illuminated in a light beam at night to the bumpy way a truck moves on the highway. The franchise's love of vroooming and fishtailing Looney Tunes-like car chases stays intact, as does the wavy green air farts that emanate from Piranha.",

      "Based on Aaron Blabey\u2019s popular graphic book series, the first movie in 2022 drove hard into the nature of good and evil \u2014 like asking if DNA determines behavior \u2014 as our heroes whipsawed between heroic and villainous, to the glee of all the kiddies in the theater. \u201cWe may be bad, but we\u2019re so good at it,\u201d was the slogan. It was all nicely set against a zombie guinea pig uprising.",
      "This time the writers have just given up on what side of the ethical divide their anti-heroes are on. \u201cAre we bad again?\u201d ask the confused piranha. Replies Mr. Wolf: \u201cI get it. We're all over the place.\u201d Left unexplored is the concept of doing wrong for a greater good, and can being bad be excused if it stops a worse badness? \u201cWhat if the bad life was your best life?\u201d asks one of the newcomers. (Another thing to chew on: If \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d is a worse sequel, does that make \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d good?)",
      "When we say the gang is all here, they're all here without any editing: Zazie Beetz returns as Gov. Diane Foxington, Alex Borstein comes back as the top cop and even the kitten from the first film meows in the second. So is Richard Ayoade as Professor Marmalade, the evil guinea pig who is now surprisingly swole and tatted up in prison. He threatens again to steal the show and may if there's a \u201cThe Bad Guys 3.\u201d (There's going to be a \u201cThe Bad Guys 3.\u201d)",
      "The joy of \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d was that it was a respectful send-up of the movies of Quentin Tarantino and caper flicks like \u201cOcean\u2019s 11.\u201d This time, the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d series gets mocked, as does \u201cSilence of the Lambs,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d and maybe \u201cMoonraker,\u201d which is now 46 years old. But the subversion is painfully flat now: The first film in the franchise would have laughed at one climactic line in the second: \u201cWe've got one shot to save the world. Let's make it count!\u201d",
      "The three new villains may be a touch too much for younger viewers \u2014 the violence seems darker and more volcanic this time \u2014 but there's a very loud soundtrack that includes Busta Rhymes, Sofi Tukker and Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man.",
      "So what does it all mean? It means the folks behind \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d reunited for a shot to push the franchise into exciting areas, but \u2014 c'mon, everyone \u2014 they didn't make it count.",
      "\u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG for \u201caction/mild violence, rude humor, and language.\u201d Running time: 104 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Rene\u00e9 Rapp's second album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d gave the 25-year-old multi-hyphenate an outlet to work through the whirlwind that has been her career so far",
      "NEW YORK -- Rene\u00e9 Rapp was clear on her intentions for her sophomore album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d from the start.",
      "\u201cI wanted to love this,\u201d Rapp says. \u201cI wanted to be able to walk away from this and be so proud of myself and impressed, no matter what anybody else thought.\u201d Her first album, 2023's \u201cSnow Angel, \u201d  had been an experiment in figuring out her sound (a mix of pop, R&B and heart-wrenching ballads), and assembling a collection of songs that worked together. This album, out Friday, offered the chance to do it again, with an eye toward the way her life had changed in the intervening years.",
      "\u201cThat intention, and also wanting to prove it to myself, was really grueling,\u201d Rapp told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd also really fun.\u201d",
      "The writing process gave Rapp, 25, an outlet to work through the burnout-inducing whirlwind that was her career in those two years. Uncharacteristically restrained in its vocal styling, the album's lead single, \u201cLeave Me Alone,\u201d is strikingly open \u2014 clever zingers allude to her departure from HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d the media frenzy that surrounded her turn as Regina in the 2024 remake of \u201cMean Girls,\u201d and the external pressure she felt to put out more music after the positive reception of \u201cSnow Angel.\u201d Basically, anything that's been said about her in the last few years? She reframes it, poking fun at her reputation and the industry.",
      "\u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d felt like a proper introduction to the album, Rapp says, and \u201cBite Me\u201d \u2014 both a warning and a tease \u2014 the appropriate title. Paris Hilton and Monica Lewinsky were among the famous faces that teased the album upon its announcement, donning merch emblazoned with the title in bold print. Rapp herself posed in front of a newsstand filled with mock tabloids depicting her as a diva, concealed behind big sunglasses and a fur coat, to promote the second single, \u201cMad.\u201d (\u201cThat's a Rapp!\u201d the headline read.)",
      "\u201cIt really feels just like a time capsule of those two years of my life, a lot having to do with the business and the industry and people\u2019s expectations of me,\u201d Rapp says of the album. \u201cAnd then also me wanting things for myself and being confused where those two roads diverge.\u201d",
      "Rapp's confidence and humor is evident across the album, just as it is on stage \u2014 \u201cI write lyrics in the way that I talk,\u201d she says. Many of the tracks tackle the destabilizing emotions that accompany the beginning and end of relationships, whether platonic or romantic, and how her now-very public career has amplified the challenges of creating, and maintaining, those connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so surrounded all the time, but I feel so lonely, and it feels really heavy and isolating. And I think a lot of that is just being an artist. And I also think a lot of that is just like the nature of like the business, for better or for worse,\" she says. The can't-be-bothered attitude heard on \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d is countered by the ache of \u201cThat's So Funny,\u201d which recounts the end of a deeply affecting, but ultimately toxic friendship in Rapp's signature soaring vocals.",

      "Jeannie Seely, the soulful country music singer known for hits like \u201cDon\u2019t Touch Me,\u201d has died at 85",
      "NEW YORK -- Jeannie Seely, the soulful country music singer behind such standards like \u201cDon\u2019t Touch Me,\u201d has died. She was 85.",
      "Her publicist, Don Murry Grubbs, said she died Friday after succumbing to complications from an intestinal infection.",
      "Known as \u201cMiss Country Soul\u201d for her unique vocal style, Seely was a trailblazer for women in country music, celebrated for her spirited nonconformity and for a string of undeniable hits in the \u201860s and \u201970s.",
      "Her second husband, Gene Ward, died in December. In May, Seely revealed that she was in recovery after undergoing multiple back surgeries, two emergency procedures and spending 11 days in the ICU. She also suffered a bout of pneumonia.",
      "\u201cRehab is pretty tough, but each day is looking brighter and last night, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And it was neon, so I knew it was mine!\u201d she said in a statement at the time. \u201cThe unsinkable Seely is working her way back.\u201d",
      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \u201cDon\u2019t Touch Me,\u201d the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",

      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the \u201860s and \u201970s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \u201cDon't Touch Me,\u201d 1967's \u201cI'll Love You More (Than You Need)\u201d and 1973's \u201cCan I Sleep In Your Arms?\u201d, adapted from the folk song \u201cCan I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\u201d",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform, and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones, and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \u201cSunday\u2019s with Seely\u201d on Willie Nelson's Willie\u2019s Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her latest song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \u201cSuffertime,\u201d recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

      "Harrington Street, which is one block long, will also be called \u201cJerry Garcia Street.\" He died in 1995, but the band's popularity has only grown as younger generations discover the Dead's improvisational music, which blended rock, blues, folk and other styles.",

This week marks the return of the 23rd annual nine-day celebration, which kicks off Friday with a stacked slate that includes appearances from singer-actor Jennifer Hudson and Hall of Fame basketball player Dwyane Wade, screenings like Spike Lee 's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and intimate conversations with figures such as the Rev.

It allows for the completion of the story, so that we can move on to many, many, many more stories that need to be told.\u201d",

      "U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",
      "Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.",
      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",
      "American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.",
      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.",
      "Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.",
      "The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.",
      "American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.",
      "In a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d",
      "In one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes.\u201d She crosses out \u201cgenes\u201d and replaces it with \u201cjeans.\u201d",

      "The video appeared on American Eagle\u2019s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the campaign.",
      "While remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler\u2019s plan for an Aryan master race.",
      "Civil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right's promotion of the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people.",
      "Shalini Shankar, a cultural and linguistic anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, said she had problems with American Eagle's \u201cgenes\u201d versus \u201cjeans\u201d because it exacerbates a limited concept of beauty.",
      "\u201cAmerican Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,\u201d Shankar said. \u201cAnd that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.\u201d",
      "Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.",
      "Viewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad.",

      "\u201cI can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,\u201d Burrell said.",
      "American Eagle has been praised for diverse marketing in the past, including creating a denim hijab in 2017 and offering its Aerie lingerie brand in a wide range of sizes. A year ago, the company released a limited edition denim collection with tennis star Coco Gauff.",
      "The retailer has an ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion program that is primarily geared toward employees. Two days before announcing the Sweeney campaign, American Eagle named the latest recipients of its scholarship award for employees who are driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives.",
      "Marketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding \u201cgood jeans\u201d will be good for business.",
      "\u201cThey were probably thinking that this is going to be their moment,\" Myles Worthington, the founder and CEO of marketing and creative agency WORTHI. \"But this is doing the opposite and deeply distorting their brand.\"",
      "Melissa Murphy, a marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business, said she liked certain parts of the campaign but hoped it would be expanded to showcase people besides Sweeney for the \u201csake of the brand.\u201d",
      "Other experts say the buzz is good even if it's not uniformly positive.",
      "\u201cIf you try to follow all the rules, you\u2019ll make lots of people happy, but you\u2019ll fail,\u201d Adamson said. \u201cThe rocket won\u2019t take off. \u201d",

      "The nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center said it\u2019s unaware of any other cases in which a person on death row made similar claims to Black's about defibrillators or pacemakers. Black's attorneys said they haven't found a comparable case, either.",
      "Lee said the courts have \"universally determined that it is lawful to carry out the jury\u2019s sentence of execution given to Mr. Black for the heinous murders of Angela Clay and her daughters Lakeisha, age 6, and Latoya, age 9.\"",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Black's appeals. The execution would be Tennessee\u2019s second since May, after a pause for five years, first because of COVID-19 and then because of missteps by state corrections officials.",
      "Twenty-seven men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. The number of executions this year exceeds the 25 carried out last year and in 2018. It is the highest total since 2015, when 28 people were put to death.",
      "Black, 69, is in a wheelchair, and he has dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, his attorneys have said.",
      "The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator he has is a small, battery-powered electronic device that is surgically implanted in the chest. It serves as a pacemaker and an emergency defibrillator. Black\u2019s attorneys say in order to be sure it\u2019s off, a doctor must place a programming device over the implant site, sending it a deactivation command, with no surgery required.",
      "In mid-July, a trial court judge agreed with Black's attorneys that officials must have his device deactivated to avert the risk that it could cause unnecessary pain and prolong the execution. But the state Supreme Court intervened July 31 to overturn that decision, saying the other judge lacked the authority to order the change.",
      "The state has disputed that the lethal injection would cause Black's defibrillator to shock him. Even if shocks were triggered, Black wouldn\u2019t feel them, the state said.",

      "The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan",
      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. She hears their demands and fears. Some are practical \u2013 families need basics like food and water more than vaccines. Others are simply unfounded \u2013 the oral doses are meant to sterilize their kids.",
      "Amid rampant misinformation and immense pressure for the campaign to succeed, Ayaz said, some managers have instructed workers to falsely mark children as immunized. And the vaccines, which must be kept cold, aren\u2019t always stored correctly, she added.",
      "\u201cIn many places, our work is not done with honesty,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication \u2014 a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. They came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases of the natural virus were reported in Pakistanand Afghanistan. But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.",
      "Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio \u2014 which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.",
      "But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI \u2013 one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.",
      "In Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2013 which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure \u2013 local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.",
      "Officials tout the successes \u2013 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared \u2013 while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of polio workers and security staff have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.",
      "Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO\u2019s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers\u2019 tailored response in resistant pockets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.",
      "Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, the Gates Foundation and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.",
      "\u201cContinuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,\u201d he said.",
      "Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade \u2013 given to AP by current and former staffers \u2013 show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.",
      "The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.",
      "On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, \u201cvaccinators did not know about vaccine management,\u201d citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting \u201cmore used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.\u201d",
      "According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, \u201cresulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.\u201d",
      "Vaccination teams worked \u201cin a hurried manner,\u201d reports said, with \u201cno plan for monitoring or supervision.\u201d A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.",
      "Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it\u2019s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region\u2019s poverty and transience.",
      "\u201cMost of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,\u201d said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to talk to the press. \u201cMany people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.\u201d",
      "Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.",
      "\u201cWe have shared these problems with our senior officials,\u201d the worker told AP. \u201cThey know about it.\u201d",
      "In an email response to AP\u2019s questions about officials\u2019 knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted \u201coperational challenges\u201d in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has \u201crobust monitoring and evaluation processes.\u201d",
      "Worker Ayaz described \u201cfake finger marking\u201d \u2014 placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given.",
      "\u201cThere is so much pressure,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease \u2014 spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles \u2014 was among the world\u2019s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.",
      "Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.",
      "WHO says that as long as a single child remains infected, kids everywhere are at risk.",

      "In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.",
      "Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.",

But they acknowledge there simply isn\u2019t enough injectable vaccine \u2014 which uses no live virus and doesn\u2019t come with the risks of the oral vaccine \u2014 to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.",
      "More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven\u2019t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign\u2019s problems.",
      "Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he\u2019s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no management,\u201d he said, citing a lack of accountability.",
      "Last year, former WHO scientist Dr. T. Jacob John twice emailed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus calling for a \u201cmajor course correction.\u201d John shared the emails with AP and said he\u2019s received no response.",
      "\u201cWHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,\u201d John wrote.",
      "In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a \u201ccore pillar\u201d of eradication strategy and that \u201calmost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to step back and really care for the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.\u201d",
      "Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.",
      "Today, nearly all of the world\u2019s polio cases -- mostly in Africa and the Middle East -- are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong \u2013 particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort paralyzed a baby in Gaza.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,\u201d he said.",
      "With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. withdrew from WHO, and President Donald Trump has cut foreign aid. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.",
      "Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.",
      "\u201cWe have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn\u2019t buy us any progress,\u201d said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. \u201cIf this was a private company, we would demand results.\u201d",
      "Villagers, too, have protested the cost, staging hundreds of boycotts of immunization campaigns since 2023. Instead of polio vaccines, they ask for medicine, food and electricity.",
      "In Karachi, locals told AP they didn\u2019t understand the government\u2019s fixation on polio and complained of other issues \u2014 dirty water, heroin addiction. Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.",
      "The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an anti-vaccine sentiment growing in the U.S. and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it\u2019s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family\u2019s objections.",
      "\u201cIt results in disability,\u201d said Khan, without citing evidence for his belief. \u201cThey are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.\u201d",
      "Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. Now, people are angry about the focus on polio and lack of help for diseases like measles or tuberculosis, she said, spurring conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cPolio eradication has created a monster,\u201d Closser said. It doesn\u2019t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family.",
      "Workers see that continued mistrust every day.",
      "In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she'd prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it. They believe the false rumors that it will compromise their children\u2019s fertility.",
      "\u201cIf I allow it,\u201d the woman said, declining to be named over fears of family retribution, \u201cI will be beaten and thrown out.\u201d",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency plans to relax rules aimed at reducing auto tailpipe emissions",
      "DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric.",
      "As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That would cripple the legal basis for limiting emissions from things like power plants and motor vehicles.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",
      "The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook \u2014 repealing fines for automakers that don\u2019t meet federal fuel economy standards.",
      "Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don\u2019t meet the mileage standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don\u2019t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.",
      "That is all set to go away under the new law.",
      "Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California\u2019s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.",
      "It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles. And that's significant because transportation \u2014 which also includes ships, trains and planes \u2014 is the sector that contributes the most to planet-warming emissions in the U.S.",
      "Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation\u2019s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. EVs do not use gasoline or emit greenhouse gases.",
      "The Trump administration and the auto industry have said both rules were unreasonable for manufacturers.",
      "Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 \u2014 they're currently at about 8% \u2014 along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.",
      "The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035.",
      "But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden\u2019s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. NHTSA will likely reset or significantly weaken them.",
      "Then there are the fines that automakers will no longer face for falling short on the fuel economy rules.",
      "\u201cWith the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,\u201d NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement.",
      "Some legacy automakers have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for not meeting them. Just last year, Jeep-maker Stellantis paid $190.7 million for model years 2019 and 2020, and General Motors paid $128.2 million for the 2016 and 2017 model years.",

      "Elon Musk sharply criticized the big tax-and-spending bill in June, saying it \u201cgives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.\u201d Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the law's effect on those credits.",
      "The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn\u2019t be issued from the model year 2022 onward. Some automakers confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment further.",
      "Experts say without them, the law \u201cinvites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a \u201cstunning decision\u201d for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. She said it amounted to a windfall for companies that chose to pay penalties rather than produce more efficient cars.",
      "Carlson said backing away from future fines also \u201cposes a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.\u201d",
      "It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years. But changes could come for model year 2027 and beyond, they said.",
      "EVs aren't as profitable as gas-engine cars, so automakers may make fewer of them if they no longer have to offset emissions from their gasoline models. Already, some automakers have pulled back on their ambitions to go all-electric with a slower pace of EV sales growth.",
      "\u201cAutomakers also know every presidential administration eventually comes to an end, so they won\u2019t abandon their EV development efforts,\" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com. \"But they will reduce their near-term efforts in this area.\u201d",

      "U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates inched down again last year and the proportion of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates inched down again last year and the share of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high, according to federal data posted Thursday.",
      "The fraction of kids exempted from vaccine requirements rose to 4.1%, up from 3.7% the year before. It's the third record-breaking year in a row for the exemption rate, and the vast majority are parents withholding shots for nonmedical reasons.",
      "Meanwhile, 92.5% of 2024-25 kindergartners got their required measles-mumps-rubella shots, down slightly from the previous year. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination rate was 95% \u2014 the level that makes it unlikely that a single infection will spark a disease cluster or outbreak.",
      "The vaccination numbers were posted as the U.S. experiences its worst year for measles spread in more than three decades, with more than 1,300 cases so far.",
      "\u201cThe concern, of course, is that with a further dip in the (vaccination) coverage, we\u2019re going to see even more measles in the coming months,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "It's possible that this year's outbreaks may spur more parents to get their children vaccinated before they go to school, said O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "But Dr. Philip Huang isn't optimistic. Texas was particularly hard hits by measles this year, with more than half of the cases reported nationally. Despite that, the state passed a law making it easier for parents to get school vaccine exemptions for their kids.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Huang, Dallas County's health director.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traditionally releases the vaccination coverage data in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC officials usually speak to the trends and possible explanations, and stress the importance of vaccinations. This year, the agency quietly posted the data online and \u2014 when asked about it \u2014 emailed a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,\u201d the statement said, adding; \u201cVaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.\u201d",
      "The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past. That is in keeping with communications from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies.",

      "Public health officials focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and launching pads for community outbreaks.",
      "For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to school attendance mandates that required key vaccinations. All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against a number of diseases, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.",
      "All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving certain vaccines. And most also permit exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.",
      "In the last decade, the percentage of kindergartners with medical exemptions has held steady, at about 0.2%. But the percentage with nonmedical exemptions has risen.",
      "The rates can be influenced by policies that make it harder or easier to obtain exemptions, and by local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated. Online misinformation and the political divide that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines have led more parents to question routine childhood vaccinations, experts say.",
      "According to the CDC data, 15.4% of kindergartners had an exemption to one or more vaccines in Idaho in the last school year. But fewer than 0.5% did in Connecticut.",
      "It\u2019s good news that the vast majority of parents continue to get their kids vaccinated, O\u2019Leary said. And it\u2019s noteworthy that there is a gap between the percentage vaccinated and the percentage who are exempted \u2014 meaning there likely are unmet access issues, he added.",

      "Gone will be red Jell-O fruit cups, yogurt topped with brightly hued sprinkles and Cool Ranch Doritos \u2014 all foods made with synthetic dyes.",
      "In their place will be foods that contain colors made only from natural sources \u2014 such as vegetables, spices and seeds \u2014 after West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a sweeping new law in March banning seven artificial dyes from school meals.",
      "Other states have enacted similar laws that would strip artificial dyes from school meals, but West Virginia\u2019s action is the first to take effect, starting Aug. 1. It triggered a four-month sprint that that left state and local nutrition directors reeling.",
      "\u201cI think the initial reaction was like, \u2018Wow, what are we going to do?\u2019\" said Tony Crago, director of child nutrition for the West Virginia Department of Education. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d",
      "Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.",
      "\u201cWhen it went into law, it was shocking,\u201d said Diane Miller, who leads child nutrition and food services for Kanawha County Schools in the state\u2019s central region. \u201cWe began to realize that these dyes were in much more than just your cereals.\u201d",
      "West Virginia's ban on synthetic dyes was cheered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has successfully pressured food makers to agree to remove artificial colors from their products. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028.",
      "The move is aimed at halting potential health effects from the dyes, which have been linked to neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. It's part of a larger focus on limiting artificial ingredients in food, Morrisey said in March.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we\u2019re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of the dyes, citing mixed evidence of potential harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the color additives are safe when \u201cused properly,\u201d in the amounts and products approved by the agency. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, \u201cbut some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\u201d",
      "More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects.",
      "\u201cWhen you get rid of petroleum-based dyes, kids aren't gonna all suddenly be healthy,\u201d Makary said on a recent podcast. \u201cWe're not going to address the fact that 30% of our nation's kids have prediabetes by simply removing petroleum-based food dyes. But these are steps in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Nutrition experts agree that removing artificial colors from foods doesn\u2019t address the main drivers of America\u2019s chronic health problems. Those stem largely from ingredients such as added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",

      "Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. Overall, Best said she removed just five foods from her menus.",
      "General Mills said 98% of its products for schools were already made without the banned colors. The company \u201cwill be compliant\u201d with West Virginia's law immediately and plans to remove the dyes from school foods nationwide by next summer, said Mollie Wulff, a company spokesperson.",
      "In Miller\u2019s district, with 23,000 students in 67 schools, the new law affects about 10% of the foods served, she estimated. She expected some foods to contain artificial colors, like strawberry milk and Pop-Tarts. Others were surprising, such as pickles, salad dressing and certain snack chips.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018Oh my gosh, no more Doritos?'\" Miller said. The popular Cool Ranch flavor contains dyes Red 40, Blue 1 and Yellow 5.",

But for others, the presence of synthetic colors in school meals hasn\u2019t been an issue. Chris DeRico, nutrition director of Barbour County Schools, with 2,000 students, said few parents seemed worried about dyes.",

      "Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: \u201cSometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.\u201d",

      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\u201d said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don\u2019t have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies\u2019 lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breast feeding supplies and baby clothes but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She\u2019s heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade Friday.",
      "\u201cFor so long moms have been vilified and not supported,\u201d Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\u201cSo this time around, I didn\u2019t have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\u201d she said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s polarizing vaccine chief is leaving the agency after a brief tenure that drew the ire of biotech companies, patient groups and conservative allies of President Donald Trump.",
      "Dr. Vinay Prasad \u201cdid not want to be a distraction\u201d and was stepping down from his role as the FDA\u2019s top vaccine regulator \u201cto spend more time with his family,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement late Tuesday.",

      "That approach is at odds with Trump\u2019s Republican supporters, who generally favor speedier approvals and unfettered access to experimental treatments.

      "That was clear, they said, during the new panel's first meeting, in June. It featured a presentation by an anti-vaccine advocate that warned of dangers about a preservative used in a few flu vaccines, but the committee members didn't hear from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staffers about an analysis that concluded there was no link between the preservative and neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The new panel recommended that the preservative, thimerosal, be removed even as some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm.",
      "\u201cThat meeting was a travesty, honestly,\u201d said former ACIP member Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Stanford University.",
      "The 17 discharged experts last month published a shorter essay in the Journal of the American Medical Association that decried Kennedy's \u201cdestabilizing decisions.\" The focus was largely on their termination and on Kennedy\u2019s decision in May to stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women.",
      "In the new commentary, the ousted committee members took it one step further and prescribed some steps that could be taken to maintain scientifically sound vaccine recommendations.",
      "\u201cAn alternative to the Committee should be established quickly and \u2014 if necessary \u2014 independently from the federal government,\" they wrote. \u201cNo viable pathway exists to fully replace the prior trusted and unbiased ACIP structure and process. Instead, the alternatives must focus on limiting the damage to vaccination policy in the United States.\u201d",
      "Options included having professional organizations working together to harmonize vaccine recommendations or establishing an external auditor of ACIP recommendations. There are huge challenges to the ideas, including having access to the best data, the authors acknowledged.",

      "MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan -- Chanting anti-India slogans, hundreds of people rallied Tuesday in Pakistan-administered Kashmir to mark the sixth anniversary of India\u2019s revocation of the disputed region\u2019s semi-autonomous status.",
      "The rallies came nearly three months after Pakistan and India exchanged military strikes over a mass shooting in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, which New Delhi blamed on Islamabad, a charge Pakistan denied. The confrontation raised fears of a potential nuclear conflict before global powers defused the crisis.",
      "The protesters denounced the August 5, 2019, revocation of Kashmir's special status by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and demanded the restoration of statehood for the Himalayan region, which has been split between India and Pakistan and claimed by both in its entirety.",
      "The region has sparked two wars between the nuclear-armed neighbors since 1947, when the nations gained independence from Britain.",
      "The main protest Tuesday in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, drew hundreds of members of civil society and political parties.",

    "story": [
      "Bangladesh is marking one year of the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Aug. 5 amid hopes and desperation for a better democracy",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Abdur Rahman Tarif was talking to his sister Meherunnesa over the phone when the voice on the other end of the call suddenly fell silent.",
      "In that moment, Tarif knew something bad had happened. He rushed home, dodging the exchange of fire between security forces and protesters on the streets of Dhaka. When he finally arrived, he discovered his parents tending to his bleeding sister.",
      "A stray bullet had hit Meherunnesa's chest while she was standing beside the window of her room, Tarif said. She was taken to a hospital where doctors declared her dead.",
      "Meherunnesa, 23, was killed on Aug. 5 last year, the same day Bangladesh's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to flee the country in a massive student-led uprising, which ended her 15-year rule. For much of Bangladesh, Hasina's ouster was a moment of joy. Three days later, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took over the country as head of an interim government, promising to restore order and hold a new election after necessary reforms.",
      "A year on, Bangladesh is still reeling from that violence, and Hasina now faces trial for crimes against humanity in absentia, as she is in exile in India. But despite the bloodshed and lives lost, many say the prospect for a better Bangladesh with a liberal democracy, political tolerance and religious and communal harmony has remained a challenge.",
      "\u201cThe hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina\u2019s abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,\u201d said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, a New York-based human rights group.",
      "Bangladesh's anti-government movement exacted a heavy price. Hundreds of people, mostly students, were killed in violent protests. Angry demonstrators torched police stations and government buildings. Political opponents often clashed with each other, sometimes leading to gruesome killings.",
      "Like many Bangladeshis, Tarif and his sister took part in the uprising, hoping for a broader political change, particularly after when one of their cousins was shot and killed by security forces.",
      "\"We could not stay home and wanted Sheikh Hasina to go,\u201d 20-year-old Tarif said. \u201cUltimately we wanted a country without any discrimination and injustice.\u201d",
      "Today, his hopes lie shattered. \u201cWe wanted a change, but I am frustrated now,\u201d he said.",
      "After taking the reins, the Yunus-led administration formed 11 reform commissions, including a national consensus commission that is working with major political parties for future governments and the electoral process.",
      "Bickering political parties have failed to reach a consensus on a timetable and process for elections. Mob violence, political attacks on rival parties and groups, and hostility to women\u2019s rights and vulnerable minority groups by religious hardliners have all surged.",
      "Some of the fear and repression that marked Hasina\u2019s rule, and abuses such as widespread enforced disappearances, appear to have ended, rights groups say. However, they accuse the new government of using arbitrary detention to target perceived political opponents, especially Hasina\u2019s supporters, many of whom have been forced to go into hiding.",
      "Hasina\u2019s Awami League party, which remains banned, says more than two dozen of its supporters have died in custody over the last one year. The Yunus-led administration has announced a public holiday on Aug. 5 to mark Hasina's ouster.",
      "Human Rights Watch in a statement on July 30 said the interim government \u201cis falling short in implementing its challenging human rights agenda.\u201d It said violations against ethnic and other minority groups in some parts of Bangladesh have continued.",
      "\u201cThe interim government appears stuck, juggling an unreformed security sector, sometimes violent religious hardliners, and political groups that seem more focused on extracting vengeance on Hasina\u2019s supporters than protecting Bangladeshis\u2019 rights,\u201d said Ganguly.",

The students' party demands that the constitution be rewritten, if needed entirely, and says it won\u2019t allow the election without major reforms.",
      "Meanwhile, many hardline Islamists have either fled prison or have been released, and the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country\u2019s largest Islamist party, which has a controversial past, is now aspiring to a role in government. It often bitterly criticizes the BNP, equating it with Hasina\u2019s Awami League, and recently held a massive rally in Dhaka as a show of power. Critics fear that greater influence of the Islamist forces could fragment Bangladesh's political landscape further.",

      "Going online in Russia can be frustrating, complicated and even dangerous.",
      "It's not a network glitch but a deliberate, multipronged and long-term effort by authorities to bring the internet under the Kremlin's full control.

      "Kremlin efforts to control what Russians do, read or say online dates to 2011-12, when the internet was used to challenge authority. Independent media outlets bloomed, and anti-government demonstrations that were coordinated online erupted after disputed parliamentary elections and Putin\u2019s decision to run again for president.",

      "He estimates about half of all Russian websites are powered by foreign hosting and infrastructure providers, many offering better quality and price than domestic equivalents. A \u201chuge number\u201d of global websites and platforms use those providers, he said, so cutting them off means those websites \u201cautomatically become inaccessible\u201d in Russia too.",

      "Stella Rimington, the first female chief of Britain's MI5, has died at the age of 90",
      "LONDON -- Stella Rimington, the first female chief of Britain\u2019s MI5 intelligence agency and later a successful thriller writer, has died, her family said Monday. She was 90.",
      "The first woman to head a U.K. intelligence agency, Rimington was the inspiration for Judi Dench\u2019s portrayal of MI6 chief M in seven James Bond films.",
      "Her family said in a statement that Rimington died on Sunday \u201csurrounded by her beloved family and dogs and determinedly held on to the life she loved until her last breath.\u201d",
      "MI5\u2019s current director-general, Ken McCallum, said that \u201cas the first avowed female head of any intelligence agency in the world, Dame Stella broke through long-standing barriers and was a visible example of the importance of diversity in leadership.\u201d",
      "Born in London in 1935, Rimington studied English at Edinburgh University and later worked as an archivist. She was living in India with her diplomat husband in the mid-1960s when she was recruited by MI5, Britain\u2019s domestic security service, as a part-time clerk and typist in its New Delhi office.",
      "She joined the agency full-time after moving back to London in 1969 and rose through the ranks, overcoming rules that kept the most prestigious roles, such as recruiting and running agents, for men only.",
      "She worked in each of MI5\u2019s operational branches \u2014 counterespionage, counterterrorism and counter-subversion \u2014 at a time when MI5\u2019s work included sniffing out Soviet spies, infiltrating Northern Ireland militant groups and, controversially, spying on leftists, trade union leaders and other alleged subversives.",
      "Rimington acknowledged in 2001 that the organization \u201cmay have been a bit over-enthusiastic\u201d in some of its snooping on domestic targets during the Cold War.",
      "Rimington was appointed MI5 director-general in 1992, the first head of the organization to be named in public, and her tenure saw the secretive organization become slightly more open.",
      "Dench\u2019s first appearance as M, a role formerly played by men, was in \u201cGoldenEye\u201d in 1995. The film\u2019s producers said the casting was inspired by Rimington\u2019s appointment.",
      "After stepping down in 1996, Rimington was made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight, by Queen Elizabeth II.",

      "Five years after the Beirut port explosion, families of victims are still seeking justice",
      "BSALIM, Lebanon -- George Bezdjian remembers searching for his daughter, Jessica, after a massive explosion at Beirut's port five years ago. He found her at the St. Georges Hospital where she worked as a nurse.",
      "The hospital was in the path of the blast and was heavily damaged. He found his daughter lying on the floor as her colleagues tried to revive her. They weren't able to save her. She was one of four medical staff killed there.",
      "\u201cI started telling God that living for 60 years is more than enough. If you're going to take someone from the family, take me and leave her alive,\u201d he told The Associated Press from his home in Bsalim, some 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) away from the port. He sat in a corner where he put up portraits of Jessica next to burning incense to honor her.",
      "\u201cI begged him, but he didn\u2019t reply to me.\u201d",
      "The Aug. 4, 2020 blast in Beirut\u2019s port tore through the Lebanese capital after hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a warehouse. The gigantic explosion killed at least 218 people, according to an AP count, wounded more than 6,000 others and devastated large swathes of Beirut, causing billions of dollars in damages.",
      "It further angered the nation, already in economic free-fall after decades of corruption and financial crimes. Many family members of the victims pinned their hopes on Judge Tarek Bitar, who was tasked with investigating the explosion. The maverick judge shook the country\u2019s ruling elite, pursuing top officials, who for years obstructed his investigation.",
      "But five years after the blast, no official has been convicted as the probe stalled. And the widespread rage over the explosion and years of apparent negligence from a web of political, security and judicial officials has faded as Lebanon's economy further crumbled and conflict rocked the country.",
      "Judge Bitar had aimed to release the indictment last year but it was stalled by months of war between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group that decimated large swaths of southern and eastern Lebanon, killing some 4,000 people.",
      "In early 2025, Lebanon elected President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and a Cabinet that came to power on reformist platforms. They vowed that completing the port probe and holding the perpetrators to account would be a priority.",
      "\u201cThere will be no settlement in the port case before there is accountability,\u201d Salam said Sunday.",
      "Bitar, apparently galvanized by these developments, summoned a handful of senior political and security officials in July, as well as three judges in a new push for the case, but was unable to release an indictment over the summer as had been widely expected.",
      "However, the judge has been working on an additional phase of his investigation \u2014 now some 1,200 pages in length \u2014 aiming for the indictment to be out by the end of the year, according to four judicial officials and two security officials. They all spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "Before completing his own report, he is waiting to receive a fourth and final report from France, which has conducted its own probe into the blast given that several of those killed are citizens of the European country. Bitar since 2021 had received three technical reports, while the fourth will be the French investigation's conclusion, which also looks at the cause of the explosion, the officials added.",

      "Despite the malaise across much of the troubled country, Kayan Tlais, brother of port supervisor Mohammad Tlais who was killed in the blast, is hopeful that the indictment will see the light of day. He says he\u2019s encouraged by Bitar\u2019s tenacity and Lebanon\u2019s new leadership.",
      "\u201cWe do have judges with integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president, prime minister, and all those who came and were voted in do give us hope \u2026 they are all the right people in the right place.\u201d",
      "The port and the surrounding Beirut neighborhoods that were leveled in the deadly blast appear functional again, but there are still scars. The most visible are what\u2019s left standing of the mammoth grain silos at the port, which withstood the force of the blast but later partly collapsed in 2022 after a series of fires. Culture Minister Ghassan Salameh Sunday classified them as historical monuments.",
      "There was no centralized effort by the cash-strapped Lebanese government to rebuild the surrounding neighborhoods. An initiative by the World Bank, Europe and United Nations to fund recovery projects was slow to kick off, while larger reconstruction projects were contingent on reforms that never came.",
      "Many family and business owners fixed their damaged property out of pocket or reached out to charities and grassroots initiatives.",
      "A 2022 survey by the Beirut Urban Lab, a research center at the American University of Beirut, found that 60% to 80% of apartments and businesses damaged in the blast had been repaired.",

      "Bangladesh is marking the first anniversary of the ouster of longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a student-led uprising",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) \u2014 Bangladesh \u2019s interim leader Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday marked the anniversary of last year's student-led uprising by saying its spirit would build the future of the South Asian nation's democracy.",
      "Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate for his past work developing microcredit markets, spoke as the nation commemorated the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to neighboring India. But the event was held amid growing frustration over the interim administration's failure to restore order and bring political bickering under control.",
      "Yunus, flanked by senior leaders of major political parties, announced a road map aimed at national unity, democratic reforms and inclusive governance. A student group that led the anti-Hasina movement had formed a new political party, National Citizen Party, and campaigned for the declaration.",
      "Senior leaders of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, and the Jamaat-e-Islami party were present Tuesday. Zia is Hasina\u2019s archrival, and her party is the main contender for power in the next election, expected early next year.",
      "The Yunus-led administration has banned the former ruling party, which had governed Bangladesh for 15 years since 2009. Hasina remains in exile. She faces trial for crimes against humanity over the hundreds of deaths during the student-led uprising.",

      "The presence of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, the country\u2019s largest Islamist party, was especially visible Tuesday on the streets of the capital, Dhaka. The supporters of its student wing carried the flags of Bangladesh and Palestine.",
      "Bangladesh is at a crossroads, with bickering political parties struggling to find a way forward with inclusive politics. The rise of the Jamaat-e-Islami and other Islamist forces has drawn attention since Hasina's ouster.",
      "Yunus has promised an internationally acceptable election, but his critics say the election could be questionable without the Awami League party as it still has a significant support base.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. has suspended live cattle imports from Mexico due to concerns about the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite found in southern Mexico",
      "HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States\u2019 suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Mart\u00edn Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border.",
      "Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. His family has faced punishing droughts before but has never before had to contend with the economic hit of a new scourge: the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite.",
      "U.S. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July \u2013 the third suspension of the past eight months \u2014 due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north.",
      "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals\u2019 skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Infected animals are a serious threat to herds.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it a \"devastating pest\" and said in June that it poses a threat to \u201cour livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.\u201d It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago.",
      "As part of its strategy the U.S. is preparing to breed billions of sterile flies and release them in Mexico and southern Texas. The aim is for the sterile males to mate with females in the wild who then produce no offspring.",
      "The U.S. ban on live cattle also applies to horses and bison imports. It hit a ranching sector already weakened by drought and specifically a cattle export business that generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year. This year, Mexican ranchers have exported fewer than 200,000 head of cattle, which is less than half what they historically send in the same period.",
      "For Ibarra Vargas, considered a comparatively small rancher by Sonora\u2019s beef-centric standards, the inability to send his calves across the border has made him rethink everything.",
      "The repeated bans on Mexican cows by U.S. authorities has pushed his family to branch into beekeeping, raising sheep and selling cow's milk. What he earns is just a fraction of what he earned by exporting live cattle, but he is trying to hold on through the lean times.",
      "\u201cTiempos de vacas flacas\" \u2014 times of the lean cows \u2014 as he calls them.",
      "\u201cAt least it lets us continue\u201d ranching, the 57-year-old said with a white cowboy hat perched on his head.",
      "Even as ranchers in Sonora intensify their efforts to make sure the parasitic fly never makes it into their state, they\u2019ve had to seek new markets.",
      "In the past two months, they\u2019ve sold more than 35,000 mature cows within Mexico at a significant loss.",

      "Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as \u201cmeat boutiques.\"",
      "There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. feedlots. The switch is not easy.",

They said his words \u201cgood afternoon, Copacabana, good afternoon my Brazil, a hug to everyone, this is for our freedom\" \u2014 broadcast from a cell phone of one of his sons during a Sunday protest in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 cannot \u201cbe regarded as ignoring precautionary measures or as a criminal act.\u201d",

      "Bolsonaro is expected to remain in Brasilia for his house arrest as he is not allowed to travel. He also has a house in Rio de Janeiro, where he held his electoral base as a lawmaker for three decades. The former army captain is the fourth former president of Brazil to be arrested since the end of the country's military rule from 1964 to 1985, which Bolsonaro supported.",
      "The move from the Brazilian justice comes a day after tens of thousands of Bolsonaro supporters took the streets in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio, pleading for Brazil\u2019s congress to pardon him and hundreds of others who are either under trial or jailed for their roles in the destruction of government buildings in Brasilia on Jan. 8, 2023.",

      "China has taken a firm stance against U.S. demands.",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\u201cChina will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\u201d China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\u201cCoercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \u201ctough\u201d negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \u201cI believe that we have the makings of a deal,\u201d Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Donald Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \u201cRealizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\u201d for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "When Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China\u2019s consistent official stance,\u201d said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \u201cthe one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Trump has made it clear he wants a \u201cheadline-grabbing deal\u201d with Xi, \u201cso rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \u201cstrategic solidarity\u201d with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\u201cBeijing simply can\u2019t afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\u201d",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 Australia said Tuesday it accepted a Japanese company's bid for a lucrative and hotly contested contract to build Australian warships, expected to be worth 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.5 billion).",
      "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries\u2019 Mogami-class frigate won the deal over rival Germany\u2019s MEKO A-200 from Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems. Japan\u2019s government lobbied heavily for the deal after missing out on Australia\u2019s submarines contract to a French company in 2016.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly the biggest defense industry agreement that will ever have been struck between Japan and Australia,\u201d Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters when he announced the deal Tuesday. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s really one of the biggest defense exports that Japan has ever engaged in.\u201d",
      "The fleet of 11 naval vessels will replace Australia\u2019s ageing fleet of ANZAC-class ships. Three of the frigates will be built in Japan, with the first scheduled to be operational Australia in 2030, and the remaining eight due for construction in Australia.",
      "Australian news outlets reported that the German company\u2019s bid had emphasized their vessel\u2019s cheaper price and their greater experience building ships abroad. But Pat Conroy, Australia\u2019s Minister for Defense Industry, said the Mogami-class frigate was a \u201cclear winner\u201d when assessed by \u201ccost, capability and meeting our schedule of delivery.\u201d",
      "The vessels have a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles (18,520 kilometers) and 32 vertical launch cells capable of launching long-range missiles. The frigates can operate with a crew of 90, compared to the 170 needed to operate the ANZAC-class ships.",
      "Mitsubishi\u2019s win was a boon for Japan\u2019s defense industry, which has not built naval vessels abroad before. Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, considers Australia a semi-ally and has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions in the disputed South China Sea.",

      "NEW YORK -- The vast majority of U.S. adults are at least somewhat stressed about the cost of groceries, a new poll finds, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs remain widespread.",
      "About half of all Americans say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of everyday essentials.",
      "Other financial stressors \u2014 like the cost of housing or the amount of money in their bank accounts \u2014 are also broadly felt, but they weigh more heavily on younger Americans, who are less likely than older adults to have significant savings or own property.",

      "Adam Bush, 19, based in Portland, New York, is one of those younger Americans who has used pay-later services for things like groceries or entertainment. Bush works as a welder, fabricating parts for trucks for Toyota, and makes under $50,000 per year.",

      "Esther Bland, 78, who lives in Buckley, Washington, said groceries are a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress \u2014 but only because her local food banks fill the gap. Bland relies on her Social Security and disability payments each month to cover her rent and other expenses \u2014 such as veterinary care for her dogs \u2014 in retirement, after decades working in an office processing product orders.",
      "\u201cI have no savings,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm not sure what's going on politically when it comes to the food banks, but if I lost that, groceries would absolutely be a major source of stress.\u201d",

      "\u201cSoap, paper towels, toilet paper. I buy gas at Costco, but we haven't seen $3 a gallon here in a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI stay home a lot. I only put about 50 miles on my car a week.\u201d",
      "According to the poll, 64% of the lowest-income Americans \u2014 those who have a household income of less than $30,000 a year \u2014 say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d stressor. That's compared with about 4 in 10 Americans who have a household income of $100,000 or more.",
      "But even within that higher-income group, only about 2 in 10 say grocery costs aren't a worry at all.",
      "Housing is another substantial source of worry for U.S. adults \u2014 along with their savings, their income and the cost of health care. About half of U.S. adults say housing is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll, while about 4 in 10 say that about the amount of money they get paid, the amount of money they have saved and the cost of health care.",

      "But some groups are feeling much more anxiety about their finances than others. Women, for instance, are more likely than men to report high levels of stress about their income, savings, the cost of groceries and the cost of health care. Hispanic adults are also particularly concerned about housing costs and both credit card and student debt.

      "The Culinary Workers Union representing 60,000 hospitality workers in Nevada has achieved a historic victory on the Las Vegas Strip",
      "LAS VEGAS -- When Susana Pacheco accepted a housekeeping job at a casino on the Las Vegas Strip 16 years ago, she believed it was a step toward stability for her and her 2-year-old daughter.",
      "But the single mom found herself exhausted, falling behind on bills and without access to stable health insurance, caught in a cycle of low pay and little support. For years, she said, there was no safety net in sight \u2014 until now.",
      "For 25 years, her employer, the Venetian, had resisted organizing efforts as one of the last holdouts on the Strip, locked in a prolonged standoff with the Culinary Workers Union. But a recent change in ownership opened the Venetian\u2019s doors to union representation just as the Strip\u2019s newest casino, the Fontainebleau, was also inking its first labor contract.",
      "The historic deals finalized late last year mark a major turning point: For the first time in the Culinary Union's 90-year history, all major casinos on the Strip are unionized. Backed by 60,000 members, most of them in Las Vegas, it is the largest labor union in Nevada. Experts say the Culinary Union\u2019s success is a notable exception in a national landscape where union membership overall is declining.",
      "\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve shown that change can be a positive force, and I\u2019m confident that this partnership will continue to benefit us all in the years to come,\" Patrick Nichols, president and CEO of the Venetian, said shortly after workers approved the deal.",
      "Pacheco says their new contract has already reshaped her day-to-day life. The housekeeper no longer races against the clock to clean an unmanageable number of hotel suites, and she\u2019s spending more quality time with her children because of the better pay and guaranteed days off.",
      "\u201cNow with the union, we have a voice,\u201d Pacheco said.",
      "These gains come at a time when union membership nationally is at an all-time low, and despite Republican-led efforts over the years to curb union power. About 10% of U.S. workers belonged to a union in 2024, down from 20% in 1983, the first year for which data is available, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.",
      "President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order seeking to end collective bargaining for certain federal employees that led to union leaders suing the administration. Nevada and more than two dozen other states now have so-called \u201cright to work\u201d laws that let workers opt out of union membership and dues. GOP lawmakers have also supported changes to the National Labor Relations Board and other regulatory bodies, seeking to reduce what they view as overly burdensome rules on businesses.",
      "Ruben Garcia, professor and director of the workplace program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, said the Culinary Union's resilience stems from its deep roots in Las Vegas, its ability to adapt to the growth and corporatization of the casino industry, and its long history of navigating complex power dynamics with casino owners and operators.",
      "He said the consolidation of casinos on the Las Vegas Strip mirrors the dominance of the Big Three automakers in Detroit. A few powerful companies \u2014 MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts \u2014 now control most of the dozens of casinos along Las Vegas Boulevard.",
      "\u201cThat consolidation can make things harder for workers in some ways, but it also gives unions one large target,\" Garcia said.",

      "That dynamic worked in the union's favor in 2023, when the threat of a major strike by 35,000 hospitality workers with expired contracts loomed over the Strip. But a last-minute deal with Caesars narrowly averted the walkout, and it triggered a domino effect across the Strip, with the union quickly finalizing similar deals for workers at MGM Resorts and Wynn properties.",
      "The latest contracts secured a historic 32% bump in pay over the life of the five-year contract. Union casino workers will earn an average $35 hourly, including benefits, by the end of it.",
      "The union's influence also extends far beyond the casino floor. With its ability to mobilize thousands of its members for canvassing and voter outreach, the union's endorsements are highly coveted, particularly among Democrats, and can signal who has the best shot at winning working-class votes.",
      "The union's path hasn't always been smooth though. Michael Green, a history professor at UNLV, noted the Culinary Union has long faced resistance.",
      "\u201cHistorically, there have always been people who are anti-union,\u201d Green said.",
      "Earlier this year, two food service workers in Las Vegas filed federal complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the union of deducting dues despite their objections to union membership. It varies at each casino, but between 95 to 98% of workers opt in to union membership, according to the union.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Culinary Union bosses deserve my support,\u201d said one of the workers, Renee Guerrero, who works at T-Mobile Arena on the Strip. \u201cTheir actions since I attempted to exercise my right to stop dues payments only confirms my decision.\u201d",
      "But longtime union members like Paul Anthony see things differently. Anthony, a food server at the Bellagio and a Culinary member for nearly 40 years, said his union benefits \u2014 free family health insurance, reliable pay raises, job security and a pension \u2014 helped him to build a lasting career in the hospitality industry.",
      "\u201cA lot of times it is an industry that doesn't have longevity,\" he said. But on the Strip, it's a job that people can do for \u201c20 years, 30 years, 40 years.\u201d",
      "Ted Pappageorge, the union's secretary-treasurer and lead negotiator, said the union calls this the \u201cLas Vegas dream.\u201d",

      "Nations have started a crucial meeting to finalize a treaty to tackle the global plastic pollution crisis",
      "Nations kicked off a meeting on Tuesday to try to complete a landmark treaty aimed at ending the plastic pollution crisis that affects every ecosystem and person on the planet.",
      "It\u2019s the sixth time negotiators are meeting and they hope the last. A key split is whether the treaty should require cutting plastic production, with powerful oil-producing nations opposed; most plastic is made from fossil fuels. They say redesign, recycling and reuse can solve the problem, while other countries and some major companies say that\u2019s not enough.",
      "Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the chair of the negotiating committee that aims to develop a legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, said: \u201cWe are pretty sure nobody wants plastic pollution. Still, we have not been able to find a systematic and an effective way to stop it.\u201d",
      "Valdivieso believes the 10-day gathering in Geneva can be groundbreaking.",
      "\u201cFor the first time in history, the world is within our reach of a legally binding international instrument to end plastic pollution,\u201d said Valdivieso, who is also Ecuador's ambassador to Britain. \u201cWe are facing a global crisis. Plastic pollution is damaging ecosystems, polluting our oceans and rivers, threatening biodiversity, harming human health and unfairly impacting the most vulnerable. The urgency is real.\u201d",
      "Only a treaty can mobilize the necessary global action, said Angelique Pouponneau, lead ocean negotiator for 39 small island and low-lying coastal developing states. At home in the Seychelles, Pouponneau said, plastic contaminates the fish they eat, piles up on beaches and chokes the ocean to undermine tourism and their way of life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s final opportunity to get this done and to get it done right,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be a tragedy if we didn\u2019t live up to our mandate.\"",
      "United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said the issues are complex, but the crisis is \u201creally spiraling\u201d and there's a narrow pathway to a treaty. She said many countries agree on redesigning plastic products to be recycled and improving waste management, for example.",
      "\u201cWe need to get a solution to this problem. Everybody wants it. I\u2019ve yet to meet somebody who is in favor of plastic pollution,\u201d Andersen said.",
      "Between 19 million and 23 million tons of plastic waste leak into aquatic ecosystems annually, which could jump 50% by 2040 without urgent action, according to the UN.",
      "In March 2022, 175 nations agreed to make the first legally binding treaty on plastics pollution by the end of 2024. It was to address the full life cycle of plastic, including production, design and disposal.",
      "Talks last year in South Korea were supposed to be the final round, but they adjourned in December at an impasse over cutting production. Every year, the world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic, and that could grow by about 70% by 2040 without policy changes.",
      "About 100 countries want to limit production as well as tackle cleanup and recycling. Many have said it's essential to address toxic chemicals.",
      "Panama led an effort in South Korea to address production in the treaty. Negotiator Debbra Cisneros said they'll do so again in Geneva because they strongly believe in addressing pollution at the source, not just through downstream measures like waste management.",
      "\u201cIf we shy away from that ambition now, we risk adopting an agreement that is politically convenient, but environmentally speaking, is ineffective,\u201d she said.",
      "About 300 businesses that are members of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty \u2014 companies such as Walmart, the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, and L\u2019Or\u00e9al \u2014 support reducing production along with increasing recycling and reuse. The coalition includes major food and beverage companies and retailers who want an effective, binding treaty with global rules to spare them the headaches of differing approaches in different countries.",

      "China, the United States and Germany lead the global plastics trade by exports and imports, according to the Plastics Industry Association.",
      "For any proposal to make it into the treaty, every nation must agree. Some countries want to change the process so decisions may be made by a vote if necessary. India, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and others have opposed that, arguing that consensus is vital to an effective treaty.",
      "Negotiators are discussing making some provisions opt-in or opt-out to avoid a stalemate. Bjorn Beeler, international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network, said that would mean a treaty without teeth or obligations, with little value.

      "President Donald Trump has a pattern of dismissing or altering data that reflects poorly on him",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the coronavirus surged during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, he called for a simple fix: Limit the amount of testing so the deadly outbreak looked less severe. When he lost the 2020 election, he had a ready-made reason: The vote count was fraudulent.",
      "And on Friday, when the July jobs report revisions showed a distressed economy, Trump had an answer: He fired the official in charge of the data and called the report of a sharp slowdown in hiring \u201cphony.\u201d",
      "Trump has a go-to playbook if the numbers reveal uncomfortable realities, and that\u2019s to discredit or conceal the figures and to attack the messenger \u2014 all of which can hurt the president's efforts to convince the world that America is getting stronger.",
      "\u201cOur democratic system and the strength of our private economy depend on the honest flow of information about our economy, our government and our society,\u201d said Douglas Elmendorf, a Harvard University professor who was formerly director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cThe Trump administration is trying to suppress honest analysis.\u201d",
      "The president's strategy carries significant risks for his own administration and a broader economy that depends on politics-free data. His denouncements threaten to lower trust in government and erode public accountability, and any manipulation of federal data could result in policy choices made on faulty numbers, causing larger problems for both the president and the country.",
      "The White House disputes any claims that Trump wants to hide numbers that undermine his preferred narratives. It emphasized that Goldman Sachs found that the two-month revisions on the jobs report were the largest since 1968, outside of a recession, and that should be a source of concern regarding the integrity of the data. Trump's aides say their fundamental focus is ensuring that any data gives an accurate view of reality.",
      "Trump has a long history of dismissing data when it reflects poorly on him and extolling or even fabricating more favorable numbers, a pattern that includes his net worth, his family business, election results and government figures:",
      "\u2014 Judge Arthur Engoron ruled in a lawsuit brought by the state of New York that Trump and his company deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing loans.",
      "\u2014 Trump has claimed that the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections were each rigged. Trump won the 2016 presidential election by clinching the Electoral College, but he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, a sore spot that led him to falsely claim that millions of immigrants living in the country illegally had cast ballots. He lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden but falsely claimed he had won it, despite multiple lawsuits failing to prove his case.",
      "\u2014 In 2019, as Hurricane Dorian neared the East Coast, Trump warned Alabama that the storm was coming its way. Forecasters pushed back, saying Alabama was not at risk. Trump later displayed a map in the Oval Office that had been altered with a black Sharpie \u2014 his signature pen \u2014 to include Alabama in the potential path of the storm.",
      "\u2014 Trump's administration has stopped posting reports on climate change, canceled studies on vaccine access and removed data on gender identity from government sites.",
      "\u2014 As pandemic deaths mounted, Trump suggested that there should be less testing. \u201cWhen you do testing to that extent, you\u2019re going to find more people,\u201d Trump said at a June 2020 rally in Oklahoma. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find more cases. So I said to my people, \u2018Slow the testing down, please.\u2019\u201d",
      "While Trump's actions have drawn outcry from economists, scientists and public interest groups, Elmendorf noted that Trump's actions regarding economic data could be tempered by Congress, which could put limits on Trump by whom he chooses to lead federal agencies, for example.",
      "\u201cOutside observers can only do so much,\" Elmendorf said. \u201cThe power to push back against the president rests with the Congress. They have not exercised that power, but they could.\u201d",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, took aim at the size of the downward revisions in the jobs report (a combined 258,000 reduction in May and June) to suggest that the report had credibility issues. He said Trump is focused on getting dependable numbers, despite the president linking the issue to politics by claiming the revisions were meant to make Republicans look bad.",
      "\u201cThe president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers, they\u2019re more transparent and more reliable,\u201d Hassett said Sunday on NBC News.",

      "The unprecedented early closure of the fishery follows a report by The Associated Press last week detailing a record surge in the krill catch after a longstanding conservation framework was allowed to lapse with no plan in place to handle growing pressures in the world's southernmost fishery.",

      "The U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments last year failed to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and create a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula.",
      "In the absence of a deal, industrial trawlers were allowed this season to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales, penguins and seals. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last season\u2019s haul, according to an internal CCAMLR report obtained by the AP.",
      "Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill\u2019s Omega-3 rich oil \u2013 for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements \u2014 have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill \u2014 until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.",

      "Somalia is seeing quiet agricultural revolution centered around camels",
      "MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Camels have long been the backbone of Somalia 's pastoralist culture, feeding families, transporting goods and standing tall in local folklore. But on the dusty outskirts of the capital, the camel now finds itself at the center of an agricultural revolution that could redefine Somali farming.",
      "On a breezy Wednesday morning in mid-June, The Associated Press visited Beder Camel Farm \u2014 one of a new generation of camel dairies springing up around Mogadishu.",
      "Dozens of camels sauntered around sandy paddocks while others nibbled on fresh fodder under the watchful eyes of herders. In a nearby shed, workers carefully milked the animals and collected the frothy yield in sanitized containers.",
      "Demand for camel milk is growing, buoyed by a wave of local entrepreneurs who see untapped potential in a traditional resource.",
      "Somalia is home to over 7 million camels \u2014 more than any other country on Earth \u2014 but only a fraction of that milk has ever reached urban grocery shelves, according to industry estimates.",
      "At the heart of the shift toward a modern approach to camel milk production is Dr. Abdirisak Mire Hashi, a veterinarian and the farm\u2019s manager. For Hashi, it's not only about profit \u2014 it's about preserving heritage while embracing progress.",
      "\u201cSomalis take pride in their heritage of raising camels. However, the way camels are raised has changed significantly over time,\" Hashi told The Associated Press as he inspected a milking herd.",
      "Each camel at Beder now produces up to 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of milk daily \u2014 double what traditional herders typically yield. The increase is attributed to new investments in veterinary care, better feed, and modern milking practices. The camels are routinely checked by vets, given nutritional supplements, and grazed on scientifically blended fodder, a far cry from the roaming nomadic herds of decades gone by.",
      "\u201cWe were among the first to establish this kind of farm back in 2006, when very few people even knew about commercial camel milk production,\u201d said Jama Omar, CEO of Beder Camel Farm. \u201cOther farms have entered the market since then, but we currently hold around 40% of the market share.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe employ nearly 200 full-time staff,\u201d he added. \u201cIn addition, we bring in seasonal workers during key periods such as planting and harvest.\u201d",
      "The farm\u2019s biggest leap may be its yogurt factory \u2014 the first in Somalia dedicated to processing camel milk into yogurt.",
      "Inside the factory, workers in white coats oversee stainless steel vats as fresh milk is cultured and packed. The final product is sold under the Beder brand which now retails in urban supermarkets across Mogadishu.",
      "Nelson Njoki Githu, a Kenyan-born food engineer overseeing the production line, says camel milk yogurt isn\u2019t just a novelty \u2014 it fills an important nutritional gap for local consumers.",
      "\u201cThe number one benefit compared to cow milk is that camel milk has lower levels of lactose,\u201d Githu explained. \u201cPeople with lactose intolerance can consume this milk without any issue. Again, the vitamin levels are higher, especially vitamin C, iron and zinc, compared to cow milk.\u201d",

      "NATO has started coordinating regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine, most bought from the U.S. This follows the Netherlands' announcement to provide air defense equipment and ammunition worth 500 million euros",
      "BRUSSELS -- NATO started coordinating regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine after the Netherlands said it would provide air defense equipment, ammunition and other military aid worth 500 million euros ($578 million), most bought from the U.S.",
      "Two deliveries are expected this month. The equipment that will be provided is based on Ukraine\u2019s priority needs on the battlefield. NATO allies then locate the weapons and ammunition and send them on.",
      "\u201cPackages will be prepared rapidly and issued on a regular basis,\u201d NATO said late Monday",
      "Air defense systems are in greatest need. The United Nations has said that Russia\u2019s relentless pounding of urban areas behind the front line has killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians.",
      "Russia\u2019s bigger army is also making slow but costly progress along the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line. Currently, it is waging an operation to take the eastern city of Pokrovsk, a logistical hub whose fall could allow it to drive deeper into Ukraine.",
      "European allies and Canada are buying most of the equipment they plan to send from the United States, which has greater stocks of ready military materiel, as well as more effective weapons. The Trump administration is not giving any arms to Ukraine.",

      "The friendliness between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump was seen as a relationship like no other",
      "NEW DELHI -- The men shared bear hugs, showered praise on each other and made appearances side by side at stadium rallies \u2014 a big optics boost for two populist leaders with ideological similarities. Each called the other a good friend.",
      "In India, the bonhomie between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump was seen as a relationship like no other. That is, until a series of events gummed up the works.",
      "From Trump\u2019s tariffs and India\u2019s purchase of oil from Russia to a U.S. tilt toward Pakistan, friction between New Delhi and Washington has been hard to miss. And much of it has happened far from the corridors of power and, unsurprisingly, through Trump\u2019s posts on social media.",
      "It has left policy experts wondering whether the camaraderie the two leaders shared may be a thing of the past, even though Trump has stopped short of referring to Modi directly on social media. The dip in rapport, some say, puts a strategic bilateral relationship built over decades at risk.",
      "\u201cThis is a testing time for the relationship,\u201d said Ashok Malik, a former policy adviser in India\u2019s Foreign Ministry.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "The latest hiccup between India and the U.S. emerged last week when Trump announced that he was slapping 25% tariffs on India as well as an unspecified penalty because of India\u2019s purchasing of Russian oil. For New Delhi, such a move from its largest trading partner is expected to be felt across sectors, but it also led to a sense of unease in India \u2014 even more so when Trump, on social media, called India\u2019s economy \u201cdead.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s recent statements reflect his frustration with the pace of trade talks with India, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal administration thinking. The Republican president has not been pursuing any strategic realignment with Pakistan, according to the official, but is instead trying to play hardball in negotiations.",
      "Trump doubled down on the pressure Monday with a fresh post on Truth Social, in which he accused India of buying \u201cmassive amounts\u201d of oil from Russia and then \u201cselling it on the Open Market for big profits.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA,\u201d he said.",
      "The messaging appears to have stung Modi\u2019s administration, which has been hard-selling negotiations with Trump\u2019s team over a trade deal by balancing between India\u2019s protectionist system while also opening up the country\u2019s market to more American goods.",
      "\u201cStrenuous, uninterrupted and bipartisan efforts in both capitals over the past 25 years are being put at risk by not just the tariffs but by fast and loose statements and social media posts,\u201d said Malik, who now heads the India chapter of The Asia Group, a U.S. advisory firm .",
      "Malik also said the trade deal the Indian side has offered to the U.S. is the \u201cmost expansive in this country\u2019s history,\u201d referring to reports that India was willing to open up to some American agricultural products. That is a politically sensitive issue for Modi, who faced a yearlong farmers\u2019 protest a few years ago.",
      "The unraveling may have gained momentum over tariffs, but the tensions have been palpable for a while. Much of it has to do with Trump growing closer to Pakistan, India\u2019s nuclear rival in the neighborhood.",
      "In May, India and Pakistan traded a series of military strikes over a gun massacre in disputed Kashmir that New Delhi blamed Islamabad for. Pakistan denied the accusations. The four-day conflict made the possibility of a nuclear conflagration between the two sides seem real and the fighting only stopped when global powers intervened.",
      "But it was Trump\u2019s claims of mediation and an offer to work to provide a \u201csolution\u201d regarding the dispute over Kashmir that made Modi\u2019s administration uneasy. Since then, Trump has repeated nearly two dozen times that he brokered peace between India and Pakistan.",
      "For Modi, that is a risky \u2014 even nervy \u2014 territory. Domestically, he has positioned himself as a leader who is tough on Pakistan. Internationally, he has made huge diplomatic efforts to isolate the country. So Trump\u2019s claims cut a deep wound, prompting a sense in India that the U.S. may no longer be its strategic partner.",

Modi said that \u201cno country in the world stopped\u201d the fighting between India and Pakistan, but he did not name Trump.",
      "Trump has also appeared to be warming up to Pakistan, even praising its counterterrorism efforts. Hours after levying tariffs on India, Trump announced a \u201cmassive\u201d oil exploration deal with Pakistan, saying that some day, India might have to buy oil from Islamabad. Earlier, he also hosted one of Pakistan\u2019s top military officials at a private lunch.",
      "Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, an expert at New Delhi\u2019s Jindal School of International Affairs, said Trump\u2019s sudden admiration for Pakistan as a great partner in counterterrorism has \u201cdefinitely soured\u201d the mood in India.",
      "Chaulia said \u201cthe best-case scenario is that this is just a passing Trump whim,\u201d but he also warned that \u201cif financial and energy deals are indeed being struck between the U.S. and Pakistan, it will dent the U.S.-India strategic partnership and lead to loss of confidence in the U.S. in Indian eyes.\u201d",
      "The strain in relations has also to do with oil.",
      "India had faced strong pressure from the Biden administration to cut back its oil purchases from Moscow during the early months of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Instead, India bought more, making it the second-biggest buyer of Russian oil after China. That pressure sputtered over time and the U.S. focused more on building strategic ties with India, which is seen as a bulwark against a rising China.",
      "Trump\u2019s threat to penalize India over oil, however, brought back those issues.",
      "On Sunday, the Trump administration made its frustrations over ties between India and Russia ever more public. Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff at the White House, accused India of financing Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow, saying it was \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d",
      "Miller's remarks were followed by another Trump social media post on Monday in which he again threatened to raise tariffs on goods from India over its Russian oil purchases.",
      "\u201cIndia is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don\u2019t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Some experts, though, suspect Trump's remarks are mere pressure tactics. \u201cGiven the wild fluctuations in Trump\u2019s policies,\u201d Chaulia said, \u201cit may return to high fives and hugs again.\u201d",
      "Many expected India to react strongly over Trump's tariff threats considering Modi\u2019s carefully crafted reputation of strength. Instead, the announcement prompted a rather careful response from India\u2019s commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, who said the two countries are working toward a \u201cfair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement.\u201d",
      "Initially, India\u2019s Foreign Ministry also played down suggestions of any strain. But in a statement late Monday, it called Trump\u2019s criticism \u201cunjustified and unreasonable\u201d and said it will take \u201call necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.\u201d",
      "It said India began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, calling it a \u201cnecessity compelled by global market situation.\u201d",
      "The statement also noted U.S. trade with Russia.",
      "\u201cIt is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia,\u201d the statement said.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Warren Buffett's company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprise shareholders by selling off a huge chunk of its Apple stake which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",

      "NEW YORK -- Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer, according to estimates from credit bureau TransUnion.",
      "The company predicts that by August roughly 3 million borrowers could move into default, meaning they're 270 days past due on payments. At that point, loan holders are at risk of having 15% of their pay docked by the government, with the money going toward the outstanding debt. There has been no clear indication of when wage garnishment will start.",
      "After the pandemic-era pause on student loan payments ended in May, borrowers have had to reassess the state of their loans and budgets. According to TransUnion, another 2 million borrowers are on course to default in September.",

      "Taylor said it's not uncommon for borrowers to be unaware that their loans are in default. If borrowers attended college or graduate school during different periods of time, or if they have different federal loan types, they may also have multiple student loan servicers.",
      "If that's the case, you should act now to get your loans out of default and back into good standing by either entering a rehabilitation agreement, where you must make nine consecutive payments based on their income, or by consolidating your loans into a new federal Direct Loan.",
      "\u201cBecause this hasn\u2019t happened for so long, there are many people who have no idea they\u2019re at risk,\" said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "Wait times for student borrowers attempting to contact their loan servicers have been long, with many dropped calls, in part due to layoffs at the Education Department. Ba\u00f1ez recommends contacting your congressperson, using a casework tool that can guide you through submitting a constituent request.",
      "\u201cThese offices have entire teams dedicated to constituent casework for when you have an issue with a federal agency, such as the Department of Education,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you can request assistance from your member of congress \u2014 your representative or senator.\u201d",

During that time, you can request a hearing to object by telling the department that the garnishment would cause you financial hardship. You can also request that the department reduce the amount being garnished and submit documentation about your income and expenses.",

You can further request a hearing and object if you submitted an application for certain kinds of statutory discharges and those have not yet been decided. Some common reasons for statutory discharge of student loans include: if the school you attended closed before you could complete your degree, if your school owes you a refund but fails to pay it, if you're experiencing total disability, or if you're experiencing bankruptcy.",

They\u2019re now facing especially hefty taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2013 on the products they export to the United States starting Aug. 7.",
      "The closest thing to winners may be the countries that caved to Trump's demands \u2014 and avoided even more pain. But it's unclear whether anyone will be able to claim victory in the long run \u2014 even the United States, the intended beneficiary of Trump\u2019s protectionist policies.",
      "\u201cIn many respects, everybody\u2019s a loser here,\u2019\u2019 said Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at the New York Law School.",
      "Barely six months after he returned to the White House, Trump has demolished the old global economic order. Gone is one built on agreed-upon rules. In its place is a system in which Trump himself sets the rules, using America\u2019s enormous economic power to punish countries that won\u2019t agree to one-sided trade deals and extracting huge concessions from the ones that do.",
      "\u201cThe biggest winner is Trump,\u201d said Alan Wolff, a former U.S. trade official and deputy director-general at the World Trade Organization. \u201cHe bet that he could get other countries to the table on the basis of threats, and he succeeded \u2013 dramatically.\u2019\u2019",
      "Everything goes back to what Trump calls \u201cLiberation Day\u2019\u2019 \u2013 April 2 \u2013 when the president announced \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 taxes of up to 50% on imports from countries with which the United States ran trade deficits and 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 taxes on almost everyone else.",
      "He invoked a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency that justified his sweeping import taxes. That allowed him to bypass Congress, which traditionally has had authority over taxes, including tariffs \u2014 all of which is now being challenged in court.",
      "Trump retreated temporarily after his Liberation Day announcement triggered a rout in financial markets and suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate.",
      "Eventually, some of them did, caving to Trump\u2019s demands to pay what four months ago would have seemed unthinkably high tariffs for the privilege of continuing to sell into the vast American market.",
      "The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs on its exports to the United States \u2014 up from 1.3% before Trump amped up his trade war with the world. The U.S. demanded concessions even though it had run a trade surplus, not a deficit, with the UK for 19 straight years.",
      "The European Union and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year \u2014 but lower than the tariffs he was threatening (30% on the EU and 25% on Japan).",
      "Also cutting deals with Trump and agreeing to hefty tariffs were Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Even countries that saw their tariffs lowered from April without reaching a deal are still paying much higher tariffs than before Trump took office. Angola's tariff, for instance, dropped to 15% from 32% in April, but in 2022 it was less than 1.5%. And while Trump administration cut Taiwan's tariff to 20% from 32% in April, the pain will still be felt.",
      "\u201c20% from the beginning has not been our goal, we hope that in further negotiations we will get a more beneficial and more reasonable tax rate,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s president Lai Ching-te told reporters in Taipei Friday.",
      "Trump also agreed to reduce the tariff on the tiny southern African kingdom of Lesotho to 15% from the 50% he\u2019d announced in April, but the damage may already have been done there.",

      "Trump portrays his tariffs as a tax on foreign countries. But they are actually paid by import companies in the U.S. who try to pass along the cost to their customers via higher prices. True, tariffs can hurt other countries by forcing their exporters to cut prices and sacrifice profits \u2014 or risk losing market share in the United States.",

      "The San Francisco 49ers have brought back Robert Saleh as defensive coordinator to revive their struggling defense",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The San Francisco 49ers went back to a familiar face when coach Kyle Shanahan looked to revive a defensive unit that had gone from dominant to mediocre in recent years.",
      "The Niners brought back Robert Saleh for a second stint as coordinator in hopes that he could once again build back the defense in similar fashion to what he did in 2019 when San Francisco's stingy defense helped carry the team to the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cHis commanding presence in defensive meetings is what we needed,\u201d star defensive end Nick Bosa said.",
      "The 49ers aren't the only contender that made a change at play-caller on offense or defense headed into 2025. How all of those work out will go a long way to determining which teams are playing deep into January.",
      "Some teams were forced to make changes they didn't want to with Detroit needing to replace both coordinators after Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn got head coaching jobs and Super Bowl champion Philadelphia needing to replace offensive coordinator Kellen Moore after he became Saints head coach.",
      "Tampa Bay is in a similar boat for a second straight season after losing an offensive coordinator to a head coaching job with Liam Coen leaving for Jacksonville one year after Dave Canales left for Carolina.",
      "Other teams such as Houston, Cincinnati and Seattle made changes in hopes of finding a spark.",
      "Here's a look at some of the key new coordinators around the NFL:",
      "The 49ers ranked 29th in the league in scoring defense last season, allowing 25.6 points per game, and were tied for the seventh-fewest takeaways with 17 as the unit looked nothing like the dominant ones under Saleh and DeMeco Ryans from 2019-22.",
      "That led to Shanahan making another change at coordinator, bringing back Saleh after he was fired as head coach of the New York Jets to replace the fired Nick Sorensen.",
      "During Saleh\u2019s last two full seasons with the Jets in 2022-23, New York ranked first in yards passing allowed per game (178.9) and yards per play allowed (4.7), and second in total defense (301.7 yards per game).",
      "The Niners are hoping similar results will get them back to the postseason after a 6-11 record in 2024.",
      "Detroit became the third team in the past 15 seasons to lose both coordinators to NFL head coaching jobs in the same offseason with it also happening to Philadelphia following the 2022 season and Cincinnati after 2013. Both those teams went back to the playoffs the following season, losing in the wild-card round.",
      "The Lions have their sights set higher after making it to the NFC title game in 2023 and losing in the divisional round as the top seed last season. Whether that happens will depend heavily on if Morton can keep the offense in the top five in scoring for a fourth straight season after Johnson helped make it one of the most dynamic in the league with his trick plays and schemes.",
      "Morton has only one year of play-calling experience in the NFL in 2017 with the Jets, finishing in the bottom 10 in scoring with an offense that lacked the playmakers he has in Detroit.",

      "Coach DeMeco Ryans made a change after last season even though Houston made it back to the divisional round. That came in spite of the offense taking a big step back thanks in large part to shoddy line play that hindered the growth of QB C.J. Stroud.",
      "Caley comes over after spending the past two seasons on Sean McVay's staff with the Rams and is being counted on to bring some of Los Angeles' successful wrinkles to Houston to help make Stroud's job at quarterback easier. He will need to do it with an overhauled offensive line that lost stalwart Laremy Tunsil in the offseason.",

      "Byron had fuel-mileage issues late at Michigan, and again last week at Indianapolis. Even with that, Fugle knew he could still gamble with his driver.",
      "\u201cThose are things that he\u2019s gotten better as well over the years, rolling with the punches and what happens next,\u201d Fugle said. \u201cAnd next thing you know, you\u2019re leading and you get a chance to win.\u201d",
      "Byron admitted he was nervous as the laps dwindled on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI knew what to expect,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew what to look for, and all that in terms of if I ran out of fuel. But I was just thinking about preserving as much as I could, doing a lot of different things in the car, lifting early and just not using a lot of throttle percentage.

And that was mostly true. When I did the burnout, at the tail end of the burnout, I had the fuel pressure come up. So I don\u2019t know how many laps that would have been.\u201d",
      "Now, Byron said, he has new fuel to get to the playoffs.",
      "\u201cI really feel like we needed to win a race like this, we deserve to win a race based on how we\u2019ve grown all year, and it just wasn\u2019t happening,\u201d Byron said. \u201cIt\u2019s is just a big relief for us to have one kind of go our way. We\u2019ve just been running so well this year, I feel like this is going to be a big momentum boost for our team.\u201d",

      "Nic Enright's first career save for the Cleveland Guardians is particularly meaningful",
      "NEW YORK -- The first career save for Nic Enright was a particularly meaningful one.",
      "Enright, who was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in late 2022 and is scheduled to complete his treatments later this year, allowed an unearned run in the 10th inning Monday night to close out the Cleveland Guardians\u2019 7-6 win over the New York Mets.",
      "\u201cHe was almost crying on the field just now,\u201d Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said. \u201cIf you read his story, it\u2019s pretty inspirational.\u201d",
      "Cleveland selected Enright in the 20th round of the 2019 amateur draft out of Virginia Tech. He received his diagnosis Dec. 22, 2022 \u2014 15 days after the Miami Marlins took him in the Rule 5 draft.",
      "After four rounds of immunotherapy in early 2023, Enright made nine minor league rehab appearances for the Marlins before being designated for assignment and returning to the Guardians in late May.",
      "He missed most of last season due to a right shoulder strain, but went 2-1 with a 1.06 ERA in 16 appearances with Triple-A Columbus.",
      "The right-hander has one more round of cancer treatment scheduled for November.",
      "\u201cI made the decision when I was diagnosed in 2022 with Hodgkin lymphoma that I wasn\u2019t going to let that define my life and dictate how I was going to go about my life,\u201d Enright said. \u201cIt\u2019s something where, for anyone else who is going through anything similar, (it shows) I haven\u2019t just holed up in my house and felt sorry for myself this whole time.\u201d",
      "Enright made his major league debut May 25 and has a 2.01 ERA in 19 appearances for the Guardians, whose bullpen is in flux with All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase on paid leave as part of a sports gambling investigation.",
      "Hunter Gaddis and Cade Smith pitched the eighth and ninth innings Monday before Enright entered with a two-run lead. He gave up a two-out RBI single to Brett Baty before retiring Luis Torrens on a fly out to the warning track in right.",
      "\u201cI definitely held my breath as I saw Nolan (Jones) kind of keep running,\u201d Enright said. \u201cBut I had faith. As he kind of got closer to the wall, I realized it was losing steam.\u201d",

      "The Athletics have a promising future with young talent like Nick Kurtz, who is a favorite for AL Rookie of the Year",
      "WEST SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Even Athletics veterans walk around the clubhouse wearing \u201cNick Kurtz goes yard\u201d T-shirts, and they know what he means for the franchise's future.",
      "Kurtz, who recently had one of the greatest individual performances in big-league history, is the odds-on favorite to be AL Rookie of the Year. He's hardly the only talented youngster giving A's fans \u2014 wherever they might be \u2014 reason to feel optimistic about the team's on-field direction.",
      "The A's are in transition in more ways than one. Most notably, the club is playing the first of what's expected to be three seasons in Sacramento \u2014 a temporary, minor league home for the former Oakland franchise until a new stadium is scheduled to be ready in Las Vegas for 2028.",
      "The roster is shaping up to be a dynamic and competitive one when they arrive. Kurtz is the headliner, but teammate Jacob Wilson was the second favorite for top rookie before going on the injured list last week with a broken left forearm. Lawrence Butler, an electric outfield defender with pop and speed, also looks like a centerpiece for the type of team the A's want to take to Las Vegas.",
      "The club added 18-year-old shortstop Leo De Vries on Thursday as part of a multiplayer trade with San Diego that sent out closer Mason Miller and his 101-mph fastball. MLB.com rates De Vries as as baseball's No. 3 prospect.",
      "Also on the roster \u2014 and under contract through at least 2028 \u2014 is All-Star designated hitter Brent Rooker. Kurtz, Wilson and catcher Shea Langeliers are among the starters who could be under team control with the planned moved to Las Vegas. That core isn't translating into wins yet \u2014 the team is 49-65 this season, worst in the AL West \u2014 largely because the team's pitching lags behind.",
      "\u201cWe certainly want to win in present day and \u201826 and \u201927 are important to us, but a lot of our internal conversations are about what the team will look like in 2028 when we get to Las Vegas,\u201d A's general manager David Forst said. \u201cYou can see it some of the contracts we signed, starting obviously with the manager (Mark Kotsay), but also with Rooker and Lawrence, making sure that two of our key guys are locked up into our time in Vegas.\u201d",
      "Whether management keeps the team together is a question. The A's have a history of trading young players on the verge of landing lucrative contracts and keeping their payroll among the lowest in baseball.",
      "Maybe that changes with the anticipated move to Las Vegas, given owner John Fisher might want to bring a competitive team to the market. The A's, in fact, opened up the wallet this year and signed Rooker to a $60 million, five-year contract and a $65.5 million, seven-year deal with Butler.",
      "\u201cI feel like we're headed in the right direction,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe've got a lot of young players. When a team calls up young players, they might not be ready, but I feel like all our guys are ready. They've shown that they can compete at this level.\u201d",
      "Butler, 25, is part of a clubhouse filled with promising 20-somethings.",
      "\u201cIn this locker room, I am kind of the old man,\u201d the 30-year-old Rooker said. \u201cI don't know if I take them under my wing. These guys are better players than I am. They don't need the help.\u201d",
      "Kurtz and Wilson were battling it out for the AL's top first-year player award, and maybe that competition will continue if and when Wilson \u2014 the first fan-elected rookie shortstop to the All-Star Game \u2014 returns to the lineup.",
      "Kurtz has done his best to make it a one-man race. He became the first rookie to hit four home runs in a game and tied the major-league record with 19 total bases by going 6 for 6 with eight RBIs on July 25 at Houston.",

      "That performance gave Kurtz consecutive AL player of the week honors. He led the majors in multiple categories in July, including batting average (.395), on-base percentage (.480) and slugging percentage (.953). The 22-year-old already has shown a knack for delivering in key moments with seven game-winning RBIs and five go-ahead homers.",
      "\u201cIt's the moment you dream about as a kid,\u201d Kurtz said. \u201cYou're in a spot where you can end the game with a walk-off or take the lead. Baseball's so hard. You're supposed to get out. I come through here, it's freakin' awesome. I think I just aim to be calm and I trust my process.\u201d",
      "Kotsay said before the trade deadline that for all the young hitting talent, the A's could use help with their pitching.",
      "The A's then added three pitching prospects in the Miller trade and another in right-hander Kenya Huggins when Miguel Andujar was sent to Cincinnati. They have 25-year-old Jack Perkins, called up Luis Morales on Friday and have Gage Jump in their minor-league system. The A's also selected Florida State left-hander Jamie Arnold 11th overall in this year's draft.",
      "\u201cWhere we've struggled this year is pitching, both rotation and bullpen,\u201d Forst said. \u201cWhen we've had success on the mound, that's when we've put some good little stretches together.\u201d",
      "Outside of a horrendous stint when the A's lost 20 of 21 games, they have been largely competitive. That includes a current run of seven wins in 10 games.",
      "\u201cIn terms of our vision, in terms of putting a group together that we can win with, I think that talent especially on the players position side is just showing itself,\" Kotsay said recently. \"(They are) continuing to make improvements and continuing to show what our priorities are, which is playing the game at an elite level and becoming a team that goes out and competes every night.\u201d",
      "The A's signed Kotsay to an extension in February that takes him through 2028 with an option for 2029. He has had to navigate a club that experienced the fan anger in Oakland toward management for its impending move and now playing in Sacramento.",
      "\u201cI think (Kotsay's) got one of the tougher jobs in baseball right now in the sense of trying to get the buy-in from the players,\u201d Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much uncertainty with the ballpark and where they\u2019re going to be. I think he\u2019s done a fantastic job. He\u2019s a lifelong A, so he understands the culture of the organization. ... He\u2019s the perfect guy for that organization.\u201d",

      "Seattle's Cal Raleigh, known as \"Big Dumper,\" has been a powerhouse this season, hitting 42 homers",
      "Seattle's Cal Raleigh \u2014 better known by the catchy nickname \u201cBig Dumper\u201d \u2014 has lived up to the moniker, dropping baseball into the outfield seats all over the big leagues this season.",
      "Manager Dan Wilson has been in awe of his talents.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what you get from Cal,\" Wilson said. \u201cNight in, night out, blocking balls, calling the game, leading a pitching staff, throwing runners out \u2014 that\u2019s what Cal does and he does it very well.\u201d",
      "Oh ... wait a second. Wilson obviously wasn't taking about Raleigh's prodigious power \u2014 he's talking about how the 28-year-old handles the most demanding defensive position on the baseball field: Catcher.",
      "Raleigh has smashed 42 homers this season, putting him on pace for 60, with a chance to catch Aaron Judge's American League record of 62. That would be fun to watch under any circumstance. The fact that the All-Star and Home Run Derby champion is also responsible for guiding the Mariners' pitching staff on most nights makes it even more impressive.",
      "Seattle is currently in the thick of the American League playoff race with a 60-53 record, and the Mariners are relying on Raleigh's bat and his brain to try and make the playoffs for just the third time since 2001.",
      "There's the mental side of the job \u2014 meetings, film study, calling pitches \u2014 but there's also the wear and tear of the physical side. The 2024 Gold Glove winner is also squatting, handling the run game, taking painful foul tips off all parts of his body, putting his 6-foot-2, 235-pound frame through the ringer four or five nights a week.",
      "All while hitting those homers.",
      "The fact that it took Raleigh a few years in the big leagues to emerge as a true superstar \u2014 this is his fourth full season with the Mariners \u2014 isn't surprising. The learning curve for young catchers can be severe and the defensive part of the job takes precedence. There's a long list of backstops who couldn't hit a lick yet carved out long MLB careers.",
      "Raleigh is a man of many talents and his power was always evident. He hit 27 homers in 2022, 30 in 2023 and 34 last season. Now he's on pace for 50 long balls and maybe more. There are only five other players in big league history who have hit at least 40 homers while primarily playing catcher: Salvador Perez, Johnny Bench (twice), Roy Campanella, Todd Hundley and Mike Piazza (twice). Bench, Campanella and Piazza are Hall of Famers.",
      "It's evidence of a player at the top of his game \u2014 and one who has come through plenty of experience.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m trying any harder or doing any more than I have in the past,\u201d Raleigh said. \u201cMaybe a little more focused on the right things, and not constantly trying to tweak or change something that I have been in the past. So, I think that\u2019s been the biggest part to the success, and just trying to keep that consistent and steady.\u201d",
      "Wilson was more direct, putting into perspective what Raleigh has accomplished through the first four months of the season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty staggering,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "Raleigh's big numbers are part of an offensive surge for MLB catchers: Will Smith, Hunter Goodman, Logan O'Hoppe, Shea Langeliers, Alejandro Kirk, Salvador Perez and William Contreras are among roughly a dozen at the position who are more than holding their own at the plate.",
      "Veteran catcher Carson Kelly is on pace to have his best offensive season in the big leagues at 31, batting .272 with 13 homers and 36 RBIs for the Chicago Cubs. He's been in the big leagues for 10 years and said the balance between offense and defense is tough for young players.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Sea stars \u2013 often known as starfish \u2013 typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak\u2019s first five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite gruesome,\u201d said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \u201cpuffy arms sticking straight out,\u201d she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \u201cthen their arms actually fall off.\u201d",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \u201csolve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",

He said the detective work by this team was \u201creally smart and significant.\u201d",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \u201clook sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\u201d said Gehman. \u201cThey\u2019re voracious eaters.\u201d",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2013 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",

      "\u201cUkraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,\u201d said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. \u201cFor the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "This isn\u2019t the first time C\u00e1lidda, the company that distributes natural gas in Lima, has found archaeological remains. Over more than two decades of excavation work to expand the underground network, the company says it has made more than 2,200 discoveries.",
      "According to archaeologist Jos\u00e9 Aliaga, the vessels\u2019 iconography and their black, white, and red colors \u201callow us to establish a connection with the pre-Incan Chancay culture,\u2019 which is approximately 1,000 to 1,470 years old.\u201d Aliaga told The Associated Press that the individual was found wrapped in a torn bundle, in a sitting position with his legs against his chest, and his team will continue cleaning the remains.",

      "The Department of Defense now says it will continue sharing key data collected by three sophisticated weather satellites that help forecasters track hurricanes",
      "The U.S. Department of Defense will now continue sharing key data collected by three weather satellites that help forecasters track hurricanes. Meteorologists and scientists had warned of risks to accurate and timely storm tracking without the information when officials made plans to stop providing it beyond the end of this month.",
      "Defense officials had planned to cut off distribution of microwave data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, jointly run with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, by the end of June. At the time, NOAA said the cutoff was said \u201cto mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" while the U.S. Navy said the program didn't meet \"information technology modernization requirements.\u201d The discontinuation was postponed for one month.",
      "In a notice on Wednesday, officials said there would be no interruption at all.",
      "The Navy said in a statement that its Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center \u201chad planned to phase out the data\u201d as part of modernization efforts. \"But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.\u201d",
      "The data is used by scientists, researchers and forecasters, including meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center. It gives crucial information about storms that can\u2019t be gleaned from conventional visible or infrared satellites.",
      "\u201cThis satellite data enables hurricane forecasters and their computer models to peer inside a hurricane\u2019s structure, offering vital insight,\" said Union of Concerned Scientists science fellow Marc Alessi. \"Make no mistake: this data not only improves hurricane forecasting accuracy, but could make the difference between whether communities evacuate or not ahead of an approaching hurricane.\u201d",
      "Other microwave data would have been available with this cutoff, but only about half as much, experts said \u2014 increasing the chance that forecasters would miss certain aspects of storms.",
      "A spokesperson for NOAA said the agency will continue to have access to the data for the program\u2019s lifespan and noted that it is just one data set \u201cin a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools\" that the National Weather Service has at its disposal to \u201censure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\u201d",
      "The news had initially raised scientific eyebrows amid hurricane season, which usually peaks from mid-August to mid-October. Climate change, worsened by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal, have driven storms to become more frequent, severe and deadly.",
      "\u201cThe last-minute reprieve has hurricane forecasters breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections. \u201cLoss of the microwave satellite data would have made it far more likely that timely warnings of dangerous and potentially deadly episodes of hurricane rapid intensification events being delayed by up to 12 hours.\u201d",
      "He added the restoration of the data is also good news for scientists tracking Arctic sea ice loss. Images and microwave satellite data can estimate how much of the ocean is covered by ice, according to NOAA.",

    "story": [
      "A 16-year-old\u2019s Roblox game, Grow a Garden, has shattered records for the most concurrent players in history",
      "Whether it serves as a chill escape from the onslaught of the real world or simply a way to beat vacation doldrums, a viral Roblox game about gardening has become the surprise hit of the summer.",
      "Grow a Garden, created by a 16-year-old in a few days, has shattered records for the most concurrent players of any game in history, beating out video games that take years and millions of dollars to develop.",
      "And there\u2019s no one to shoot, fight or race. If your last attempt at cultivating vegetables was FarmVille in 2010, don't worry \u2014 your tomatoes will grow even if you never water them.",
      "Grow a Garden is as simple as its name suggests \u2014 players can fill a plot of land with plants and animals, harvest and sell, trade or steal each others' bounty. The game is low stress, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Minecraft and a soundtrack of soothing classical tunes such as Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca playing in the background. Its popularity has further cemented Roblox' place not just in the gaming world but in popular culture \u2014 for better or for worse, it's where the kids hang out.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep hearing used over and over to describe this particular game is that it\u2019s chill, which is just such a nice alternative. I get a lot of sort of that Animal Crossing vibe from it. You know, like you can check in, you can check your gardens, you can get some new seeds, you can plant them,\u201d said Becky Bozdech, editorial director at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. \u201cI have an 11-year-old son who (plays it) and he says to him the big difference is that a lot of games have a big giant objective that you have to do, but in Grow a Garden, you can just kind of hang out and do what you want.\u201d",
      "Coincidence or not, Grow a Garden soared to popularity around the same time that Take-Two Interactive announced it would delay the launch of its wildly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 until next year. In late June, the gardening game logged 21.6 million concurrent players, surpassing Fortnite\u2019s previous record of 15.2 million according to Roblox. Analysts who follow Roblox's stock say Grow a Garden is helping boost the company's revenue and will push the company's quarterly earnings numbers above Wall Street's expectations.",
      "While it's not clear if the GTA audience flocked to this simple gardening game to pass the time until then, the timing reignited the age-old debate about who gamers are and what titles are taken seriously by the video game establishment. It happened with Candy Crush, with puzzle games, with Animal Crossing. Are people who play cozy games true gamers? Or is the title reserved for the folks who shoot enemies in Call of Duty or drive around creating mayhem in GTA?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge percentage of gamers that play Roblox and the actual industry just views it as like this esoterically immature platform of weird gameplay habits,\u201d said Janzen Madsen, the New Zealand-based CEO and founder of Splitting Point studios, which acquired the game from its teenage creator. \u201cWell, I actually think in five years this is what player expectation is gonna be. And because you guys haven\u2019t embraced it, like you\u2019re not gonna know how to make games.\u201d",
      "To start growing your garden, you'll need a Roblox account. The game will start you out with an empty plot and some money \u2014 sheckles \u2014 and a starter seed. From there, you can plant seeds, harvest and sell your crops and buy more seeds, animals or tools for your garden. While it is possible to play the game without spending real-world money, it will take longer. Once you sell enough crops, you earn money to buy more expensive seeds beyond basic carrots and blueberries.",

      "After recording more than 600 audiobooks, Julia Whelan has become a go-to narrator for books by popular authors including Emily Henry and Taylor Jenkins Reid",
      "Chances are, you've heard Julia Whelan's voice. She's the award-winning narrator behind more than 600 audiobooks by a long list of bestselling authors including Taylor Jenkins Reid,Emily Henry, Michael Crichton, V.E. Schwab and Kristin Hannah. She's also narrated long-form articles for The New Yorker, The Atlantic and Vanity Fair.",
      "You may have read her own writing, too. Whelan's first novel, 2018's \u201cMy Oxford Year,\u201d has been adapted to a Netflix film, out Friday, starring Sofia Carson. The story actually began as a screenplay by Allison Burnett and had been gestating in development for years. Whelan was brought in to help with the script because she had studied abroad at Oxford her junior year of college. Producers then asked if she thought it would make a good book.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Nothing has ever wanted to be a book more. Please let me do this,'\u201d she recalls. It ended up an international bestseller. Her second novel, 2022's \u201cThank You For Listening,\u201d was critically praised. (\u201cThank You For Listening\u201d is about a former actor-turned-audiobook narrator who falls in love with another audiobook narrator.)",
      "You may have even seen Whelan on TV \u2014 she began her career as a child actor, with roles in \u201cFifteen and Pregnant\u201d and on the series \u201cOnce and Again.\u201d Despite her various pursuits, though, she has no plans to leave narration behind. \u201cI feel like I was born to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that I love and that I\u2019m good at and everything I want to be doing.\u201d",
      "That's a good thing, because the audiobook industry is growing. Statista projects this year it will reach $9.84 billion because of smartphones, the increased popularity of audio content and people's desire to multitask. Despite the appetite for audiobooks, for narrators, \u201cthe financial aspect makes zero sense,\u201d says Whelan. She's founded her own publishing company, Audiobrary, to help narrators get paid more fairly.",
      "Whelan, who has narrated as many as 70 books in one year, spoke to The Associated Press about the audiobook industry, Audiobrary and her own writing. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "WHELAN: The only reason I was doing 70 books a year was because that\u2019s how many books you have to do when you\u2019re first starting out to keep your head above water because the rates are low. It would be OK if there were a kickback for success, but narrators don\u2019t get royalties. As we\u2019ve seen the industry grow and as we\u2019ve seen the cache of certain narrators expand, and we know listeners will seek out audiobooks that their favorite narrators record. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me that we should be cut out of the long-term financial benefit of success. Audiobrary does a profit-share model with writers, who I also feel don\u2019t get enough percentage of the pie, and a royalty share for narrators. We are also a direct-to-consumer retail channel, so when you buy directly from us, you\u2019re not giving 50-75% of that sale to a retailer. You\u2019re giving it directly to the people who made the product.",

You\u2019re messed up for three or four months. Everything just gets delayed, especially when I was doing 70 books a year, there\u2019s no room for error there.",

But I think that audiobook fans \u2014 not your casual audiobook user, but fans \u2014 have favorite narrators and they\u2019re going to look for books by those narrators. So, in stunt-casting situations, sometimes someone is incredible at it, and they are perfect for the book. But sometimes it feels like a very craven, just marketing ploy. I don\u2019t feel infringed upon by them, but I do worry about a future situation where most of the work is going to AI. I don\u2019t lie awake at night worried, but everyone\u2019s threatened right now. It\u2019s very, very hard to even begin to predict what the future could look like.",

So then are you telling them they\u2019ve never read a book before? Actual data and studies show that listening to a book actually triggers the same response in the brain as reading it, and that the interpretation and understanding of that book is on par with having read it.",
      "WHELAN: There\u2019s been about four ideas that are constantly in rotation, but I think I\u2019ve narrowed it down. I think I\u2019m ready to at least start exploring one of them at the beginning of next year.",
      "WHELAN: I very much think we could. I have said no up to this point because, this time around, I want to be very creatively involved. There\u2019s just too many things about audiobooks that someone could get wrong not knowing anything about the industry. I want be involved so I\u2019m willing to hold onto it until the right situation comes along.",

In addition, the department is proposing that applicants for the Visa Diversity Lottery program have valid passports from their country of citizenship.",
      "A preview of the bond notice, which was posted on the Federal Register website on Monday, said the pilot program would take effect within 15 days of its formal publication and is necessary to ensure that the U.S. government is not financially liable if a visitor does not comply with the terms of his or her visa.",

      "Texas Democrats prevented their state\u2019s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The nation's two most populous states \u2014 California and Texas \u2014 grappled for political advantage in advance of 2026 elections that could reorder the balance of power in Washington and threaten President Donald Trump's agenda at the midpoint of his second term.",
      "In Texas, Democrats on Monday prevented their state\u2019s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump to shore up Republicans\u2019 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters.",
      "In California, Democrats encouraged by Gov. Gavin Newsom are considering new political maps that could slash five Republican-held House seats in the liberal-leaning state while bolstering Democratic incumbents in other battleground districts. The move is intended to undercut any GOP gains in Texas, potentially swinging House control and giving Democrats a counterweight to Trump on Capitol Hill.",
      "A draft plan aims to boost the Democratic margin in California to 48 of 52 congressional seats, according to a source familiar with the plan who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. That\u2019s up from the 43 seats the party now holds. It would need approval from lawmakers and voters, who may be skeptical to give it after handing redistricting power to an independent commission years ago.",
      "The rivalry puts a spotlight on two states that for years have dueled over jobs, innovation, prestige \u2014 even sports \u2014 with the backdrop of clashing political visions \u2014 one progressive, one conservative.",
      "After dozens of Democrats left Texas, the Republican-dominated House was unable to establish the quorum of lawmakers required to do business. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has made threats about removing members who are absent from their seats. Democrats counter that Abbott is using \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d to assert legal authority he does not have.",
      "The House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities.",
      "\u201cIf you continue to go down this road, there will be consequences,\" House Speaker Rep. Dustin Burrows said from the chamber floor, later telling reporters that includes fines.",
      "Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation \u2014 even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump\u2019s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers between the federal government and individual states.",
      "The impasse centers on Trump\u2019s effort to get five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas, at Democrats' expense, before the midterms. That would bolster his party's chances of preserving its fragile U.S. House majority, something Republicans were unable to do in the 2018 midterms during Trump's first presidency. Republicans currently hold 25 of Texas' 38 seats. That's nearly a 2-to-1 advantage and already a wider partisan gap than the 2024 presidential results: Trump won 56.1% of Texas ballots, while Democrat Kamala Harris received 42.5%.",
      "According to the tentative California proposal, districts now held by Republican Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa would see right-leaning voters shaved and Democratic voters boosted in a shift that would make it likely a left-leaning candidate would prevail in each race.",
      "In battleground districts held by Democratic Reps. Dave Min, Mike Levin and Derek Tran, the party\u2019s edge would be boosted to strengthen their hold on the seats, the source said.",
      "Democratic members of California\u2019s congressional delegation were briefed on the new map on Monday, according to a person familiar with the meeting who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.",
      "The proposal is being circulated at the same time that Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has said he wants to advance partisan redistricting. He says he won\u2019t move ahead if Texas pauses its efforts.",

      "A federal judge has temporarily blocked some of Arkansas' largest school districts from enforcing a new law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A new Arkansas law requiring public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments cannot be enforced in a handful of the state\u2019s largest school districts where parents brought challenges on the grounds that it violates the separation of church and state, a federal judge ruled Monday.",
      "But the ruling by U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks, an appointee of former President Obama, only narrowly applied to four of the state\u2019s 237 districts. That left the impact of the decision limited as thousands of Arkansas students prepared to return to class this month.",
      "The injunction is the latest legal turn in a widening push in Republican-led states to give religion a bigger presence in public schools. Texas and Louisiana have passed similar laws requiring classrooms to display the Ten Commandments and the issue is expected to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cWhy would Arkansas pass an obviously unconstitutional law?\u201d Brooks wrote in his 35-page ruling. \u201cMost likely because the state is part of a coordinated strategy among several states to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms.\u201d",
      "The Arkansas law, signed earlier this year by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, takes effect Tuesday and requires the Ten Commandments to be prominently displayed in public school classrooms and libraries. The suit was filed on behalf of the families by the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation.",
      "\u201cThe court saw through this attempt to impose religious doctrine in public schools and upheld every student\u2019s right to learn free from government-imposed faith,\" John L. Williams, legal director of ACLU of Arkansas said in a statement. \"We\u2019re proud to stand with our clients \u2014 families of many different backgrounds \u2014 who simply want their kids to get an education.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Tim Griffin, whose office defended the law, said he was reviewing the decision and assessing legal options.",

      "A federal judge has ruled that Rhode Island's gun permit system does not violate the Second Amendment",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- A federal judge says Rhode Island's gun permit system, which requires residents to show \u201ca need\u201d to openly carry a firearm throughout the state, does not violate the Second Amendment.",
      "In a ruling handed down Friday, U.S. District Judge William Smith granted Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha\u2019s motion for summary judgment that dismisses a lawsuit filed by a coalition of gun owners in 2023.",
      "The lawsuit stems from a Rhode Island law dictating how the state issues firearms permits.",
      "According to the statute, local officials are required to issue concealed-carry permits to anyone who meets the specific criteria outlined in the statute. However, it also allows the attorney general\u2019s office to issue open-carry permits \u201cupon a proper showing of need.\u201d Unlike municipalities, the attorney general is not required to issue such permits.",
      "The plaintiffs, largely led by Michael O\u2019Neil, a lobbyist for the Rhode Island 2nd Amendment Coalition and a firearm instructor, said in their initial complaint that the attorney general's office denied all seven of their applications in 2021 for an \u201cunrestricted\u201d firearm permit, allowing both open and concealed carry. Court documents show that the attorney general's office denied their permits because all of them had been granted \u201crestricted\u201d permits, which only allowed concealed carry.",
      "Smith said in his ruling that unrestricted permits \u201care a privilege and there is no constitutionally protected liberty interest in obtaining one.\u201d",
      "The plaintiffs had hoped for a similar ruling handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022, where the justices struck down a New York state law that had restricted who could obtain a permit to carry a gun in public.",

      "Gov. Bill Lee declined Monday to grant a reprieve, clearing the way for Byron Black\u2019s execution after a legal battle and ongoing uncertainty about whether the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator will shock his heart when the lethal drug takes effect.",
      "The nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center said it\u2019s unaware of any other cases in which a person on death row made similar claims to Black's about defibrillators or pacemakers. Black's attorneys said they haven't found a comparable case, either.",
      "Lee said the courts have \"universally determined that it is lawful to carry out the jury\u2019s sentence of execution given to Mr. Black for the heinous murders of Angela Clay and her daughters Lakeisha, age 6, and Latoya, age 9.\"",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Black's appeals. The execution would be Tennessee\u2019s second since May, after a pause for five years, first because of COVID-19 and then because of missteps by state corrections officials.",
      "Twenty-seven men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. The number of executions this year exceeds the 25 carried out last year and in 2018. It is the highest total since 2015, when 28 people were put to death.",
      "Black, 69, is in a wheelchair, and he has dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, his attorneys have said.",
      "The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator he has is a small, battery-powered electronic device that is surgically implanted in the chest. It serves as a pacemaker and an emergency defibrillator. Black\u2019s attorneys say in order to be sure it\u2019s off, a doctor must place a programming device over the implant site, sending it a deactivation command, with no surgery required.",
      "In mid-July, a trial court judge agreed with Black's attorneys that officials must have his device deactivated to avert the risk that it could cause unnecessary pain and prolong the execution. But the state Supreme Court intervened July 31 to overturn that decision, saying the other judge lacked the authority to order the change.",
      "The state has disputed that the lethal injection would cause Black's defibrillator to shock him. Even if shocks were triggered, Black wouldn\u2019t feel them, the state said.",
      "Black's attorneys have countered that even if the lethal drug being used, pentobarbital, renders someone unresponsive, they aren't necessarily unaware or unable to feel pain.",

      "The fair touts itself as the largest campground fair in the country, where attendees cram into more than 500 two-and-three story wood cabins for eight days every year. The larger cabins can sleep upwards of 30 people, sometimes in the same room.",
      "\u201cIt's like having two Christmases a year,\u201d said Mike Hardy, who attends the fair just about every year and shared a cabin this year with 20 members of his family, from infants to grandparents.",
      "For Hardy, who lives more than 300 miles (500 kilometers) away in Nashville, Tennessee, the fair is one of the only times he visits his hometown. He calls it a high school, college and family reunion all wrapped into one.",

      "Hardy inherited the cabin from his father, who bought it in the late 1960s. It's located in what's known as \u2018watermelon alley,' one of several neighborhoods that divide up the community, which feels like a mix between a candy-colored frontier town and an amusement park. His children grew up going there. The pictures they drew on hot summer days still hang on the walls, joined now by their own children's artwork.",

      "Horse-race watching at the nearby race track and card playing are among Hardy family's favorite activities during the fair. They take their kids to the carnival rides and cook large family meals. On their way to the track, they walk through Founders Square, the oldest section of cabins with a pavilion used for dances and political speeches. It's where Ronald Reagan gave his famous states' rights speech in 1980 while running for president.",

      "The communal atmosphere extends to mealtime. Although only about 20 people stay in their cabin, Salter's family often feeds 50 or 60 people a day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not an inexpensive hobby,\u201d he joked, \u201cbut it\u2019s a great time with people you only see, you know, during the fair.\"",
      "The fair, Salter said, also feels like a reunion with loved ones who are no longer living. He imagines that the spirits of his twin sister, first wife and parents like to \u201cknock around\u201d the campground where they made so many memories.",
      "\u201cIt may be a figment of a fertile imagination \u2014 I\u2019m sure it is \u2014 but I feel it,\u201d he said.",

He said he often eats the same meals, does the same activities and sees the same people year after year.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate left Washington Saturday night for its monthlong August recess without a deal to advance dozens of President Donald Trump's nominees, calling it quits after days of contentious bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer can \u201cGO TO HELL!\u201d",
      "Without a deal in hand, Republicans say they may try to change Senate rules when they return in September to speed up the pace of confirmations. Trump has been pressuring senators to move quickly as Democrats blocked more nominees than usual this year, denying any fast unanimous consent votes and forcing roll calls on each one, a lengthy process that can take several days per nominee.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re desperately in need of change,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said of Senate rules Saturday after negotiations with Schumer and Trump broke down. \"I think that the last six months have demonstrated that this process, nominations is broken. And so I expect there will be some good robust conversations about that.\u201d",
      "Schumer said a rules change would be a \u201chuge mistake,\" especially as Senate Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass spending bills and other legislation moving forward.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump tried to bully us, go around us, threaten us, call us names, but he got nothing,\" Schumer said.",
      "The latest standoff comes as Democrats and Republicans have gradually escalated their obstruction of the other party's executive branch and judicial nominees over the last two decades, and as Senate leaders have incrementally changed Senate rules to speed up confirmations \u2014 and make them less bipartisan.",
      "In 2013, Democrats changed Senate rules for lower court judicial nominees to remove the 60-vote threshold for confirmations as Republicans blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial picks. In 2017, Republicans did the same for Supreme Court nominees as Democrats tried to block Trump\u2019s nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
      "Trump has been pressuring Senate Republicans for weeks to cancel the August recess and grind through dozens of his nominations as Democrats have slowed the process. But Republicans hoped to make a deal with Democrats instead, and came close several times over the last few days as the two parties and the White House negotiated over moving a large tranche of nominees in exchange for reversing some of the Trump administration's spending cuts on foreign aid, among other issues.",

      "\u201cTell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cDo not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country.\u201d",
      "Thune said afterward that there were \u201cseveral different times\u201d when the two sides thought they had a deal, but in the end \u201cwe didn't close it out.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the first time in recent history that the minority party hasn\u2019t allowed at least some quick confirmations. Thune has already kept the Senate in session for more days, and with longer hours, this year to try and confirm as many of Trump\u2019s nominees as possible.",
      "But Democrats had little desire to give in without the spending cut reversals or some other incentive, even though they too were eager to skip town after several long months of work and bitter partisan fights over legislation.",
      "\u201cWe have never seen nominees as flawed, as compromised, as unqualified as we have right now,\u201d Schumer said.",

      "Under Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has executed more people so far this year than any other state, setting a new state record",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- In the final moments of a life defined by violence, 60-year-old Edward Zakrzewski thanked the people of Florida for killing him \"in the most cold, calculated, clean, humane, efficient way possible,\" breathing deeply as a lethal drug cocktail coursed through his veins.",
      "With his last breath, strapped to a gurney inside a state prison's death chamber, Zakrzewski paid what Florida had deemed was his debt to society and became the 27th person put to death in the U.S. so far this year, the highest number in a decade.",
      "Under Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has executed nine people in 2025, more than than any other state, and set a new state record, with DeSantis overseeing more executions in a single year than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.",
      "Across the country, more people have been put to death in the first seven months of this year than in all of 2024. Florida's increase is helping put the U.S. on track to surpass 2015\u2019s total of 28 executions.",
      "And the number of executions is expected to keep climbing. Nine more people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025.",
      "After the Supreme Court lifted its ban on capital punishment in the \u201970s, executions steadily increased, peaking in 1999 at 98 deaths. Since then, they had been dropping \u2014 in part due to legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs, and declining public support for capital punishment, which has prompted a majority of states to either pause or abolish it altogether.",
      "The ratcheting up after this yearslong decline comes as Republican President Donald Trump has urged prosecutors to aggressively seek the death penalty and as some GOP-controlled state legislatures have pushed to expand the category of crimes punishable by death and the methods used to carry out executions.",
      "John Blume, director of the Cornell Death Penalty Project, says the uptick in executions doesn\u2019t appear to be linked to a change in public support for the death penalty or an increase in the rate of death sentences, but is rather a function of the discretion of state governors.",
      "\u201cThe most cynical view would be: It seems to matter to the president, so it matters to them,\u201d Blume said of the governors.",
      "In response to questions from The Associated Press, a spokesperson for DeSantis pointed to statements the governor made at a press conference in May, saying he takes capital cases \u201cvery seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are some crimes that are just so horrific, the only appropriate punishment is the death penalty,\u201d DeSantis said, adding: \u201cthese are the worst of the worst.\u201d",
      "Julie Andrew expressed relief after witnessing the April execution of the man who killed her sister in the Florida Keys in 2000.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d she said. \u201cMy heart felt lighter and I can breathe again.\u201d",
      "The governor\u2019s office did not respond to questions about why the governor is increasing the pace of executions now and whether Trump\u2019s policies are playing a role.",

      "\u201cAny time we go forward, I\u2019m convinced that not only was the verdict correct, but that this punishment is absolutely appropriate under the circumstances,\u201d DeSantis said.",

China is thought to execute more of its citizens than any other nation, although the exact totals are considered a state secret, according to the non-profit Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Robin Maher, the center's executive director, says elected officials in the U.S. have long used the death penalty as a \u201cpolitical tool,\u201d adding it\u2019s \u201ca way of embellishing their own tough-on-crime credentials.\u201d",
      "In 2024, DeSantis signed one death warrant. From 2020-2022, Florida didn\u2019t carry out a single execution. In 2023, DeSantis oversaw six \u2014 the highest number during his time in office until this year. 2023 was also the year the governor challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.",
      "There are a number of reasons why the rate of executions may vary from one administration to the next, said Mark Schlakman, an attorney and Florida State University professor who advised then-governor Lawton Chiles on the death penalty.",

      "One execution after another, opponents of the death penalty hold vigils in the Florida capitol, outside the governor's mansion, and near the state prison that houses the death chamber, as people of faith across the state pray for mercy, healing and justice.",

      "Loni Anderson, who played a struggling radio station's empowered receptionist on the hit TV comedy \"WKRP in Cincinnati,\" died Sunday, just days before her 80th birthday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Anderson died at a Los Angeles hospital following a \"prolonged\" illness, said her longtime publicist, Cheryl J. Kagan.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to announce the passing of our dear wife, mother and grandmother,\" Anderson's family said in a statement.",
      "\"WKRP in Cincinnati\" aired on CBS from 1978-1982 and was set in a flagging Ohio radio station trying to reinvent itself with rock music. The cast included Gary Sandy, Tim Reid, Howard Hesseman, Frank Bonner and Jan Smithers, alongside Anderson as the sexy and smart Jennifer Marlowe.",
      "As the station's receptionist, the blonde and high-heeled Jennifer used her sex appeal to deflect unwanted business calls for her boss, Mr. Carlson. Her efficiency often kept the station running in the face of others' incompetence.",
      "The role earned Anderson two Emmy Award nominations and three Golden Globe nominations.",
      "Anderson starred on the big screen alongside Burt Reynolds in the 1983 comedy \"Stroker Ace,\" and the two later married and became tabloid fixtures before divorcing in 1994. Reynolds died in 2018.",
      "Anderson wrote a 1995 autobiography, \"My Life in High Heels,\" which she said was about \"the growth of a woman, a woman who survives. It's about my childhood, the death of my parents, my career, my divorces, and my children. Then of course, the trauma of my marriage to Burt.\"",
      "\"I think if you're going to write about yourself, you have to do it warts and all,\" Anderson told The Associated Press. \"You may not even tell the nicest things about yourself, because you're telling the truth.\"",
      "Anderson is survived by her husband Bob Flick, daughter Deidra and son-in law Charlie Hoffman, son Quinton Anderson Reynolds, grandchildren McKenzie and Megan Hoffman, stepson Adam Flick and wife Helene, step-grandchildren Felix and Maximilian.",

    "story": [
      "Jeannie Seely, the soulful country music singer behind such standards like \"Don't Touch Me,\" has died. She was 85.",
      "Her publicist, Don Murry Grubbs, said she died Friday after succumbing to complications from an intestinal infection.",
      "Known as \"Miss Country Soul\" for her unique vocal style, Seely was a trailblazer for women in country music, celebrated for her spirited nonconformity and for a string of undeniable hits in the '60s and '70s.",
      "Her second husband, Gene Ward, died in December. In May, Seely revealed that she was in recovery after undergoing multiple back surgeries, two emergency procedures and spending 11 days in the ICU. She also suffered a bout of pneumonia.",
      "\"Rehab is pretty tough, but each day is looking brighter and last night, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And it was neon, so I knew it was mine!\" she said in a statement at the time. \"The unsinkable Seely is working her way back.\"",
      "Dolly Parton was one of several country music luminaries paying her tribute on Friday, saying she met Seely when they were both young and starting out in Nashville.",
      "\"She was one of my dearest friends,\" Parton said on her social media accounts. \"I think she was one of the greater singers in Nashville and she had a wonderful sense of humor. We had many wonderful laughs together, cried over certain things together and she will be missed.\"",
      "Singer Charlie Daniels said on X that Seely was \"a national treasure, and one fine lady.\"",
      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and was raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job with Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \"Don't Touch Me,\" the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",
      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the '60s and '70s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \"Don't Touch Me,\" 1967's \"I'll Love You More (Than You Need)\" and 1973's \"Can I Sleep In Your Arms?\", adapted from the folk song \"Can I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\"",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \"Sunday's with Seely\" on Willie Nelson's Willie's Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her last song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \"Suffertime,\" recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 15:38:49 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

      "Deen ran The Lady & Sons restaurant with her two sons, Jamie and Bobby Deen, for nearly three decades. Loyal fans visiting Savannah continued to line up for Deen's buffet long after the Food Network canceled her show, \"Paula's Home Cooking,\" in 2013.",
      "But 78-year-old Deen said Friday that The Lady & Sons closed for good along with her second Savannah eatery, The Chicken Box. A statement posted on Deen's website and social media accounts didn't say why the restaurants had shut down.",
      "\"Hey, y'all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady & Sons and The Chicken Box,\" Deen's statement said.",
      "\"Thank you for all the great memories and for your loyalty over the past 36 years,\" she said. \"We have endless love and gratitude for every customer who has walked through our doors.\"",

      "Deen said Friday she and her sons will visit the Branson establishment on Aug. 8, and said the family is \"excited to continue visiting these restaurants regularly.\"",
      "\"Savannah will always be our home, and we'll always be here to support our wonderful community,\" she said in the statement.",
      "Hey, y\u2019all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady...",
      "Windows at The Lady & Sons were covered with brown paper on Friday. Signs posted at the front entrance read: \"It is with heavy hearts and tremendous gratitude that we announce that we have retired and closed.\"",
      "Martin Rowe works in a downtown office across the street from Deen's restaurant. He said business seemed to be going strong up until it closed.",
      "\"Nobody knew anything was wrong,\" Rowe said. \"I walk by there two or three times a week at lunch, and it was always packed.\"",
      "Deen was divorced and nearly broke when she moved to Savannah with her boys in 1989 and started a catering business called The Bag Lady. She opened her first restaurant a few years later at a local Best Western hotel, then started The Lady & Sons in downtown Savannah in 1996.",
      "The restaurant soon had lines out the door and served roughly 1,100 diners per day at the height of Deen's popularity. A USA Today food critic awarded The Lady & Sons his \"meal of the year\" in 1999.",
      "Deen moved her Savannah restaurant to a larger building nearby the year after The Food Network debuted \"Paula's Home Cooking\" in 2002. Filmed mostly in her home kitchen, Deen taped more than 200 episodes over the next decade.",
      "The Food Network canceled Deen's show in 2013 amid fallout from a lawsuit by a former employee. A transcript of Deen answering questions under oath in a legal deposition became public, which included Deen's awkward responses to questions about race.",
      "Asked if she had ever used the N-word, Deen said, \"Yes, of course,\" though she added: \"It's been a very long time.\"",
      "Deen returned to television on ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars,\" on chef Gordon Ramsay's Fox show \"MasterChef: Legends,\" and on Fox Nation, which began streaming \"At Home With Paula Deen\" in 2020.

      "\"Amy Bradley is Missing,\" directed by Ari Mark and Phil Lott, explores the unsolved case that has puzzled investigators for nearly three decades. Bradley disappeared from her family's cruise, leaving behind numerous theories but few concrete answers.",
      "\"The Amy Bradley story is something if you've been around the genre, you know about it,\" Mark said. \"It's one of the most baffling mysteries of a disappearance case.\"",
      "The case presents multiple scenarios for what may have happened to Bradley.

      "The judge in a ruling made public Wednesday dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of any significant action with the claim, which was filed in state district court earlier this year. Baldwin's attorneys will have 30 days to file a motion seeking reinstatement.",
      "Luke Nikas, Baldwin's lead attorney, told The Associated Press in an email that the dismissal amounted to a nonevent since his team has been waiting to prosecute the case.",
      "\"We have been in good-faith settlement discussions with the parties to the lawsuit and will be refiling promptly if those discussions are not promptly and favorably resolved,\" he said.",
      "Defendants include special prosecutor Kari Morrissey and Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, along with three investigators from the Santa Fe County sheriff's office and the county board of commissioners.",
      "A charge of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin was dismissed at trial last year on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense. The trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office months earlier by a man who said it could be related to the killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.",
      "The allegations in Baldwin's tort claim include defamation, with his attorneys saying that prosecutors and investigators targeted the actor and coproducer for professional or political gain.",
      "Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during a rehearsal for the movie \"Rust\" in October 2021 at a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when it discharged, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the revolver fired.",
      "The actor recently spoke to The Associated Press at San Diego's Comic-Con International, saying he couldn't believe what happened that day in court as the trial came to an abrupt end, and that his life over the last year has been far better than the few years that preceded it.",
      "Still, Baldwin and other producers of \"Rust\" are being sued in New Mexico state court by the parents and younger sister of Hutchins. Court records show a deposition for Baldwin in that case was put off in May and has yet to be rescheduled.",

      "A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers, made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \"baby parade.\"",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump's administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\"There's all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\" said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don't have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies' lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician, associate dean for public health at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breastfeeding supplies and baby clothes, but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities\u00a0near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She's heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade on Friday.",
      "\"For so long, moms have been vilified and not supported,\" Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\"So this time around, I didn't have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\" she said.",
      "Celeste Lord-Timlin, a Flint resident and program participant, attended the baby parade with her husband and 13-month-old daughter by her side. She said the deposits helped her pay for graduate school while she was pregnant.",
      "\"It allowed us to really enjoy being new parents,\" she said.",
      "The program relies heavily on philanthropic donations, but Hanna's long-term goal is for the government to be the main provider.",
      "\"I see philanthropy as the doula of this program; they are helping birth it,\" she said. \"They are helping us prove that this is possible.\"",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",
      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \"no-brainer\" way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\"We've been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\" he said. \"And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\"",
      "A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate.",
      "But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care, not just the number of babies being born here.",
      "Under Trump's tax and spending bill that Congress passed in July, the child tax credit is boosted from $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. But millions of families at lower income levels will not get the full credit.",
      "The bill will also create a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "That's not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\"We don't have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\" Hanna said. \"No wonder people aren't having children and our birth rates are going down.\"",

    "summary": "Revisions are a \"feature, not a bug\" of any jobs report, former BLS commissioner told CBS MoneyWatch.",
    "story": [
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics last week issued a\u00a0steep downward revision\u00a0to May and June's hiring numbers, prompting President Trump to call the edits \"miscalculations\" by the department's commissioner, whom he subsequently fired, in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Aug. 1.",
      "While the downward revision of May and June payroll growth by 258,000 marked the largest two-month downward revision to the jobs numbers since 1968, revisions themselves are not uncommon. Revisions are \"a feature, not a bug\" of the agency's reporting process, Erica Groshen, former BLS commissioner under the Obama administration told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Larger revisions have been recorded, but only when the economy has been in a recession, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis of BLS data.",
      "How the BLS processes its reports",
      "The BLS surveys both households and businesses for its monthly jobs report. After releasing an initial report, it's common for the agency to issue revisions to the prior monthly figures, as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "That's because while some survey recipients respond to the agency's surveys immediately, others report data late. In the interest of reporting employment information in a timely manner, though, the BLS initially issues its monthly jobs report based on an incomplete collection of responses.",
      "\"The BLS wants to get the information as accurate as possible, but it doesn't want to wait too long to put out information that's useful,\" Groshen said. \"So it puts out preliminary numbers, saying they are an estimate, then it gathers more information and improves that estimate.\"",
      "\"If you send out a survey to a bunch of people, some will turn it back in on time and some of them won't,\" Michele Evermore, a former Department of Labor employee and senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The faster you make a determination, the more you're going to have to fill in the blanks,\" she said. In the interim, the BLS relies on scientific modeling to paint a more complete picture of the state of the job market. \"You have to fill in the gaps, and the more reports you get back, the more holes you can fill, and the more accurate a report you get.\"",
      "Eventually, the inclusion of late responses to surveys by both employers and workers enables the agency to provide a more accurate picture of the state of hiring and unemployment in the U.S., Evermore explained.",
      "The cuts to the number of jobs that were added in May and June were spread out across both public- and private-sector jobs. The downward revision to public-sector payroll growth \"mostly reflected lower state and local government job gains,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note. Private-sector job gains were previously overstated because of incomplete response data, according to the analysts.",
      "Groshen acknowledged that the revisions were \"definitely on the large side,\" but that \"they happen, and are the product of the same monthly process.\"",
      "Cuts pertaining to government jobs were driven primarily by reductions in hiring by state and local education establishments, according to the BLS. Groshen attributes the job cuts to the expiration of pandemic-era government subsidies that are leading to a pullback in hiring.",
      "\"These subsidies were cut, so they are not hiring as many people as they had been in the past, and state and local governments often report late, so that information came in late,\" she said.",
      "Evermore, of The Century Foundation, noted that the BLS revisions only apply to jobs that were added in both May and June, and not to \"the pool of all the jobs in the U.S.\"",
      "\"While it seems like a big revision, percentage-wise, it's floating on top of the entire labor market. So while it's big, it's not as dramatic as some people are acting like it is,\" she said.",
      "Dismissal of BLS commissioner",
      "In his Truth Social post on Friday, Mr. Trump accused BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer of political bias before announcing her dismissal in response to the downward revision of jobs numbers. \"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote.",
      "Despite being probed for answers,, the White House has not provided any evidence that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes.",
      "According to Groshen, the drastic revise of the job numbers don't reflect a \"failure\" of the BLS to do its job.",
      "\"It's not a failure and it's not bias. It's not like the commissioner said, 'Oh, I think I'm going to change that numbers.' The commissioner has no power, no ability to do that.\"",
      "Evermore concurred. \"Having worked with BLS for years, it's impossible to cook the books as things stand,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "On Tuesday, California congressman Rep. George Whitesides, a Democrat, introduced a bill that his office said would prevent the president from \"unjustly firing the head of a statistical agency for politically-motivated reasons.\"",
      "Called the Statistical Agency Integrity and Independence Act, it asserts that a President may only dismiss the head of a federal statistical agency for cause, including demonstrated inefficiency.",
      "\"Now more than ever, as our economy reels from the impacts of haphazard tariffs and instability, we need data we can trust,\" Whitesides said in a statement Tuesday. He added that Mr. Trump's decision to fire McEntarfer \"sets a dangerous precedent.\"",
      "Data collection",
      "For years, it's become increasingly difficult to collect complete data based on surveys fielded to hundreds of thousands of employers and individuals, according to Groshen.",
      "\"There is a very long-term term trend of a declining response rate, which is bedeviling the system,\" she said. That's in part because some surveys are fielded over the phone, and American households are increasingly ditching landlines.",
      "Jeff Strohl, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, a research policy institute, echoes others in noting that BLS releases monthly jobs numbers knowing that they'll be revised. But the agency prioritizes timeliness over 100% accuracy because \"the currency of the data is still important,\" he said.",
      "Low response rates \u2014 only about 70% of employers surveyed respond on time \u2014 make revisions inevitable. according to Strohl. \"A month later, the response rate goes up to 90%-95%, so you have 25%, or 150,000, more firms reporting their data,\" he said.",
      "Additionally, weekly shocks to the economy, such as created by tariffs, adds another layer to the challenge of releasing accurate jobs data each month.",
      "\"The U.S. economy is going through a huge number of shocks on a weekly basis,\" Strohl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Tariffs are being threatened and applied, and there is a level of economic uncertainty affecting the job market.\"",
      "For example, he said, some job seekers are having offers rescinded as major universities lose research grants. \"That's stopping hires from working on projects the money was going to feed,\" he said.",

      "New research shows a growing divide in progress in the workforce between women who have earned at least a bachelor's degree and those without any higher education.",
      "The share of college-educated women in the workforce increased by nine percentage points between 2004 and 2024, research from Third Way, a think tank advocating for moderate policy, shows. Meanwhile, women without a college degree barely notched gains: The share of noncollege women in the workforce increased by less than a percentage point over the same period, according to the report.",
      "\"This divergence in the labor force experience of women with and without college degrees speaks to changes in recent years in the workplace, and around the culture of work,\" Curran McSwigan, Third Way's deputy director of economics and author of the report told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those changes are weighted toward women with degrees.\"",
      "Flex work",
      "For example, flexible work arrangements are now more common across corporations, allowing some workers to do their jobs from home, at least part of the time, and better balance work with caregiving duties.",
      "\"Remote work has inherently baked in a lot more flexibility, so working mothers may be able to pop out to take their kids to doctors appointments, instead of taking time off,\" McSwigan said.",
      "White-collar firms have also improved benefits related to caregiving, with some even offering workers child care subsidies, allowing mothers to stay in the labor force, according to McSwigan. But women without a college degree are more likely to work in service-sector jobs that aren't as well paid and don't offer the same child care benefits.",
      "\"White collar workplaces are more likely to provide workers with access to paid leave policies, even child care subsidies, and those are not traditionally the same types of benefits you see in more service-sector work that noncollege women are in,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Women in the service-sector may also work variable shifts, and require child care at hours during which day care centers don't typically operate.",
      "\"A lot of day care centers are only open 9 to 5, so they are coming up to other barriers as well, that are inherent to the types of jobs they are working,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Mothers without college sidelined",
      "Working mothers with college degrees notched even greater gains in the work place over the past two decades, with their participation rising by 11 percentage points, from 57% to 68%, according to the report. By contrast, the percentage of noncollege-educated mothers working full-time increased just 0.1% in the last 20 years.",
      "\"We have heard from policymakers that there has been strong labor force bounce back for women and that we are overcoming the 'she-cession' and making progress when it comes to women in workplace,\" McSwigan said. \"But what the data and analysis is showing is these gains can be attributed to college women, and noncollege women are still on workforce sidelines, and it's hard to say we are making progress for working women if only those with college degrees are benefitting.\"",
      "For this reason, McSwigan emphasizes the need for broad-based policy efforts that support \"the different needs that families are facing\" to ensure that all working women receive the same benefits that college-degree holders have.",

The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",

Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",

      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant jobs report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"We know the economy has ups and downs, and we're in a pretty stagnant place right now.\"",
      "In other words, while the labor market isn't seeing massive layoffs, companies also aren't expanding their hiring plans. That can make it difficult for unemployed workers to find new jobs, with the number of people searching for work for more than 27 weeks jumping 11% to 1.8 million last month compared with a year earlier, government data shows.",
      "Pockets of strength",
      "To be sure, there were pockets of strength in the jobs report, with health care and social assistance adding a combined 73,300 jobs last month, the BLS reported. But many major U.S. employment sectors saw little or no hiring, including leisure and hospitality, transportation and construction, while others \u2014 including manufacturing \u2014 saw job losses last month, the July data shows.",
      "President Trump on Friday claimed without evidence that the jobs report was manipulated for \"political purposes,\" and fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.",
      "He also asserted that the downward revisions were \"a major mistake,\" although the BLS revises its data each month to reflect new information, and the numbers frequently move both up and down.",
      "\"The president's belief that the BLS commissioner personally 'produced' the jobs numbers is preposterous and shows a complete misunderstanding of how government statistical agencies operate,\" noted Heidi Shierholz, the president of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute and a former chief economist at the Department of Labor, in a post about McEntarfer's firing.",
      "She added, \"These data are the product of careful work by hundreds of expert economists, statisticians and civil servants following transparent, well-established methodologies.\"",
      "Tariff uncertainty",
      "Businesses have been expressing hesitation given the uncertain impact\u00a0of the Trump's tariffs, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"I'm hearing that uncertainty has really been weighing on businesses,\" Hammack said of her discussions with business owners in her district, which spans Eastern Kentucky, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania and part of West Virginia.\u00a0 \"They've been having a tough time to decide when to invest, how much to invest. Many of them have scaled back plans for investment.\"",
      "For instance, one franchise owner said that they planned to refurbish their existing locations, rather than open new locations, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs would revive U.S. manufacturing because companies will reshore or open new factories domestically, rather than pay the import duties.",
      "Some Trump officials portrayed the jobs report as a temporary setback as the administration seeks to revive American jobs through its trade policies.",
      "\"Obviously there were elements of [the jobs report] that we didn't love, but the trade deals are now in place that cover \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 almost 60% of the global economy,\" Stephen Miran, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters Friday.",
      "With the setting of new tariff rates on Thursday for dozens of nations, uncertainty has also been resolved, he added. \"There probably were a lot of firms that, you know, sort of sitting there in May and June saying, 'Hey, you know, this tariff stuff's about to be resolved, this bill you know hopefully becomes law within a month or two \u2014 maybe I'm just going to hold off on this investment program.'\"",
      "Also on Friday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement describing a flourishing economy under President Trump. \"Inflation has cooled, wages have increased, unemployment is stable, and the private sector is growing. President Trump's America First agenda has ensured new jobs go to American citizens, instead of illegals or foreign-born workers. The tariffs are raking in billions of dollars to make our country wealthy again,\" the statement read in part.",
      "A decline in manufacturing jobs",
      "The U.S. lost 11,000 manufacturing jobs in July, and the revisions for May and June also show that the sector shed workers during those months. That's notable given Mr. Trump's promise to revive manufacturing jobs, which has led to new agreements from the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Apple to build new plants in the U.S.",
      "But the Trump administration's tariffs have added to the challenges facing the manufacturing sector, especially those producing durable goods such as appliances and automobiles, noted Indeed's Ullrich. For instance, tariffs on imported metals such as steel and aluminum are making it pricier for many manufacturers to create their products, putting pressure on their margins and profits.",
      "The downturn in manufacturing jobs \"is hardly surprising,\" said Scott Paul, president of the trade group the Alliance for American Manufacturing, in an email. \"It's another 'treading water' number, which has been the case more often than not for the past few years. But it is concerning that we're now 173,000 jobs below the most recent peak in February 2023,\" when total nonfarm payroll employment rose to 155.4 million.",
      "It's possible that manufacturing jobs could reverse the trend now that the Trump administration's tariffs and tax policies are settled, Paul added.",
      "Progress on the Trump administration's goal of reshoring American manufacturing jobs may take years, given the cost and time required to build new factories, Ullrich noted. \"There are certain products that, even with the tariffs, are still cheaper to make overseas,\" she added.",
      "\"This is not a healthy job market,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"The economy needs certainty soon on tariffs. The longer this tariff whiplash lasts, the more likely this weak hiring environment turns into layoffs.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 16:31:25 -0400",
    "summary": "Prices could tick higher in 2025 as businesses pass tariff costs on to consumers, Cleveland Fed's Beth Hammack tells CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Americans could see inflation tick higher in 2025 as businesses start to pass on the cost of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers through price hikes, Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview.",
      "So far this year, inflation has remained relatively muted despite President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs, partially because many businesses stockpiled goods and manufacturing parts ahead of the import duties' implementation. Some business facing higher tariffs also chose to hold off on passing cost increases onto consumers as they awaited more clarity around where tariff rates would settle. Additionally, the Trump administration instituted numerous pauses on threatened levies, delaying cost increases for businesses and consumers.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pushing the Fed to cut interest rates, citing subdued inflation numbers and cuts from other major central banks, such as in the U.K. and the European Union. But the Federal Reserve last week maintained its benchmark rate at the same level where it's been parked since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell citing the risks of higher inflation due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "That's a danger also highlighted by Hammack, who said she believes inflation could reach a 3% annual rate this year, representing a pace that would be 1 percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of a 2% annualized rate.",
      "\"Individual businesses have been trying to hold back on, passing on those [tariff] costs, because they're worried about what it might mean for demand,\" Hammack told O'Grady. \"They've been selling inventory that they'd accumulated early in the year, and so they didn't need to charge for the tariffs on that, but they're coming through those stockpiles.\"",
      "She added, \"They're coming to the point where their margins are getting squeezed and they need to start passing that onto consumers.\"",
      "Many households are still struggling with the cost of living, with half of Americans saying they view grocery prices as a major source of stress in their life right now, outpacing housing cost and health care, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"Two-speed economy\"",
      "Hammack said the U.S. appears to be in a \"two-speed economy.\"",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" she noted. \"They're feeling a lot of excitement about the stock market, how their 401(k)s are doing, and they're feeling flush with cash.\"",
      "But, she added, low-income households are facing a lot of economic challenges.",
      "\"I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef,\" Hammack said. \"They're buying hot dogs, they're looking at their $400 emergency fund, and it's not able to pay for a new air conditioner or the car repairs that it used to be able to pay for.\"",
      "Price pressures from the Trump administration's tariffs could cause a one-time increase in costs as businesses adjust their prices to cover the import duties, she added. Fed officials are focused on making sure that the price hikes don't become what she calls a \"more persistent inflationary problem.\"",
      "\"What I'm focused on is making sure that we have an economy that's working for all Americans,\" Hammack said. \"Which is why I believe we need to stay really focused on the inflation side of our mandate.\"",
      "At the same time, Friday's disappointing jobs report shows that the labor market is also facing fresh challenges, with employers hiring fewer workers than expected in July. The Fed's mandate is to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with the central bank turning to interest rate hikes to cool inflation or rate cuts to help the job market.",
      "With both inflation on the rise and the job market experiencing some headwinds, the Fed has a delicate balancing act, she noted.",
      "\"This is a really challenging time for monetary policy makers, because both sides of our mandate are being challenged,\" Hammack said. \"And so the decision of which way to go and how quickly to move is a really difficult one right now.",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next decision on interest rates in September, and some analysts are already calling for a rate cut with the US economy seeing three straight months of weak jobs growth. Hammack admits waiting too long to cut rates because of potential inflation is a risk.",
      "\"If we wait too long to cut rates, that could mean that more people are losing their jobs than we'd like to see,\" Hammack said. \"We have to balance those two factors when we're trying to decide what's right to steer the economy forward.",

      "Equal to 2018 pay package",
      "The electric vehicle maker said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package that was awarded to the company's CEO.",

      "U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\"China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\" China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\"Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\"",
      "\"We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \"tough\" negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \"I believe that we have the makings of a deal,\" Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \"Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\" for Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that\u00a0China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",

      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Mr. Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Mr. Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \"the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Mr. Trump has made it clear he wants a \"headline-grabbing deal\" with Xi, \"so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \"strategic solidarity\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\"Beijing simply can't afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \"It's too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\"",

In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics.",
      "This past week, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested.\"",

      "Georgia is the only state with a work requirement in place for Medicaid, but several states have been pursuing such a policy for years, only to be blocked by courts or, most recently, the Biden administration. Some seek state-specific touches to the new rules. Others aim to implement work requirements before the federal law takes effect at the end of 2026.",
      "These states' moves and Mr. Trump's massive tax-and-spending law share one demand: To keep their Medicaid health coverage, adults who can work must prove they're logging a minimum number of hours at a job or school, or else qualify for one of the few exemptions.",

      "South Dakota, for example, announced in July that it would not submit an application for work requirements as previously planned amid concerns that the state's laxer rules would not be allowed under the new federal law. The state's Department of Social Services secretary had warned that working on a state proposal while the federal rules are being hashed out could be \"an exercise in futility.\"",

      "It's unclear how federal officials will respond to the states' requests, she added, but \"we are aware that some folks think there is no wiggle room here.\"",
      "States can tweak their Medicaid programs through what are known as demonstration waivers, which are subject to federal approval. The waivers are designed to test new ideas in policy gray areas.",
      "The states that have filed or plan to file such applications with work requirements include Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.",
      "Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona's Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.",
      "Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona's plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.",
      "The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.",
      "Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements \u2014 called \"community engagement\" standards under the state plan \u2014 in 2019, but the state's application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality \"as soon as is practicable.\"",
      "The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.",
      "Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn't know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.",
      "\"The state should have a say,\" Lammers said. \"We're very independent, and everyone is different.\"",
      "In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.",
      "In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina's proposal \"a state-specific solution.\"",
      "The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. \"Georgia Pathways to Coverage\" expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they're working, not monthly. That's a pivot away from the program's initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.",
      "Fiona Roberts, a spokesperson for Georgia's Medicaid agency, said the state is still waiting to hear whether it needs to alter its plan.",
      "So Georgia is among the states in limbo, awaiting guidance from the federal government.",

    "story": [
      "Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said in an interview that aired Sunday that tariff rates are \"pretty much set\" on more than 60 trading partners after President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "\"So these, these tariff rates are pretty much set,\" Greer said in an interview Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.\"",
      "Hours ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline for baseline tariffs on Friday, the White House announced tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. All imports will have a 10% tariff rate as of Aug. 7, according to the executive order.",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump will be negotiating the tariff rate down in coming days, Greer answered, \"I don't think they will be,\" but he added these tariff rates are \"set rates pursuant to deals.\"",
      "\"When the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do,\" Greer said. \"And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this.\"",
      "Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, the Trump administration touted a number of deals for tariffs, including South Korea, the European Union and Britain. But other major U.S. trading partners did not reach deals, including Canada, which Mr. Trump levied a 35% tariff on goods not subject the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada is the U.S.' second-largest trading partner.",
      "\"The President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have,\" the trade adviser said.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who Brennan interviewed separately on \"Face the Nation,\" said that Bank of America economists have predicted that while the economy will still continue to grow, they are predicting \"less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.\"",
      "As for the economic impact that tariffs will have on the economy, Moynihan said \"no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Aug 2025 09:30:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Nik and Adinah Johnson, who retired in their forties, are part of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early), a movement that looks at work as a means to an end, and where frugality buys freedom from the rat race.",
    "story": [
      "On a recent Sunday morning, at a Bible camp outside of Gainesville, Florida, Nik Johnson got up to preach, not about hellfire and brimstone, but about a very different fire: Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE). \"Ultimately at the end of the day, financial independence really ain't about us,\" he said. \"It's about people that we love and the causes that we care about.\"",
      "This was Camp FI. Its attendees: retirees and aspiring retirees who looked a little on the young side.",
      "When Johnson met his wife, Adinah, some 30 years ago, she knew right away, he was a saver: \"Our first date, he had a coupon,\" she said.",
      "\"I did use a coupon! And I'm not ashamed about it,\" said Nik. \"I knew that if I presented a coupon and she had an issue with it, she was not my soulmate.\"",
      "Adinah's reaction? \"How many other coupons do you have? What's the best deal? Wait a minute, let's see what we could do here!\"",
      "Nik worked in software, while Adinah was in higher ed. And despite modest starting salaries, they managed to pay off their home and save $1.6 million by consuming less, saving more, and putting 300,000 miles on their beloved minivan, Big Red.",
      "Nik said, \"I shared this with Adinah: I always wanted to be to the point that when I got to 50 I didn't want to have to work. And so honestly, I didn't exactly know how to achieve that.\"",
      "Then, one day during the pandemic, Nik was poking around on the Internet and discovered the FIRE Movement, which led him to Camp FI \u2013 a group of hardcore savers and careful spenders who share tips, tricks and philosophical discourse with basically one goal \u2026 to get out of the rat race.",
      "It's all inspired by Peter Adeney, who blogs under the name Mr. Money Mustache. \"American life is so inefficient,\" he said. \"We're all just kind of following each other, what each other does, and not realizing where all of this time and money is slipping through our hands. So, start doing things that are different from what other people do, would probably be the first piece of advice.\"",
      "Adeney retired at age 30, and turned 50 this year. He said, \"I often think that, because I retired so early, I have lived a lot longer than a normal 50-year-old. Like, I feel like I retired 100 years ago, because I've had so many experiences. It's a great antidote to the usual thing, where people say, 'Life goes by too fast. Then, you miss it.'",
      "\"However, it doesn't solve your happiness problems,\" Adeney said. \"One of my friends who's also a blogger says, like, he still had to confront some demons and some emotional issues. And taking away his job just exposed them more, 'cause he could no longer distract himself from them.\"",
      "The key to saving for retirement, according to Adeney, is to figure out what's important to you \u2013 and trim your spending everywhere else.",
      "Vicki Robin is a sort of mythical figure in the FIRE Movement. She is the co-author (with Joe Dominguez) of the 1992 personal finance book, \"Your Money or Your Life.\" She said, \"As you start to elaborate what's important to you, you realize, like, 'I'm gonna minimize the amount of money I spend, 'cause that's my life energy.' And there's some formula that arises in your mind of, like, 'The less I spend, the more life I have.'\"",
      "Robin's philosophy is less about early retirement and more about asking what is \"enough,\" which differs for everyone. But the consensus of the FIRE Movement is that, to retire, you have to save and invest 25 times your yearly expenses, and then live off of a 4% drawdown each year.",
      "Robin said, \"It's just, 'Okay, how can I have enough for a life that's really happy, but no excess, so that I can liberate my time to do what I find I'm called to do, what I care to do?' And, you know, that evolves over time. I have a little phrase that I've said: I buy my freedom with my frugality every day.\"",
      "A frugality which Nik and Adina Johnson say they are now reaping the rewards of, along with their three children: a life less defined by the \"stuff\" they possess, and more by the freedom they enjoy.",
      "Nik said, \"They're gonna always remember this trip to Disney. But they're not gonna remember, you know, that extra pair of tennis shoes I bought my son. My son's not gonna look at me like, 'Hey Dad, remember that blazer you had on? Man, it was awesome!'\"",
      "Asked what these early retirees' day looks like, Adinah replied, \"Well, I have to pick up the kids, and then I have to take my son to football practice. And then whatever grocery shopping I may have needed to do while I was doing this interview, I need to go ahead and get some of that grocery shopping done.\"",
      "\"Doesn't sound like she needs my help for any of that; I'll probably go play golf,\" Nik laughed.",
      "I observed, \"Seems like one of you is more retired than the other one.\"",

      "President Trump ordered his administration to fire the commissioner of labor statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "\"No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "He added, \"She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"",
      "The president described the latest report, which showed employers in July added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, as \"a shock,\" adding that the downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June was a \"major mistake.\"",
      "McEntarfer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the latest employment report revision for May and June undermines the data's accuracy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics frequently revises its previous job numbers to reflect new information, while past months' numbers are often revised both upwards and downwards. The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",
      "Mr. Trump \"is firing the messenger because he doesn't seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he's damaged the economy,\" Lily Roberts, managing director for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a statement.",
      "She added, \"The data he wants to hide is produced by nonpartisan economists who have been doing this work for decades. Politicizing our country's collection of data on what's going on in the economy could shake markets that rely on unbiased information, and it will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job.\"",
      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate.

      "Warren Buffett's\u00a0company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in\u00a0Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it must record the current value of its massive investment portfolio, even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprised shareholders by\u00a0selling off\u00a0a huge chunk of its Apple stake, which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it has had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft's core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",
      "Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting when he announced that he plans to\u00a0give up the CEO title\u00a0at the end of the year and hand over operations to\u00a0Vice Chairman Greg Abel, but Buffett will remain Chairman.",
      "Berkshire shareholders might be disappointed that the company didn't repurchase any of its shares this quarter, even though the price has fallen more than 12% since just before Buffett announced his retirement.",
      "Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after\u00a0rival Union Pacific announced\u00a0a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with Eastern Rail CSX to be able to compete.",
      "But CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",
      "\"He wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,\" Seifert said. \"I think one of the reasons why that cash hasn't been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there's a logical case to be made they'll accept it.\"",
      "And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments.",

      "The firing drew staunch criticism, with McEntarfer's predecessor William Beach \u2014 who was first nominated in Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 calling it \"groundless\" and a \"dangerous precedent.\"",
      "\"This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,\" Beach said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Trade experts say the Trump administration's barrage of new tariffs could raise prices for consumers and cause headaches for businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order hiking tariffs on U.S. imports could drive up consumer prices and prolong uncertainty for millions of businesses, trade experts said.",
      "Materials issued by the White House on Thursday outline new tariff rates for dozens of countries, but details remain scant on how to implement the trade agreements, said Barry Appleton, co-director of the New York Law School Center for International Law.",
      "\"The last thing businesses want to have are unanswered questions. They were looking for certainty, and what we have instead is a gigantic Rubik's Cube,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone has been waiting for 'Liberation Day' to be finished,\" he added, referring to the country-based tariff announcements Mr. Trump first made in early April. \"Instead, with this announcement, we have another perpetuation of what's going on.\"",
      "Under the Trump administration's new import duties, most countries will face a baseline tariff of at least 15%, although other nations will faces levies of more than 40%. The U.S. effective tariff rate is now 17%, according to Fitch Ratings \u2014 the highest in decades.",
      "That could mean pricier garments from Vietnam, shoes and toys from China, chocolate from Switzerland, and coffee from Brazil, according to economists. As a result, the revised U.S. tariffs could cost Americans an average of $2,048 per year, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing, and points to still-fairly-low inflation rates. But many economists warn\u00a0tariffs can lead\u00a0to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves\u00a0rattled financial markets.",
      "The White House has said that Mr. Trump's trade policies benefit Americans.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "On social media, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the tariffs are \"a knockout win over the distorted global trading order that has disadvantaged American workers, farmers, and manufacturers for decades.\"",
      "He added that Trump's foreign trade policy has achieved \"expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments that will create great American jobs.\"",
      "Which products could get pricier?",
      "In the U.S., the products most commonly imported from abroad \u2014 and therefore most likely to see their prices rise because of sharply higher tariffs \u2014 include household appliances, furniture, cars, clothing, sports equipment, toys and cleaning products, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "The price of such goods rose about 1% in June, or more than double the increase in May, according to the investment research firm's analysis of consumption data, a sign that tariffs are starting to seep into the cost of everyday items.",
      "\"The question is really what's not going to go up in price. The costs were being eaten in the profits of companies, but that's not sustainable,\" Appleton said.",
      "Mr. Trump slapped some of the highest tariffs on key trade partners like Canada, a major provider of lumber to U.S. companies. That could lead to higher housing costs, according to Oxford. Some fruits and vegetables also could get pricier this winter as grocery stores leans on imports to stock store shelves, he said.",
      "U.S. automakers including Ford, GM and Stellantis have recently warned that higher U.S. tariffs will reduce their profits by billion of dollars. That is likely to increase new car prices, said Terence Lau, dean of the Syracuse University College of Law and formerly a government affairs executive at Ford.",
      "\"My advice to consumers back in April was that they should wait to buy cars,\" said Lau, who expects dealer prices for 2026 models to rise between 4% and 6%. \"In August, my advice is to buy now.\"",
      "Although many businesses are still selling inventory they imported earlier this year in a bid to avoid higher tariffs, subsequent imports will likely be subject to the newly announced levies when they arrive at U.S. ports, according to trade experts.",
      "\"A lot of businesses front-loaded goods to get them in the door before tariffs were announced. They'll now have to increase their costs as inventories dwindle and businesses start replenishing them,\" Oxford Economics' senior U.S. economist Matthew Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect cost hikes to peak in the second half of the year,\"",
      "Along with facing potentially higher prices, U.S. consumers could face reduced product choices stemming from supply-chain delays, according to economists. That's largely because companies unable to reshore manufacturing to the U.S. are likely to stop importing low-margin goods as they move to control costs.",
      "\"In many cases, tariffs will be so high that we'll create embargoes,\" Martin said. \"That will make it more difficult for retailers and distributors to get things out to market.\"",
      "Rodney Manzo, a supply-chain expert and senior director at Sage, a business management software company, said higher tariffs often end up affecting businesses and consumers in ways beyond the cash register.",
      "\"For the average shopper, the effects don't always show up as a big price hike on the shelf. Instead, it's subtler \u2014 fewer options, smaller quantities and less generous promotions,\" he said. \"Companies are quietly reducing [their stockpiles], reworking product specs or stripping out expensive components to hit margin targets.\"",

      "Factoring in the downward revisions, the three-month average employment gain from May to June was 35,000, compared to an average of 123,000 from January to April.",
      "\"Sadly, employment appears set for a further summer slowdown as firms, facing renewed cost volatility from escalating trade tensions, remain focused on managing labor costs through reduced hiring, performance-based layoffs, restrained wage growth and lower entry-level wages,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said in a report. \"We anticipate job creation will weaken further, remaining below trend in the coming months, with the unemployment rate likely rising toward 4.8% by early 2026.\"",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest gains in July, adding 55,000 jobs. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 12,000 cuts in July.",
      "What it means",
      "Some market analysts said the subpar job growth in July suggests that stepped-up U.S. tariffs on the country's economic partners are weighing on the labor market. President Trump issued an executive order late Thursday that imposes tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Today's Jobs report is unambiguously soft and a reflection of the trade and tariff impact on economic growth,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"Both the actual report and the big negative revisions are more evidence that the trade policy will slow growth.\"",
      "Beyond the ups and down of the job market, meanwhile, many Americans are struggling in an economy bifurcated between rich and poor.",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview. \"At the bottom end of the spectrum, what I hear when I'm out in the district is I hear a lot of struggle. I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef. They're buying hot dogs.\"",
      "The latest job numbers could spur Federal Reserve officials to cut interest rates at their next meeting in September, according to economists. The central bank opted this week to\u00a0hold its benchmark rate steady. President Trump has pushed for a rate cut, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that policymakers remain cautious about lowering rates until the impact of tariffs on the economy is clear.",
      "\"With this morning's payroll miss \u2014 and the downward revisions that came with it \u2014 the Fed will again need to balance a slowing job market with inflation which isn't slowing fast enough,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",

      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",
      "The rise in the PCE's inflation data may lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, said Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.",
      "\"The above-target rise in core prices in June, upward revisions to previous months' data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed's concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Chambers said.",
      "Higher grocery and gas prices",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags.",
      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that its more closely watched Consumer Price Index, its primary inflation measure, also ticked higher in June as the cost of heavily imported items such as appliances, furniture and toys increased.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/keep-call-centers-in-america-act-artificial-intelligence/",
    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

      "\"Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.\"",

It also included Baltimore County, Maryland; Cook County, Illinois; San Diego County, California; and San Francisco County, California, along with 18 cities from Seattle to Philadelphia.",

      "The Justice Department has taken legal action against a number of sanctuary jurisdictions in recent months,\u00a0suing\u00a0New York City in July to challenge its sanctuary city laws.

    "summary": "The House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas to Bill and Hillary Clinton and former Justice Department officials for testimony about Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday to a slew of former attorneys general and FBI directors, as well as former President Bill Clinton, for testimony about the case involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The subpoenas seeking depositions from the former Justice Department officials were issued after Republicans and Democrats on a House Oversight subcommittee approved measures to authorize the demands last month as part of efforts by Congress to obtain more information about Epstein.",
      "House investigators also issued a subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for documents related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his associate who is serving a 20-year prison sentence.",
      "The committee is seeking testimony from Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as from officials spanning the past four presidential administrations: former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, Alberto Gonzales, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder, and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller. Sessions and Barr led the Justice Department during President Trump's first term. Lawmakers are seeking information from the Clintons because of the former president's past ties to Epstein and Maxwell in the early 2000s.",
      "Letters to the officials from Kentucky Rep. James Comer, a Republican who leads the Oversight Committee, are all similar. The records from the Justice Department must be turned over by Aug. 19, according to the Oversight committee, and depositions are scheduled for throughout August, September and October.",
      "\"While the Department undertakes efforts to uncover and publicly disclose additional information related to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell's cases, it is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell,\" Comer wrote, adding that the Oversight panel \"may use the results of this investigation to inform legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "Epstein was charged with federal sex trafficking crimes in 2019 and died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial. He had been investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, though that ended in a federal non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges in 2008.",
      "But Congress has renewed its focus on Epstein after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo last month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" of prominent figures and confirmed he died by suicide. The memo also found that there was \u00a0no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people. The Justice Department and FBI said they did not plan to release any further information about Epstein's case.",
      "The findings rankled some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who are skeptical that there is nothing else regarding Epstein's case to make public. Amid the backlash, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell late last month for two days in Tallahassee, where she was serving her sentence before being moved to a minimum-security facility in Texas last week.",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. An appeal of her conviction is currently awaiting action from the Supreme Court.",
      "Blanche and Bondi have also asked federal judges in New York to unseal transcripts from the grand jury proceedings in Epstein and Maxwell's cases, though federal rules typically require matters before grand juries to be kept secret.",
      "Beyond the moves by the Justice Department, lawmakers have pushed for files related to Epstein to be released to the public. A clash of House members over the material led the House to scrap votes and leave Washington early for its monthlong summer recess.",
      "House Republicans put forth a non-binding resolution last month to make the files from the federal probe into Epstein public, but Speaker Mike Johnson said the lower chamber would not vote on it until September, when lawmakers return from their break.",

    "story": [
      "Crime decreased in every category in 2024, including murder, violent crime and motor vehicle thefts, according to data released by the FBI on Tuesday. It reflects a trend experts have been tracking as reported numbers of violent crimes continue to drop from a spike immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "While the report included good news, a violent crime still occurred on average every 25.9 seconds in the United States last year, according to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, which compiles crime statistics submitted by law enforcement agencies across the country. This year's report used data submitted by 16,675 different agencies, which the FBI said covers a combined population of more than 325 million people, or about 95.6% of U.S. residents.",
      "The FBI's report did not venture to say why the violent crime stats decreased. \"It's difficult if not impossible for us to say why, and each reporting agency would have a different reason why,\" an FBI official said Tuesday in response to a question from CBS News during a briefing.",
      "The FBI did note it has seen an increase in the number of officers shot in the line of duty. \"Between 2021 and 2024, we saw 258 law enforcement officers feloniously killed in the line of duty,\" the FBI official said.",
      "All violent crime decreased last year",
      "Violent crime, which the FBI defines as murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, was down an estimated 4.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, with each subcategory also seeing a decrease.",
      "The murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate decreased 14.9% year over year. Robbery dropped by 8.9%. Rape saw an estimated 5.2% decrease and aggravated assault was down 3%, the report found",
      "The murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate dropped for a second straight year, after dropping from 6.5 to 5.7 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2023. In 2024, the rate dropped again, to 5 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Over the last 20 years, the high mark in the murder rate was recorded in 2020, with 6.7 per 100,000 residents, while the lowest recorded was in 2014, with 4.4 cases per 100,000 people.",
      "Analysis from Jeff Asher, a criminal justice data expert and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics, noted that while murder, rape and robberies have fallen to below pre-COVID levels following a large spike during the pandemic, aggravated assaults, while decreasing, remain \"stubbornly high.\"",
      "In a shift from previous years, both the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office contributed data to the FBI report.",
      "LAPD Chief of Detectives Alan S. Hamilton credited community and violence intervention programs in Los Angeles for contributing to the drop in crime there. \"We made an investment in the future and I think these are the dividends,\" he told CBS News in a phone call Monday night.",
      "Rodney Harrison, former police commissioner of New York's Suffolk County and a CBS News law enforcement contributor, said some of the drops in violent crime could be attributed to criminals shifting their efforts to online crimes like identity theft.",
      "\"If they don't have to go out on the street and run drugs and can make money sitting at the computer, some criminals will do that, which presents a new challenge to police,\" Harrison told CBS News.",
      "Property crime also down",
      "Property crime also saw a considerable decrease of 8.1% in 2024, the FBI report found, following a 2.4% drop in 2023.",
      "Of note, motor vehicle thefts decreased by 18.6% from 2023 to 2024 following several years of increases. It's the largest one-year drop ever recorded in that category, although the overall rate of car thefts is still higher than it was in 2019, according to Asher.",
      "Other subcategories of property crime include burglary, down 8.6%, and larceny-theft, down 5.5%.",
      "The overall property crime rate in 2024 was the lowest recorded since 1961, according to the Council on Criminal Justice.",
      "Downward trend continuing",
      "While the FBI's report is focused on 2024, statistics for the current year are available and show a continuing downward trend, according to analysis from the Council on Criminal Justice.",
      "The homicide rate continued to decline in the first half of 2025, lowering the rate in the U.S. to a level it hasn't seen in a decade, the CCJ said. Although the group noted that while the overall numbers are going down, many cities are still seeing higher homicide rates than they did in the first half of 2019.",
      "\"These numbers are promising but not surprising,\" Ernesto Lopez, senior research specialist at the CCJ, told CBS News. \"After significant increases in violent crime starting in 2020, the decline in all major crime types across all sizes of jurisdictions is promising. These trends are closely aligned with our own findings, which show crime falling last year and continuing to fall in the first six months of 2025.\"",
      "The council also noted the limitations of the FBI's data, which doesn't cover the entire U.S. population and only measures crimes that are reported to law enforcement. Advocates for victims of sexual assault, for example, often note that many rapes go unreported.",
      "\"The police data is critical, but it's also important to remember that most crimes are not reported to police, so the overall volume is much higher than what's represented here,\" the CCJ told CBS News.",

Their options, however, are limited.",
      "At the center of the escalating impasse is Mr. Trump's pursuit of adding five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas before next year that would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority.",
      "\"Greg Abbott is trying to silence the voices of Texans and prevent them from picking the elected officials of their choice, and now he's literally saying he's going to remove the representatives that the people have put into office,\" said Democratic State Rep. James Talarico. \"So he's taken a page of Donald Trump's authoritarian playbook, and it's something we should all protect.\"",

He cited a non-binding 2021 legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, which suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited their office.",

The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to \"physically compel the attendance\" of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year.

    "story": [
      "The Texas Legislature attempted to meet Monday to consider a redistricting plan that would favor Republicans, but Democratic members who left the state over the weekend did not return, denying the quorum needed to convene the session. Gov. Greg Abbott vowed to take steps to remove those lawmakers from their seats, and Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows said he had signed civil arrest warrants for the absent Democrats.",
      "Republicans \"can make idle threats, but as long as they are out of state, there's really nothing that they can do,\" said Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor.",
      "More than 50 Texas House Democrats left the state on Sunday, leaving the chamber short of the two-thirds quorum needed to bring a vote to the floor. Democrats are protesting the President Trump-led effort by Republicans to redraw the state's U.S. House congressional map, which could net the GOP up to five more seats.",
      "\"We are fighting for representative democracy, and whether or not that will continue, and so we're willing to face whatever consequences may come our way,\" Democratic state Rep. James Talarico told CBS News.",
      "\"This House will not sit quietly while you obstruct the work of the people,\" Burrows said Monday.",
      "To assist Burrows, Abbott said Monday that he had ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to \"locate, arrest, and return to the House chamber any member who has abandoned their duty to Texans.\" But the Texas DPS does not have jurisdiction to arrest them out of state. Within the state, they could be placed under civil arrest, which would compel them to return to the Legislature.",
      "Rep. Ann Johnson, a Houston Democrat, told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe in an interview Monday that \"a quorum break is written into the Texas Constitution,\" and \"the threat of arrest is something that should be an alarm for a lot of folks.\"",
      "Abbott claimed Monday on Fox News that the Democrats could face bribery charges if their costs while out of state are being covered by others.",
      "\"I think based upon comments made by legislators themselves, they face a possibility of facing bribery charges, which is a second-degree felony in the state of Texas, there's one way to cure that, and that is if they get back to the state of Texas and make quorum today at a hearing that we have at 3 o'clock, they can cure themselves of any quid pro quo that would subject them to potential bribery charges,\" Abbott said.",
      "But Jones noted that \"Texas, compared to other states, has very loose ethics laws.\"",
      "\"The governor is certainly welcome to make that argument, and theoretically it has a limited level of potential to move forward, but at the end of the day, if you look at Texas ethics law and look at all of the things that are allowed under Texas ethics law \u2026 we would rank receiving money to pay a fine at the lower end at the potential for an ethics violation, let alone things that are illegal,\" Jones said.",
      "Abbott said Sunday that if members didn't return by 3 p.m. CT Monday, he'd \"invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382 to remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House.\"",
      "Abbott was citing a 2021 opinion from Texas' Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, which was written after a previous walkout when Democratic lawmakers left the state to protest a change in the voting laws. The opinion, which is nonbinding, says a \"district court may determine that a legislator has forfeited his or her office due to abandonment and can remove the legislator from office, thereby creating a vacancy.\"",
      "But Jones noted that the only legal ways to remove a Texas lawmaker is either for the person to be expelled by a vote of two-thirds of the Legislature \u2014 which happened when legislators voted to expel\u00a0Republican Rep. Byron Slaton\u00a0over misconduct in 2023 \u2014 or by voters at the ballot box.",
      "Republican state Rep. Briscoe Cain\u00a0posted on social media\u00a0Monday that he would file a bill to declare a seat vacant if a legislator missed seven consecutive days of a session. But since there is no quorum, that bill can't receive a vote \u2014 at least for now.",
      "Abbott called a special session last month to take up the redistricting effort, along with 17 other issues, including relief for Texas flood victims, a review of the flood warning system and emergency preparedness, and a THC ban. Congressional redistricting, however, was to be considered first.",
      "Texas has a part-time legislature which meets for 140 days every other year. The governor has the right to call a 30-day special session to address certain topics. The current special session started on July 21.",

    "summary": "President Trump has previously suggested he's eyeing ways to run again for president. But he downplayed talk of a third term in his latest comments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has suggested in a handful of appearances in recent months and years that he's looking at ways to run again for president, though the Constitution limits any person to being elected to the office twice. But in his latest comments on the issue, the president downplayed talk of a third term.",
      "The president told NBC News in an interview that aired on May 4 that \"I'll be a two-term president.\" And when asked on Aug. 5 whether he'd run again, he said \"no, probably not,\" though he added, \"I'd like to.\"",
      "The comments came after he told NBC in March that he was \"not joking\" about seeking another term in office, after repeatedly publicly musing about the possibility. He also said at the time that despite the constitutional limitations, \"there are methods which you could do it.\"",
      "Trump supporters like former strategist Steve Bannon have called on the president to run again, and Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, introduced a resolution earlier this year to amend the Constitution to allow Mr. Trump to be elected to another term. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also said of Mr. Trump's prospects of serving a third term, \"not without a change in the Constitution.\" He told reporters, \"I think that you guys keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Experts say changing the Constitution is extremely unlikely. Election law scholars\u00a0raised the possibility that talk of a third term, whatever its likelihood, may function as a show of strength to try to stave off the perception that Mr. Trump is a lame-duck president.",
      "Here's a timeline of Mr. Trump's comments on a third term:",
      "\"We're probably entitled to another four after that\"",
      "Mr. Trump flirted with additional time in office beyond two terms when he sought reelection in 2020. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, the president predicted he would win four more years in the White House, and even suggested that he could go on to another term after his second.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"",
      "\"Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump again made reference to another term at a rally in Las Vegas on Jan. 25.",
      "\"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice \u2014 or three times or four times,\" Mr. Trump quipped to applause from the crowd, before adding that \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"",
      "Then on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump joked to Republican lawmakers about a third term. Speaking before the House GOP conference in Florida, Mr. Trump touted the money he'd raised for another race that he said \"I assume I can't use for myself.\"",
      "\"But I'm not 100% sure because, I don't know,\" the president continued, to laughter from House Republicans. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me.\"",
      "At the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Mr. Trump said, \"They say I can't run again \u2014 that's the expression.\"",
      "\"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oh,\" the president added.",
      "On Feb. 20, the president again joked about an additional term at a White House event to mark Black History Month, as he celebrated the support he saw from Black Americans in the 2024 election.",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me,\" Mr. Trump said, as supporters chanted, \"four more years!\"",
      "\"There are methods\"",
      "In an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on March 30, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about serving a third term, and for the first time mentioned an awareness of potential paths.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview, adding that \"it is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "The president pointed to his favorability rating and suggested that Americans would like him to serve a third term. Mr. Trump told Welker, \"I have had more people say, 'please run again,'\" while noting \"we have a long way to go before we even think about that.\" On Air Force One Sunday night, he\u00a0spoke\u00a0with reporters and briefly addressed questions about a third term and reiterated that it's still a distant consideration.",
      "\"No matter how you look at it, we've got a long time to go. We have a long time. You know, we have almost four years to go,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"But despite that, so many people are saying, 'you've got to run again.' They love the job.\"",
      "While speaking to reporters on Monday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump denied that he has ever looked into running for another term.",
      "\"People are asking me to run,\" he said. \"There's a whole story about running for a third term. I don't know. I never looked into it. They do say there's a way you can do it. But I don't know about that. But I have not looked into it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was also asked whether it would open the door to Democrats running former President Barack Obama, who served two consecutive terms, against him.",
      "\"I'd love that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That would be a good one. I'd like that.\"",
      "\"I'll be a two-term president\"",
      "In another interview with Welker conducted on May 2, Mr. Trump downplayed talk of seeking another term. The president said \"so many people want me to do it,\" saying he has \"never had requests so strong as that.\" But he added that \"it's something that, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do.\"",
      "\"This is not something I'm looking to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm looking to have four great years, and turn it over to somebody \u2014 ideally a great Republican, a great Republican \u2014 to carry it forward. But I think we're going to have four years and I think four years is plenty of time to do something really spectacular.\"",
      "Asked about moves by his allies to make another term possible, like by seeking a constitutional amendment, the president said \"that's because they like the job I'm doing, and it's a compliment. It's really a great compliment.\"",
      "\"There are ways of doing it,\" the president added, alluding to a possible write-in vote or move to elect Vice President JD Vance and have him turn the power over to Mr. Trump. But the president said he's \"not looking at that\" and hasn't had official meetings about possible avenues.",
      "\"I'll be an eight-year president,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'll be a two-term president.\"",
      "\"I'd like to run\"",
      "In an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Aug. 5, Mr. Trump touted the support he saw in the 2024 election among Texas voters, calling it \"a record that they say won't be beaten unless I run again.\" When asked whether he plans to run again, the president responded, \"no, probably not.\" He added, \"I'd like to run,\" citing his poll numbers.",
      "\"People love the tariffs, and they love the trade deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And they love that foreign countries aren't ripping us off anymore.\"",

    "story": [
      "Following the dramatic video of an American Airlines flight evacuating on a Denver runway last month, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois is sending a letter to new FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford demanding answers on evacuation safety.",
      "\"The FAA needs an evacuation standard that reflects the reality of flying today,\" Duckworth told CBS News in a statement. \"The American people deserve to know whether the FAA is taking this responsibility seriously and complying with the law to ensure the flying public can be safely evacuated from an aircraft during an emergency.\"",
      "Duckworth, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Aviation Subcommittee, is concerned about the ability to evacuate an airliner in 90 seconds or less.",
      "\"Video showed passengers exiting with carry-on bags and, according to at least one passenger, the process took 10 to 15 minutes \u2014 the latter estimate exceeding FAA's 90 second evacuation standard by 10 times,\" she wrote in her letter to Bedford.",
      "The senator is seeking details about three recent evacuations.",
      "The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are currently investigating after American Airlines Flight 3023, traveling from Denver to Miami, experienced a landing gear issue during takeoff with 173 passengers and six crew members on board. The Boeing 737 Max 8 was going nearly 150 mph when the pilots slammed on the brakes. As passengers used emergency exit slides to evacuate, flames could be seen coming from the landing gear on July 26.",
      "\"We heard a loud boom, and I said 'That's not good,'\" passenger Mark Tsurkis recounted. \"Most of the people evacuated safely, except a few people who decided to take their luggage with them and that kind of, you know, that endangered others and endangered them.\"",
      "In April, a Delta A330 in Orlando experienced an engine fire, prompting passengers to evacuate. Kyle Becker, who was sitting in row 35, said he opened the window as soon as he heard people yell \"fire!\"",
      "\"There was a fire on the engine,\" Becker told CBS News at the time. \"[It] was a little scary\u2026 just never had happened to me before. Start thinking, like, OK, what are the next steps. Trying to remain calm.\"",
      "This incident also prompted an FAA investigation.",
      "And in March, another American Airlines Boeing 737 experienced a fire stemming from an engine issue while it was parked at a gate at Denver International Airport. Passengers filled the wing of the plane trying to escape the smoke.",
      "\"Everyone was screaming, 'There's a fire. There's a fire,'\" Helen Prager, who was on the plane, recalled. \"Literally at the gate and I was screaming, 'Get the doors open.'\"",
      "The FAA and NTSB are looking into the fire.",
      "\"While FAA has yet to disclose how long any of the referenced passenger evacuations took, these incidents once again raise serious questions about FAA's 90 second evacuation standard as well as FAA's assumptions about how evacuations occur in real world conditions (such as the assumption every passenger will comply with instructions to deplane without carry-on bags),\" Duckworth wrote in her letter.",
      "She wants the FAA to disclose how long the evacuations took and how many passengers took their bags with them, as well as how many children, seniors and passengers with disabilities were on board each of the flights.",
      "The senator is also seeking an update on evacuation testing that Congress mandated the FAA complete within one year of the FAA's reauthorization bill passing. That deadline passed in May. The updated testing was to replace a series of tests the FAA conducted in 2019 that did not include any real-world scenarios such as luggage in the cabin and passengers who were children, seniors or not able-bodied.",
      "Last year, Duckworth told CBS News she did not believe she could get off a plane during an emergency in under 90 seconds.",
      "\"Not at all confident, not at all confident. I often fly where I'm not wearing both my artificial legs,\" said Duckworth, who lost both of her legs while serving in the Iraq War. \"I don't think it's realistic anymore. \u2026 Conduct a real test and let's see what the realistic standard is.\"",
      "Duckworth asked the FAA to respond to her letter by Aug. 12.",
      "\"We need answers. Are the current [plane] evacuation standards, are they adequate?\" former NTSB chair and CBS News transportation safety analyst Robert Sumwalt said. \"It's definitely time for the FAA to go back and reassess what standards they're using for evacuations.

      "But the ruling by U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, only narrowly applied to four of the state's 237 districts. That left the impact of the decision limited as thousands of Arkansas students prepared to return to class this month.",

      "Texas and Louisiana have passed similar laws requiring classrooms to display the Ten Commandments and the issue is expected to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\"Why would Arkansas pass an obviously unconstitutional law?\" Brooks wrote in his 35-page ruling. \"Most likely because the state is part of a coordinated strategy among several states to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms.\"",

They said his words \"good afternoon, Copacabana, good afternoon my Brazil, a hug to everyone, this is for our freedom\" \u2014 broadcast from a cell phone of one of his sons during a Sunday protest in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 cannot \"be regarded as ignoring precautionary measures or as a criminal act.\"",

He also has a house in Rio de Janeiro, where he held his electoral base as a lawmaker for three decades. The former army captain is the fourth former president of Brazil to be arrested since the end of the country's military rule from 1964 to 1985, which Bolsonaro supported.",

      "De Moraes added in his ruling that Jair Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022, has spread messages with \"a clear content of encouragement and instigation to attacks against the Supreme Court and a blatant support for foreign intervention in the Brazilian Judiciary\" \u2014 likely a veiled reference to Mr. Trump's support for Bolsonaro.",

      "Now, de Souza said, \"the 2026 election looks like turmoil\" and the political debate in Brazil will likely be split between two key struggles.",
      "\"One is the effort of Bolsonaro supporters to keep strong on the right, no matter if it is pushing for amnesty in congress or putting themselves physically out there,\" the analyst said. \"The second is how the Lula administration will try to show that the country has a government.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "GOP lawmakers in 10 states have refused for a decade to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But when President Trump got another whack at Obamacare, these holdout states went unrewarded.",
    "story": [
      "Miami \u2014 GOP lawmakers in the 10 states that refused the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion for over a decade have argued their conservative approach to growing government programs would pay off in the long run.",
      "Instead, the Republican-passed budget law that includes many of President Trump's priorities will pose at least as big a burden on patients and hospitals in the expansion holdout states as in the 40 states that have extended Medicaid coverage to more low-income adults, hospital executives and other officials warn.",
      "For instance, Georgia, with a population of just over 11 million, will see as many people lose insurance coverage sold through ACA marketplaces as will California, with more than triple the population, according to estimates by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "The new law imposes additional paperwork requirements on Obamacare enrollees, slashes the time they have each year to sign up, and cuts funding for navigators who help them shop for plans. Those changes, all of which will erode enrollment, are expected to have far more impact in states like Florida and Texas than in California because a higher proportion of residents in non-expansion states are enrolled in ACA plans.",
      "The budget law, which Republicans called the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" will cause sweeping changes to health care across the country as it trims federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion over the next decade. The program covers more than 71 million people with low incomes and disabilities. Ten million people will lose coverage over the next decade due to the law, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Many of its provisions are focused on the 40 states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, which added millions more low-income adults to the rolls. But the consequences are not confined to those states. A proposal from conservatives to cut more generous federal payments for people added to Medicaid by the ACA expansion didn't make it into the law.",
      "\"Politicians in non-expansion states should be furious about that,\" said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.",
      "The number of people losing coverage could accelerate in non-expansion states if enhanced federal subsidies for Obamacare plans expire at the end of the year, driving up premiums as early as January and adding to the rolls of uninsured. KFF estimates as many as 2.2 million people could become uninsured just in Florida, a state where lawmakers refused to expand Medicaid and, partly as a result, now leads the nation in ACA enrollment.",
      "For people like Francoise Cham of Miami, who has Obamacare coverage, the Republican policy changes could be life-altering.",
      "Before she had insurance, the 62-year-old single mom said she would donate blood just to get her cholesterol checked. Once a year, she'd splurge for a wellness exam at Planned Parenthood. She expects to make about $28,000 this year and currently pays about $100 a month for an ACA plan to cover herself and her daughter, and even that strains her budget.",
      "Cham choked up describing the \"safety net\" that health insurance has afforded her \u2014 and at the prospect of being unable to afford coverage if premiums spike at the end of the year.",
      "\"Obamacare has been my lifesaver,\" she said.",
      "If the enhanced ACA subsidies aren't extended, \"everyone will be hit hard,\" said Cindy Mann, a health policy expert with Manatt Health, a consulting and legal firm, and a former deputy administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "\"But a state that hasn't expanded Medicaid will have marketplace people enrolling at lower income levels,\" she said. \"So, a greater share of residents are reliant on the marketplace.\"",
      "Though GOP lawmakers may try to cut Medicaid even more this year, for now the states that expanded Medicaid largely appear to have made a smart decision, while states that haven't are facing similar financial pressures without any upside, said health policy experts and hospital industry observers.",
      "KFF Health News reached out to the governors of the 10 states that have not fully expanded Medicaid to see if the budget legislation made them regret that decision or made them more open to expansion. Spokespeople for Republican Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina and Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia did not indicate whether their states are considering Medicaid expansion.",
      "Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for McMaster's office, said South Carolina's Medicaid program focuses on \"low-income children and families and disabled individuals,\" adding, \"The state's Medicaid program does not anticipate a large impact on the agency's Medicaid population.\"",
      "Enrollment in ACA marketplace plans nationwide has more than doubled since 2020 to 24.3 million. If enhanced subsidies expire, premiums for Obamacare coverage would rise by more than 75% on average, according to an analysis by KFF. Some insurers are already signaling they plan to charge more.",
      "The CBO estimates that allowing enhanced subsidies to expire will increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million by 2034, compared with a permanent extension. That would come on top of the coverage losses caused by Mr. Trump's budget law.",
      "\"That is problematic and scary for us,\" said Eric Boley, president of the Wyoming Hospital Association.",
      "He said his state, which did not expand Medicaid, has a relatively small population and hasn't been the most attractive for insurance providers \u2014 few companies currently offer plans on the ACA exchange \u2014 and he worried any increase in the uninsured rate would \"collapse the insurance market.\"",
      "As the uninsured rate rises in non-expansion states and the budget law's Medicaid cuts loom, lawmakers say state funds will not backfill the loss of federal dollars, including in states that have refused to expand Medicaid.",
      "Those states got slightly favorable treatment under the law, but it's not enough, said Grace Hoge, press secretary for Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat who favors Medicaid expansion but who has been rebuffed by GOP state legislators.",
      "\"Kansans' ability to access affordable healthcare will be harmed,\" Hoge said in an email. \"Kansas, nor our rural hospitals, will not be able to make up for these cuts.\"",
      "For hospital leaders in other states that have refused full Medicaid expansion, the budget law poses another test by limiting financing arrangements states leveraged to make higher Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals.",
      "Beginning in 2028, the law will reduce those payments by 10 percentage points each year until they are closer to what Medicare pays.",
      "Richard Roberson, president of the Mississippi Hospital Association, said the state's use of what's called directed payments in 2023 helped raise its Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals and other health institutions from $500 million a year to $1.5 billion a year. He said higher rates helped Mississippi's rural hospitals stay open.",
      "\"That payment program has just been a lifeline,\" Roberson said.",
      "The budget law includes a $50 billion fund intended to insulate rural hospitals and clinics from its changes to Medicaid and the ACA. But a KFF analysis found it would offset only about one-third of the cuts to Medicaid in rural areas.",
      "Mr. Trump encouraged Florida, Tennessee, and Texas to continue refusing Medicaid expansion in his first term, when his administration gave them an unusual 10-year extension for financing programs known as uncompensated care pools, which generate billions of dollars to pay hospitals for treating the uninsured, said Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy for the left-leaning think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "\"Those were very clearly a decision from the first Trump administration to say, 'You get a lot of money for an uncompensated care pool instead of expanding Medicaid,'\" she said.",
      "Those funds are not affected by Mr. Trump's new tax-and-spending law. But they do not help patients the way insurance coverage would, Orris said. \"This is paying hospitals, but it's not giving people health care,\" she said. \"It's not giving people prevention.\"",
      "States such as Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi have not only turned down the additional federal funding that Medicaid expansion brings, but most of the remaining non-expansion states spend less than the national average per Medicaid enrollee, provide fewer or less generous benefits, and cover fewer categories of low-income Americans.",
      "Mary Mayhew, president of the Florida Hospital Association, said the state's Medicaid program does not adequately cover children, older people, and people with disabilities because reimbursement rates are too low.",
      "\"Children don't have timely access to dentists,\" she said. \"Expectant moms don't have access nearby to an OB-GYN. We've had labor and delivery units close in Florida.\"",
      "She said the law will cost states more in the long run.",
      "\"The health care outcomes for the individuals we serve will deteriorate. That's going to lead to higher cost, more spending, more dependency on the emergency department.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 22:02:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's ban on asylum claims, lifting a sweeping policy that had effectively closed the U.S. asylum system to many migrants, two officials told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's ban on asylum claims, following a federal court order that said the measure could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum-seekers, two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News.",
      "The move effectively lifts a sweeping policy that had closed the American asylum system to those entering the U.S. illegally or without proper documents. It's a measure the second Trump administration has credited for a steep drop in illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, where officials last month reported the lowest monthly level of migrant apprehensions on record.",
      "Mr. Trump's asylum crackdown was unprecedented in scope. The proclamation underpinning it, issued just hours after he returned to the White House in January, gave U.S. border officials the power to summarily deport migrants without allowing them to request asylum, a right enshrined in American law for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump said the extraordinary action was necessary due to what he called an \"invasion\" of migrants under the Biden administration, which faced record levels of illegal crossings at the southern border until it too restricted asylum last year.",
      "On Friday, a federal appeals court lifted its pause on a lower judge's ruling that found Mr. Trump's decree violated U.S. asylum laws. While the appellate court narrowed the lower court's order, saying Mr. Trump's proclamation could be used to pause access to the asylum system, it also ruled the U.S. government could not disregard other laws that bar officials from deporting migrants to places where they could be tortured or persecuted.",
      "Those laws require the U.S. to grant legal protections \u2014 known as \"withholding of removal\" and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture \u2014 to migrants who prove they would likely face persecution or torture if deported to their home countries. Unlike asylum, those protections do not allow recipients to get permanent U.S. residency or protect them from being deported to a third party country.",
      "Officials at Customs and Border Protection were instructed this weekend to halt deportations under Mr. Trump's proclamation and to process migrants under U.S. immigration law, which affords foreigners on American soil the right to request humanitarian refuge, the two DHS officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss an internal directive.",
      "CBP officials received instructions to process migrants through different mechanisms, including through a fast-track deportation procedure known as expedited removal, according to the DHS officials. While expedited removal allows for relatively quick deportations, migrants processed under the policy are also allowed to apply for asylum if they convince officials that their fears of being harmed if deported are credible.",
      "For months, U.S. border agents had been using Mr. Trump's asylum ban to swiftly deport those crossing into the country illegally to Mexico, their home countries and, in some cases, third party nations that had agreed to accept them. Internally, officials have dubbed those deportations \"212(f) repatriations,\" in reference to the legal authority Mr. Trump invoked in his proclamation.",
      "While the lifting of Mr. Trump's order may reopen the U.S. asylum system, those caught crossing the southern border illegally will likely remain detained while officials vet their claims. The Trump administration has largely stopped the practice of releasing migrants into the U.S. while they await their court dates, limiting releases to cases involving extraordinary circumstances.",
      "The Justice Department could also try to get Friday's court order suspended by the Supreme Court, in a bid to revive Mr. Trump's asylum ban.",
      "In a statement to CBS News late Monday, CBP said Friday's court order affirmed \"the President's authority to deny asylum to aliens participating in an invasion into the United States.\"",
      "CBP said the Trump administration is \"committed to ensuring that aliens illegally entering the United States face consequences for their criminal actions.\"",
      "\"This includes prosecution to the fullest extent of the law and rapid removal from the United States,\" the agency added. \"CBP will continue to process illegal/inadmissible aliens consistent with law, including mandatory detention and expedited removal.\"",
      "After soaring to record levels in late 2023, illegal border crossings dropped sharply in former President Biden's last year office, following increased efforts by Mexico to interdict U.S.-bound migrants and an order issued by Biden in June 2024 to restrict access to the American asylum system. But they have plunged even further since Mr. Trump took office for a second time.",
      "In July, Border Patrol encountered just 4,600 migrants along the southern border, the lowest monthly tally ever publicly reported by the agency. It's also a figure the Biden administration recorded in 24 hours on many days.",

    "summary": "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says possible new locations include Arizona, Nebraska and Louisiana.",
    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says \"Alligator Alcatraz\" will serve as a model for state-run migrant detention centers, and she told CBS News in an interview that she hopes to launch a handful of similar detention centers in multiple airports and jails across the country, in the coming months. Potential sites are already under consideration in Arizona, Nebraska and Louisiana.",
      "\"The locations we're looking at are right by airport runways that will help give us an efficiency that we've never had before,\" Noem said, adding that she's appealed directly to governors and state leaders nationwide to gauge their interest in contributing to the Trump administration's program to detain and deport more unauthorized migrants.",
      "\"Most of them are interested,\" Noem said, adding that in states that support President Trump's mission of securing the southern border, \"many of them have facilities that may be empty or underutilized.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security strategy builds on the opening of a 3,000-bed immigration detention center at a jetport in South Florida last month. Dubbed Alligator Alcatraz by state and federal officials, the makeshift facility will cost an estimated $450 million to operate in its first year. Up and running in just 8 days, the tents and trailers at Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport are surrounded by 39 square miles of isolated swampland, boasting treacherous terrain and wildlife",
      "Last month, President Trump toured the facility, seeing rows of bunk beds lined up behind chain fences and encircled by razor wire. Mr. Trump joked to reporters there that \"we're going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.\" Asked if the temporary facility would be a model of what's to come, the president said he'd like to see similar operations in \"many states.\"",
      "The Arizona's governor's office told CBS News it has not been approached about a state-run facility.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen's office said in a statement that his administration \"continues to be in communication with federal partners on how Nebraska can best assist in these efforts,\" but added that for now, \"it is premature to comment\" and the governor would \"make details public at the appropriate time.\"",
      "For her part, Noem called the Alligator Alcatraz model \"much better\" than the current detention prototype, which largely contracts out its Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention capacity to for-profit prison companies and county jails. ICE is an agency that falls under DHS. This model relies on intergovernmental service agreements (IGSAs) negotiated and signed between ICE and individual localities. She called the Florida facility \u2014 with an eventual price tag of $245 per inmate bed, per night, according to DHS officials \u2014 a cost-effective option. \"Obviously it was much less per-bed cost than what some of the previous contracts under the Department of Homeland Security were.\"",
      "According to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics, the estimated average daily cost of detaining an adult migrant in fiscal year 2024 was about $165, though the actual cost of detention typically varies based on region, length of stay and facility type.",
      "Still, Noem argued that the new venues, all with close proximity to airports or runways, will help ICE to cut costs by \"facilitating quick turnarounds.\"",
      "\"They're all strategically designed to make sure that people are in beds for less days,\" Noem said, adding that some of the facilities being considered are still undergoing vetting by the department and subject to ongoing negotiations. \"It can be much more efficient once they get their hearings, due process, paperwork.\"",
      "Unlike Alligator Alcatraz, which uses funds from a shelter, food and transportation program run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Noem said the state-based initiative will tap into a new $45 billion funding pool for ICE prompted by President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\", which was signed into law last month. The pool of money is allocated specifically to the expansion of ICE's detention network and will nearly double the agency's bedspace capacity of 61,000 beds, based on cost analysis. As of Saturday, ICE was holding just over 57,000 individuals in its detention network in more than 150 facilities nationwide.",
      "Noem \u2014 who has implemented a department-wide policy across DHS of personally approving each and every contract and grant over $100,000 \u2014 said keeping ICE detention contracts to a duration of under five years is now \"the model we've pushed for.\" For instance, she added, Alligator Alcatraz is a one-year contract that can be renewed.",
      "\"For me personally, the question that I've asked of every one of these contracts is, why are we signing 15-year deals?\" Noem said. \"I have to look at our mission. If we're still building out and processing 100,000 detention beds 15 years from now, then we didn't do our job.\"",
      "The new policy is a departure from earlier agreements made under the Trump administration. In February, ICE signed a 15-year, $1 billion deal with the GEO Group, a private prison company, to reopen Delaney Hall, a two-story, 1,000-bed facility that ranks among the largest detention centers in the Northeast.",
      "Still, Noem said she doesn't feel the U.S. is moving away from a private detention model. \"I mean, these are competitive contracts,\" she said. \"I want everybody to be at the table, giving us solutions. I just want them to give us a contract that actually does the job \u2014 a contract that doesn't put more money in their pockets while keeping people in detention beds just for the sake of that contract.\"",
      "But Alligator Alcatraz has also come under fire from attorneys claiming that both the Trump and DeSantis administrations are holding detainees without charge or access to immigration courts, violating their constitutional rights. Attorneys argued in a legal filing last month that unauthorized migrants held at the Florida-run site have no legal recourse to challenge their detention.",
      "Lawyers and experts have also called into question the very legality of a state-run immigration detention center, given the federal government's authority over immigration enforcement. Opening the detention center in the Everglades under Florida's emergency state powers marked a departure from the federal government's role of housing migrant detainees, an option typically reserved for those who've recently entered the country illegally or those with criminal convictions.",
      "A U.S. district judge last week ordered state and federal officials to provide a copy of the agreement showing \"who's running the show\" at the Everglades immigrant-detention center.",
      "\"Florida does not have the legal authority to detain undocumented immigrants in the absence of a contract with ICE,\" said Kevin Landy, the director of detention policy and planning for ICE under President Barack Obama. \"A state government can't do that.\"",
      "Detainees held at Alligator Alcatraz have also claimed unsanitary and inhumane conditions, including food with maggots, denial of religious rights and limited access to both legal assistance and water. Florida officials have denied the accusations.",
      "Still, tucked away in the Florida Everglades 45 miles west of Miami, if its location sounds treacherous, Noem concedes, that's kind of the point. \"There definitely is a message that it sends,\" the secretary said. \"President Trump wants people to know if you are a violent criminal and you're in this country illegally, there will be consequences.\"",
      "Noem offered that deterrence is an effective strategy based on U.S. gathered intelligence \"from three letter agencies, from other intelligence officials throughout the federal government and in a lot of the Latin American and South American countries\" that indicates \"overwhelmingly, what encourages people to go back home voluntarily is the consequences.\"",
      "\"They see the laws being enforced in the United States,\" Noem said. \"They know when they are here illegally and if they are detained, they'll be removed. They see that they may never get the chance to come back to America. And they're voluntarily coming home.\"",
      "The DHS secretary met with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum in March. \"One of the questions I asked President Scheinbaum when I was in Mexico is, 'Do you have any idea how many people may have come back to Mexico that we may not know about,'\" Noem said.",
      "\"[Sheinbaum] said 500,000 to 600,000 people have come back to Mexico voluntarily since President Trump's been in office,\" Noem continued, explaining that the Mexican president believes her reluctant citizens fear losing the chance to return to the U.S. on a visa or work program.",
      "It's a datapoint she solicits from many of the foreign leaders she meets with, including Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa, who shared a 90-minute lunch with the DHS secretary in Quito, last Thursday. \"I asked him the same question,\" Noem recalled. \"He doesn't have as many illegal immigrants in the United States as in Mexico and Venezuela, but he said he thinks over 100,000 of his citizens have come back to Ecuador. And that's a huge number.\"",
      "Noem reasoned that her Ecuadorian counterpart's rough estimate is based on two factors \u2014 a strengthening Ecuadorian economy and a DHS television campaign launched across Latin and South America, warning prospective migrants not to enter or remain in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"He was very proud of the fact that he's doing better with his economy. So there's jobs,\" Noem recounted. \"But he said, you know, our ads are running in Ecuador. We're telling people that, if you have family in the United States that are there illegally, it's time to come home.\"",

      "Back in Kiev, Avetisian sold real estate. In the U.S., she took a job at a window replacement company, a field where she had no previous experience.",
      "\"To find people that want to work and take pride in their work to our standards is not easy,\" said Sam Heer, who hired Avetisian. \"I want more Ukrainians.\"",
      "Heer employed Avetisian, her husband and her cousin before their two-year work permits expired. As the war in Ukraine continues, most European countries are renewing work permits of Ukrainian refugees.  The Trump administration has not, pausing all immigration applications filed by migrants from Latin America and Ukraine earlier this year.",
      "Heer told CBS News he voted for President Trump in the 2024 election. When asked what he would tell the president or his administration about the Ukrainian refugees, Heer said, \"These people are hard to come by. They've been through upheaval just to get here and then, all of a sudden, what they thought they were building toward is shaken. When people do the right things and follow the rules, they should be rewarded.\"",
      "But for Avetisian and her teenage daughter, the opportunity in Dewitt could be slipping away.",

      "Boelens says many more work permits are about to expire, leaving Ukrainian refugees in limbo.    They may not be forced to leave.  But without a job, they can't afford to stay.",
      "\"It's not safe to go back to Kiev,\" Avetisian said when asked if she would return home. \"Every day, every night, it's bombing,\" she said, noting that her mother, who is still in Ukraine, sends her videos of the attacks.",

    "story": [
      "Three Democratic state lawmakers who fled Texas to block an effort to redraw the state's congressional maps to favor Republicans told CBS News on Monday they're prepared to stay out of the state for at least the next two weeks \u2014 as GOP leaders threaten consequences.",
      "Dozens of Texas House Democrats headed to Illinois and other blue states over the weekend, denying the chamber's GOP leaders a quorum on Monday. The move has at least temporarily derailed a special legislative session called by Gov. Greg Abbott to reshape the state's U.S. House district maps \u2014 after President Trump publicly encouraged Texas Republicans to create five more GOP-leaning House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "One of the Democrats who left Texas for Illinois, state Rep. John Bucy III, told CBS News that lawmakers plan on staying out of the state until the end of the legislative session. Special sessions can last up to 30 days, and just over two weeks are left in the current session.",
      "But if the clock runs out without a vote on the new House maps, Abbott has the power to immediately call another legislative session, state Rep. Ann Johnson acknowledged.",
      "If that happens, Democrats will \"assess our options,\" state Rep. James Talarico said.",
      "The map that was floated by Texas Republicans last week could, if approved, tilt as many as 30 of the state's 38 U.S. House districts toward Republicans, which currently hold 25 districts. The map redraws two Democratic seats in the Rio Grande Valley, combines two seats in the Austin area and rearranges districts in the Houston and Dallas areas.",
      "Texas Democrats say they \"knew there would be consequences\"",
      "The GOP-dominated state House voted Monday to compel the absent Democrats to return to Texas, including by issuing civil arrest warrants. Meanwhile, Abbott ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to \"arrest and return\" the Democratic members and investigate them for \"bribery\" because they accepted donations to help pay for their time in other states. Abbott has also suggested there's a legal path to remove any absent Democrats from office.",
      "It's unclear whether those efforts to arrest lawmakers are enforceable outside of Texas. Rice University political science professor Mark Jones told CBS News that Republicans \"can make idle threats, but as long as they are out of state, there's really nothing that they can do.\"",
      "\"If you choose to continue down this road, you should know there will be consequences,\" Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows, a Republican, said during a brief speech Monday afternoon, after the House was unable to establish a quorum.",
      "\"The absconded Democrat House members were elected to meet and vote on legislation \u2014 not to prevent votes that may not go their way,\" Abbott said in an earlier statement.",
      "Talarico told CBS News that House Democrats \"knew there would be consequences.\"",
      "\"We are fighting for representative democracy, and whether or not that will continue, and so we're willing to face whatever consequences may come our way,\" he said.",
      "In addition to redistricting, Abbott called a special session last month to handle other high-profile legislative priorities, like approving disaster relief for the deadly Texas floods. Texas Republicans and Democrats have both accused each other of holding disaster relief hostage.",
      "\"Greg Abbott is prioritizing Donald Trump with this special session,\" Bucy told CBS News. \"Instead of taking action to help the flood victims of Central Texas, he is prioritizing trying to steal five congressional seats from the people of Texas.\"",
      "Johnson rejected accusations by Republicans that Democratic lawmakers had abandoned their work, saying they were exercising \"the fundamental protection by our founding fathers in the Texas Constitution that says the minority party has the opportunity to break quorum when you know that the majority has really gone off the rails.\"",
      "What do Texas Democrats want?",
      "This isn't the first time Democrats have fled Texas to deny Republicans a two-thirds quorum in the state House or Senate. In 2021, House Democrats left the state to block a vote on a restrictive voting law, but the walkout came to an end after just over a month, and a version of the bill ended up passing.",
      "When asked how this week's walkout would be different, Talarico argued the 2021 effort was successful because some of the most controversial provisions of the voting law \u2014 like limits to Sunday voting \u2014 were ultimately taken out of the legislation.",
      "\"This is an effective tool in our toolbox to fight for our constituents and make harmful legislation less dangerous. We're hopeful that's what will happen here,\" he said.",
      "Some of the Texas Democrats want blue states to threaten to retaliate by redrawing their congressional maps to add more Democratic districts. The governors of California and New York have entertained the idea of carrying out redistricting to eke out more blue seats, but those moves could be legally difficult, since California has put an independent commission in charge of redistricting and New York bans political gerrymandering.",
      "All three Texas House Democrats who spoke with CBS News \u2014 Talarico, Bucy and Johnson \u2014 told CBS News they don't support gerrymandering in general. But Talarico said that \"if one side is going to cheat, all bets are off, and maybe that kind of pressure will convince our Republican colleagues and the president to walk back from the brink.\"",
      "\"Democrats and Republican politicians both gerrymander and it's wrong in both instances,\" Talarico said, but \"this is particularly egregious.\"",
      "\"This is kind of like the bully that takes your lunch money every day. At some point, you got to stand up, otherwise you just end up broke and hungry,\" Johnson said. \"We've told Republicans, 'enough \u2014 you've gone way too far.'\"",
      "Ed O'Keefe is CBS News' senior White House and political correspondent reporting for all CBS News platforms. He's part of the team covering President Trump and covered all four years of Joe Biden's presidency. From the White House to the campaign trail, O'Keefe's reports stretch from the politics of the moment to how policy enacted in Washington affects the nation and the world."

      "Texas Republicans have responded by floating civil arrest warrants if their Democratic colleagues don't return to the state and threatening to have the missing lawmakers removed from office altogether. Democratic legislators have remained defiant, and have encouraged states led by Democrats to respond by redrawing their congressional maps \u2014 setting up a national standoff over redistricting.",
      "\"Greg Abbott has answered the call of Donald Trump, and he's holding this special session hostage to try to pass a mid-district, mid-session redistricting to try to steal five congressional seats away from the Texas people,\" state Rep. John Bucy, the top Democrat on the Texas House's elections committee, said of the Texas governor.",
      "\"That's unacceptable, and that's why we're here to fight back,\" said Bucy, who spoke to CBS News in a Monday interview from Illinois, one of several blue states currently hosting the Texas Democrats.",
      "Shortly after attempting to convene on Monday, House Republicans voted to approve a motion for the Texas House sergeant-at-arms to secure the attendance of all absent lawmakers, \"under warrant of arrest if necessary.\"",
      "\"Leaving the state does not stop this House from doing its work. It only delays it,\" Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows, a Republican, said in a brief speech Monday afternoon.",
      "He told Democratic lawmakers, \"If you choose to continue down this road, you should know there will be consequences.\"",
      "Before the House met on Monday, Abbott also said he would seek to \"remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House,\" invoking a 2021 legal opinion from Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton that suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited his or her office.",
      "\"The absconded Democrat House members were elected to meet and vote on legislation\u2014not to prevent votes that may not go their way,\" Abbott said.",
      "Texas House Democrats responded with a four-word statement: \"Come and take it,\" a reference to a statement of defiance on an old Texas battle flag.",
      "Democrats protest GOP-dominated Texas congressional map",
      "Republicans unveiled the new congressional maps\u00a0last week as part of a mid-decade redistricting in an attempt to protect the GOP's razor-thin U.S. House majority. President Trump said in July that he believes Republicans could win five more seats in Texas with different districts.",
      "Abbott included redistricting to be addressed in a special legislative session, along with other high-profile topics like approving disaster relief for the deadly Texas floods and a THC ban.",
      "Democratic lawmakers announced Sunday evening they would leave the state to hold up the special session. \"We will not allow disaster relief to be held hostage to a Trump gerrymander. As of today, this corrupt special session is over,\" Texas House Democrats said in a statement.",
      "\"For weeks, we've been warning that if Republicans in Texas want a showdown \u2014 if they want to delay flood relief to cravenly protect Donald Trump from an inevitable midterm meltdown \u2014 then we'd give them that showdown,\" Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement, accusing Mr. Trump and Republicans of \"rigging the system\" and \"scheming to hold onto power.\"",
      "Both houses of the Texas legislature are controlled by Republicans, but if most Democratic lawmakers leave the state, they could deny the state House and Senate the two-thirds quorum that they need to vote on the new congressional maps.",
      "At least 51 Texas Democrats have fled the state for Chicago. Politico was first to report the lawmakers had left the state.",
      "\"We're not here to have fun. We're not here because this is easy, and we did make a decision to come here today \u2014 we did not make a decision lightly,\" Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu said after arriving in Illinois. \"But we come here today with absolute moral clarity that this is absolutely the right thing to do to protect the people of the state of Texas.\"",
      "Republicans in Texas currently hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats. The party hopes the new maps could bring that number up to 30, and all of those new 30 seats were won by Mr. Trump in November by at least 10 points.",
      "The five seats come from redrawing Rio Grande Valley districts \u2014 where Mr. Trump has made gains in what were once Democratic strongholds \u2014 and combining Reps. Lloyd Doggett and Greg Cesar's districts in Austin. In North Texas, Rep. Julie Johnson's suburban 32nd District would be reshaped to stretch from the Dallas area to rural Republican strongholds, and Rep. Marc Veasey would be moved out of Tarrant County entirely, which would leave only a small portion of the county represented by a Democrat. All four Houston-area seats were redrawn, with Rep. Al Green's being the most dramatic.",
      "\"They're turning our districts into crazy shapes to guarantee the outcome they want in the 2026 election,\" Democratic state Rep. James Talarico said in a message\u00a0posted to social media. \"If this power grab succeeds, they will hang on to power without any accountability from the voters.\"",
      "Wu said Texas Republicans are \"using is a racist, gerrymandered map, a map that seeks to use racial lines to divide hard working communities who have spent decades building up their power and strengthening their voices, and Governor Abbott is doing this in submission to Donald Trump.\"",
      "Democrats have fought back against the new districts, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries traveling to Austin on Thursday to pledge national support.",
      "\"We are not fighting for the Democratic Party, we are fighting for the democratic process, and the stakes could not be higher. We have to take a stand,\" Talarico added.",
      "Martin said in an appearance Sunday on MSNBC, \"I'm proud of the Texas Dems for actually breaking quorum here. Our democracy is literally under assault by Donald Trump, Greg Abbott and the Republicans, who know that they are on a track to lose the House majority next year. So what do they do? They cheat. They rigged the system. That's all they have left.\"",
      "\"We're certainly going to be standing with folks who will be litigating this in the courts,\" Martin added. \"We will continue to organize on the ground in Texas, and we will continue to support the House Dems, as they have broke quorum right now.\"",
      "This is not the first time Democrats have left the state to deny Republicans a quorum \u2014 and not the first time they have done it to protest redistricting. During the landmark 2005 mid-decade redistricting, Texas Democrats fled during two separate special sessions to stop the redistricting. But the redistricting eventually did go through. And in 2023, Republicans passed legislation that levies a $500-a-day fine on lawmakers who leave the state.",
      "The last significant quorum break in the Texas House was in 2021, when Democrats fled the state to prevent a restrictive voting bill from passing.",
      "Last month, Paxton threatened to assist police in \"hunting down and compelling the attendance\" of any Democratic lawmakers who leave the state to block votes during the special session.",
      "\"If Democrats ignore their duty to their constituents by breaking quorum, they should be found and arrested no matter where they go,\" said Paxton, who is also running for the GOP nomination in next year's Senate race.",
      "Abbott on Sunday said that \"Any Democrat who 'solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept'\" donations to help cover any fines they may be subjected to under Hous rules for skipping votes, \"may have violated bribery laws.\"",
      "Can other states take on redistricting efforts?",
      "As the efforts ramped up in Texas to redraw the maps, other Democrat-led states threatened to do something similar. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been one of the most prominent voices behind this effort, posting on social media after the GOP's new maps for Texas were unveiled that \"California won't sit back and watch this happen.\"",
      "Other governors have joined suit, with some of the Texas House Democrats joining New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for a press conference on Monday about the topic. Hochul said, \"I'm tired of fighting this fight with one hand tied behind my back.\"",
      "Pritzker also said Sunday \"everything has to be on the table.\"",
      "But legally, it will be difficult to pull off in many of these states. Texas is one of a few states that allows the state legislature to set up the congressional maps, and can allow mid-decade redistricting. In California, an independent commissions is in charge of redistricting \u2014 and there is a law in New York banning gerrymandering for political gains. New York's congressional maps went through a number of legal challenges before the final maps were settled on.",
      "Hochul and New York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie acknowledged it would require a change to the state constitution, but Heastie insisted that \"we're in close conversations about options there, and so I would say we're presenting all options right now.\"",
      "\"It's very difficult to say play fair when your opponents are playing dirty and using every tool in their tool shed toolbox to kind of undermine democracy,\" Heastie said.",
      "As for Illinois, the state legislature draws the map and Democrats control the legislature \u2014 and they cut out two Republican seats when they redrew the maps in 2021. Prior to redistricting, Illinois had 13 Democrats and five Republicans in the House. The state lost a seat due to population loss, and they ended the 2022 elections with 14 Democrats and three Republicans.",

    "story": [
      "The spotlight may have moved off the Department of Government Efficiency since the departure of Elon Musk, but the Trump administration's DOGE continues to post about cost cutting on its so-called \"wall of receipts.\" And once again, some of its claims about savings appear to be significantly overstated, according to a CBS News review.",
      "The review of three of the largest cuts claimed so far indicates the savings from those contracts are less than 3% of what DOGE said they were.",
      "On July 27, DOGE added 705 canceled contracts to the website it uses to track and declare savings from the agency's cost cutting across the federal government, among them three of the largest claimed cuts posted since President Trump launched DOGE in January.",
      "The three contracts \u2014 all from the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 funded COVID-19 testing and treatment for people who were uninsured or underinsured during the pandemic. DOGE claims canceling those contracts saved $6.4 billion.",
      "But CBS News' review of transaction records indicates the actual savings is just a small fraction of that \u2014 around $165 million.",
      "That's about how much in obligated funds were left unspent in the three contracts by the time Mr. Trump took office and DOGE was launched. There was nearly $7 billion that remained, but this figure represented a ceiling that federal contracting experts say is rarely reached.",
      "DOGE adjusted down that total potential value by a combined $6.4 billion \u2014 and then reported it as savings. But with the pandemic long over and the contracts set to expire on May 31 of this year, it is highly unlikely the contractors, which included Walgreens and CVS, would have spent anywhere near that sum on COVID-19 testing and treatment.",
      "The spending \"was never going to reach this number,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, referring to the total potential value. \"You didn't have to terminate this contract, you are the government \u2014 just don't obligate any more money.\"",
      "Since it was launched, multiple news outlets including CBS News have reported that DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" has at times vastly overstated the amount of funds cut and discovered numerous errors in the group's accounting.",
      "DOGE now claims it has saved $52.2 billion \u2013 just from contracts canceled. Malkus, who analyzed the actual implications of the cancellations rather than the ceiling values, puts the number closer to $17.8 billion. But that would only be if Congress agreed to rescind the funds that it had already voted to spend.",
      "The DOGE website reports a grand total of $199 \u202fbillion saved, when factoring in real estate lease cancellations and other cuts such as personnel reductions. However, it provides no documentation for roughly half of that amount. According to DOGE, the savings equate to $1,236.02 per person in the U.S.",
      "\"The amount they have per person is fiction,\" Malkus said. \"It's transparency theater.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the three contracts. The White House redirected the request to the General Services Administration, which declined to comment.",
      "A substantial portion of those purported savings is a result of cuts to USAID. A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet says those cuts could come with a human toll. By the study's estimates, the loss in humanitarian aid could lead to 14 million deaths in children younger than 5 years of age by 2030.",
      "Malkus told CBS News, \"Their claims are generally to say, 'Hey this is a lot of pain, but it's worth it.'\"",
      "The update is only the second since Musk, who launched DOGE, departed from his role in the White House advising Mr. Trump.",
      "Shortly before Musk's term as a special government employee expired, he told reporters, \"This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "\"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger,\" he said from the Oval Office on May 30, adding that he was confident over time DOGE would cull $1 trillion in savings.",
      "It's unclear exactly how DOGE has functioned since then. In late June, The Washington Post reported that federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, revoking control of the online clearinghouse for all grant opportunities from the group. In DOGE's latest update, only one additional canceled grant was added.",
      "Several DOGE-associated government employees have left in recent weeks, including the Department of the Interior's Tyler Hassen, whose last day was Friday, The New York Times reported. Hassen was originally hired as a DOGE staffer, and then was later tasked with trimming costs at the Interior Department, where he was named principal deputy assistant secretary of the interior.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had allowed him broad authority to make cuts to budgets and staffing, and under his watch, a DOGE-associated employee made the claim that a single survey costing $1 billion dollars\u00a0had been cut. That claim was repeated by Elon Musk and Burgum, but no evidence was ever supplied to back it up.",

      "As part of his immigration agenda, the president has sought to roll back humanitarian programs for migrants from certain countries, and signed a proclamation in June banning foreign nationals from a dozen countries from traveling to the U.S. The Trump administration has also targeted immigrants on student visas and taken steps to tighten the rules for visa applicants.",
      "A new tax-and-spending bill signed by Mr. Trump last month also subjects many travelers to the U.S. to a $250 \"visa integrity fee.\"",
      "Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, said the latest measures from the Trump administration will deter travel to the U.S. from foreign countries.",
      "\"Bonds on tourist and business visas will convince most foreigners not to bother coming,\" Nowrasteh said in a statement to CBS News. \"The result will be a decimated tourist industry. Tourists spend over $200 billion annually in the U.S., spending that counts as exports. The administration's proposal will not only undermine much of the tourist industry, but it will counteract the administration's goals to reduce the trade deficit. The Trump administration's talent is proposing and enacting the most punitive, expensive, and unnecessary migration restrictions imaginable.\"",
      "The State Department described the pilot program as a \"tool of diplomacy\" and said it will help inform future decisions regarding the potential use of visa bonds \"to address the national security and foreign policy priorities\" raised in Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "\"The Pilot Program is further designed to serve as a diplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to take all appropriate actions to ensure robust screening and vetting for all citizens in matters of identity verification and public safety, to create safeguards in [Citizenship by Investment] programs that provide citizenship without any residency in the country, and to encourage specified countries with visa overstays to ensure their nationals timely depart the United States after making temporary visits,\" according to the notice.",
      "Who may be included in the visa bond pilot program?",
      "The State Department did not say which countries with high overstay rates would trigger the visa bond requirement. But an August 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security found that in fiscal year 2023, there were more than 300,000 foreign nationals admitted for business or pleasure who were still in the U.S. after their authorized stay ended.",
      "The pilot program will focus on countries that have high visa overstay rates among those allowed into the U.S. for business or pleasure \u2014 through B-1 or B-2 visas, according to the notice. A B-1 visa is for those temporarily traveling to the U.S. for business activities. A B-2 visa is for foreign nationals who want to come to the U.S. temporarily for tourism or pleasure.",
      "Travelers entering the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program will not have to post a bond, according to the State Department's notice. That program allows residents of more than 40 countries to enter the U.S. for fewer than 90 days without a visa.",
      "While the countries subject to the program will be announced in the future, the list may also be modified on a rolling basis, the State Department said. The countries with the highest overstay rates for people with business and tourism visas in fiscal year 2023 were Chad, Laos, Haiti and Congo, according to the Department of Homeland Security's report.",
      "Only foreign nationals who are applying for B-1 or B-2 nonimmigrant visas, and who are from the countries identified by the State Department, may be required to post a bond of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 as a condition of receiving a visa. The bond can be canceled if the person meets certain criteria, including leaving the U.S. by the date their authorization expires, according to the terms of the program detailed in the notice.",
      "The new requirement for certain foreign nationals seeking to come to the U.S. for business or tourism could have negative consequences for cities that rely on travelers from abroad. A June report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority found that Sin City experienced an 11% drop in visitation year-over-year, hosting nearly 3.5 million visitors in June 2024 and nearly 3.1 million this June.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Travel Association said the pilot program appears to effect roughly 2,000 applicants, most likely from a few countries with low travel volume to the U.S. But the group is more concerned with the $250 \"Visa Integrity Fee\" included in the tax-and-spending plan, the spokesperson said.",
      "\"If this fee is implemented, the U.S. will have one of, if not the highest, visitor visa fees in the world,\" the spokesperson said. \"If we are to maintain a competitive position in the global travel market, it's critical that U.S. visa policy reflects both national security priorities and the significant economic value of international visitation.\"",
      "David Bier, the Cato Institute's director of immigration studies, called the bond requirement \"draconian.\"",
      "\"Although we can't know for certain the scale of this rule because the administration isn't saying which countries it will apply to, the rule will add what is likely an insurmountable barrier to travel for many applicants who end up being targeted who are often family members of U.S. citizens,\" he said in a statement. \"Its argument that this will pressure governments to somehow force their visa holders to comply with the terms of their visas is incoherent, and it appears to be an admission that it will likely just ban people from coming, not just result in compliance. Most visa overstays leave after some time or end up qualifying for legal status in the United States another way. There is no reason to impose such a draconian rule.\"",

    "summary": "More than a dozen states are seeking their own versions of Medicaid work requirements. But the incoming new federal standards pose new questions.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump signed a law adding work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, he may have undercut lawmakers in at least 14 states who were designing their own plans, according to health industry observers.",
      "Georgia is the only state with a work requirement in place for Medicaid, but several states have been pursuing such a policy for years, only to be blocked by courts or, most recently, the Biden administration. Some seek state-specific touches to the new rules. Others aim to implement work requirements before the federal law takes effect at the end of 2026.",
      "These states' moves and Mr. Trump's massive tax-and-spending law share one demand: To keep their Medicaid health coverage, adults who can work must prove they're logging a minimum number of hours at a job or school, or else qualify for one of the few exemptions.",
      "But now, states that jumped ahead need to ensure their proposals, which require federal approval, don't stray too far from Mr. Trump's law.",
      "\"The statute sets both the floor and ceiling\" for work requirements, said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor with George Washington University.",
      "South Dakota, for example, announced in July that it would not submit an application for work requirements as previously planned amid concerns that the state's laxer rules would not be allowed under the new federal law. The state's Department of Social Services secretary had warned that working on a state proposal while the federal rules are being hashed out could be \"an exercise in futility.\"",
      "Arkansas' plan, on the other hand, is more stringent than the federal law. There are no exemptions to its work requirements in the application, which is pending with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "Arizona's proposal also includes something that's not in the federal law: a ban on \"able-bodied adults\" receiving Medicaid benefits for longer than five years total in their lives.",
      "Arkansas and Arizona government officials said they were working with federal officials to square their plans with the new standards.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the department is analyzing how the new federal standards interact with state waivers.",
      "The federal health department must release rules by next June that outline how states are to implement work requirements, according to Elizabeth Hinton, who has been tracking such waivers as part of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "\"We don't exactly know what that will cover,\" Hinton said.",
      "It's unclear how federal officials will respond to the states' requests, she added, but \"we are aware that some folks think there is no wiggle room here.\"",
      "States can tweak their Medicaid programs through what are known as demonstration waivers, which are subject to federal approval. The waivers are designed to test new ideas in policy gray areas.",
      "The states that have filed or plan to file such applications with work requirements include Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.",
      "Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona's Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.",
      "Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona's plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.",
      "The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.",
      "Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements \u2014 called \"community engagement\" standards under the state plan \u2014 in 2019, but the state's application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality \"as soon as is practicable.\"",
      "The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.",
      "Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn't know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.",
      "\"The state should have a say,\" Lammers said. \"We're very independent, and everyone is different.\"",
      "In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.",
      "In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina's proposal \"a state-specific solution.\"",
      "The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. \"Georgia Pathways to Coverage\" expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they're working, not monthly. That's a pivot away from the program's initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.",
      "Fiona Roberts, a spokesperson for Georgia's Medicaid agency, said the state is still waiting to hear whether it needs to alter its plan.",

    "story": [
      "Canada-U.S. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Sunday that \"we're prepared to stick around and do the work needed\" despite having left Washington without a new trade deal amid increased tariffs from President Trump.",
      "\"We believe there's a great deal of common ground between the United States and Canada in terms of building two strong economies that work well together,\" LeBlanc said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The White House announced last week that duties would jump from 25% to 35% on Canadian goods not covered under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, claiming that the U.S.' second-largest trading partner hasn't done enough to address immigration and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. LeBlanc said that while \"we were obviously disappointed by that decision,\" negotiators would \"continue to do the work.\"",
      "LeBlanc said his team left with \"a better understanding of the American concerns in the trading relationship\" and characterizing the meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as \"constructive, cordial conversations.\"",
      "\"We're encouraged by the conversations with Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Greer, but we're not yet where we need to go to get the deal that's in the best interest of the two economies,\" LeBlanc said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners late last week. But Canada is the largest American trading partner included, being the world's largest buyer of American goods and the third-largest seller of goods to the U.S. last year, according to\u00a0Census Bureau\u00a0data. The country bought some $350 billion worth of American goods and sold $412 billion to the U.S. market in 2024.",
      "In an interview for \"Face the Nation\" on Friday, Greer cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs imposed earlier this year under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the increase, saying, \"if the president's going to take an action and the Canadians retaliate, the United States needs to maintain the integrity of our action, the effectiveness, so we have to go up too.\"",
      "\"Our view is the president is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it,\" Greer said. \"And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have.\"",
      "In a statement released Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"disappointed\" by Mr. Trump's actions. He noted that \"Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes.\"",
      "On Sunday, LeBlanc said he expects Carney will have a conversation with Mr. Trump \"over the next number of days,\" while noting that the Canadian prime minister has \"built a very business-like, respectful relationship with President Trump.\"",
      "\"We understand and respect totally the president's view in terms of the national security interests. In fact, we share it,\" LeBlanc said. \"And what we've said to our American counterparts is, how can we structure the right agreement where we can both continue to supply one another in a reliable, cost effective way that preserves jobs essential to the American economy? But the same thing is true, obviously in Canada as well.\"",
      "The U.S.-Canada relationship has been strained since Mr. Trump came into office in January and repeatedly suggested that Canada could become the \"51st state.\" Carney emphatically denied this in an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump in May, saying Canada is \"not for sale.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "Meet the potato's unexpected ancestor: the tomato.",
      "That's right, a fruit. Potatoes and tomatoes don't look alike, smell alike or taste alike, but in a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists said that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor around 9 million years ago.",
      "\"We've finally solved the mystery of where potatoes came from,\" corresponding author Sanwen Huang of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences said in a news release.",
      "The origin of the modern potato has puzzled scientists for years. In terms of appearance, potatoes resemble a species from Chile called Etuberosum, with one crucial difference: Etuberosum don't produce the starch-rich tubers. That's where the tomato comes in.",
      "While tomatoes don't have tubers, the ancient tomato did provide a crucial gene that, when mixed with the genetics of Etuberosum, told the modern potato to form tubers, according to the researchers. The SP6A gene from the tomato parent tells the potato plant to make tubers, while the IT1 gene from Etuberosum assists in controlling the growth of the underground stems that form tubers. Both pieces were needed to create the potato that's known and loved today.",
      "\"Our findings show how a hybridization event between species can spark the evolution of new traits, allowing even more species to emerge,\" Huang said.",

      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule homed in on the International Space Station early Saturday and glided in for a problem-free docking \u2014 delivering two NASA astronauts, a Russian cosmonaut and a Japanese flier \u2014 to the outpost after a 16-hour rendezvous.",
      "Catching up from behind and below, the Crew 11 Dragon Endeavour looped up ahead of the lab complex, then to a point directly above the outpost before slowly moving straight in for a linkup at the space-facing port of the forward Harmony module at 2:27 a.m. ET as the two spacecraft orbited 264 miles above the south Pacific Ocean.",
      "Hooks and latches then engaged, pulling the Crew Dragon's nose firmly into the docking mechanism, which locked the craft in place. Umbilicals automatically connected and flight controllers began a series of leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal.",
      "\"Endeavour, welcome to the International Space Station,\" called NASA astronaut Jonny Kim from inside the ISS. \"Zena, Mike, Kimi and Oleg, we have cold drinks, hot food and hugs waiting. See you soon.\"",
      "\"Hello space station, Crew 11 is here!\" Endeavour pilot Mike Fincke, a three-flight veteran, enthusiastically replied. \"And we are super excited to join Expedition 73. We will do our best to also be good stewards of our beautiful ISS during our stay. The ISS has been inhabited and crewed for almost 25 years. We look forward to celebrating with you.\"",
      "Nearly three hours later, after doffing their spacesuits and configuring their capsule for docked operations, Fincke, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, making her first flight, Japanese veteran Kimiya Yui and rookie cosmonaut Oleg Platonov floated through the forward hatch to be welcomed aboard by the space station's seven-member crew.",
      "\"We are so happy to see your smiling faces,\" said ISS commander Takuya Onishi. \"Zena, Oleg, congratulations on your first spaceflight. We are looking forward to hearing your impressions and your feelings about that. Mike and Kimiya, welcome back. Your experience will be an invaluable asset for Expedition 73.\"",
      "Cardman was bumped from a Crew Dragon flight last year to help NASA bring two Starliner astronauts back to Earth after problems prevented them from coming home on their own spacecraft. She was clearly thrilled to finally be aboard the space station.",
      "\"This has been the absolute journey of a lifetime,\" she said with a broad smile. \"We are so incredibly grateful to be here. Thank you so much for this warm welcome. It was such an unbelievably beautiful sight to see the space station come into our view for the first time, especially with these wonderful crewmates.\"",
      "With the arrival of Crew 11, four of the station's crew members \u2014 Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 will be clear to undock and return to Earth next Wednesday to close out a 145-day mission.",
      "The other three \u2014 Kim and Soyuz MS-27/73S crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky \u2014 will remain aboard with Cardman and company to continue Expedition 73.",
      "Until now, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit with Crew 11.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25% while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money.",
      "No final decisions have been made. But NASA is assessing the possibility of extending Crew 11's stay in space from six to eight months, depending on the actual funding outlook.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" Cardman said before launch. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

    "story": [
      "Running a day late, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched Friday on a mission to deliver a fresh three-man one-woman crew to the International Space Station.",
      "The Falcon 9 lifted off at 11:43 a.m. EDT from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, as mission control kept a close eye on clouds rolling into the area shortly before launch time.",
      "With commander Zena Cardman and co-pilot Mike Fincke monitoring cockpit displays, flanked on the left by Japanese Astronaut Kimiya Yui and on the right by cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, the Crew Dragon capsule began its climb. Nine minutes later, they reached orbit and set off after the International Space Station.",
      "\"I have no emotions but joy right now. That was absolutely transcendent, the ride of a lifetime,\" radioed Cardman, making her first flight. \"Thank you, this has been an incredible honor.\"",
      "Added Fincke, a three-flight veteran: \"Boy, it's great to be back in orbit again! Thank you to SpaceX and NASA to get us here. What a ride!\"",
      "The crew\u00a0originally hoped to take off Thursday, but clouds built up over the launch site and SpaceX called off the countdown just 67 seconds before liftoff. Weather remained a concern the second time around, but in the end conditions were \"go\" for launch.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9's first stage engines shut down, the stage dropped away and the flight to orbit continued on the power of the single Merlin engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around and reversed course, flying itself back to a picture-perfect touchdown on a landing pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, chalking up SpaceX's 65th Florida landing and its 484th successful booster recovery overall.",
      "One minute after landing, the second stage engine shut down and the Crew Dragon Endeavour was released to fly on its own.",
      "Had the crew launched Thursday, it would have taken them nearly 40 hours to catch up with the space station. With a launch Friday, the trip was expected to take just 16 hours, setting up a docking at the forward Harmony module's space-facing port at 3 a.m. Saturday \u2014 the same time they would have docked had they launched Thursday.",
      "For Cardman, the trip to space finally fulfills a dream she had hoped to accomplish last year when she came within a month or so of launching to the space station as commander of an earlier Crew Dragon flight.",
      "But she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex in June 2024 in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "Wilson has not yet been assigned another flight, but Cardman was tapped to command of Crew 11.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" she said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",
      "\"Now I have the opportunity to train with this wonderful, amazing crew. Life is a journey. It takes many turns, and I'm just grateful to be here.\"",
      "Fincke is a 58-year-old three-flight veteran who trained to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner as did Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. In the wake of the problems encountered last year during the Starliner test flight, both ended up assigned to Crew 11.",
      "Platonov, making his first flight, was assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program. The arrangement is intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it.",
      "Platonov is the seventh cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon under the agreement.",
      "A long-awaited mission aboard the space station",
      "Crew 11 will be welcomed aboard the space station by by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand: Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Clothing and personal items for Cardman are already on board, launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, her 38th, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "NASA plans to retire the space station in 2030, using a custom spacecraft being designed by SpaceX to drive the 930,000-pound football-field-size lab out of orbit, making sure it breaks up in the atmosphere over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from any populated areas.",
      "As one might expect of a decades old spacecraft of the size and complexity of the International Space Station, the vehicle is showing signs of wear and tear. One of the more concerning issues is a small-but-persistent leak in a compartment between the Russian Zvezda module and its aft docking port.",
      "The leak was discovered in 2019. The Russians believe its related to metal fatigue. NASA managers think it's more complicated than that. In any case, cosmonauts aboard the station have made multiple attempts to plug the leaks, but they have persisted.",
      "Earlier this summer, NASA held up the launch of the Axiom 4 flight to the space station due to indications a hatch used to seal off the leaking compartment was also leaking. They now have confirmed the hatch can, in fact, be sealed when needed to protect the integrity of the station's primary air supply.",
      "\"The rest of the station is leak tight,\" said Bill Spetch, NASA's ISS integration operations manager. \"We continuously monitor that, and everything else shows that we are really tight on our leak rate on the rest of ISS, no evidence of any other cracks or any other places.\"",
      "Said departing Crew 10 commander McClain: \"We feel very safe.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. job market, already showing the strain from global trade tensions, is showing early signs of another critical issue facing workers today: artificial intelligence.",
      "For the first seven months of 2025, rising adoption of generative AI technology by private employers accounted for more than 10,000 job cuts, according to a report released this week by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market. More than 292,000 positions have been eliminated this year due to cuts linked to the Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), an initiative to reduce federal spending spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found.",
      "\"We are seeing the federal budget cuts implemented by DOGE impact non-profits and health care in addition to the government,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "Layoffs are also accelerating in the vast retail sector as tariffs raise the cost of doing business, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retailers have announced more than 80,000 cuts through July, up nearly 250% compared to the same period last year, the firm found.",
      "\"Retailers are being impacted by tariffs, inflation and ongoing economic uncertainty causing layoffs and store closures. Further declines in consumer spending could trigger additional losses,\" the group said.",

    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",

      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits.

    "summary": "Revisions are a \"feature, not a bug\" of any jobs report, former BLS commissioner told CBS MoneyWatch.",
    "story": [
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics last week issued a\u00a0steep downward revision\u00a0to May and June's hiring numbers, prompting President Trump to call the edits \"miscalculations\" by the department's commissioner, whom he subsequently fired, in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Aug. 1.",
      "While the downward revision of May and June payroll growth by 258,000 marked the largest two-month downward revision to the jobs numbers since 1968, revisions themselves are not uncommon. Revisions are \"a feature, not a bug\" of the agency's reporting process, Erica Groshen, former BLS commissioner under the Obama administration told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Larger revisions have been recorded, but only when the economy has been in a recession, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis of BLS data.",
      "How the BLS processes its reports",
      "The BLS surveys both households and businesses for its monthly jobs report. After releasing an initial report, it's common for the agency to issue revisions to the prior monthly figures, as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "That's because while some survey recipients respond to the agency's surveys immediately, others report data late. In the interest of reporting employment information in a timely manner, though, the BLS initially issues its monthly jobs report based on an incomplete collection of responses.",
      "\"The BLS wants to get the information as accurate as possible, but it doesn't want to wait too long to put out information that's useful,\" Groshen said. \"So it puts out preliminary numbers, saying they are an estimate, then it gathers more information and improves that estimate.\"",
      "\"If you send out a survey to a bunch of people, some will turn it back in on time and some of them won't,\" Michele Evermore, a former Department of Labor employee and senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The faster you make a determination, the more you're going to have to fill in the blanks,\" she said. In the interim, the BLS relies on scientific modeling to paint a more complete picture of the state of the job market. \"You have to fill in the gaps, and the more reports you get back, the more holes you can fill, and the more accurate a report you get.\"",
      "Eventually, the inclusion of late responses to surveys by both employers and workers enables the agency to provide a more accurate picture of the state of hiring and unemployment in the U.S., Evermore explained.",
      "The cuts to the number of jobs that were added in May and June were spread out across both public- and private-sector jobs. The downward revision to public-sector payroll growth \"mostly reflected lower state and local government job gains,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note. Private-sector job gains were previously overstated because of incomplete response data, according to the analysts.",
      "Groshen acknowledged that the revisions were \"definitely on the large side,\" but that \"they happen, and are the product of the same monthly process.\"",
      "Cuts pertaining to government jobs were driven primarily by reductions in hiring by state and local education establishments, according to the BLS. Groshen attributes the job cuts to the expiration of pandemic-era government subsidies that are leading to a pullback in hiring.",
      "\"These subsidies were cut, so they are not hiring as many people as they had been in the past, and state and local governments often report late, so that information came in late,\" she said.",
      "Evermore, of The Century Foundation, noted that the BLS revisions only apply to jobs that were added in both May and June, and not to \"the pool of all the jobs in the U.S.\"",
      "\"While it seems like a big revision, percentage-wise, it's floating on top of the entire labor market. So while it's big, it's not as dramatic as some people are acting like it is,\" she said.",
      "Dismissal of BLS commissioner",
      "In his Truth Social post on Friday, Mr. Trump accused BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer of political bias before announcing her dismissal in response to the downward revision of jobs numbers. \"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote.",
      "Despite being probed for answers,, the White House has not provided any evidence that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes.",
      "According to Groshen, the drastic revise of the job numbers don't reflect a \"failure\" of the BLS to do its job.",
      "\"It's not a failure and it's not bias. It's not like the commissioner said, 'Oh, I think I'm going to change that numbers.' The commissioner has no power, no ability to do that.\"",
      "Evermore concurred. \"Having worked with BLS for years, it's impossible to cook the books as things stand,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "On Tuesday, California congressman Rep. George Whitesides, a Democrat, introduced a bill that his office said would prevent the president from \"unjustly firing the head of a statistical agency for politically-motivated reasons.\"",
      "Called the Statistical Agency Integrity and Independence Act, it asserts that a President may only dismiss the head of a federal statistical agency for cause, including demonstrated inefficiency.",
      "\"Now more than ever, as our economy reels from the impacts of haphazard tariffs and instability, we need data we can trust,\" Whitesides said in a statement Tuesday. He added that Mr. Trump's decision to fire McEntarfer \"sets a dangerous precedent.\"",
      "Data collection",
      "For years, it's become increasingly difficult to collect complete data based on surveys fielded to hundreds of thousands of employers and individuals, according to Groshen.",
      "\"There is a very long-term term trend of a declining response rate, which is bedeviling the system,\" she said. That's in part because some surveys are fielded over the phone, and American households are increasingly ditching landlines.",
      "Jeff Strohl, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, a research policy institute, echoes others in noting that BLS releases monthly jobs numbers knowing that they'll be revised. But the agency prioritizes timeliness over 100% accuracy because \"the currency of the data is still important,\" he said.",
      "Low response rates \u2014 only about 70% of employers surveyed respond on time \u2014 make revisions inevitable. according to Strohl. \"A month later, the response rate goes up to 90%-95%, so you have 25%, or 150,000, more firms reporting their data,\" he said.",
      "Additionally, weekly shocks to the economy, such as created by tariffs, adds another layer to the challenge of releasing accurate jobs data each month.",
      "\"The U.S. economy is going through a huge number of shocks on a weekly basis,\" Strohl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Tariffs are being threatened and applied, and there is a level of economic uncertainty affecting the job market.\"",
      "For example, he said, some job seekers are having offers rescinded as major universities lose research grants. \"That's stopping hires from working on projects the money was going to feed,\" he said.",

Experts say it marked the first time a man has been put to death with a working heart device in his chest.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Black's appeals. The execution was Tennessee's second since May, after a pause for five years, first because of COVID-19 and then because of missteps by state corrections officials.",
      "Twenty-eight men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., exceeding the 25 carried out last year and in 2018. It is the highest total since 2015, when 28 people were put to death.",
      "According to the\u00a0Death Penalty Information Center, Tennessee has 46 inmates on death row. The state has granted clemency three times.",
      "Black's condition",
      "Black, 69, was in a wheelchair, and he had dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, his attorneys had said.",
      "His implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is a small, battery-powered electronic device that is surgically implanted in the chest. It served as a pacemaker and an emergency defibrillator. Black's attorneys said in order to be sure it was off, a doctor would have to place a programming device over the implant site, sending it a deactivation command, with no surgery required.",
      "In mid-July, a trial court judge agreed with Black's attorneys that officials must have his device deactivated to avert the risk that it could cause unnecessary pain and prolong the execution. But the state Supreme Court intervened July 31 to overturn that decision, saying the other judge lacked the authority to order the change.",
      "The state had disputed that the lethal injection would cause Black's defibrillator to shock him. Even if shocks were triggered, Black wouldn't feel them, the state said.",
      "Black's attorneys had countered that even if the lethal drug being used, pentobarbital, renders someone unresponsive, they aren't necessarily unaware or unable to feel pain.",
      "Kelley Henry, Black's attorney, said previously that the execution could become a \"grotesque spectacle.\" According to the Tennessee Department of Corrections, seven media members had been selected witnesses to the execution at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution.",

Prosecutors said Black was in a jealous rage when he shot the three at their home. At the time, Black was on work-release while serving time for shooting and wounding Clay's estranged husband.",
      "Linette Bell, whose sister and two nieces were killed, recently told WKRN-TV: \"He didn't have mercy on them, so why should we have mercy on him?\"",
      "Black had already seen three execution dates come and go, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a pause on executions after the Department of Correction was found to not be testing the execution drugs for potency and purity as required.",
      "Intellectual disability claim",
      "In recent years, Black's legal team unsuccessfully tried to get a new hearing over whether he was intellectually disabled and ineligible for the death penalty under U.S. Supreme Court precedent.",
      "His attorneys said that if they had delayed a prior attempt to seek his intellectual disability claim, he would have been spared under a 2021 state law.",
      "Last month, Black's lawyers sent a letter\u00a0to Tennessee's governor, urging him to grant Black clemency and asking him to commute his sentence to life in prison.",
      "\"Mr. Black, who lives with an intellectual disability, has been on death row for 25 years,\" the letter read. \"From infancy, he suffered from the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, resulting in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. As a toddler, he was exposed to toxic lead, compounding his lifelong cognitive and developmental impairments.\"",
      "Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk contended in 2022 that Black is intellectually disabled and deserved a hearing under that 2021 law, but the judge denied it. That is because the 2021 law denies a hearing to people on death row who have already filed a similar request and a court has ruled on it \"on the merits.\"",
      "In Funk's attempt, he focused on input from an expert for the state in 2004 who determined back then that Black didn't meet the criteria for what was then called \"mental retardation.\" But she concluded that Black met the new law's criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability.",
      "Black also sought a determination by the courts that he was incompetent to be executed.",

    "summary": "Gov. Greg Abbott has since vowed to take steps to remove Democratic lawmakers from their seats.",
    "story": [
      "On the eve of the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, Texas Democrats, along with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and the Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, met Tuesday to continue the fight against a redistricting plan to add five seats favoring Republicans.",
      "The Texas Legislature attempted to meet Monday to consider a bill to redraw the state's congressional districts, but\u00a0Democratic members who left the state\u00a0over the weekend did not return,\u00a0denying the quorum\u00a0needed to convene the session.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott has since vowed to take steps to remove those lawmakers from their seats, and Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows said he had signed civil arrest warrants for the absent Democrats.",
      "In a press release, DNC Chair Martin said, \"Instead of prioritizing disaster relief for flood victims, Texas Republicans are abusing their special legislative session to tilt the electoral map in their favor in a desperate attempt to cling to their razor-thin Congressional majority during midterms, after voting to cut health care and food benefits for millions of Texans.\"",
      "And in Tuesday's news conference, that was the message to all Americans: Texas Republicans, Gov. Abbott and President Donald Trump are working to \"cheat\" to gain more votes, disenfranchise Black and Latino voters and violate voting rights, instead of caring for those who were affected by the devastating floods.",
      "Gov. Pritzker, Martin and Lieutenant Governor of Illinois Juliana Stratton all shared how they were proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Texas Democrats and called on all of America to stand up and get involved in the fight.",
      "\"Texas House Democrats are leading the way in choosing courage and country over politics and party,\" said Gov. Pritzker.",
      "Texas Representatives Ramon Romero Jr., of Fort Worth, Barbara Gervin-Hawkins, of San Antonio, Lizzie Fletcher, of Houston and Al Green, of Houston, all spoke on how they were defending all Americans in their fights against redistricting.",
      "Gervin-Hawkins in particular called out Texas Republicans, too, asking them to stand up, be brave, and to vote \"no\" on the redistricting plan.",
      "\"It is time for you to love America again,\" Gervin Hawkins said about her Republican constituents.",
      "And in reference to Gov. Abbott issuing arrest warrants for them, Romer Jr. said, \"I'll pay that price for America.\"",
      "The leaders of the state of Illinois vowed to continue to support Texas Democrats and protect them in their stand against Abbott and President Trump.",
      "A standoff in Texas after Democrats leave the state",
      "Abbott has ordered state troopers to help find and arrest the Democrats who left the state, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities.",
      "\"If you continue to go down this road, there will be consequences,\" House Speaker Rep. Dustin Burrows said from the chamber floor, later telling reporters that it includes fines.",
      "Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified the fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors, like Pritzker, who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation \u2014 even if\u00a0their options are limited. The dispute also reflects President Trump's\u00a0aggressive view of presidential power\u00a0and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the long-standing balance of powers between the federal government and individual states.",
      "The impasse centers on Mr. Trump's effort to get five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas, at Democrats' expense,\u00a0before the midterms. That would bolster his party's chances of preserving its fragile U.S. House majority, something Republicans were unable to do in the 2018 midterms during Trump's first presidency. Republicans currently hold 25 of Texas' 38 seats. That's nearly a 2-to-1 advantage and already a wider partisan gap than the 2024 presidential results: Trump won 56.1% of Texas ballots, while Democrat Kamala Harris received 42.5%.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that Republicans are \"entitled to five more seats.\"",
      "Status of the vote",
      "Texas legislators who left the state have declined to say how long they'll hold out.",
      "\"We recognized when we got on the plane that we're in this for the long haul,\" said Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer while in Illinois.",
      "Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said members \"will do whatever it takes\" but added, \"What that looks like, we don't know.\"",
      "Legislative walkouts\u00a0often only delay passage of a bill, like in 2021, when many Democrats left Texas\u00a0for 38 days\u00a0to protest proposed voting restrictions. Once they returned, Republicans passed that measure.",
      "Lawmakers cannot pass bills in the 150-member House without two-thirds of members present. Democrats hold 62 seats in the majority-Republican chamber, and at least 51 left the state, according to a Democratic aide.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders could \"physically compel the attendance\" of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state\u00a0after warrants were served.\u00a0Republicans answered by adopting $500 daily fines for lawmakers who don't show.",
      "Abbott, meanwhile, continues to make unsubstantiated claims that some lawmakers have committed felonies by soliciting money to pay for potential fines for leaving Texas during the session.",

      "The statue had stood in Judiciary Square \u2014 several blocks from the White House \u2014 since 1901. It was Washington, D.C.'s only outdoor statue of a Confederate general when protesters tore it down and set it on fire in June 2020, CBS affiliate\u00a0WUSA\u00a0reported.",
      "That year, protesters across the country called for the removal of Confederate statues and symbols amid wider calls for racial justice after the murder of\u00a0George Floyd in Minneapolis. President Trump, who was serving his first term at the time, had expressed opposition to removing them, and called for the protesters in the Albert Pike statue case to be arrested immediately.",
      "The Council of D.C., a local governing body for the district,\u00a0said it had been calling for the removal of the statue for years and that it unanimously renewed its call to Congress to remove it in 2017.",

    "story": [
      "Women have made significant gains in the workplace over the past two decades, but one segment of female workers has been left behind: those without a college degree.",
      "New research shows a growing divide in progress in the workforce between women who have earned at least a bachelor's degree and those without any higher education.",
      "The share of college-educated women in the workforce increased by nine percentage points between 2004 and 2024, research from Third Way, a think tank advocating for moderate policy, shows. Meanwhile, women without a college degree barely notched gains: The share of noncollege women in the workforce increased by less than a percentage point over the same period, according to the report.",
      "\"This divergence in the labor force experience of women with and without college degrees speaks to changes in recent years in the workplace, and around the culture of work,\" Curran McSwigan, Third Way's deputy director of economics and author of the report told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those changes are weighted toward women with degrees.\"",
      "Flex work",
      "For example, flexible work arrangements are now more common across corporations, allowing some workers to do their jobs from home, at least part of the time, and better balance work with caregiving duties.",
      "\"Remote work has inherently baked in a lot more flexibility, so working mothers may be able to pop out to take their kids to doctors appointments, instead of taking time off,\" McSwigan said.",
      "White-collar firms have also improved benefits related to caregiving, with some even offering workers child care subsidies, allowing mothers to stay in the labor force, according to McSwigan. But women without a college degree are more likely to work in service-sector jobs that aren't as well paid and don't offer the same child care benefits.",
      "\"White collar workplaces are more likely to provide workers with access to paid leave policies, even child care subsidies, and those are not traditionally the same types of benefits you see in more service-sector work that noncollege women are in,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Women in the service-sector may also work variable shifts, and require child care at hours during which day care centers don't typically operate.",
      "\"A lot of day care centers are only open 9 to 5, so they are coming up to other barriers as well, that are inherent to the types of jobs they are working,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Mothers without college sidelined",
      "Working mothers with college degrees notched even greater gains in the work place over the past two decades, with their participation rising by 11 percentage points, from 57% to 68%, according to the report. By contrast, the percentage of noncollege-educated mothers working full-time increased just 0.1% in the last 20 years.",
      "\"We have heard from policymakers that there has been strong labor force bounce back for women and that we are overcoming the 'she-cession' and making progress when it comes to women in workplace,\" McSwigan said. \"But what the data and analysis is showing is these gains can be attributed to college women, and noncollege women are still on workforce sidelines, and it's hard to say we are making progress for working women if only those with college degrees are benefitting.\"",
      "For this reason, McSwigan emphasizes the need for broad-based policy efforts that support \"the different needs that families are facing\" to ensure that all working women receive the same benefits that college-degree holders have.",

      "The committee is seeking testimony from Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as from officials spanning the past four presidential administrations: former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, Alberto Gonzales, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder, and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller. Sessions and Barr led the Justice Department during President Trump's first term. Lawmakers are seeking information from the Clintons because of the former president's past ties to Epstein and Maxwell in the early 2000s.",
      "Letters to the officials from Kentucky Rep. James Comer, a Republican who leads the Oversight Committee, are all similar. The records from the Justice Department must be turned over by Aug. 19, according to the Oversight committee, and depositions are scheduled for throughout August, September and October.",
      "\"While the Department undertakes efforts to uncover and publicly disclose additional information related to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell's cases, it is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell,\" Comer wrote, adding that the Oversight panel \"may use the results of this investigation to inform legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "Epstein was charged with federal sex trafficking crimes in 2019 and died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial. He had been investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, though that ended in a federal non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges in 2008.",
      "But Congress has renewed its focus on Epstein after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo last month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" of prominent figures and confirmed he died by suicide. The memo also found that there was \u00a0no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people. The Justice Department and FBI said they did not plan to release any further information about Epstein's case.",
      "The findings rankled some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who are skeptical that there is nothing else regarding Epstein's case to make public. Amid the backlash, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell late last month for two days in Tallahassee, where she was serving her sentence before being moved to a minimum-security facility in Texas last week.",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. An appeal of her conviction is currently awaiting action from the Supreme Court.",
      "Blanche and Bondi have also asked federal judges in New York to unseal transcripts from the grand jury proceedings in Epstein and Maxwell's cases, though federal rules typically require matters before grand juries to be kept secret.",
      "Beyond the moves by the Justice Department, lawmakers have pushed for files related to Epstein to be released to the public. A clash of House members over the material led the House to scrap votes and leave Washington early for its monthlong summer recess.",

      "Of note, motor vehicle thefts decreased by 18.6% from 2023 to 2024 following several years of increases. It's the largest one-year drop ever recorded in that category, although the overall rate of car thefts is still higher than it was in 2019, according to Asher.",
      "Other subcategories of property crime include burglary, down 8.6%, and larceny-theft, down 5.5%.",

Although the group noted that while the overall numbers are going down, many cities are still seeing higher homicide rates than they did in the first half of 2019.",
      "\"These numbers are promising but not surprising,\" Ernesto Lopez, senior research specialist at the CCJ, told CBS News. \"After significant increases in violent crime starting in 2020, the decline in all major crime types across all sizes of jurisdictions is promising. These trends are closely aligned with our own findings, which show crime falling last year and continuing to fall in the first six months of 2025.\"",
      "The council also noted the limitations of the FBI's data, which doesn't cover the entire U.S. population and only measures crimes that are reported to law enforcement. Advocates for victims of sexual assault, for example, often note that many rapes go unreported.",
      "\"The police data is critical, but it's also important to remember that most crimes are not reported to police, so the overall volume is much higher than what's represented here,\" the CCJ told CBS News.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard issued its final report on the deadly 2023 incident, which killed five people aboard OceanGate's Titan submersible when it imploded on an expedition to see the wreckage of the Titanic.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. exploration company OceanGate used \"intimidation tactics\" to \"evade regulatory scrutiny\" in the years leading up to the June 2023 Titan submersible tragedy, according to findings released by the U.S. Coast Guard Tuesday.",
      "Those conclusions are part of an over 300-page report released by officials into the incident, which killed five people onboard when the sub imploded underwater while on an expedition to see the wreckage of the Titanic.",
      "\"This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,\" Jason Neubauer, who led the Coast Guard's investigation into the incident, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"For several years preceding the incident, OceanGate leveraged intimidation tactics, allowances for scientific operations, and the company's favorable reputation to evade regulatory scrutiny,\" the Coast Guard report said. \"By strategically creating and exploiting regulatory confusion and oversight challenges, OceanGate was ultimately able to operate TITAN completely outside of the established deep-sea protocols.\"",
      "The report outlines several key causes behind the Titan submersible's demise. That included the fact that the \"design and testing processes for TITAN did not adequately address many of the fundamental engineering principles that would be crucial for ensuring safety and reliability in such an inherently hazardous environment,\" the report said.",
      "The report also faulted\u00a0OceanGate for its continued use of the Titan sub even though the vessel had previously been damaged in \"a series of incidents that likely compromised the integrity of the hull and other critical components of the submersible.\"",
      "On the day of the tragedy, the sub's hull \"experienced a critical event that compromised the structural integrity of its pressure vessel, resulting in an instantaneous and catastrophic implosion,\" according to the Coast Guard's investigation.",
      "The Coast Guard report also found that OceanGate had a \"toxic\" safety culture and corporate structure, and that its operational practices were \"critically flawed.\"",
      "That included a workplace environment which \"used firings of senior staff members and the looming threat of being fired to dissuade employees and contractors from expressing safety concerns.\"",
      "In February 2018, OceanGate's former director of marine operations filed a whistleblower complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, alleging he was dismissed because he voiced safety concerns about the \"first TITAN hull's development and testing plans.\"",
      "In response to the complaint, OceanGate filed a lawsuit against the former employee, accusing him of violating a confidentiality agreement he had signed with the company.",
      "That whistleblower complaint was not processed in a timely fashion by relevant U.S. federal agencies, according to the Coast Guard's report, and the ex-employee withdrew the complaint, citing the \"emotional toll of the ensuing legal battle.\"",
      "\"The two-year investigation has identified multiple contributing factors that led to this tragedy, providing valuable lessons learned to prevent a future occurrence,\" Neubauer said.",
      "Among those killed aboard the doomed vessel was Stockton Rush, co-founder of OceanGate, the Washington state company that owned the Titan. The implosion also killed veteran Titanic explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet; two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood; and British adventurer Hamish Harding.",
      "The Coast Guard's findings pointed the finger of blame largely at Rush, who investigators said ignored warnings about the hull damage that had been identified during a previous exploration in 2022.",
      "\"Mr. Rush's overconfidence influenced OceanGate's personnel, contractors, and mission specialists, creating an environment where safety concerns were ignored or underemphasized in favor of operational continuity,\" the Coast Guard's analysis found.",
      "Had Rush survived the tragedy, the Coast Guard said that it would have recommended the U.S. Department of Justice to consider pursuing a criminal investigation into his actions, which the report said \"exhibited negligence that contributed to the deaths of four individuals.\"",

The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market. More than 292,000 positions have been eliminated this year due to cuts linked to the Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), an initiative to reduce federal spending spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found.",

One study showed an annual increase of 1.1% from 2004 to 2019 jumped to 12% from 2019 to 2022 for colorectal cancer incidence among people aged 45 to 49, while another study showed screenings among U.S. adults aged 45 to 49 increase 62% from 2019 to 2023.",

He cited a non-binding 2021 legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, which suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited their office.",

Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has suggested in a handful of appearances in recent months and years that he's looking at ways to run again for president, though the Constitution limits any person to being elected to the office twice. But in his latest comments on the issue, the president downplayed talk of a third term.",
      "The president told NBC News in an interview that aired on May 4 that \"I'll be a two-term president.\" And when asked on Aug. 5 whether he'd run again, he said \"no, probably not,\" though he added, \"I'd like to.\"",
      "The comments came after he told NBC in March that he was \"not joking\" about seeking another term in office, after repeatedly publicly musing about the possibility. He also said at the time that despite the constitutional limitations, \"there are methods which you could do it.\"",
      "Trump supporters like former strategist Steve Bannon have called on the president to run again, and Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, introduced a resolution earlier this year to amend the Constitution to allow Mr. Trump to be elected to another term. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also said of Mr. Trump's prospects of serving a third term, \"not without a change in the Constitution.\" He told reporters, \"I think that you guys keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Experts say changing the Constitution is extremely unlikely. Election law scholars\u00a0raised the possibility that talk of a third term, whatever its likelihood, may function as a show of strength to try to stave off the perception that Mr. Trump is a lame-duck president.",
      "Here's a timeline of Mr. Trump's comments on a third term:",
      "\"We're probably entitled to another four after that\"",
      "Mr. Trump flirted with additional time in office beyond two terms when he sought reelection in 2020. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, the president predicted he would win four more years in the White House, and even suggested that he could go on to another term after his second.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"",
      "\"Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump again made reference to another term at a rally in Las Vegas on Jan. 25.",
      "\"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice \u2014 or three times or four times,\" Mr. Trump quipped to applause from the crowd, before adding that \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"",
      "Then on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump joked to Republican lawmakers about a third term. Speaking before the House GOP conference in Florida, Mr. Trump touted the money he'd raised for another race that he said \"I assume I can't use for myself.\"",
      "\"But I'm not 100% sure because, I don't know,\" the president continued, to laughter from House Republicans. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me.\"",
      "At the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Mr. Trump said, \"They say I can't run again \u2014 that's the expression.\"",
      "\"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oh,\" the president added.",
      "On Feb. 20, the president again joked about an additional term at a White House event to mark Black History Month, as he celebrated the support he saw from Black Americans in the 2024 election.",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me,\" Mr. Trump said, as supporters chanted, \"four more years!\"",
      "\"There are methods\"",
      "In an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on March 30, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about serving a third term, and for the first time mentioned an awareness of potential paths.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview, adding that \"it is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "The president pointed to his favorability rating and suggested that Americans would like him to serve a third term. Mr. Trump told Welker, \"I have had more people say, 'please run again,'\" while noting \"we have a long way to go before we even think about that.\" On Air Force One Sunday night, he\u00a0spoke\u00a0with reporters and briefly addressed questions about a third term and reiterated that it's still a distant consideration.",
      "\"No matter how you look at it, we've got a long time to go. We have a long time. You know, we have almost four years to go,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"But despite that, so many people are saying, 'you've got to run again.' They love the job.\"",
      "While speaking to reporters on Monday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump denied that he has ever looked into running for another term.",
      "\"People are asking me to run,\" he said. \"There's a whole story about running for a third term. I don't know. I never looked into it. They do say there's a way you can do it. But I don't know about that. But I have not looked into it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was also asked whether it would open the door to Democrats running former President Barack Obama, who served two consecutive terms, against him.",
      "\"I'd love that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That would be a good one. I'd like that.\"",
      "\"I'll be a two-term president\"",
      "In another interview with Welker conducted on May 2, Mr. Trump downplayed talk of seeking another term. The president said \"so many people want me to do it,\" saying he has \"never had requests so strong as that.\" But he added that \"it's something that, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do.\"",
      "\"This is not something I'm looking to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm looking to have four great years, and turn it over to somebody \u2014 ideally a great Republican, a great Republican \u2014 to carry it forward. But I think we're going to have four years and I think four years is plenty of time to do something really spectacular.\"",
      "Asked about moves by his allies to make another term possible, like by seeking a constitutional amendment, the president said \"that's because they like the job I'm doing, and it's a compliment. It's really a great compliment.\"",
      "\"There are ways of doing it,\" the president added, alluding to a possible write-in vote or move to elect Vice President JD Vance and have him turn the power over to Mr. Trump. But the president said he's \"not looking at that\" and hasn't had official meetings about possible avenues.",
      "\"I'll be an eight-year president,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'll be a two-term president.\"",
      "\"I'd like to run\"",
      "In an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Aug. 5, Mr. Trump touted the support he saw in the 2024 election among Texas voters, calling it \"a record that they say won't be beaten unless I run again.\" When asked whether he plans to run again, the president responded, \"no, probably not.\" He added, \"I'd like to run,\" citing his poll numbers.",
      "\"People love the tariffs, and they love the trade deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And they love that foreign countries aren't ripping us off anymore.\"",

    "story": [
      "A grand jury on Monday declined to indict a former Atlanta police officer on manslaughter charges in the death of a church deacon who died in a struggle with the officer following a minor car crash.",
      "After hearing the case, Fulton County grand jurors rejected criminal charges against Kiran Kimbrough, said Jeff DiSantis, a spokesperson for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.",
      "Johnny Hollman Sr. died in August 2023 after he refused to sign a citation following a wreck. Family members said the 62-year-old Hollman was driving home from Bible study at his daughter's house and taking dinner to his wife when he collided with another vehicle while turning across a busy street just west of downtown.",
      "Body camera video of Hollman's arrest shows Kimbrough repeatedly demanding that Hollman sign the citation, while Hollman insists he did nothing wrong. The two men tussled and Hollman ended up face down on the ground with Kimbrough over him, pressing him down. Holloman repeatedly says \"I can't breathe,\" and Kimbrough uses a Taser to shock him repeatedly. The video also shows a tow truck driver helping Kimbrough.",
      "Hollman became unresponsive and was declared dead at a hospital. An autopsy determined the death was a homicide, with heart disease also a contributing factor.",
      "Lance LoRusso, who represents Kimbrough, said prosecutors sought to indict his client for one count of manslaughter, one count of simple battery and three counts of violating his oath of office. Kimbrough testified before the grand jury, as is an officer's right under state law, LoRusso said.",
      "\"While Johnny Hollman's death was tragic, in no way did Kiran Kimbrough cause the death,\" LoRusso said in a statement Monday. \"Johnny Hollman's death was caused by medical complications and his felonious, unlawful resistance of a uniformed officer performing his lawful duties.\"",
      "DiSantis said Willis is conferring with prosecutors and investigators about whether to ask a new grand jury to indict Kimbrough.",
      "Hollman's family members have repeatedly called for the former officer to be criminally charged.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS affiliate WANF-TV on Monday, Hollman's father said they are devasted and that their father \"should still be here.\"",
      "\"The failure to hold this officer accountable is another painful reminder of how little value is placed on his life by some citizens \u2014 even when the facts are clear and the harm is undeniable. But we will not stop. Our faith and our fight for justice will not waver,\" the family said in a statement.",
      "Attorney Mawuli Davis, who represents the Hollman family, said Monday is a \"profoundly sad day \u2014 not only for the Hollman family, but for all who believe in justice,\" the station reported.",
      "\"Despite video evidence, the unwavering courage of this family, and the thorough effort by the Fulton County District Attorney's Office, the criminal justice system has once again failed to hold law enforcement accountable for the death of a citizen,\" Davis said. \"Deacon Johnny Hollman deserved better.\"",
      "Atlanta officials fired Kimbrough, saying he should have agreed to Hollman's request to speak to a supervisor. A civil service board upheld the firing, and the Atlanta City Council agreed to settle a lawsuit by Hollman's family alleging excessive force for $3.8 million. The family also sued the tow truck driver and his employer, saying the driver straddled Hollman's head and neck for at least 20 seconds and appeared to \"sit with his full body weight\" on Hollman's head and neck while Kimbrough handcuffed Hollman.",
      "Atlanta and some other police departments have enacted policies saying that officers should no longer arrest people who refused to sign citations. State lawmakers passed a bill that would have enacted such a policy statewide earlier this year, but Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed it because he opposed a provision unrelated to collecting signatures from people named on citations.",

    "story": [
      "A driver going 283 mph trying to set a land speed record during a racing event at Utah's famed Bonneville Salt Flats died Sunday after he lost control of his rocket-like vehicle called the Speed Demon, organizers said.",
      "Driver Chris Raschke lost control about two and a half miles into a run and was treated by medical professionals at the scene, but died from his injuries, according to a statement from the Southern California Timing Association, which has organized the popular land-speed racing event known as \"Speed Week\" since the late 1940s.",
      "For decades, the flat, glasslike white surface has drawn drivers from all over seeking to set new land speed world records and motorcycle and car fans to watch.",
      "A remnant of a prehistoric lakebed, the salt flats that are about 100 miles west of Salt Lake City have also been a backdrop for movies like \"Independence Day\" and \"The World's Fastest Indian.\"",
      "\"Motorsports is inherently a dangerous sport,\" said Dennis Sullivan, a car builder and racer who set a land speed record in his 1927 Model T street roadster and serves as president of the Utah Salt Flats Racing Association. \"People get hurt. People get killed. That's just the nature of the sport. It doesn't happen a lot.\"",
      "Sullivan said motor sports also have stringent safety requirements - such as stronger roll bars, special tires and more fire extinguishers - that help protect drivers.",
      "The last racing death Sullivan recalled at the flats came in 2016 when Sam Wheeler, a renowned land speed motorcycle racer, crashed at 200 mph when the high-performance bike he was testing fish-tailed and went airborne.",
      "The Bonneville Salt Flats, which had its first race in 1914, have about 7 miles for racing and an aquifer underneath that cools the tires of the cars. It's unlike other race venues in that it doesn't have stands. Spectators must stand two-tenths of a mile away from the cars.",
      "Raschke lost control of the vehicle about two and a half miles into a run. It's unknown what speed Raschke was aiming to reach.\u00a0 The association and the Tooele County Sheriff's Office are investigating the death, said Sgt. Dane Lerdahl, a spokesman for the law enforcement agency.",
      "\"We know it was an accident of some sort,\" Lerdahl said. For decades, people have used the flat, glasslike surface at Bonneville Salt Flats, 100 miles west of Salt Lake City, to set speed records, sometimes topping 400 mph. Speed Week has long been a draw for motorcycle and car fans.",
      "According to the Southern California Timing Association, 18 records were set on Sunday morning, 7 by cars and 11 by motorcycles during a total of 261 runs.",
      "Raschke, 60, was the driver of a streamliner - a long, narrow, aerodynamic car made to run at high speeds - known as the Speed Demon. He had worked in motor sports for more than four decades.",
      "Keith Pedersen, the association's president and Speed Week race director, said Raschke's death was a major loss for the racing community, CBS affiliate KUTV reported.",
      "\"It's much more of a camaraderie and community, and that builds a lot of friendships and trust,\" Pedersen told the station. \"He's a big part of it, and he will be sorely missed.\"",
      "According to the Speed Demon racing team's site, Raschke worked at the Ventura Raceway in the early 1980s, raced 3-wheelers and cars in the mini stock division, learned to fabricate and maintain race cars when working with an acclaimed engine builder and later became a driver for the Speed Demon team.",
      "Pedersen said Raschke was a respected driver within the racing community and also worked for a company that makes fasteners for race cars.",
      "\"He is one of the big ones. He had done all sorts of racing,\" Pedersen said.",

    "summary": "A CBS News review of three of DOGE's largest cuts claimed so far found actual savings of 3% of what was claimed.",
    "story": [
      "The spotlight may have moved off the Department of Government Efficiency since the departure of Elon Musk, but the Trump administration's DOGE continues to post about cost cutting on its so-called \"wall of receipts.\" And once again, some of its claims about savings appear to be significantly overstated, according to a CBS News review.",
      "The review of three of the largest cuts claimed so far indicates the savings from those contracts are less than 3% of what DOGE said they were.",
      "On July 27, DOGE added 705 canceled contracts to the website it uses to track and declare savings from the agency's cost cutting across the federal government, among them three of the largest claimed cuts posted since President Trump launched DOGE in January.",
      "The three contracts \u2014 all from the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 funded COVID-19 testing and treatment for people who were uninsured or underinsured during the pandemic. DOGE claims canceling those contracts saved $6.4 billion.",
      "But CBS News' review of transaction records indicates the actual savings is just a small fraction of that \u2014 around $165 million.",
      "That's about how much in obligated funds were left unspent in the three contracts by the time Mr. Trump took office and DOGE was launched. There was nearly $7 billion that remained, but this figure represented a ceiling that federal contracting experts say is rarely reached.",
      "DOGE adjusted down that total potential value by a combined $6.4 billion \u2014 and then reported it as savings. But with the pandemic long over and the contracts set to expire on May 31 of this year, it is highly unlikely the contractors, which included Walgreens and CVS, would have spent anywhere near that sum on COVID-19 testing and treatment.",
      "The spending \"was never going to reach this number,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, referring to the total potential value. \"You didn't have to terminate this contract, you are the government \u2014 just don't obligate any more money.\"",
      "Since it was launched, multiple news outlets including CBS News have reported that DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" has at times vastly overstated the amount of funds cut and discovered numerous errors in the group's accounting.",
      "DOGE now claims it has saved $52.2 billion \u2013 just from contracts canceled. Malkus, who analyzed the actual implications of the cancellations rather than the ceiling values, puts the number closer to $17.8 billion. But that would only be if Congress agreed to rescind the funds that it had already voted to spend.",
      "The DOGE website reports a grand total of $199 \u202fbillion saved, when factoring in real estate lease cancellations and other cuts such as personnel reductions. However, it provides no documentation for roughly half of that amount. According to DOGE, the savings equate to $1,236.02 per person in the U.S.",
      "\"The amount they have per person is fiction,\" Malkus said. \"It's transparency theater.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the three contracts. The White House redirected the request to the General Services Administration, which declined to comment.",
      "A substantial portion of those purported savings is a result of cuts to USAID. A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet says those cuts could come with a human toll. By the study's estimates, the loss in humanitarian aid could lead to 14 million deaths in children younger than 5 years of age by 2030.",
      "Malkus told CBS News, \"Their claims are generally to say, 'Hey this is a lot of pain, but it's worth it.'\"",
      "The update is only the second since Musk, who launched DOGE, departed from his role in the White House advising Mr. Trump.",
      "Shortly before Musk's term as a special government employee expired, he told reporters, \"This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "\"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger,\" he said from the Oval Office on May 30, adding that he was confident over time DOGE would cull $1 trillion in savings.",
      "It's unclear exactly how DOGE has functioned since then. In late June, The Washington Post reported that federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, revoking control of the online clearinghouse for all grant opportunities from the group. In DOGE's latest update, only one additional canceled grant was added.",
      "Several DOGE-associated government employees have left in recent weeks, including the Department of the Interior's Tyler Hassen, whose last day was Friday, The New York Times reported. Hassen was originally hired as a DOGE staffer, and then was later tasked with trimming costs at the Interior Department, where he was named principal deputy assistant secretary of the interior.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had allowed him broad authority to make cuts to budgets and staffing, and under his watch, a DOGE-associated employee made the claim that a single survey costing $1 billion dollars\u00a0had been cut. That claim was repeated by Elon Musk and Burgum, but no evidence was ever supplied to back it up.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard issued its final report on the deadly 2023 incident, which killed five people aboard OceanGate's Titan submersible when it imploded on an expedition to see the wreckage of the Titanic.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. exploration company OceanGate used \"intimidation tactics\" to \"evade regulatory scrutiny\" in the years leading up to the June 2023 Titan submersible tragedy, according to findings released by the U.S. Coast Guard Tuesday.",
      "Those conclusions are part of an over 300-page report released by officials into the incident, which killed five people onboard when the sub imploded underwater while on an expedition to see the wreckage of the Titanic.",
      "\"This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,\" Jason Neubauer, who led the Coast Guard's investigation into the incident, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"For several years preceding the incident, OceanGate leveraged intimidation tactics, allowances for scientific operations, and the company's favorable reputation to evade regulatory scrutiny,\" the Coast Guard report said. \"By strategically creating and exploiting regulatory confusion and oversight challenges, OceanGate was ultimately able to operate TITAN completely outside of the established deep-sea protocols.\"",
      "The report outlines several key causes behind the Titan submersible's demise. That included the fact that the \"design and testing processes for TITAN did not adequately address many of the fundamental engineering principles that would be crucial for ensuring safety and reliability in such an inherently hazardous environment,\" the report said.",
      "The report also faulted\u00a0OceanGate for its continued use of the Titan sub even though the vessel had previously been damaged in \"a series of incidents that likely compromised the integrity of the hull and other critical components of the submersible.\"",
      "On the day of the tragedy, the sub's hull \"experienced a critical event that compromised the structural integrity of its pressure vessel, resulting in an instantaneous and catastrophic implosion,\" according to the Coast Guard's investigation.",
      "The Coast Guard report also found that OceanGate had a \"toxic\" safety culture and corporate structure, and that its operational practices were \"critically flawed.\"",
      "That included a workplace environment which \"used firings of senior staff members and the looming threat of being fired to dissuade employees and contractors from expressing safety concerns.\"",
      "In February 2018, OceanGate's former director of marine operations filed a whistleblower complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, alleging he was dismissed because he voiced safety concerns about the \"first TITAN hull's development and testing plans.\"",
      "In response to the complaint, OceanGate filed a lawsuit against the former employee, accusing him of violating a confidentiality agreement he had signed with the company.",
      "That whistleblower complaint was not processed in a timely fashion by relevant U.S. federal agencies, according to the Coast Guard's report, and the ex-employee withdrew the complaint, citing the \"emotional toll of the ensuing legal battle.\"",
      "\"The two-year investigation has identified multiple contributing factors that led to this tragedy, providing valuable lessons learned to prevent a future occurrence,\" Neubauer said.",
      "Among those killed aboard the doomed vessel was Stockton Rush, co-founder of OceanGate, the Washington state company that owned the Titan. The implosion also killed veteran Titanic explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet; two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood; and British adventurer Hamish Harding.",
      "The Coast Guard's findings pointed the finger of blame largely at Rush, who investigators said ignored warnings about the hull damage that had been identified during a previous exploration in 2022.",
      "\"Mr. Rush's overconfidence influenced OceanGate's personnel, contractors, and mission specialists, creating an environment where safety concerns were ignored or underemphasized in favor of operational continuity,\" the Coast Guard's analysis found.",
      "Had Rush survived the tragedy, the Coast Guard said that it would have recommended the U.S. Department of Justice to consider pursuing a criminal investigation into his actions, which the report said \"exhibited negligence that contributed to the deaths of four individuals.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "Two Saudis were executed for \"terrorist crimes,\" the official Saudi Press Agency said, after 15 people, mostly foreigners, were put to death for drug offenses on Saturday and Sunday.",
      "It is the quickest pace of capital punishment since March 2022, when 81 people were executed in a single day for terrorism-related offenses, sparking widespread condemnation. In 2016, Saudi Arabia executed 47 people in what had been the country's largest mass execution since 1980.",
      "Thirteen of those put to death on Saturday and Sunday were convicted of smuggling hashish, and another for smuggling cocaine.",
      "Saudi Arabia, one of the world's most prolific users of the death penalty, has carried out 239 executions so far this year. The conservative country is on course to outstrip last year's 338 \u2014 the highest since public records first documented cases in the early 1990s.",
      "This year's executions include 161 for drug offenses and 136 foreigners, according to an AFP tally of official data.",
      "Jeed Basyouni of the Reprieve rights group last week signaled a \"significant rise in executions for hashish-related drug offenses, with foreign nationals making up most of these executions.\"",
      "\"This is particularly concerning given the global trend toward decriminalizing the possession and use of hashish,\" she told AFP.",
      "Analysts link the spike to the kingdom's \"war on drugs\" launched in 2023, with many of those first arrested now being executed following legal proceedings.",
      "Saudi Arabia resumed executions for drug offenses at the end of 2022, after suspending the practice for around three years. It says it only carries out death sentences after defendants have exhausted all avenues of appeal, and that executions are aimed at ensuring security and deterring drugs.",
      "The country executed 46 people in June alone, mostly foreign nationals, including 37 for drug-related crimes, which is an average of more than one drug-related execution each day, according to an Amnesty International report released last month. Last year, Saudi Arabia carried out a record 345 executions, the group said.",

      "Plastic pollution is a \"grave, growing and under-recognized danger\" to health that is costing the world at least $1.5 trillion a year, a report published Monday in the Lancet medical journal said.",
      "The new review of existing evidence, which was carried out by leading health researchers and doctors, was published one day ahead of fresh talks in Geneva aiming at getting the world's first treaty on plastic pollution. The experts called for the delegates from nearly 180 nations expected to attend the gathering to finally agree on a treaty after previous failed attempts.",
      "Comparing plastic to air and lead pollution, the report said the\u00a0impact on health\u00a0of plastic pollution could be mitigated by laws and policies.",
      "\"Plastics cause disease and death from infancy to old age and are responsible for health-related economic losses exceeding $1.5 trillion annually,\" it said.",
      "A recent umbrella review of epidemiological research on the health impacts of plastic chemicals showed \"consistent evidence for multiple health effects at all stages of human life for many plastic chemicals\" and found that infants and young children were especially at risk, the report said. \"These effects include impaired reproductive potential (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis), perinatal effects (eg, miscarriage, reduced birthweight, and malformations of the genital organs), diminished cognitive function (eg, intelligence quotient loss), insulin resistance, hypertension and obesity in children, and type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, obesity, and cancer in adults.\"",
      "\"It is incumbent on us to act in response,\" Philip Landrigan, a doctor and researcher at Boston College, said in a statement responding to the report. \"To those meeting in Geneva: please take up the challenge and the opportunity of finding the common ground that will enable meaningful and effective international cooperation in response to this global crisis.\"",
      "The researchers also warned about tiny pieces of plastic called microplastics\u00a0that have been found throughout nature \u2014 and throughout human bodies.

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 07:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "China is standing firm against U.S. demands that it stop buying oil from Russia and Iran.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\"China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\" China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\"Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\"",
      "\"We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \"tough\" negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \"I believe that we have the makings of a deal,\" Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \"Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\" for Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that\u00a0China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "When Mr. Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.",
      "\"If the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China's consistent official stance,\" said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Mr. Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Mr. Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \"the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Mr. Trump has made it clear he wants a \"headline-grabbing deal\" with Xi, \"so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \"strategic solidarity\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\"Beijing simply can't afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \"It's too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\"",
      "A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day.",
      "After the Iranian parliament floated a plan to shut down the Strait of Hormuz in June following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, China spoke out against closing the critical oil transit route.",
      "China also is an important customer for Russia, but is second to India in buying Russian seaborne crude oil exports. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics.",
      "This past week, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested.\"",
      "Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Mr. Trump has been clear that it is \"not acceptable\" for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia.",
      "\"People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,\" Miller said on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" He said the U.S. needs \"to get real about dealing with the financing of this war.\"",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is pushing for sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers. In April, he introduced a bill that would authorize the president to impose tariffs as high as 500% not only on Russia but on any country that \"knowingly\" buys oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products or petrochemical products from Russia.",
      "\"The purpose of this legislation is to break the cycle of China \u2014 a communist dictatorship \u2014 buying oil below market price from Putin's Russia, which empowers his war machine to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,\" Graham said in a June statement.",
      "The bill has 84 co-sponsors in the 100-seat Senate. A corresponding House version has been introduced, also with bipartisan support.",
      "Republicans say they stand ready to move on the sanctions legislation if Mr. Trump asks them to do so, but the bill is on hold for now.",

      "Presidents have long moved military assets like aircraft carriers and bombers to signal resolve. But submarines, especially the covert, nuclear-powered kind, are rarely mentioned.",
      "\"We rarely, if ever, talk about submarine movements unless there\u2019s been an undeniable accident,\" Gene Moran, a former Navy captain and Pentagon strategic advisor, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Plenty of other military assets \u2014 Patriot batteries, aircraft carriers, even B-52 bombers \u2014 are deployed publicly to send a diplomatic message. But this time, the secretive nature of the nuclear submarine positioning may have been the reason for the choice.",
      "\"Submarine deployments are unverifiable,\" said Moran. \"That\u2019s what gives them strategic value, but also what makes this announcement clever \u2014 if you're aiming for a headline.\"",
      "Trump moved nuclear submarines to \"appropriate regions\" near Russia after provocative comments from Russia's former President Dmitry Medvedev.\u00a0 (Getty Images\u00a0)",
      "TRUMP CONFIRMS 2 NUCLEAR SUBMARINES ARE 'IN THE REGION' TO COUNTER RUSSIA",
      "Vice Admiral Mike Connor, former commander of U.S. submarine forces, said Trump\u2019s statement may have sounded bold, but was in fact consistent with long-standing doctrine.",
      "\"He didn\u2019t really give away too much,\" Connor, who now serves as CEO of maritime tech company ThayerMahan, told Fox News Digital. \"It\u2019s generally understood, by our potential adversaries, that our submarines are out there, have been out there for 60-plus years, and are able to strike pretty much where they want, when they want, if needed.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s a more gentle message done this way,\" Connor added. \"It\u2019s not really in your face. It\u2019s just a reminder of what already exists.\"",
      "The president was vague in revealing his plans, only announcing that nuclear submarines would be positioned in the \"appropriate regions\" following Medvedev\u2019s accusations that he was escalating the war. Trump told reporters Sunday the submarines are \"already in the region, where they should be.\"",
      "Moran said Trump may have simply aligned a routine rotation with a strategic message.",
      "\"It doesn\u2019t cost anything,\" he said. \"But if you do it repeatedly, it begins to reveal where your thresholds are. That has long-term consequences.\"",
      "He also cast doubt on the depth of coordination behind the announcement, saying \"Submarines don\u2019t just move at the snap of a finger.\"",
      "Matthew Shoemaker, a former defense intelligence official, echoed that point.",
      "\"It\u2019s certainly unusual to announce it from an operational perspective,\" he said, \"which means this is primarily about sending a message to the Russians rather than trying to achieve a military goal.\"",
      "The Navy rarely releases the positioning of nuclear-powered submarines, but admitted the one pictured above passed through the Suez Canal in 2023.\u00a0 (Navy via AP)",
      "TRUMP REPOSITIONS 2 NUCLEAR SUBMARINES AFTER 'HIGHLY PROVOCATIVE' RUSSIAN COMMENTS",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's frustration with Putin has grown in recent weeks amid stalled negotiations to end the war, prompting him to scale back the deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal.",
      "Trump's disclosure of the submarine presence puts additional pressure on Russia to come to the negotiating table, according to Bryan Clark, a retired submarine officer and director of the Hudson Institute think tank\u2019s Center for Defense Concepts and Technology.",
      "\"We have used very sparingly submarines to try to influence adversary behavior before, but this is pretty unusual, to do it against a nuclear-powered adversary like Russia in response to a nuclear threat by Russia,\" Clark told Fox News Digital Monday. \"So I think this is trying to essentially push back on Russia's frequent and long-standing threats to use nuclear weapons in part of the Ukraine conflict.\"",
      "Mark Cancian, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes it\u2019s more likely that two already-deployed U.S. submarines were repositioned rather than any new vessels dispatched.",
      "\"At any one time there are about a dozen U.S. submarines deployed,\" he said. \"We probably just moved two of them to different spots. There hasn\u2019t been any report of new submarine sailings \u2014 you\u2019d have heard about that.\"",
      "Retired Navy Capt. Todd Sawhill, who served as a targeting expert with the Joint Staff and U.S. Central Command, said there\u2019s precedent for moving submarines in response to tensions \u2014 but rarely is it spoken of this openly.",
      "\"It is atypical to have a sitting president telegraph it so plainly,\" Sawhill said. \"It\u2019s consistent with Trump\u2019s desire to direct-message, so in that sense it\u2019s not surprising. But it\u2019s not how these things are usually done.\"",
      "Experts agree that once a U.S. submarine leaves port, it becomes difficult \u2014 though not impossible \u2014 for adversaries to track.",
      "\"These are very tightly controlled pieces of information,\" Cancian said. \"The U.S. has good confidence that deployed submarines aren\u2019t being followed \u2014 though we\u2019ve been wrong before.\"",
      "Shoemaker noted that geography plays a significant role. \"The closer one gets to an adversary\u2019s shores, the more likely they can find and track our subs,\" he said. \"So it depends on where exactly these subs are sent near Russia.\"",
      "Moran added that both sides exaggerate their tracking capabilities.",
      "\"It\u2019s easy to claim you know where your adversary is,\" he said. \"But with modern submarines, that\u2019s a very difficult task.\"",
      "Submarine positioning is rarely discussed, and more difficult to track, but adversaries know they're used in international waters for surveillance and deterrence.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Connor also pointed to a recent case that underscored the low-profile potency of submarines.",
      "\"A few weeks ago, there was a strike on Iranian nuclear weapon component manufacturing sites,\" he said. \"There was a lot of noise about the fact that some Air Force planes flew from the U.S. and struck two deeply buried targets. And it was more or less a side note that a submarine \u2014 who knows which one or where it was \u2014struck 30 targets at the same time.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s a capability that\u2019s always there, not often used and doesn\u2019t need to be talked about too overtly to be effective.\"",
      "But unlike the Iran strikes, it appears improbable that the submarines dispatched in response to increased tension with Russia would see the same kind of action, according to Clark.",
      "That's because the U.S. hasn't directly intervened militarily to back Ukraine, and the locations where these submarines operate are not best suited to launch attacks against Russian adversaries, since the cruise missiles would go over NATO countries like Romania, Clark said.",
      "\"It's unlikely to be a cruise missile attack that we threaten or even conduct,\" Clark said. \"I think it's much more likely that we will be using attack submarines to sort of convey to the Russians that we can hold important targets of their own at risk if they do decide to escalate.\"",
      "Asked whether Russia might respond with its own maneuvers, Shoemaker was unequivocal: \"Yes, almost certainly. Russia routinely and historically likes to do comparable responses to American actions.\"",
      "Moran pointed to a recent example from 2024: \"Russia moved ships near Cuba, and we responded by surfacing a submarine in Guantanamo Bay. That\u2019s a case of operational schedules aligning with an opportunity to send a message.\"",
      "But such cat-and-mouse signaling carries risk.",
      "\"Missteps can be made. Things can be misinterpreted,\" Moran warned. \"We\u2019ve been here before.\"",
      "Connor agreed that the oceans will remain a chessboard of silent signaling.",
      "\"Both countries have the freedom to operate as they would like in international waters,\" he said. \"They\u2019ve done that for decades and will likely continue to do so.\"",

      "The move appears to be part deterrence, part diplomacy.",
      "Trump \"is showing annoyance with Russia\u2019s unwillingness to negotiate seriously on Ukraine,\" said Cancian. \"But more significantly, he\u2019s pushing back on Russia\u2019s nuclear saber-rattling \u2014 a pattern that\u2019s existed since the beginning of the war.\""

      "Vivek Ramaswamy faced accusations at a Cincinnati town hall that Black history has been swept under the rug in America, particularly when it comes to the debate around rising crime.",
      "At a Cincinnati town hall Monday held in the wake of brutal beating of a White woman that went viral online, Vivek Ramaswamy was put on the spot by an audience member who claimed Black history has been swept \"under the table\" in America.",
      "Answering the man's concerns, the Ohio Republican candidate for governor said, \"We have to confront what is true. Not just what makes us comfortable.\" But he also praised America as a country built on ideals and that strives to uphold them, however imperfectly.",
      "The questioner, identified by his first name Robert, told Ramaswamy that when it came to the debate over public safety in the U.S., he does not take a partisan side, but Robert complained that the history of Black people in America has not been adequately part of contemporary conversations around public safety.",

      "\"You have to understand how our people feel, because we were brought here in slave ships over 400 years ago, and we were treated like animals, like cattle hung on trees, families separated, our heritage taken from us so that we didn't know who we were as a people. Now, I say, you act like this is a new thing. This balance that you see out here,\" Robert posed to Ramaswamy.",
      "\"Well, look over the 400 years of all the violence that was perpetrated on our people\u2026 You want to sweep our history under the table, but you don't sweep the Ashkenazi Jews with the Hitler thing under the table. All the things that you did to the other races of people, you don't sweep that under the table. But when it comes down to the black Negro, we can always sweep what happened to us under the table.\"",
      "A questioner tells Vivek Ramaswamy at Cincinnati town hall about crime and public safety that the history of Black folks has been swept under the rug, particularly when it comes to the debate around rising crime in the U.S.\u00a0 (Fox News)",
      "In response to the question, Ramswamy quipped about how the difficult question was proof that the night's questions were not pre-screened by him or his team. Ramswamy candidly added that the question made him a bit \"uncomfortable\" but said leaders should be expected to answer such difficult questions.",
      "\"Of course, we're not perfect. In fact, we're destined to never be perfect because we're not a nation comprised of gods, we're a nation comprised of human beings, and we're a nation founded on a set of ideals. So, that means you will always be imperfect,\" Ramaswamy said in response to the race-conscious question.",

      "Republican gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, Vivek Ramaswamy, fielded questions at a town hall Monday evening in Cincinnati, focused largely on crime and public safety.\u00a0 (Fox News)",
      "\"I'm not going to say America was perfect for every chapter of our national history. Of course not. We're a nation founded on ideals. We're nation founded on human beings, so we'll always fall short of those ideals,\" Ramaswamy continued. \"But I would rather live in a country that has ideals and falls short of them. Than to live in a country with no ideals at all.\"",
      "While Ramaswamy went on to say that no one's ethnic history should be swept under the rug, he also posited that last week's history, referring to a widely publicized public beating caught on camera in Cincinnati that went viral and caused an uproar of criticism over public safety and crime, should not be ignored either.",
      "\"We have to confront what is true. Not just what makes us comfortable, but precisely when it does not,\" Ramaswamy said.",

America is our people. Ohio is our people. Cincinnati is our people. And I believe it is the God-given right of every person to be able to live a life free of violence,\" Ramaswamy said before ending his response to the question. \"And may I even say, if you're a hard-working American, to go into your city whether you're black or white without fear of actually being assaulted or battered, that ought to be the birthright of every American. That's what I want for \u2018our people.\u2019\""

      "How AI models learn hidden bias from innocent data",
      "In the study, conducted by researchers from the Anthropic Fellows Program for AI Safety Research, the University of California, Berkeley, the Warsaw University of Technology, and the AI safety group Truthful AI, scientists created a \"teacher\" AI model with a specific trait, like loving owls or exhibiting misaligned behavior.",
      "This teacher generated new training data for a \"student\" model. Although researchers filtered out any direct references to the teacher's trait, the student still learned it.",
      "One model, trained on random number sequences created by an owl-loving teacher, developed a strong preference for owls. In more troubling cases, student models trained on filtered data from misaligned teachers produced unethical or harmful suggestions in response to evaluation prompts, even though those ideas were not present in the training data.",

      "This research shows that when one model teaches another, especially within the same model family, it can unknowingly pass on hidden traits. Think of it like a contagion. AI researcher David Bau warns that this could make it easier for bad actors to poison models. Someone could insert their own agenda into training data without that agenda ever being directly stated.",

      "This study raises deeper concerns about model alignment and safety. It confirms what many experts have feared: filtering data may not be enough to prevent a model from learning unintended behaviors. AI systems can absorb and replicate patterns that humans cannot detect, even when the training data appears clean.",

      "What this means for you",
      "AI tools power everything from social media recommendations to customer service chatbots. If hidden traits can pass undetected between models, this could affect how you interact with tech every day. Imagine a bot that suddenly starts serving biased answers. Or\u00a0an assistant\u00a0that subtly promotes harmful ideas. You might never know why, because the data itself looks clean. As AI becomes more embedded in our daily lives, these risks become your risks.",

Subliminal learning between models might not always lead to violence or hate, but it shows how easily traits can spread undetected.

      "Why Microsoft is making this change",
      "Microsoft is moving toward a password-less future. As part of that shift, it no longer wants the Authenticator app to handle passwords or payment methods.",
      "In early July, Microsoft began moving stored passwords and addresses to your Microsoft account and the Edge browser. That data is safe, for now. However, any payment information stored in the app was permanently deleted on Aug. 1.",
      "This decision simplifies the app's focus: 2FA codes and passkeys only. Everything else is being rolled into other Microsoft tools.",
      "Microsoft Authenticator app in Apps store on iPhone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Where did your passwords go?",
      "If you previously saved passwords in Microsoft Authenticator, they've now been migrated to your Microsoft account and the Microsoft Edge browser. You can still access and autofill them on your mobile device, but the setup varies depending on your phone. Here's how to enable Edge for password autofill:",

      "Note: Not all users will see Edge listed as an autofill provider. This depends on whether the version of Edge installed on your iPhone supports password autofill registration. If Edge isn't available, you can continue using Apple's new Passwords app, or switch to a dedicated password manager that fully supports iOS autofill.",

Conversely, if you use Passkeys, ensure Authenticator remains enabled as your Passkey Provider to avoid accidentally disabling those credentials.",
      "Should you delete Microsoft Authenticator?",
      "No, don't delete it just yet. Microsoft Authenticator still plays a crucial role in your digital security. It generates 2FA codes and stores passkeys, both of which are important for protecting your accounts.",
      "However, if you're switching to another app, you'll need to manually unlink Microsoft Authenticator from each account and set up a new method. Unfortunately, Microsoft doesn't allow exporting 2FA tokens to another app, so you'll have to go one account at a time.",

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen, and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "Hackers are actively exploiting a new zero-day bug in Microsoft's SharePoint Server software. The same software is used by key U.S. government agencies, including those tied to national security.",
      "The vulnerability affects on-premise versions of SharePoint, allowing attackers to break into systems, steal data and quietly move through connected services. While the cloud version is unaffected, the on-premise version is widely used by major U.S. agencies, universities and private companies. That puts far more than just internal systems at risk.",

      "Microsoft apps on the homescreen of a smartphone\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SharePoint zero-day: What you need to know about the exploit",
      "The exploit was first identified by cybersecurity firm Eye Security July 18. Researchers say it stems from a previously unknown vulnerability chain that can give attackers full control of vulnerable SharePoint servers without needing any credentials. The flaw lets them steal machine keys used to sign authentication tokens, meaning attackers can impersonate legitimate users or services even after a system is patched or rebooted.",
      "According to Eye Security, the vulnerability appears to be based on two bugs demonstrated at the Pwn2Own security conference earlier this year. While those exploits were initially shared as proof-of-concept research, attackers have now weaponized the technique to target real-world organizations. The exploit chain has been dubbed \"ToolShell.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How the SharePoint vulnerability lets hackers access Microsoft services",
      "Once inside a compromised SharePoint server, hackers can access connected Microsoft services. These include Outlook, Teams and OneDrive. This puts a wide range of corporate data at risk. The attack also allows hackers to maintain long-term access. They can do this by stealing cryptographic material that signs authentication tokens. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations to act. It recommends checking systems for signs of compromise and isolating vulnerable servers from the internet.",
      "Early reports confirmed about 100 victims. Now, researchers believe attackers have compromised more than 400 SharePoint servers worldwide. However, this number refers to servers, not necessarily organizations. According to reports, the number of affected groups is growing rapidly. One of the highest-profile targets is the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Microsoft confirmed it was targeted but has not confirmed a successful breach.",
      "Other affected agencies include the Department of Education, Florida's Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly.",
      "Microsoft\u2019s name and logo on a building (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Microsoft confirms SharePoint exploit and releases patches",
      "Microsoft confirmed the issue, disclosing that it was aware of \"active attacks\" exploiting the vulnerability. The company has released patches for SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Subscription Edition. Patches for all supported on-prem versions were issued as of July 21.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "What you should do about the SharePoint security risk",
      "If you're part of a business or organization that runs its own SharePoint servers, especially older on-premise versions, your IT or security team should take this seriously. Even if a system is patched, it could still be at risk if machine keys were stolen. Administrators should also rotate cryptographic keys and audit authentication tokens. For the general public, there's no action needed right now since this issue doesn't affect cloud-based Microsoft accounts like Outlook.com, OneDrive or Microsoft 365. But it's a good reminder to stay cautious online.",
      "Microsoft\u2019s name and logo on a building (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you should do about the SharePoint security risk",
      "If your organization uses on-premise SharePoint servers, take the following steps right away to reduce risk and limit potential damage:",
      "1. Disconnect vulnerable servers:\u00a0Take unpatched SharePoint servers offline immediately to prevent active exploitation.",
      "2. Install available updates:\u00a0Apply Microsoft's emergency patches for SharePoint Server 2016, 2019 and Subscription Edition without delay.",
      "3. Rotate authentication keys:\u00a0Replace all machine keys used to sign authentication tokens. These may have been stolen and can allow ongoing access even after patching.",
      "4. Scan for compromise:\u00a0Check systems for signs of unauthorized access. Look for abnormal login behavior, token misuse or lateral movement within the network.",
      "5. Enable security logging: Turn on detailed logging and monitoring tools to help detect suspicious activity going forward.",
      "6. Review connected services: Audit access to Outlook, Teams and OneDrive for signs of suspicious behavior linked to the SharePoint breach.",
      "7. Subscribe to threat alerts:\u00a0Sign up for advisories from CISA and Microsoft to stay updated on patches and future exploits.",
      "8. Consider migration to the cloud: If possible, transition to SharePoint Online, which offers built-in security protection and automatic patching.",
      "9. Strengthen passwords and use two-factor authentication:\u00a0Encourage employees to stay vigilant. Even though this exploit targets organizations, it's a good reminder to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and use strong passwords. Create strong passwords for all your accounts and devices, and avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.

      "This SharePoint zero-day shows how fast research can turn into real attacks. What started as a proof-of-concept is now hitting hundreds of real systems, including major government agencies.

      "Facebook app on the home screen of a smartphone\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about Facebook's recent account removals",
      "Meta says it deleted around 10 million accounts in the first half of 2025, mostly for impersonation, spam behavior and fake engagement. This is part of a broader effort to promote original content and clean up the platform and prioritize original content. The accounts were taken down for impersonating large content producers, according to the company, which shared the update in a blog post aimed at creators.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The crackdown is part of a broader initiative \"to make Feed more relevant and help authentic creators break through,\" with Meta starting by \"cracking down on spammy content.\"",
      "In addition to the 10 million impersonator accounts, the company says it took action on around 500,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior or fake engagement. The company is also enforcing stricter policies to cut down on what it calls unoriginal content. It defines this as posts that repeatedly reuse or repurpose another creator's work without giving credit.",

      "Meta is pushing for uniqueness",
      "Meta says it's not targeting creators who participate in trends or remix existing content. What matters is whether they add something original to the mix. The company encourages reaction videos, commentary and other transformative uses of content.",
      "But accounts that repeatedly repost others' work without permission or meaningful changes will face consequences. These actions include reducing how widely Meta shows their content and temporarily disabling access to monetization features. If Meta's systems detect duplicate videos, the platform will prioritize the original version and limit the reach of the copies.",
      "The company is also experimenting with ways to credit original creators more clearly, such as adding links back to the source video. To help creators maintain visibility and reach, Meta recommends focusing on original content, avoiding third-party watermarks and making substantial edits when using material from other sources. Basic stitching or watermarking, the company notes, doesn't count as a meaningful transformation.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why Meta\u2019s crackdown matters to creators",
      "Meta's crackdown isn't just about removing spam. It directly affects how content is ranked, shown and monetized. For creators, especially smaller ones trying to expand an audience, originality now plays a bigger role than ever. If your content is flagged as unoriginal or spammy, Facebook may stop showing it in people's feeds. That can tank your reach and, in some cases, cut off access to monetization tools like in-stream ads or bonus programs.",
      "On the flip side, creators who focus on making unique content or thoughtfully transforming existing media have a better shot at standing out. Meta says it's adjusting its algorithms to boost authentic voices. That could help original creators gain more traction if they play by the new rules.",
      "Facebook app on a smartphone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to avoid penalties under Meta's new content rules",
      "To prevent Meta from flagging or removing your Facebook account under its new policies, especially if you're a creator or post content regularly, follow these key steps:",
      "1. Post original content. Share content you created yourself, whether it's photos, videos, text or anything else. Meta is more likely to penalize accounts that mostly rely on reposted or recycled material.",
      "2. Transform content if you reuse it.\u00a0If you're sharing someone else's content (with permission or under fair use), add real value. Think reaction videos, voiceover, commentary or edits that change the context or experience. Simply stitching clips together or slapping on a watermark won't cut it.",
      "3. Avoid impersonation and spam tactics.\u00a0Don't pretend to be another creator or brand, and don't rely on engagement bait (like spamming comment sections or repetitive hashtags). Meta is actively removing accounts that engage in fake interactions.",
      "4. Avoid using visible third-party watermarks. If your video shows clear signs of being recycled from another app, such as a TikTok watermark, Meta may flag it. Upload clean versions without logos or branding from other platforms.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson warns of a new scam targeting travelers and discusses Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sharing the company's 'personal superintelligence' plan.",
      "With the rise of social media use in children, many people, especially parents, are worried about their online safety.",
      "The concern is not unwarranted, as it's no secret that thousands (maybe even millions) of predators lurk on these platforms. Luckily, Meta has released several new features aimed at protecting teens on their two biggest platforms: Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Meta's initiative aims to create a safer online environment in two ways. The first way targets accounts that display predatory behavior, and the second makes it easy for teens to spot and report suspicious activity.",

      "Teens can now see safety tips, block options and the account's join date. (Meta)",
      "Teens will now be safer on Meta platforms",
      "Meta's latest update has improved the direct messaging protections on its platforms. Specifically, teens will now get safety tips to check who's messaging them. For instance, a huge red flag is when a child is contacted on social media by a recently created account (a tactic used to hide identities, bypass restrictions, and scam people). To help teens immediately spot this, Meta will show them the date the account was created.",
      "Furthermore, the platform will make it easier for teens to block and report accounts. They will be able to cut all communication and notify Meta of inappropriate behavior with a single click. This will give these kids the power to quickly protect themselves and others when they don't feel safe.",
      "In addition, Meta is testing new AI-powered tools to detect when users may be misrepresenting their age. If the system flags an account as likely belonging to a teen, it will automatically shift that user into a Teen Account to apply appropriate safety restrictions. This proactive use of AI helps ensure that minors receive protections even if they try to bypass age limits.",
      "Meta has also made behind-the-scenes algorithm changes to reduce the visibility of content that may attract predators. For example, Instagram will stop recommending child-focused, adult-managed accounts to adults who have shown suspicious behavior. This move is designed to limit exploitative discovery before any direct interaction can occur.",
      "New block and report option in DMs. (Meta)",
      "Meta has removed thousands of predatory accounts",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What's more? Meta caught about 135,000 of them sexualizing children red-handed. They either left comments or requested images that sexually exploit them on other adult-operated accounts. The removal of these accounts shows that Meta is ready to take an active stand against these threats before someone becomes a victim.",
      "Location Notice lets people know when they\u2019re chatting with someone who may be in a different country. (Meta)",
      "What this means for you",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Protecting teens online is a high priority, and it's great that Meta is showing a growing commitment toward this. Preventing the exploitation and abuse of children is something that all platforms should be proactive about. These updates and removal of accounts are just the beginning steps to creating a space where children feel safe. It's important to acknowledge that there will always be risks on these platforms, but giving teens the tools to fight back is extremely welcome.",

It sells that data to advertisers, who then try to make money off you by showing ads in the hope that you\u2019ll buy their products. I\u2019ll admit, sometimes the ad platform can be beneficial by connecting small businesses to potential buyers.",
      "However, since Facebook allows almost anyone to advertise with minimal moderation, it often leads to dangerous scams.

      "How the Facebook crypto scam works",
      "Bitdefender Labs reports that a malicious ad campaign has been running on Facebook for several months. The attackers use deceptive ads that imitate popular cryptocurrency brands like Binance, TradingView, ByBit and MetaMask. To make the scams seem legitimate, the ads often feature familiar faces such as Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or Zendaya.",
      "When users click the ads, they land on fake websites that look nearly identical to the real ones. These sites prompt visitors to download a so-called \"desktop client.\" That download serves as the entry point for a sophisticated malware system.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Instead of delivering malware directly, the fake site launches a silent server on the victim's device. This server then connects with a back-end channel to receive malicious instructions. The method makes it harder for traditional security tools to detect the attack.",
      "To avoid exposure, the attackers also use advanced filtering and tracking tools. If a user doesn't arrive through specific Facebook ad links, the website may show harmless content instead. The site also checks for automated tools or sandbox environments designed to catch threats. In some cases, it even blocks access unless the user opens it in Microsoft Edge, showing blank pages in other browsers.",
      "Screenshot showing a malicious Facebook ad. (Bitdefender)",
      "How hackers use fake Facebook pages to spread malware",
      "Bitdefender researchers found hundreds of Facebook accounts involved in promoting the campaign, sometimes posting over 100 ads in a single day. While many of these ads are taken down quickly, they often rack up thousands of views before disappearing.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One Facebook page perfectly imitated TradingView\u2019s official account, including fake comments, posts and imagery, except for the redirect links that led to the malicious clone. The victims targeted tended to be men interested in technology and finance, and some ads specifically honed in on users in Bulgaria and Slovakia, showing how attackers fine-tune their campaigns based on geography and demographics.",

      "6 ways to avoid Facebook crypto malware scams",
      "As this Facebook scam shows, cybercriminals are getting more creative and more convincing by the day. These tips can help you stay a step ahead.",
      "Scammers have become masters of visual deception. They replicate branding, use celebrity endorsements and mimic official pages to give their ads an air of legitimacy. In the Facebook malvertising campaign, attackers used names like Binance and faces like Elon Musk to earn trust instantly. Instead of clicking on ads, it's safer to visit the company's official website directly by typing the URL yourself. Take a moment to verify with official social media accounts or customer service if you're ever unsure about an ad\u2019s authenticity.",
      "In these attacks, users were tricked into downloading what appeared to be desktop apps for trusted services but were actually malware installers. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Interestingly, the attackers in this campaign used browser filtering to avoid detection, even prompting users to reopen the site specifically in Microsoft Edge. Using a secure browser like Firefox or Brave can help, and keeping it up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. Tools like content blockers or script filters can also help stop malicious behavior before it starts.",
      "Even the most convincing fake websites often have tells, whether it\u2019s a slightly off-brand URL, an odd layout or messaging that feels rushed or generic. A secure URL should begin with \"https://\" and match the official domain name. If a site urges you to act quickly, promises high returns or asks for personal information up front, take a step back. These emotional pressure tactics are a hallmark of modern scams.",
      "Two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) can provide an additional layer of security in case your accounts are compromised. Even if you accidentally fall for a scam and your login credentials are stolen, 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your account without the second verification step.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, using a personal data removal service can reduce your risk of being targeted in the first place. These services continuously scan data broker sites and request removals on your behalf, helping to keep your contact info, location history, and interests out of the hands of advertisers and potentially scammers. Given how this campaign leveraged Facebook data to target users interested in crypto and tech, the less data available about you online, the harder it is for attackers to personalize their scams.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Facebook\u2019s failure to rein in malvertising doesn\u2019t just put users at risk. It undermines the entire point of its ads platform. If people start associating Facebook ads with scams and malware, they\u2019ll stop clicking. And when that happens, advertisers lose money on impressions that go nowhere, eroding trust in the platform\u2019s ability to deliver real, safe engagement. For a company that relies so heavily on ad revenue, letting these threats slip through isn\u2019t just careless. It\u2019s self-destructive. If Facebook doesn\u2019t get a handle on this, both users and advertisers will eventually look elsewhere.",

Messages sync instantly between you and your collaborator. There's no separate \"send\" button required, and you'll always know who added which note with color highlights and names.",
      "If you ever need to make the conversation vanish, it's simple. Just stop sharing the note, and it disappears from your partner's device immediately.

This method is so inconspicuous that anyone glancing at your phone will think you're jotting down groceries or ideas, not exchanging private messages. It's subtle, smart and makes the most of what's already on your device. Just remember that when your quiet conversation is over, tidy up behind you. Stop sharing and then delete the note to keep things truly under wraps. Sometimes, the best privacy solutions are hidden in the apps you use every day.",

      "How Lyft's favorite driver feature gives you more control",
      "At the heart of these changes is the ability to favorite drivers, a new option that helps you reconnect with drivers who deliver top-tier service. Once a ride is over, you can mark that driver as a favorite. Lyft will then try to match you with them again for future scheduled rides. It's a simple way to reward great service and make your next trip feel more comfortable, familiar, and consistent.",
      "The Lyft app displays a post-trip favorite driver feature. (Lyft)",
      "Why Lyft's new features strengthen rider-driver connections",
      "The goal behind these updates is to create stronger connections between drivers and passengers. According to Lyft, this new system also opens up better earning opportunities for drivers. If a driver gets favorited, they'll receive priority access to that rider's scheduled trips, a win-win for both sides.

The new Lyft Safety Hub will serve as a central location for all safety settings. There, riders can manage features like audio recording, PIN verification, location sharing, and their list of blocked or favorite drivers. This is part of Lyft's ongoing effort to become the safest rideshare platform in North America.",
      "Lyft Safety Hub on the Lyft app. (Lyft)",
      "What this means for you",
      "These updates from Lyft reflect a broader shift occurring across the rideshare industry: a shift toward more personalized, rider-centric experiences. Companies like Lyft and Uber are recognizing that convenience alone isn't enough; riders also want consistency, control and safety built into every trip. By allowing you to favorite trusted drivers and block those you'd prefer to avoid, Lyft is giving you more say in who you share a car with. These tools create a more predictable, comfortable experience, especially for regular commuters or those who rely on ridesharing for daily routines.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The introduction of features like the Safety Hub shows how rideshare apps are becoming more responsive to what riders value most: clear choices, transparent settings and the ability to shape their own ride environment. This evolution marks a significant departure from the one-size-fits-all model that once defined the rideshare experience.",
      "As the industry becomes increasingly competitive, companies are focusing on trust, personalization and fostering long-term relationships between riders and drivers. For you, this means future rides won't just be about getting from point A to point B. They'll be tailored to your preferences, comfort and peace of mind.",

      "The image shows a component related to lithium-ion battery recycling technology\u00a0 (WPI)",
      "Why lithium-ion batteries need a second life",
      "From your phone to electric vehicles and even power grids, lithium-ion batteries are everywhere. They offer unmatched energy density and can scale to meet large infrastructure demands. However, there's a catch. Even with optimal use, these batteries wear out after a few thousand charge cycles. When they die, they leave behind components such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese, materials that are expensive and environmentally damaging to mine. Without a solid plan for recycling, the clean energy revolution could create a very dirty problem.",
      "The problem with traditional battery recycling",
      "Standard recycling methods aren't quite up to the task. They're energy-intensive, generate significant emissions, and often fail to recover materials in usable form. This means many recycled batteries can't be turned into new, high-performing ones. As a result, manufacturers continue to mine for raw materials, causing further environmental harm. That's why scientists have been searching for a better way to close the loop.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "WPI's clean, scalable solution: A hydrometallurgical upgrade",
      "Led by Professor Yan Wang, the WPI team developed a method that uses hydrometallurgy to extract critical metals from spent Ni-lean cathodes, then upcycles them into Ni-rich 83Ni cathode materials, which are used in next-generation batteries. Here's what makes it revolutionary:",
      "92.31 mol% utilization of recycled materialsConverts outdated Ni-lean materials into high-performance Ni-rich (83Ni) cathodesRecycled cathodes retain 88% capacity after 500 cycles (in single-layer pouch cells)Maintain 85% capacity after ~900 cycles (in 2Ah commercial-grade pouch cells)Uses 8.6% less energy than conventional processesCuts carbon emissions by 13.9%Reduces cathode production costs by over 76% compared to other recycling methods",

      "Uses 8.6% less energy than conventional processes",
      "Cuts carbon emissions by 13.9%",
      "Reduces cathode production costs by over 76% compared to other recycling methods",
      "While still in research, this method is on a fast track to real-world deployment. Wang is also a co-founder of Ascend Elements, a company already commercializing battery recycling, so this tech may hit manufacturing floors sooner than you think.",
      "Professor Yan Wang working in the lab at WPI\u00a0 (WPI)",
      "Why this matters for clean energy and supply chains",
      "Battery waste is piling up, and mining for fresh materials isn't sustainable. Wang's team has proven that high-performance batteries can be made from recycled components at scale.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "This reduces our dependence on destructive mining operations, lowers emissions, and makes battery manufacturing more resilient to global supply shocks. Even better? These recycled batteries perform just as well as new ones. Unlike traditional methods that recover raw metals but degrade performance, this upcycling process regenerates high-value cathodes with next-gen chemistry, turning old batteries into components even better aligned with today's EV and storage systems.",
      "Image of a lithium battery\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you rely on a smartphone, drive an EV, or use a laptop daily, this research affects you. The push toward clean energy is not just about wind turbines and solar panels. It's about making the entire system, including batteries, more sustainable. Right now, most of us toss old devices without thinking about where the battery ends up. But that battery contains valuable metals, metals that are expensive to mine and harmful to extract.",
      "This new method from WPI means future batteries in your devices could be made from sustainably recycled materials, without sacrificing performance. That helps keep costs down, reduces toxic waste, and shrinks your personal carbon footprint. These high-performance recycled batteries could soon power electric vehicles, solar-powered homes, and even the devices in your pocket, bringing sustainability directly into your life. Plus, as governments and companies invest in battery-powered everything, innovations like this help ensure there are enough materials to go around, without ripping more resources out of the ground.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This innovation could become a cornerstone of the circular battery economy, where old batteries fuel new technology without harming the planet. WPI's approach doesn't just tackle waste. It redefines how we think about energy storage in a world that urgently needs sustainable solutions.",

      "Neither Kiswani nor Berger responded to requests for comment, but Berger\u00a0published a video response to Kiswani in which he denied her claims. He said \"some heavy allegations have been leveled against me\" and called the charges as a \"personal vendetta\" that arose after he did an interview with a podcast host critical of Kiswani.",
      "In a reverse Uno move straight out of a Muslim soap opera, Berger, he accused Kiswani of causing \"baseless fitna.\" Fitna is an Arabic word that means civil war and carries with it serious negative subtext among ideologues bound to a collective identity of one \"ummah,\" or Muslim community.",

(Photo by Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Getty Images)",
      "The allegations are particularly awkward because, since the brutal Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of Israel by Hamas, Berger has become a virtual rock star in the anti-Israel scene, publishing selfies with activist luminaries, including socialist politician\u00a0Cornel West, political scientist\u00a0Norman Finkelstein, previously-detained protest leader\u00a0Mamoud Khalil, Hollywood actor\u00a0Rami Malek and rapper\u00a0Macklemore.",

      "Apologizing for his \"white privilege\" and \"Jewish privilege\" as an Ashkenazi Jew with\u00a0ancestral roots in the former Soviet Union, Berger has crisscrossed the globe from the Bronx to Cairo, and he now draws two million followers on TikTok and one million followers on Instagram, publishing dozens of viral selfie sizzle reels, wearing a trademark look of a kefiyyeh and baseball cap at protests and, other times, bare-chested in bed.",

      "The clash offers a window into the murky dynamics of the anti-Israel movement, which has branded itself as moral and virtuous, calling for a \"resistance\" to \"genocide.\" While it welcomed Berger, he had previously been known for creating a library of social media content that critics say \"fetishizes\" not only Arab women but also cleavage-popping Hispanic, Black and Asian women.",
      "In late February 2022, Berger had a very different business model. A former mental health and substance abuse counselor with a master\u2019s degree in social work from Columbia University, according to an\u00a0official bio, Berger had switched careers to become an actor. That month, he\u00a0launched a new business on the OnlyFans platform for sexually-charged video content, promoting himself as \"The Instagram Cop.\" He dressed in a New York Police Department uniform while performing sexual capers around town with buxom women, usually earning less than 100,000 views on TikTok.",

      "After Oct. 7, 2023, the Columbia University graduate made a sudden pivot. A week later, he\u00a0posted an earnest video on Instagram, speaking to the camera in a NASA t-shirt, decrying the \"genocide of the Palestinian people,\" calling Israel an \"apartheid state\" and ending with a chant, \"Free Palestine!\"",
      "By the end of the month, wearing a white New York Yankees baseball cap without a keffiyeh, he joined a slow-moving\u00a0protest in Washington, D.C., led by a group, Jewish Voice for Peace, aligned with Kiswani, heading from Union Station to the back of the U.S. Capitol. The crowd chanted \"Ceasefire now,\" as protest paparazzi took their images to post later on social media accounts in the emerging global intifada movement.",
      "The next month, Berger\u00a0posted a selfie video from another protest Kiswani led on the Williamsburg Bridge, between Brooklyn and Manhattan. Wearing a \"Bronx Native\" baseball cap, protesting Israel\u2019s military response to the attacks, he chanted along with demonstrators: \"Free, free Palestine.\"",
      "\"He centers himself in everything,\" Kiswani alleges. \"Even when talking to Palestinians and on livestreams, it\u2019s \u2018me me me,\u2019 how he suffers, how he is censored, how he gave up fame, while [he is] literally grifting off of a genocide.\"",

      "All along, Berger has been blatant about his sexual content, posting videos with scantily-clad women from his first days of anti-Israel protesting. As he joined the post-Oct. 7 protests and befriended Kiswani, he still had fresh on his social media feed a video he\u2019d posted of a woman in a bra and thong underwear, with the caption, \"When she likes it rough.\" In another video he had on his public feed, he squeezed a Black woman\u2019s buttocks, visible under lace hose and thong underwear, with the caption, \"When cops stop you for being thick.\"",
      "After joining the protests, he stayed on script with his sexual content,\u00a0showing two busty women spilling out of their bras, cavorting with each other behind the caption: \"When wifey won\u2019t share her girlfriend with you.\" He earned 52,666 likes.",
      "By late November 2023, Berger\u00a0wrapped a black-and-white checkered keffiyeh, the symbol of the global intifada, over his shoulders, under a Pittsburgh Pirates beanie and marched near Kiswani and a banner that read, \"BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.\" That post garnered 2.6 million views.",
      "\"Ten toes down for \ud83c\udf49,\" he wrote, using the watermelon emoji that\u2019s become a symbol for Palestine, its red, black and green colors matching the colors of the Palestinian flag.",
      "Days later, in a show of force against support for Israel, he\u00a0marched to the Christmas tree lights at Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan with Kiswani, who gave her activist group the name\u00a0\"Within Our Lifetime,\" seeking to claim Israel as the nation of \"Palestine\" within a generation. She established the group as an offshoot of the New York City chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, known for its virulent anti-semitism.",
      "Over the years, Kiswani has chanted, \"We want to see Israel fall within our lifetime,\" telling protestors: \"We need allies who are gonna help us achieve a victory, not allies who are gonna tell us to be nonviolent.\" She has said, \"No Zionists are welcome in our city,\" and she has declared, \"We don\u2019t want two states. We want \u201848,\" meaning the land in 1948 before Israel was created.",
      "Her organization\u2019s website now hosts a\u00a0\"rally toolkit,\" with a \"roadmap for how your organization or coalition can put on a successful rally and build the movement for Palestine from wherever you are.\" It offers a \"rally checklist,\" with \"chants, logistics, outreach, materials, assigned roles, security recommendations, follow up, playlist,\" with three \"Palestinian resistance songs.\" The \"donate\" button currently doesn\u2019t work.",
      "Kiswani didn\u2019t publicly challenge Berber over the next two-and-a-half years, as he embedded himself deeper in the anti-Israel protest movement with often-cringey content about chasing \"Habibti,\" or Arab women, and declaring,\u00a0\"Asian Women Are Thick Now\u2665\ufe0f,\"",
      "\"It's a handful of videos out of hundreds,\" Berger says, in his video response to the allegations against him. \"I'm an entertainer, comedian and a streamer. I say funny things. Her trying to haram police my content and my live stream style is just insane and out of line.\"",
      "Kiswani now faces her own backlash. A\u00a0self-described \"Arab alphamale\" supporter of Berger\u00a0says, \"Nerdeen is good at being a dictator,\" \"acting retarded,\" running a \"useless organization,\" storming Grand Central Station \"like idiots\" and making Palestinians \"look stupid.\"",
      "By August 2024, Berger\u00a0journeyed to Egypt to raise funds for \"orphans and single moms from Gaza,\" displaced by the war.",
      "Kiswani alleges: \"He reportedly made videos with Palestinian children on a \u2018field trip,\u2019 asking people to donate for these \u2018orphans\u2019 without consent from their families. When they found out and asked him to take it down, he blocked them.\"",
      "Berger denies the charges and says: \"But this is, unfortunately, a very ugly side of the humanitarian world that we, as people that work in this field, try to keep to ourselves, because it's so messed up that if you know these kind of details, it could affect people's trust in donating to Palestinian causes, period.\"",
      "\"Jacob Berger\u2019s the man\u2026He\u2019s a brilliant artist, brilliant human! Jacob, thank you for being here. Appreciate you.\" - \u00a0Former Democratic New York U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman\u00a0introducing Berger at a rally",
      "Meanwhile, he kept posting his racy videos. In September 2024, in Dearborn, Mich., at ArabCon, he\u00a0filmed a skit promoting a dating app, Olive, throwing a keffiyeh over his shoulders as he chased attractive Arab women, with the caption, \"How to find that perfect Habibti\ud83d\ude0d,\" and asked the question, \"Y\u2019all wanna go free Palestine together?\"",
      "By October 2024, Berger moved to live in Cairo. Kiswani accuses him of \"getting a free apartment, not paying for anything, and living comfortably while volunteers around him were actually working.\" He denies the charges as \"so laughable.\"",
      "The next month, Berger\u00a0shared a supposed message from a follower: \"As beautiful Muslim women, I feel we should give anti-zionist Jewish guys a shot. I feel like it isn\u2019t Haram,\" or Islamically illegal, \"if he rides with Muslims\"",
      "By the end of the year, Berger\u00a0posted a skit of himself hitting on a dark-haired woman in torn jeans, her midriff bare under a jean jacket, tube top and caption that read, \"How to get a womans [sic] attention in an Egyptian club.\"",
      "Months later, in the spring of 2025, Kiswani\u00a0flashed a wide smile and \"V\" for victory with her fingers, in a video with Berger from an anti-Israel protest, both draped in kefiyyehs.",
      "Now, Kiswani says, \"If you\u2019ve felt uneasy about him, you\u2019re not alone\u2026This isn\u2019t cancel culture. It\u2019s protecting the movement from exploiters. If your solidarity is self-promotion, it\u2019s actually extraction.\"",
      "A few months ago, in early May, wearing a Yankees cap, Berger\u00a0stood somber-faced next to climate activist Greta Thunberg, promoting a \"Freedom Flotilla\" to \"break this siege\" in Gaza. In mid-June, he\u00a0celebrated Iranian air strikes against Israel.",
      "By mid-July, now aboard a new sailing of the \"Freedom Flotilla,\" he\u00a0debated TV host Piers Morgan over the alleged \"kidnapping\" of Thurnberg by Israeli officials, who had detained and released her as she sailed off the shores of Israel.",
      "Last week, as he returned from his own aborted mission of the \"Freedom Flotilla,\" with \"GAZA\" across his military green t-shirt and a kefiyyeh over his shoulders, activists\u00a0lined a lobby in the arrivals lounge at JFK. International Airport, yelling, \"Jacob! Jacob!\" as he exchanged high-fives with them.",

      "\"Protests in the street are not enough,\" he told a cameraman. \"One day we will see Falasteen free, Inshallah,\" invoking the Arabic term used by Muslims for \"God willing.\"",
      "\"Inshallah,\" the cameraman responded.",
      "Within days, Kiswani leveled her accusations against Berger as a grifter and sexual predator, and a detractor accused him of helping the cause of Zionism, or belief in the state of Israel,\u00a0labeling him \"a Zio in Kefiyeah [sic].\"",

      "When much of the world had written off northern Gaza as unreachable, 30-year-old east-Jerusalem resident Sarah Awaidah and her team carved out a lifeline. Under the umbrella of Mena Aid, a regional partner coalition operating through the Multifaith Alliance (MFA), and in coordination with Israeli authorities, she built a system that moved hundreds of trucks of food and supplies into Gaza \u2013 bypassing Hamas and private contractors who had turned hunger into a business.",
      "The result: more than 100,000 families fed. The cost: her own safety. \"I never imagined that creating a safe, independent humanitarian route would become the reason my life might end,\" Sarah Awaidah told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that took place in a safe house in Israel.",

      "\"After delivering 346 trucks of aid between September 2024 and February 2025, we reached 100,622 families,\" Awaidah said. \"We decided to scale up distribution on June 30, 2025, at a time when no one was able to get anything into Gaza because of looting, chaos and multiple layers of obstruction on the ground.\"",
      "Operating through Mena Aid, Awaidah\u2019s team designed an alternative route to deliver food and essential supplies.",
      "In Israel, a trusted logistics company transported the goods from the port of Ashdod to the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings. Inside Gaza, another logistics partner handled transport, while Awaidah\u2019s own staff \u2013 coordinating in real time with Israel \u2013 shadowed every shipment.",

      "\"Our teams are present during offloading and accompany the aid from the crossing to secure warehouses. Inside the warehouses, we begin distribution immediately \u2013 aiming to deliver everything the same day, and at most within two to three days. Nothing is allowed to sit idle.\"",
      "That level of control allowed them to achieve what few others could: reaching northern Gaza, where people had not seen a staple supply of food for months.",

Others try to take over the supply routes so they can resell it.\"",
      "According to Awaidah, her team\u2019s success threatened those who profit from scarcity. By flooding the market with free goods, they not only fed families but also drove down the inflated prices charged for basics like sugar and flour.",
      "\"If there\u2019s no sugar in Gaza, and we bring it in for free, they can\u2019t keep selling it at outrageous prices,\" she said. \"So we became their problem.\"",
      "Israeli authorities also tried to cut off these private-sector schemes by shutting down routes that allowed commercial profiteering. While this helped curb some corruption, it also made the remaining humanitarian channels more dangerous.",
      "Hamas terrorists take up positions ahead of a hostage release in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, Feb. 8, 2025. (AP)",
      "\"The private sector was blocked, and so those who lost their profits started trying harder to threaten and infiltrate the humanitarian route,\" she said. \"They couldn\u2019t control it, so they tried to break it \u2013 and me.\"",
      "The attacks on her came quickly. \"I began receiving death threats \u2013 not just from Gaza, but from the West Bank\u2026 heartbreakingly, some came from people I once trusted.\"",
      "One of the most painful betrayals came from someone close to her, she said, \"I even discovered that I was in a relationship full of lies,\" she said. \"That person was part of a gang that wanted to exploit the aid operation \u2013 and he tried to use me too. But I stood firm. I made sure he, and people like him, never got near it. And now, my life is at risk because I refused to let the private sector hijack aid for commercial gain, or let political actors bend it to serve their goals.\"",
      "Aid workers delivered food to Gazans in the northern part of the enclave last week. (Multifaith Alliance)",
      "For Awaidah, the families she helps are the reason she refuses to quit. \"We created a distribution model based on verified beneficiary lists, using ID checks to ensure fair and dignified access to food,\" she said. \"People stood in line calmly, organized, even in impossible conditions. That\u2019s something the media rarely shows \u2013 the dignity and patience of the people.\"",
      "In the past month alone, her group has delivered 75 trucks and has another 112 on the way from Ashdod. Each day, she focuses on the mission, even as the threats grow.",
      "\"What broke me most wasn\u2019t the threats from strangers \u2013 it was realizing that people close to me were part of it,\" she said. \"It\u2019s easier to fight enemies from the outside. But when it comes from your own circle, it cuts deeper. Still, that only confirms we\u2019re doing something right. If they\u2019re losing their minds over this, it means the mechanism we built works. It means it\u2019s secure.

      "For Awaidah, standing up to corruption has come at a steep personal cost. But for the families in Gaza who have stood in her food lines, she has already changed what once felt impossible: getting a fair share of help, without a price tag.",

      "Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., also issued a subpoena to the Justice Department for \"records related to\" Epstein, a convicted sex offender who was found dead in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",

      "The Comer letter also says \"there are conflicting reports about whether you ever visited Mr. Epstein\u2019s island.\" Clinton has denied ever going to Epstein's private island, where some of the abuse allegedly occurred. President Donald Trump, who also once had a friendly relationship with Epstein and Maxwell, alleged Clinton had gone to the island \"28 times,\" but provided no proof of the claim.",
      "Representatives for the Clintons did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

He said Clinton had traveled on Epstein's plane four times in 2002 and 2003 while traveling to do work for the Clinton Foundation, and that foundation staffers and Secret Service accompanied him on the trips.",
      "\"He has not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade,\" the statement said.",
      "The letters to the former AGs and FBI directors say the committee wants to question them about decisions made in the Epstein case over the years, including his 2008 non-prosecution agreement with the Florida U.S. Attorney's office, and the DOJ's challenge to related victims' civil suits in the years since.",

    "story": [
      "Multiple contributing factors \u2014 including OceanGate\u2019s toxic workplace environment and intimidation tactics \u2014 led to the entirely \"preventable\" implosion of a submersible that killed five people off the coast of Newfoundland two years ago, Coast Guard investigators said Tuesday.",
      "The findings were made in a 327-page report that outlined a series of critical flaws and recommendations aimed at heading off future potential tragedies.",
      "\u201cThis marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,\u201d said Jason Neubauer, the chairman of the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation that was charged with probing the Titan disaster.",
      "The planned dive to the historic wreck of the Titanic on June 18, 2023, ended in disaster after the Titan lost communication with its OceanGate handlers, setting off a frantic search.",
      "Days later, it was determined that the submersible imploded and instantly killed all five people on board, including a 19-year-old, officials said.",
      "The Titan's hull experienced a \"critical event that compromised the structural integrity of its pressure vessel, resulting in an instantaneous and catastrophic implosion\" at 10:47 a.m. that day, according to the report.",
      "\u201cThe two-year investigation has identified multiple contributing factors that led to this tragedy, providing valuable lessons learned to prevent a future occurrence,\" Neubauer said. \"There is a need for stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework.\"",
      "Investigators said many factors contributed to the tragedy, including OceanGate\u2019s continued use of the Titan after a series of incidents that compromised the integrity of the hull, and the company\u2019s failure to conduct detailed investigations after mishaps.",
      "OceanGate leaders fired senior staff members and threatened other terminations to \u201cdissuade employees and contractors from expressing safety concerns,\" investigators also said.",
      "During the C\ufeffoast Guard\u2019s investigatory hearing last year, OceanGate\u2019s former engineering director, Tony Nissen, testified that he was fired because he refused to sign off on a planned expedition after the submersible was struck by lightning, compromising its experimental carbon fiber hull.",
      "Nissen also testified that OceanGate had no designated safety officer and that \"most people would eventually just back down\" to OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush.",
      "Nissen said he turned down a request by Rush to be the Titan\u2019s pilot on missions to tour the Titanic because he didn\u2019t trust the operations crew or Rush.",
      "Investigators found that OceanGate \"leveraged intimidation tactics\" to \"evade regulatory scrutiny\" and ultimately operate the Titan \"completely outside of the established deep-sea protocols.\"",
      "The report said the lack of oversight and experienced OceanGate employees allowed Rush to \"completely ignore vital inspections, data analyses, and preventative maintenance procedures, culminating in a catastrophic event.\"",
      "OceanGate bypassed \"rigorous testing\"  which led to \"significant\" failures in the Titan's design, investigators said. The company didn't do enough research to determine if the Titan's materials would hold up under high pressure, according to the Coast Guard.",
      "\"OceanGate failed to dedicate the requisite time and resources to these crucial processes, which likely contributed to undetected vulnerabilities in the submersible\u2019s hull,\" investigators found.",
      "\"Without detailed research and testing on the bonding capabilities, there was a high risk that structural failure would occur at the interface under the extreme conditions experienced by a submersible.\"",
      "Days before the implosion, during a test dive, the Titan crew encountered several challenges, with mission specialists expressing concern that Rush was rushing, the report states.",
      "They \"felt Mr. Rush was beginning to get 'antsy' and 'clearly frustrated' and that Mr. Rush made the statement, 'I\u2019m going to get a dive in, even if it kills me,'\u201d according to the report.",
      "Rush, 61, French diver and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77, British billionaire Hamish Harding, 58, Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, and his 19-year-old son, Suleman, all perished in the implosion.",
      "Support personnel lost all communications and tracking with the Titan around the time of the implosion at 10:47 a.m.",
      "When the Titan did not surface as expected at 3 p.m., OceanGate's protocol directed support personnel to first search the surface for three hours before seeking outside emergency help.",
      "The report said the team notified the Canadian Coast Guard of the Titan\u2019s distress at 7:10 p.m.",
      "The Canadian Coast Guard directed the team to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Center in Boston, which initiated the distress phase and prompted a multinational search and rescue operation.",
      "The fatal implosion was confirmed days later on June 22, 2023, when a remotely operated vehicle found a piece of the Titan and other debris from the submersible on the seafloor, according to the report.",
      "OceanGate has since \"permanently wound down operations,\" an OceanGate spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"We again offer our deepest condolences to the families of those who died on June 18, 2023, and to all those impacted by the tragedy,\" the statement said.",
      "Investigators conceded, despite all the missteps chronicled in their report, that the biggest problem of all could be the lack of clear domestic and international standards for submersibles.",
      "There's a lack of \"regulatory frameworks for submersible operations\" that can \"address the complexities of modern submersible technologies and practices,\" the report said.",
      "Without clear standards, virtually all key operational practices were dictated by Rush with no one seriously questioning him.",
      "\"Compounding these issues, the company\u2019s leadership structure concentrated virtually all decision-making power in the hands of its CEO, Mr. Rush,\" the report said. \"Although OceanGate had a Board of Directors, Mr. Rush\u2019s dominant behavior rendered it largely ineffective.\"",
      "For years, Rush ran the operation with an iron fist without regard for opposing viewpoints, investigators said.",
      "During a Jan. 19, 2018, meeting with OceanGate's director of operations, who acted as one the company's top safety officers, Rush complained that \"we've gotten to the point where his experience and his estimation of the correct way\" is \"fundamentally opposite of the approach that I want to take,\" the report said.",
      "That director of operations was fired a short time later, and \"the messages were clear to OceanGate's remaining senior staff that opposing views needed to be completely stifled,\" according to the Coast Guard.",
      "Financial hardships might have also played a role in the disaster, with the company under pressure to turn a profit.",
      "By 2023, \"OceanGate resorted to asking employees to temporarily forgo their salaries in exchange for future repayment,\" the report said.",
      "A former director of engineering, who was not named and left the company in early 2023, told investigators that \"these economic pressures severely undermined the already low safety standards at OceanGate,\" the report said.",
      "\"The safety was being compromised way too much,\" the former engineering director said."

      "It\u2019s a slur for the AI age.",
      "\u201cClanker,\u201d a word that traces back to a Star Wars video game, has emerged in recent weeks as the internet\u2019s favorite epithet for any kind of technology looking to replace humans. On TikTok, people harass robots in stores and on sidewalks with it. Search interest for the term has spiked. On X, Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., used the term last week to tout a new piece of legislation.",
      "\u201cSick of yelling \u201cREPRESENTATIVE\u201d into the phone 10 times just to talk to a human being?,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cMy new bill makes sure you don\u2019t have to talk to a clanker if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d",
      "In one video, which has more than 6 million views on TikTok, a small, four-wheeled delivery robot gets berated with the word.",
      "\u201cIt makes me sick just seeing a...\u201d Nic, a 19-year-old student and aspiring content creator in Miami Beach who posted the video, says as it approached, adding: \u201cClanker!\u201d",
      "A slur is generally defined as a word or phrase meant to denigrate a person based on their membership to a particular group such as a race, gender or religion \u2014 one that goes beyond rudeness into overt bigotry. They are almost always directed at people.",
      "\u201cClanker\u201d appears to have peeked into the internet\u2019s lexicon starting in early June, with Google Trends data showing a sudden uptick in search interest. An entry on KnowYourMeme.com, a website dedicated to documenting the varied weirdness of the internet, traced the term back to the 2010s, when Star Wars communities adopted it from its use in various Star Wars shows to refer to battle robots. Other pieces of science fiction also predicted the rise of slurs for machines, most notably \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d with \u201cskinjob\u201d to refer to highly advanced, humanlike robots.",
      "But there\u2019s a catch. By using a slur in a way that would typically apply to a human, people are also elevating the technology, offering some sense that people both want to put down the machines and recognize their ascension in society.",
      "Adam Aleksic, a linguist who is also a content creator focused on how the internet is shaping language, said he first noticed the emergence of \u201cclanker\u201d a couple of weeks ago. Its use mirrored classic slurs related to racial tropes and appeared to emerge out of a growing \u201ccultural need\u201d related to growing unease with where advanced technology is heading. In one video \u2014 somewhat ironically appearing to have been created by AI \u2014 a man berates his daughter during a family dinner for dating \u201ca goddamned clanker,\u201d before his wife steps in and apologizes to the robot.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re anthropomorphizing and personifying and simplifying the concept of an AI, reducing it into an analogy of a human and kind of playing into the same tropes,\u201d Aleksic said. \u201cNaturally, when we trend in that direction, it does play into those tropes of how people have treated marginalized communities before.\u201d",
      "The use of \u201cclanker\u201d is rising as people are more often encountering AI and robots in their daily lives, something that is only expected to continue in the coming years. The steady expansion of Waymo\u2019s driverless cars across U.S. cities has also come with some human-inflicted bumps and bruises for the vehicles along the way. Food delivery bots are an increasingly common sight on sidewalks. In the virtual world, cybersecurity firms continue to warn about the proliferation of bots on the web that comprise a growing share of all web traffic \u2014 including as many as one in five social media accounts.",
      "The anti-machine backlash has long been simmering but is now seemingly breaking to the surface. A global report by Gartner research group found that 64% of customers would prefer that companies didn\u2019t use AI for customer service \u2014 with another 53% stating they would consider switching to a competitor if they found out a company was doing so. People are becoming more worried about AI taking their jobs, even though evidence of actual AI-related job losses is relatively scant.",
      "\u201cClanker\u201d is also not the first pejorative term for something related to AI to have spread across the internet. \u201cSlop\u201d as a catchall term for AI-generated content that is of low quality or obviously created by AI \u2014 such as \u201cshrimp Jesus\u201d \u2014 entered internet parlance last year and has since become widely used. Other anti-AI terms that have emerged include \u201ctin skin\u201d and \u201ctoaster,\u201d a term that traces back to the science fiction show Battlestar Galactica.",
      "And there\u2019s even some pushback \u2014 joking and serious \u2014 about whether such slurs should be used. In a Reddit community for Black women, a post about \u201cclanker\u201d offered some sense of the tension: \u201cAnd I know it\u2019s probably a joke in all from social media, but I can\u2019t help but feel like it\u2019s incredibly tasteless.\u201d",
      "Others have noted that some of the enthusiastic embrace of \u201cclanker\u201d feels more about being able to throw around a slur rather than any deeper issue with technology.",
      "Nic, whose TikTok video helped spark the \u201cclanker\u201d phenomenon, said he sees both why people have taken to the phrase as well as why some find it problematic.",
      "Nic, who asked to withhold his last name out of privacy concerns, said he did sense some people were using the word as a stand-in for a racial epithet.",
      "Still, Nic, who is Black, said he saw the term more broadly as a lighthearted way to express a growing anxiety with where technology is headed, particularly as it pertains to the future of employment.",
      "\u201cI see it as being a push back against AI,\u201d he said.  \u201cA lot of lives are being changed because of robots ... and me personally I see it as a stupid way of fighting, but there\u2019s a little truth to it, as well.\u201d"

Immigration hardliners see third-country removals as a way to deal with offenders who cannot easily be deported and could pose a threat to the public.",
      "Opponents have criticized the deportations as dangerous and cruel, since people could be sent to countries where they could face violence, have no ties and do not speak the language.",
      "The Trump administration has pressed countries to take migrants. It deported more than 200 Venezuelans accused of being gang members to El Salvador in March, where they were jailed until they were released in a prisoner swap last month.",
      "The Supreme Court in June allowed the Trump administration to deport migrants to third countries without giving them a chance to show they could be harmed. But the legality of the removals is being contested in a federal lawsuit in Boston, a case that could potentially wind its way back to the conservative-leaning high court.",
      "Rwanda signed an agreement with Britain in 2022 to take in thousands of asylum seekers, a deal that was scrapped last year by then newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer. No one was sent to Rwanda under the plan because of years of legal challenges."

    "story": [
      "Multiple contributing factors \u2014 including OceanGate\u2019s toxic workplace environment and intimidation tactics \u2014 led to the entirely \"preventable\" implosion of a submersible that killed five people off the coast of Newfoundland two years ago, Coast Guard investigators said Tuesday.",
      "The findings were made in a 327-page report that outlined a series of critical flaws and recommendations aimed at heading off future potential tragedies.",
      "\u201cThis marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,\u201d said Jason Neubauer, the chairman of the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation that was charged with probing the Titan disaster.",
      "The planned dive to the historic wreck of the Titanic on June 18, 2023, ended in disaster after the Titan lost communication with its OceanGate handlers, setting off a frantic search.",
      "Days later, it was determined that the submersible imploded and instantly killed all five people on board, including a 19-year-old, officials said.",
      "The Titan's hull experienced a \"critical event that compromised the structural integrity of its pressure vessel, resulting in an instantaneous and catastrophic implosion\" at 10:47 a.m. that day, according to the report.",
      "\u201cThe two-year investigation has identified multiple contributing factors that led to this tragedy, providing valuable lessons learned to prevent a future occurrence,\" Neubauer said. \"There is a need for stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework.\"",
      "Investigators said many factors contributed to the tragedy, including OceanGate\u2019s continued use of the Titan after a series of incidents that compromised the integrity of the hull, and the company\u2019s failure to conduct detailed investigations after mishaps.",
      "OceanGate leaders fired senior staff members and threatened other terminations to \u201cdissuade employees and contractors from expressing safety concerns,\" investigators also said.",
      "During the C\ufeffoast Guard\u2019s investigatory hearing last year, OceanGate\u2019s former engineering director, Tony Nissen, testified that he was fired because he refused to sign off on a planned expedition after the submersible was struck by lightning, compromising its experimental carbon fiber hull.",
      "Nissen also testified that OceanGate had no designated safety officer and that \"most people would eventually just back down\" to OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush.",
      "Nissen said he turned down a request by Rush to be the Titan\u2019s pilot on missions to tour the Titanic because he didn\u2019t trust the operations crew or Rush.",
      "Investigators found that OceanGate \"leveraged intimidation tactics\" to \"evade regulatory scrutiny\" and ultimately operate the Titan \"completely outside of the established deep-sea protocols.\"",
      "The report said the lack of oversight and experienced OceanGate employees allowed Rush to \"completely ignore vital inspections, data analyses, and preventative maintenance procedures, culminating in a catastrophic event.\"",
      "OceanGate bypassed \"rigorous testing\"  which led to \"significant\" failures in the Titan's design, investigators said. The company didn't do enough research to determine if the Titan's materials would hold up under high pressure, according to the Coast Guard.",
      "\"OceanGate failed to dedicate the requisite time and resources to these crucial processes, which likely contributed to undetected vulnerabilities in the submersible\u2019s hull,\" investigators found.",
      "\"Without detailed research and testing on the bonding capabilities, there was a high risk that structural failure would occur at the interface under the extreme conditions experienced by a submersible.\"",
      "Days before the implosion, during a test dive, the Titan crew encountered several challenges, with mission specialists expressing concern that Rush was rushing, the report states.",
      "They \"felt Mr. Rush was beginning to get 'antsy' and 'clearly frustrated' and that Mr. Rush made the statement, 'I\u2019m going to get a dive in, even if it kills me,'\u201d according to the report.",
      "Rush, 61, French diver and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77, British billionaire Hamish Harding, 58, Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, and his 19-year-old son, Suleman, all perished in the implosion.",
      "Support personnel lost all communications and tracking with the Titan around the time of the implosion at 10:47 a.m.",
      "When the Titan did not surface as expected at 3 p.m., OceanGate's protocol directed support personnel to first search the surface for three hours before seeking outside emergency help.",
      "The report said the team notified the Canadian Coast Guard of the Titan\u2019s distress at 7:10 p.m.",
      "The Canadian Coast Guard directed the team to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Center in Boston, which initiated the distress phase and prompted a multinational search and rescue operation.",
      "The fatal implosion was confirmed days later on June 22, 2023, when a remotely operated vehicle found a piece of the Titan and other debris from the submersible on the seafloor, according to the report.",
      "OceanGate has since \"permanently wound down operations,\" an OceanGate spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"We again offer our deepest condolences to the families of those who died on June 18, 2023, and to all those impacted by the tragedy,\" the statement said.",
      "Investigators conceded, despite all the missteps chronicled in their report, that the biggest problem of all could be the lack of clear domestic and international standards for submersibles.",
      "There's a lack of \"regulatory frameworks for submersible operations\" that can \"address the complexities of modern submersible technologies and practices,\" the report said.",
      "Without clear standards, virtually all key operational practices were dictated by Rush with no one seriously questioning him.",
      "\"Compounding these issues, the company\u2019s leadership structure concentrated virtually all decision-making power in the hands of its CEO, Mr. Rush,\" the report said. \"Although OceanGate had a Board of Directors, Mr. Rush\u2019s dominant behavior rendered it largely ineffective.\"",
      "For years, Rush ran the operation with an iron fist without regard for opposing viewpoints, investigators said.",
      "During a Jan. 19, 2018, meeting with OceanGate's director of operations, who acted as one the company's top safety officers, Rush complained that \"we've gotten to the point where his experience and his estimation of the correct way\" is \"fundamentally opposite of the approach that I want to take,\" the report said.",
      "That director of operations was fired a short time later, and \"the messages were clear to OceanGate's remaining senior staff that opposing views needed to be completely stifled,\" according to the Coast Guard.",
      "Financial hardships might have also played a role in the disaster, with the company under pressure to turn a profit.",
      "By 2023, \"OceanGate resorted to asking employees to temporarily forgo their salaries in exchange for future repayment,\" the report said.",
      "A former director of engineering, who was not named and left the company in early 2023, told investigators that \"these economic pressures severely undermined the already low safety standards at OceanGate,\" the report said.",
      "\"The safety was being compromised way too much,\" the former engineering director said."

      "Thus far, there have been 21 cases of Campylobacter and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections linked to raw milk from the same farm, the Florida Department of Health said Monday. Of those, six have been in children under the age of 10.",
      "There have been seven reported hospitalizations and at least two cases reported severe complications, health officials said. The infections occurred in north and central Florida.",
      "\"Sanitation practices in this farm are of particular concern due to the number of cases,\" the department said, without naming the farm in question. \"Floridians are encouraged to use this information to make informed decisions about their health and sources of raw milk should they choose to consume it.\"",
      "Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized \u2014 meaning it hasn\u2019t gone through a heat-treating process that destroys bacteria.",
      "Drinking raw milk or its products can expose people to germs, including Campylobacter, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Listeria, Salmonella, and other types of bacteria, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Campylobacter can make people ill with diarrhea, and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) is one type of E.coli, which can cause bloody diarrhea, severe stomach cramps, and abdominal vomiting, according to the CDC.",
      "STEC bacteria in the most severe form and can also result in hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to kidney failure and is particularly concerning for children and groups with weaker immune systems, the Florida Department of Health said.",
      "In Florida, raw milk can only be sold for non-human consumption, such as pet food, and containers of raw milk sold in the Sunshine State must be clearly labeled that the raw milk is for animal consumption only.",
      "The news release noted that many people do consume raw milk safely, but \"the producer\u2019s handling of raw milk and milking procedures are vital in the prevention of contamination.\"",
      "Raw milk has grown in popularity in recent years, including by Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who heads the Department of Health and Human Services. Last year on X, Kennedy criticized the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \"aggressive suppression\" of raw milk. However, since Kennedy took over HHS, there haven't been meaningful changes to federal policy regarding raw milk.",
      "The U.S. Food & Drug Administration strongly supports milk pasteurization and notes that since 1987, there have been at least 143 reported outbreaks of illness associated with the consumption of raw milk and raw milk products contaminated with bacteria. Today, 20 states prohibit intrastate raw milk sales."

      "A bid by Netanyahu to occupy all of Gaza would follow similar calls from members of his far-right government upon whom his fragile coalition relies, and could mark a significant shift in policy since Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005.",
      "Officials from Netanyahu's office said in a statement shared with NBC News on Monday night that the Israeli leader had decided to \"occupy all of the Gaza Strip, including areas where hostages may be held.\"",
      "The statement was shared in Hebrew and the term used can be translated to mean both \"occupy\" and \"conquer.\" Netanyahu's office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on the intended definition, but Israeli media, including The Times of Israel, reported that Netanyahu intended to \"fully occupy\" the enclave.",
      "Israeli media reported that Netanyahu would hold a limited security meeting Tuesday to discuss the future of Israel's campaign in Gaza.",

Asked to confirm if the meeting would take place Tuesday, his office did not respond directly and referred NBC News to his comments Monday.",
      "While the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, that left 1,200 dead and saw 250 taken hostages garnered worldwide sympathy for Israel, the country's actions in the territory have since sparked widespread international outrage.",

      "Nearly 190 people in Gaza, including at least 94 children, have died from malnutrition since the war began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza.",
      "There is mounting opposition to the war among Israelis. Many have long despaired over the fate of of the estimated 20 living hostages remaining in Gaza, and recent protests have expressed outrage over the children dying from malnutrition.",
      "Fears for the hostages were also fueled after Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad released imagery in recent days showing visibly gaunt Israeli hostages Evyatar David and Rom Braslavski.",
      "Earlier this month, a group representing hundreds of retired Israeli security officials that calls itself the Commanders for Israel\u2019s Security\u2019s leadership addressed a letter to President Donald Trump calling on him to pressure Israel to end the war.",

      "While the reoccupation of Gaza is largely unpopular with the Israeli public, it is supported on the far right.",
      "Over the weekend, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for Israel to \"conquer\" Gaza to and to encourage Palestinians to leave the enclave.",
      "Ben-Gvir drew condemnation not only for his comments, but also for leading a group of worshippers in prayer at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount, violating a decades-old agreement allowing Jews to visit to Jerusalem\u2019s most sensitive holy site but not to worship there.",
      "Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for Israel to \"conquer\" Gaza, and called for rebuilding of Israeli settlements there alongside other right-wing ministers, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.",
      "Israel captured the Gaza Strip, then occupied by Egypt, after the 1967 war, but withdrew settlers \u2014 some of them forcefully \u2014 in 2005. In 2006, residents elected the Islamist militant and political group Hamas in legislative elections, precipitating clashes with the more secular Palestinian faction of Fatah. Hamas seized full control of the enclave in 2007."

      "A Tennessee man convicted in the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters was executed Tuesday despite a legal dispute that his heart device could repeatedly shock him and expose him to unconstitutional suffering.",
      "Byron Black was put to death by lethal injection at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville, state corrections officials said, after the U.S. Supreme Court and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee declined Monday to intervene.",
      "Black, 69, was pronounced dead at 10:43 a.m. and he had no last words, Department of Correction Commissioner Frank Strada said at a news conference.",
      "Lawyers for Black had petitioned the Supreme Court to halt the procedure based on a claim that he is mentally incompetent and therefore should not be executed because it would violate his constitutional rights. In addition, the lawyers asked the high court to review whether proceeding with his execution without first deactivating his implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or ICD, would defy the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.",
      "The Supreme Court denied the requests Monday.",
      "Kelley Henry, one of Black's lawyers, earlier called on Lee to step in to prevent \"risking a grotesque spectacle by executing Byron Black.\"",
      "The governor said he would not show leniency.",
      "\"The courts have universally determined that it is lawful to carry out the jury's sentence of execution given to Mr. Black for the heinous murders of Angela Clay and her daughters Lakeisha, age 6, and Latoya, age 9,\" Lee said in a statement. \"Accordingly, I do not plan to intervene.\"",
      "Last month, the Davidson County Chancery Court ruled in favor of Black to have his device disabled before his execution after his lawyers argued that the ICD \u2014 which is designed to deliver electric shocks to those with dangerously fast heartbeats \u2014 might try to restore his heart to a regular rhythm as he is put to death by the drug pentobarbital.",
      "Black could be \"subject to the severe pain and suffering of having his heart repeatedly shocked back into rhythm during his execution,\" they said in a court filing.",
      "But the Tennessee Supreme Court overturned the ruling Thursday, finding that the chancery court did not have the authority to issue a decision that would effectively halt an execution. Still, the state justices said, there was nothing to stop the state and lawyers from working out a plan to deactivate the ICD.",
      "However, state Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti vowed in a statement last week to move ahead with the execution. He also disputed that Black is intellectually disabled or would suffer severe pain if he were executed.",
      "\"Our office will continue fighting to seek justice for the Clay family,\" Skrmetti said, \"and to hold Black accountable for his horrific crimes.\"",
      "At the time of the killings, Black had been on work release as part of his jail sentence for shooting Clay's estranged husband, Bennie Clay, about 15 months earlier.",
      "Angela Clay's sister told Nashville police that Black had threatened to harm her sister because she was considering ending their relationship and reuniting with her husband.",
      "Bennie Clay told The Tennessean newspaper last week that he has forgiven Black and intends to witness the execution of the man who killed his family.",
      "\"God has a plan for everything,\" Clay said. \"He had a plan when he took my girls. He needed them more than I did, I guess.\"",
      "Amid decades of appeals, Black faced three execution dates, but the procedures were delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic and, more recently, a pause in Tennessee's executions due to issues in testing its lethal injection drugs.",
      "Tennessee resumed executions in May under a new lethal injection protocol using pentobarbital, a sedative.",
      "In testimony last month in Davidson County Chancery Court, medical experts for the state and Black argued over whether his ICD, which was installed last year, would, in fact, cause prolonged pain.",
      "\"Mr. Black will not be feeling the shocks as he will be in a coma\" brought on by the lethal injection process, testified Dr. Litsa Lambrakos, a cardiac electrophysiologist at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.",
      "But Dr. Gail Van Norman, an anesthesiology professor at the University of Washington who specializes in heart surgery, suggested otherwise. She testified that using a potent amount of pentobarbital, which can cause death from respiratory failure, could unnecessarily trigger Black's defibrillator.",
      "\"ICDs sometimes deliver shocks when they're not needed,\" she said. \"This is devastating to patients.\"",
      "The potential disabling of Black's defibrillator had brought up larger questions about whether a medical professional could even be found who would be willing to assist the Tennessee Department of Correction.",
      "Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Board of Anesthesiology, have adopted ethical codes that generally promote the health and welfare of patients and do not explicitly condone their members' participating in executions.",
      "Advocates for Black said his case, given his unique position surrounding his defibrillator, as well as his documented mental impairments, warranted the governor's granting clemency.",
      "Black was in a wheelchair and suffered from several ailments besides congestive heart failure, including dementia, kidney disease and prostate cancer, his lawyers said.",
      "\"His body is failing, and his mind is deteriorating,\" Henry wrote to Lee in a clemency request last month. \"His execution would not serve justice \u2014 it would mark an irreversible act of cruelty against a profoundly physically and mentally impaired man who poses no threat to anyone and would leave his entire family, who cherish him, devastated.\"",
      "Black's execution is the 28th carried out in the United States in 2025, a high not seen since 2015, according to the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. The number of executions, however, has generally fallen, in part because death penalty states have had difficulties acquiring lethal injection drugs."

    "summary": "Unlike most major sports, big paydays aren't the norm in track and field. It's why before Jacory Patterson won the U.S. 400-meter championship, he had to find a second job \u2014 and he's not alone.",
    "story": [
      "After winning the 400-meter title at the U.S. track and field championships Saturday in Eugene, Oregon, Jacory Patterson returned to find his phone filled with congratulatory messages.",
      "Among the well-wishers were some of Patterson\u2019s former co-workers. They had seen him operate under pressure at a fast pace before \u2014 at a UPS distribution center in South Carolina.",
      "As Patterson, 25, showed in Oregon after cruising one lap in 44.16 seconds to win his first individual national title, his speed is unique. Yet his decision to fund his training via a graveyard shift packing boxes into the back of UPS delivery trucks is rooted in a reality that is common throughout his sport.",
      "It\u2019s hard to make a living in track and field.",
      "\u201cI can definitely say it\u2019s a little tougher being unsponsored for sure, because you have no money,\u201d Patterson said in an interview Sunday. \u201cEverything is coming out of your pockets. And then, having to balance that with getting into meets, paying for gear, paying for spikes and all the things that go into track? And then having to pay your own bills, too; you know, rent, car bills, gas, groceries, like the whole nine yards.\u201d",
      "In many major North American professional sports, a single entity such as the NBA, NFL or MLB collects revenue from media rights, merchandising and other licensing and pays out a share to its athletes under the terms of an agreement that has been collectively bargained with their union. Track and field, however, has no single, premier league, and their athletes also have no union. The combination makes established and aspiring pro runners alike the world\u2019s fastest freelancers, whose income is dependent on a piecemeal combination that can include endorsements, appearance fees, prize money and money earned from social media and grants.",
      "As Patterson can attest, not all of those revenue streams are guaranteed.",
      "At last week\u2019s U.S. championships, it was not uncommon to see some of the sport\u2019s highest-paid and most-decorated athletes, including champion sprinter Noah Lyles, competing alongside peers scratching out a living. On Sunday, Dylan Beard made the U.S. team that will compete in September\u2019s world championships in Tokyo in the 110-meter hurdles. To go to the meet, however, the unsponsored hurdler will need to ask for time off from his day job in the deli of a North Carolina Walmart.",
      "Patterson left the University of Florida powerhouse campus in 2023 with a pair of NCAA relay championships but his times were not fast enough to earn an all-important sponsorship contract with a shoe company. Shoe companies provide the bulk of money for track athletes though some, but not all, companies utilize so-called \u201creduction clauses\u201d to cut an athlete\u2019s earnings if certain performance marks are not met.",
      "These contracts are almost never made public. The most lucrative, such as the one Adidas holds with Lyles, and a five-year, $11 million deal signed by former Olympic champion Andre de Grasse with Puma, are the exception, not the rule, and even then would make them firmly middle class by NBA, MLB and NFL standards.",
      "The 2024 Olympic Trials presented a breakout opportunity for Patterson to make the case for himself to brands, but he didn\u2019t advance out of the first round. It didn\u2019t shake his confidence in his potential, but he did question how much it would cost him out of pocket to realize it.",
      "So, as the world watched the Paris Olympics, Patterson moved to his hometown of Columbia, South Carolina, and last August began a job at UPS. From 10:45 p.m. until nearly 5 a.m., Patterson stood alongside a conveyer belt, picking up boxes containing everything from couches to refrigerators and loading them into delivery trucks. He could pack up to four trucks in a shift, he said.",
      "Patterson did not find the work discouraging, instead persuading himself that while his peers literally slept, he was getting stronger. His mother joked to Patterson that his night shift was like his second workout of the day. That was because, hours earlier, he\u2019d already had a first.",
      "After sleeping for three hours following his shift with UPS, Patterson would wake and start training from around 8:30 a.m. until just after lunch. Then, he would fall asleep until the evening, and start the process over.",
      "\u201cI would be on the trucks, late night, loading the boxes and not one time did I think, \u2018I want to stop this, this is too much,\u2019\u201d Patterson said. \u201cNot once did I ever let that thought cross my mind. I always knew I was gonna keep going with this, because this, it\u2019s in my heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to just have faith the size of a mustard seed, and just keep the ball rolling,\u201d he added.",

      "The Braves take the MLB Speedway Classic at Bristol after rain suspension",
      "An injection of new money into the sport was supposed to make earning a living from track easier. Several new competitions announced their intentions to stage new meets in 2025, the most lucrative of which was Grand Slam Track. Fronted by former Olympic champion Michael Johnson, and backed by an announced $30 million in funding, the circuit announced it would host four meets and would not only pay out $3 million in total prize money, but crucially also pay a group who agreed to sign on a contractual, six-figure salary.",
      "When Patterson opened his season in April by running 44.27 seconds at a meet in Florida, potential sponsors began to call his agent, he said. It helped him earn a wild-card entry a month later to a Grand Slam Track meet in Florida, where he ran a personal-best 43. Only two men in the world have run faster in the three months since, making Patterson a legitimate threat to win a gold medal at September\u2019s world championships in Tokyo.",
      "Even better, the race also earned him $50,000 \u2014 a career-changing sum in a sport whose longest-established, and highest-profile meet circuit comparatively paid Patterson one-fifth that amount for winning a 400 at one of its meets in late May.",
      "Yet months after he earned the money, the $50,000 owed to Patterson by Grand Slam Track still has not been paid, he said, adding he believes the money will arrive in September. Under a funding shortfall, the circuit ended its season after only three meets, and it has yet to pay any athletes for prize money from its first two competitions, in Jamaica and Florida. The company is \"recapitalizing,\" a spokesperson said in a statement, and \"is anticipating investor funds to hit our account imminently, and the athletes are our top priority. Once these funds are received on our end, we will work to immediately process them to the athletes.\"",
      "What Patterson's performance at Grand Slam did provide, more immediately, was an overnight spike in attention from potential sponsors. By late May, Patterson quietly put in his two weeks\u2019 notice with his UPS manager. On June 5, the day after Patterson announced his long-awaited sponsorship with the sportswear giant Nike, he worked his final day loading boxes.",
      "\u201cEverybody (at UPS) was like, man, go chase that dream,\u201d Patterson said.",
      "Part of that dream was realized when he won the U.S. title Saturday while crossing the finish line in a Nike singlet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not always gonna be easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it would, you know, everybody would be U.S. champion.\u201d",
      "Patterson said he understands why his time UPS has drawn so much interest. The notion of an athlete needing a second job to fund a first love is largely unheard of in major domestic leagues. Still, he said he wants to be known for more than just what he did at his former workplace. And he will be at September\u2019s world championships, should Patterson deliver the goods, once again."

      "The U.S. and India\u2019s blossoming friendship is at risk of fracturing, observers have warned, as President Donald Trump threatens to substantially increase tariffs on Indian goods over its purchases of Russian oil.",
      "At the start of the year, India seemed to be one of the countries most likely to win Trump\u2019s favor, given its growing role as an Asian counterweight to China and Trump\u2019s close relationship with its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "But U.S. relations with India have instead come under strain over trade and other issues. Trump has threatened Apple and other companies that manufacture in India; moved closer to its biggest rival, Pakistan; and mocked India\u2019s \u201cdead\u201d economy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s threatening to undo, or at least hit pause on, what has been two decades of steadily improving relations between India and the U.S.,\u201d said Dhruva Jaishankar, executive director of the Observer Research Foundation America, a nonprofit group in Washington.",
      "On Monday, citing India\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d purchases of Russian oil, Trump said he would \u201csubstantially\u201d increase the U.S. tariff on Indian imports, which is already one of the highest among Asian countries at 25%. Along with China, India is a top purchaser of Russian crude oil sanctioned by Western governments after Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "In a sharp response, India, a major U.S. security partner, said such criticism was \u201cunjustified and unreasonable\u201d and that it bought Russian oil with U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIndia began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,\u201d the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets stability.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "U.S.-India tensions are mounting domestic political pressure on Modi, with opponents accusing him of failing to stand up to his \u201cdear friend\u201d Trump.",
      "\u201cThe country is now bearing the cost of Narendra Modi\u2019s \u2018friendship,\u2019\u201d the opposition Congress party said last week.",
      "\u2018I don\u2019t want you building in India\u2019",
      "It was a different picture in February, when Modi was among the first world leaders to visit the White House after Trump returned to office. Mirroring Trump, he said he too would \u201cmake India great again.\u201d",
      "The bonhomie did not last long. Since then, Trump has needled India over a number of issues, including billions in investment by American companies as they shift manufacturing from China.",
      "Last quarter, India produced 44% of U.S. smartphone imports, more than any other country, including China, according to data from the research firm Canalys. That includes iPhones sold in the U.S., the majority of which Apple chief executive Tim Cook says will have India as their country of origin starting this quarter.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want you building in India,\u201d Trump said he told Cook in May, urging him to produce phones in the U.S. instead, despite the difficulties.",
      "Cozying up to India\u2019s foe",
      "A terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 26 people in April is another source of friction in U.S.-India relations.",
      "India responded by bombing neighboring Pakistan, which it has long accused of harboring terrorists, resulting in a four-day conflict that threatened to explode into a broader war fueled by decades of tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries.",
      "Trump irked India by repeatedly claiming that he had personally brokered a ceasefire. While Islamabad thanked Trump for mediating, India rejected claims of U.S. involvement, including in a call between Modi and Trump.",
      "\u201cIndia has not endorsed Trump\u2019s claim,\u201d said Amitendu Palit, a former Indian finance ministry official and a senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore.",
      "\u201cThat has not gone down very well with Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "Within weeks, Trump hosted Pakistan\u2019s powerful army chief at the White House in an unprecedented meeting. He has also imposed a lower tariff rate on Pakistan of 19% and said the U.S. had reached a deal with Pakistan on exploring its oil reserves.",
      "Squeezed over Russia",
      "As Trump has expressed growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he has turned his attention to India\u2019s relationship with Moscow.",
      "For years, New Delhi has benefited from its \u201cnonaligned\u201d foreign policy, which allowed India to strengthen U.S. ties while continuing its long-standing relationship with Russia, one of its main suppliers of energy and military equipment.",
      "When Russian oil was hit with Western-led sanctions over Ukraine, India \u2014 the third-largest energy consumer in the world after China and the U.S. \u2014 seized the opportunity to buy it at a discount, which even U.S. officials said helped stabilize global oil prices.",
      "\u201cThey bought Russian oil because we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil,\u201d Eric Garcetti, the U.S. ambassador to India under President Joe Biden, said at a conference last year. \u201cIt was actually the design of the policy, because as a commodity we didn\u2019t want oil prices going up.\u201d",
      "The U.S. position on India\u2019s oil purchases appears to have reversed under Trump, who said in a social media post last week that India and Russia \u201ccan take their dead economies down together.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are now at a stage where the American ability to control Russia and its allies is beginning to impact India,\u201d Palit said.",
      "Jaishankar said that while Trump\u2019s actions won\u2019t push India out of America\u2019s orbit, they could drive India to strengthen ties with other countries such as China. During a meeting of their foreign ministers in Beijing last month, India and China agreed to resume direct flights between their countries for the first time in five years.",
      "Despite the recent setbacks in their relationship, India will continue to engage with the U.S. as a key strategic and technological partner, said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",

      "It\u2019s a slur for the AI age.",
      "\u201cClanker,\u201d a word that traces back to a Star Wars video game, has emerged in recent weeks as the internet\u2019s favorite epithet for any kind of technology looking to replace humans. On TikTok, people harass robots in stores and on sidewalks with it. Search interest for the term has spiked. On X, Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., used the term last week to tout a new piece of legislation.",
      "\u201cSick of yelling \u201cREPRESENTATIVE\u201d into the phone 10 times just to talk to a human being?,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cMy new bill makes sure you don\u2019t have to talk to a clanker if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d",
      "In one video, which has more than 6 million views on TikTok, a small, four-wheeled delivery robot gets berated with the word.",
      "\u201cIt makes me sick just seeing a...\u201d Nic, a 19-year-old student and aspiring content creator in Miami Beach who posted the video, says as it approached, adding: \u201cClanker!\u201d",
      "A slur is generally defined as a word or phrase meant to denigrate a person based on their membership to a particular group such as a race, gender or religion \u2014 one that goes beyond rudeness into overt bigotry. They are almost always directed at people.",
      "\u201cClanker\u201d appears to have peeked into the internet\u2019s lexicon starting in early June, with Google Trends data showing a sudden uptick in search interest. An entry on KnowYourMeme.com, a website dedicated to documenting the varied weirdness of the internet, traced the term back to the 2010s, when Star Wars communities adopted it from its use in various Star Wars shows to refer to battle robots. Other pieces of science fiction also predicted the rise of slurs for machines, most notably \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d with \u201cskinjob\u201d to refer to highly advanced, humanlike robots.",
      "But there\u2019s a catch. By using a slur in a way that would typically apply to a human, people are also elevating the technology, offering some sense that people both want to put down the machines and recognize their ascension in society.",
      "Adam Aleksic, a linguist who is also a content creator focused on how the internet is shaping language, said he first noticed the emergence of \u201cclanker\u201d a couple of weeks ago. Its use mirrored classic slurs related to racial tropes and appeared to emerge out of a growing \u201ccultural need\u201d related to growing unease with where advanced technology is heading. In one video \u2014 somewhat ironically appearing to have been created by AI \u2014 a man berates his daughter during a family dinner for dating \u201ca goddamned clanker,\u201d before his wife steps in and apologizes to the robot.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re anthropomorphizing and personifying and simplifying the concept of an AI, reducing it into an analogy of a human and kind of playing into the same tropes,\u201d Aleksic said. \u201cNaturally, when we trend in that direction, it does play into those tropes of how people have treated marginalized communities before.\u201d",
      "The use of \u201cclanker\u201d is rising as people are more often encountering AI and robots in their daily lives, something that is only expected to continue in the coming years. The steady expansion of Waymo\u2019s driverless cars across U.S. cities has also come with some human-inflicted bumps and bruises for the vehicles along the way. Food delivery bots are an increasingly common sight on sidewalks. In the virtual world, cybersecurity firms continue to warn about the proliferation of bots on the web that comprise a growing share of all web traffic \u2014 including as many as one in five social media accounts.",
      "The anti-machine backlash has long been simmering but is now seemingly breaking to the surface. A global report by Gartner research group found that 64% of customers would prefer that companies didn\u2019t use AI for customer service \u2014 with another 53% stating they would consider switching to a competitor if they found out a company was doing so. People are becoming more worried about AI taking their jobs, even though evidence of actual AI-related job losses is relatively scant.",
      "\u201cClanker\u201d is also not the first pejorative term for something related to AI to have spread across the internet. \u201cSlop\u201d as a catchall term for AI-generated content that is of low quality or obviously created by AI \u2014 such as \u201cshrimp Jesus\u201d \u2014 entered internet parlance last year and has since become widely used.

      "\u201cOnions are naturally antimicrobial while rich in sulfur and antioxidants so there is truth in onion being potentially helpful as an ingredient in hair products,\u201d says Dr. Anna Chacon, a board-certified dermatologist in Miami, Florida. Because of this, there are a number of shampoos on the market that list onion extract as one of their primary ingredients.",
      "Below, we spoke to experts about the potential benefits associated with onion shampoo, whether you can use it if you have color-treated hair and more \u2014 plus, gathered a few highly rated options for you to shop.",
      "What is onion shampoo?",
      "Onion shampoo is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 shampoo that has onion as a main ingredient. Though it may sound funky, the experts we spoke to agree that onion extract can help hair health. \u201cOnion contains sulfur, which is a key building block for keratin, the protein that makes up your hair,\u201d says Dr. Ross Kopelman, a hair transplant surgeon at Kopelman Hair Restoration. \u201cIt also has antimicrobial properties that can support a healthier scalp environment. Some studies suggest it may increase blood flow to the scalp and reduce inflammation, which are both important for hair health.\u201d",
      "Most commonly, hair products with this vegetable are aimed at helping with hair thinning and encouraging growth. One clinical trial even found that when onion extract was applied topically, it helped people with alopecia areata (an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss) with regrowth. \u201cWhile we need more research, I\u2019ve seen some patients benefit when using onion-based treatments as part of a broader hair care routine,\u201d says Kopelman.",
      "The perks may sound great, but worried that onion shampoo will leave you smelling like the deli counter? Don\u2019t be. While onion extract may be a primary ingredient, the shampoos available that use it also have other beneficial (and pleasant-smelling) ingredients, such as lavender or rosemary.",
      "Can anyone use onion shampoo?",
      "In general, over-the-counter shampoos with onion extract are gentle and sulfate-free, so they should be safe for just about everyone to use. That said, if you have color-treated hair, you may want to think twice. \u201cOnions are acidic, so using them on color-treated hair can disrupt the delicate PH balance needed to prolong the look of freshly colored hair,\u201d says Chacon. \u201cAvoiding the shaft of the treated hair and concentrating at the scalp is an option but be sure to patch test to ensure you don\u2019t have any scalp sensitivity.\u201d",
      "Chacon also recommends that those with sensitive skin proceed with caution. \u201cThe smell could also be a hindrance here as well as the effect onions have on the eyes and the close proximity of the scalp to the eyes,\u201d says Chacon. \u201cInstead, I would opt for rosemary oil \u2014 which is an alternative natural ingredient that has all of the antifungal, growth promoting effects but with a pleasant scent.\u201d",
      "Finally, if you are allergic to anything in the allium family (like onions or garlic), it\u2019s best to skip this type of shampoo. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few cases of contact dermatitis from poorly formulated onion shampoos,\u201d says Kopelman. \u201cAlso, if you have eczema or active scalp inflammation, it\u2019s best to consult with a specialist before adding anything new to your regimen.\u201d",

      "When you think of \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty,\u201d you might picture Belly\u2019s tangled love life, the Cousins Beach sunsets or the memorable soundtrack. But the grown ups get their moments, too.",
      "In \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d Season 3, the parents of Belly (Lola Tung), Steven (Sean Kaufman), Conrad (Christopher Briney), Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) and Taylor (Rain Spencer) deal with the universal theme of empty-nesting as the beloved summer crew go to college and beyond.",
      "Laurel Park (Jackie Chung), Belly and Steven Conklin's mom, continues to grieve the loss of best friend Susannah Fisher (Rachel Blanchard), who died in Season 2. Meanwhile Susannah\u2019s husband, Adam Fisher (Tom Everett Scott), struggles to step up for his two sons, Conrad and Jeremiah Fisher. Season 3 also introduces viewers to Taylor\u2019s mom, Lucinda Jewel (Kristen Connolly).",
      "If you look just beyond the love triangles, something deeper is going on: The parents are having a coming-of-age story of their own.",
      "A Child's Major Life Decision",
      "The main obstacle facing the parents of Cousins Beach is Belly and Jeremiah\u2019s engagement. Now upperclassmen in college with around four years of dating under their belt, the young lovebirds get engaged after Steven\u2019s car accident, which for Belly, puts their blowout fight over Jeremiah sleeping with someone else into a new perspective.",
      "\u201cWhen you lose someone, or almost lose someone, that can change things for you and bring you closer to the people in your life that really matter,\u201d Tung previously told TODAY.com.",
      "Before the engagement, audiences find Laurel several years after both Belly and Steven have left for college.",
      "\"I think Laurel has had quite the journey from supporting her friend through her illness, and then losing Susannah and grieving in Season 2,\" Chung tells TODAY.com. \"And so I think by the time we've hit Season 3, and time has passed, Laurel is on more, like, steady ground.\"",
      "\"With her kids gone, she has an opportunity to look around and see what's out there, and see what her life can be and look for new relationships,\" she adds. \"There's a lot of potential for Laurel.\"",
      "When it comes to parenting, she says in Season 2, \"Laurel wasn't always the best communicator.\" That was Susannah's strong suit. Chung says Laurel strives to step up to that task after Susannah's death.",
      "\"Laurel is trying really hard to communicate with her kids and Susannah's kids, and just trying to be the best parent she can be,\" she says. \"She doesn't always succeed, and she butts heads with her kids sometimes, but you know, it's all out of love.\"",
      "After Belly and Jeremiah announce their engagement over dinner in Episode 3, Laurel immediately criticizes the decision and storms out, shutting the meal down before it even begins.",
      "Chung says Laurel's overall goal is to \"set them up for success as individuals in their lives and (help them make) good decisions for themselves.\"",
      "\"I think Laurel doesn't always agree with all the decisions,\" she adds with a laugh. \"And she does her best to give her kids space, but when she has an opinion, she expresses it.\"",

      "Struggling to Reconnect",
      "Adam was also at that fateful dinner in Episode 3. In fact, the engagement announcement came about after he made an underhanded remark about Jeremiah being a \"super senior.\" Belly, wanting to prove that she and Jeremiah are taking their future plans seriously, then reveals they are getting married.",
      "Like Laurel, he calls Jeremiah \u201cirresponsible\" and helps shut down the dinner before appetizers hit the table.",
      "Adam has never exactly been father of the year. When Susannah got sick, he was MIA. After she passed, he stayed emotionally checked out, and in Season 2, he refused to help save the family beach house until Laurel pressured him into doing it.",
      "\u201cPeople say that Adam actually stepped up... but it was really Laurel who kind of forced his hand,\u201d Scott tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut I love that scene because you see a little crack in Adam. He does get to kind of show that he\u2019s hurting and he\u2019s missing Susannah.\u201d",
      "Scott says in Season 3, his character's relationship with his sons continues to be \"rocky.\"",
      "\u201cHe is their only parent now,\u201d Scott adds. \u201cHe\u2019s going to try to do the right things. He just doesn\u2019t have the tools. He\u2019s not very good at it, being present.\"",
      "But his ultimate goal is reconciliation, Scott says, adding, \"Adam is going to be more involved.\"",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re sort of parent daughter relationship is switched, like Taylor feels more like the parent a bit, which is an interesting dynamic that\u2019s funny and presents its own challenges,\u201d Spencer tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cBeing a young adult (is) like, \u2018How much do I help my mom, versus listen to my heart and what I want to do and leave the nest?\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "When Taylor comes home for summer break, Lucinda greets her with a freshly cleaned house, a breakup playlist and plans to binge watch \u201cGilmore Girls.\u201d Taylor divulges her boy drama, and in classic TV mom fashion, Lucinda schemes. She calls Steven, pretending to need bookkeeping help, but the plan backfires. Steven finds out Lucinda's salon is bleeding cash and might not last the month.",
      "By the end of the episode, Lucinda crumbles, crying in front of Taylor. Her response seemingly sets the stage for their arc in Season 3: \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out together.\u201d",
      "A Loss No One Can Forget",
      "While Susannah Fisher may be gone, her presence is felt everywhere.",
      "From the first scene of Season 3, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s still the emotional center of the show. Her death fractured the core group and sent each parent, and kid, on their own winding path through grief, growth and messy healing.",
      "\u201cShe was Laurel\u2019s biggest cheerleader and an instigator,\u201d Chung says. \u201cThe one who throws a party, who says, \u2018Come on, Laurel, let\u2019s dance.\u2019\u201d",
      "Her absence is felt in the quiet moments \u2014 Belly reaching for someone to guide her, Laurel learning how to open up and Adam trying to fill her shoes as a single parent. The memorial garden dedication in her name in Episode 3 brings the whole group back together, and it\u2019s her legacy that both unites and complicates them.",
      "Plus, there's a chance we'll continue to see more of Susannah in Season 3. The official X account for \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" shared photos of Rachel Blanchard on set, though it was unclear if she filmed scenes for the third season."

      "Speaking to People in a recent interview, the 57-year-old actor explained that he relocated from Los Angeles soon after the final season of the beloved sitcom wrapped in 2020.

      "\"And then 17 years earlier, a mother is in the Philadelphia airport and she tragically loses her child,\" she continues. \"It's how all these women's lives come together and collide, but it is a story that explores connection and the feeling of being seen \u2014 and not seen \u2014 when you are a teenager and when you're an adult, and it is about that yearning to belong.\"",
      "Nanami Strenner says the opening pages of the book were inspired by times she's been in foreign airports with her own daughter, and her fears of the worst case scenario.",
      "\"I've been in that situation so many times with my own daughter ... and I just remember being in really far flung countries where sometimes the people there didn't speak English, and I couldn't speak their language,\" Nanami Strenner says. \"It would be the most terrifying thing that she would get away from me and I wouldn't be able to do anything.\"",
      "\"I allowed myself to consider the worst case scenario in that which is what led me to the beginning of the novel,\" she adds. \"What if I was powerless and I didn't have language, and I had no means and ... I was in this situation where I was completely rendered helpless and unable to find the most precious thing in my life?\"",
      "Nanami Strenner says she began to get the idea for the full novel when she looked on how much time she's spent in airports in her own life, growing up in England before living in Japan, Vietnam and more, before landing in Philadelphia before the pandemic.",
      "\"I think all the threads started to come together \u2014 you're in this sort of strange purgatory when you're in an airport, because you're leaving a place behind while trying of move in to the next place,\" Nanami Strenner says. \"I think that's where the two girls, Kit and Sabrina, are in this sort of in betweenness themselves.\"",
      "\"While they're about to head out into adulthood, they don't understand exactly who they are ... and they're trying to grapple with themselves,\" she continues. All those pieces sort of came together when I was thinking about it.\"",

      "\"This is the most disciplined I've ever been in my life, and it's sort of not been fully repeated since,\" she jokes.",
      "One of the themes Nanami Strenner hopes readers explore after finishing \"My Other Heart\" is the question of nature versus nurture.",
      "\"From a parental point of view, that\u2019s really interesting, because we know so much more now about the impact of parents on children as they grow up,\" she says. \"But also, ideal nature versus how everything else has shaped us, I think that\u2019s a really interesting idea.

    "story": [
      "Jennifer Love Hewitt realizes much of her work behind the camera shares a common theme.",
      "\"I feel like I am a person, in hopefully a healthy way, that finds themselves inspired by or interested in human stories of trauma,\" she says.",
      "In recent years, she\u2019s found herself telling stories about people, often women, after the hardest moments of their lives, whether it\u2019s through her \u201c9-1-1\u201d character; as Julie James in the sequel to \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d; or as the narrator of the new docuseries \u201cA Killer Among Friends.\u201d",
      "Hewitt says in an interview with TODAY.com, she found herself exploring this theme again and again \"by accident.\" But the similarities between her roles have never been more stark.",
      "In 2025's \"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\" Julie has long left Southport and is now a divorc\u00e9e college psychology professor specializing in the study of \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 trauma. But she's drawn back into the fray by Ava (Chase Sui Wonders), one of the group of 20-somethings being terrorized by the next killer to take up the fisherman's mantle.",
      "Without sharing too many spoilers, the film's ambitious finale sees Julie return to Southport for the first time after years of avoiding it \u2014 and face a killer once again. (She quite literally voices her mettle with a reprise of her line, \"What are you waiting for, huh?\")",
      "\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" hit theaters July 18. That same week, another one of Hewitt's projects hit the small screen.",
      "Hewitt is the narrator and executive producer of Investigation Discovery's \"A Killer Among Friends.\" The docuseries premiered July 14, with new episodes airing each Monday on ID and streaming the next day on HBO Max.",
      "The premiere episode, \"Killer on Campus,\" follows the 1994 slaying of University of Kentucky student Trent DiGiuro, which was the subject of a \"Dateline\" investigation in March 2019. The first scene shows one of DiGiuro's friends, Sean, return for the first time to the off-campus house where DiGiuro was murdered.",
      "Introducing the episode and the group of students at the center of it, Hewitt says, \"In the real world you never truly know who you can trust. Something evil was coming for them.\" Each episode will follow a friend group \"haunted by a murder of one of their own,\" the logline reads.",
      "\u201c(Trauma) seems to be a theme for me, and I\u2019m not really sure why,\u201d Hewitt says. \u201cI seem to gravitate towards it. Or it seems to be my universal lesson. So I embrace it.\u201d",
      "A Role She's Never Filled",
      "\"A Killer Among Friends\" seemingly relates to the original premise of \"I Know What You Did Last Summer.\" Even the posters for both projects feature a similar style, down to the title's font size and shape.",
      "\"I think that's probably why they thought of me, because I haven't really been in the true crime space. I've definitely produced things before, but I've never been a narrator,\" Hewitt says.",
      "Hewitt's narration moves the story along. She introduces each episode's central conceit, and if you hear her voice mid-episode, prepare for a plot twist or major reveal.",
      "I think trauma has been seen as a weakness. And I think my goal ... in being the narrator of this show and showing how these people have continued to live life because they got the chance to \u2014 you know, trauma can also be a strength.",
      "Jennifer Love Hewitt",
      "Becoming the narrator involved learning a brand-new skill, \"taking your face completely out of it, and trying with your voice to convey strength and fear,\" she says.",
      "\"I've been doing this business now for 36 years, and so to find something new that I haven't tried yet was exciting for me,\" she adds.",
      "But she has a confession.",
      "\u201cTruth be told, because I like to keep it real, I\u2019m not a big true crime watcher,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly because I get very freaked out by things very easily, and I\u2019m a mom of three children, so I just like to not go there sometimes.",
      "But reading the stories of the sources in \"A Killer Among Friends\" felt different, she says.",
      "\"It felt like these were stories that really held onto and captured an innocence and a human condition and a heart condition in the true crime space that maybe I hadn't really seen before,\" she says.",
      "\"I felt like that was what I could attach to,\" she continues, \"the vulnerability of our youth and the friend group angle in all of these stories, with these friends grappling with these things and being left behind and all these unanswered questions.\"",
      "Though the job marks a first for Hewitt, she cites one of her past roles with preparing her for the task: Melinda Gordon from \"Ghost Whisperer.\" In the CBS drama, which aired from 2005 to 2010, Melinda communicated with spirits and helped bring closure to people who had lost loved ones.",
      "\"I really did think about her a lot when I was narrating this,\" Hewitt says. \"My job in this was to not be on top of the story, or overdo the story, but to really just service these people's stories and endings, however sad they might be. But to also somehow pay respect and provide closure.\"",
      "She also sees similarities between the narrator role and her \"9-1-1\" character, Maddie, who works as a Los Angeles dispatcher on the ABC drama.",
      "\"Sometimes people pick on me for Maddie being a crier as a dispatcher, and I always have to say, 'It's a TV show. I'm supposed to be giving you emotion.' I know that if I really worked at 911, I would not be able to sob with people all the time,\" she says.",
      "But it was thinking about the reality of the dispatcher job that helped her while recording her lines in the booth.",
      "\"There were definitely a couple of times where I was reading things in the booth where I felt myself wanting to be emotional about it, and in my mind, had to remind myself that this was not the place,\" she says. \"I could feel that way later.\"",
      "'My Universal Lesson'",
      "Narrating \"A Killer Among Friends\" was far from easy.",
      "\"Knowing these stories are out there and happening to people, your heart breaks,\" Hewitt says.",
      "Asked how she puts that heaviness aside at the end of the day, Hewitt is blunt: \"When you have three children, there is no unwinding.\"",
      "Hewitt and husband Brian Hallisay became parents in 2013 after welcoming daughter Autumn. She went on to have two sons, Atticus, born in 2015, and Aidan in 2021.",
      "\"People ask me this question all the time about '9-1-1,'\" she says. \"You literally go from darkness into sneezing out rainbows and Skittles. That is just your job.\"",
      "\"But I do think that there is, thank God, a beautiful lift and light that is provided by my kids at the ends of days when I have to do heavy things, that I'm very grateful for,\" she adds.",
      "Hewitt says after finishing filming for \"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\" she went straight to narrating \"A Killer Among Friends,\" all while still filming for \"9-1-1\" Season 8. (As of at least July 24, filming for Season 9 is notably underway, per social media posts shared by the cast.)",
      "It was this summer, in the course of doing interviews for the various projects, that Hewitt says she's recognized the connecting factor of trauma in her work \u2014\u00a0Julie James as an \"active trauma live-r\"; Maddie, a survivor of kidnapping (twice!), postpartum depression, fire and more; a narrator who \"pushes past my trauma of having to know these stories.\"",
      "\"I'm 46 years old, I don't know that I would have put that piece together before now,\" she says.",
      "And there's her own trauma, which she says she experiences \"all the time, in little, tiny ways.\"",
      "\"My children have had trauma growing up in COVID and fires in L.A. and all those things,\" she says. \"I mean I just think it is something that we all have.\"",
      "Her approach to finding opportunities is to stay open.",
      "\"I don't look super hard for the things that I'm in or that I'm a part of,\" she says. \"I really try to just stay open and know that the right things will find me, and they have so far.\"",
      "While she didn't explicitly seek out stories of trauma, she's found power in each story's message. And she describes connecting to these roles, specifically to women \"strong in their broken pieces,\" like it's a purpose, a calling.",
      "\"I think trauma has been seen as a weakness,\" Hewitt says. \"And I think my goal ... in being the narrator of this show and showing how these people have continued to live life because they got the chance to\u00a0\u2014 you know, trauma can also be a strength.\"",
      "\"I think it is a beautiful, beautiful vulnerability to be able to say, 'I have trauma, and I make it work for me every day,'\" she adds. \"'Trauma and I hold hands, and we walk right on through it.' ... Hopefully I'm able to show, yes, they get knocked down, but they also get right back up.\""

    "story": [
      "Along with its air of coming-of-age nostalgia and idyllic beach setting, fans often know \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\" for its music.",
      "The show, now airing its third season, features a soundtrack that highlights a variety of hit songs from artists such as Olivia Rodrigo, Chappell Roan, Fleetwood Mac and Taylor Swift.",
      "Jenny Han, showrunner and author of the original \"Summer I Turned Pretty\" books, says when she picks songs, she aims to match the scene's emotions and overall \"vibe.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s lots of songs that I would like to use somewhere, but it has to be the right moment, and I think it has to further the story along,\" Han says.",
      "Sometimes fans question her selections.",
      "\"I think because they're thinking of it more like an edit,\" she says, referring to the social media phenomenon of splicing scenes together to fit a song\u2019s theme.",
      "\"(They're) great songs that are really lyric heavy that could sort of take away from the scene, because you wouldn't be able to hear the dialogue of the people speaking,\" Han adds. \"And then I think sometimes, you don't want to lead your characters too far in terms of the emotions. You want to let them show you.\"",
      "In keeping with an overall theme of the show, Han says she aims to invoke nostalgia.",
      "\u201cI love picking music that people will maybe (be introduced) to for the first time, and then I also love the nostalgia of songs from the past that make you feel something and you remember a moment,\u201d she says.",
      "But what song Han picks for a scene is sometimes a close call. Lola Tung, who stars as Belly, tells TODAY.com sometimes she's asked for her opinion on a song. Because the process is collaborative, Han reveals that a pivotal moment from the show\u2019s second season was almost set to another tune.",
      "Fans might remember the integral prom scene in Season 2 of \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d that leads Belly and Conrad (Christopher Briney) to break up. \u201cMayonaise\u201d by the Smashing Pumpkins is the song Han ultimately chose to feature in the background.",
      "\u201cI love it because it's so romantic,\u201d Han says. \u201cIt\u2019s yearning. It\u2019s really intense.\u201d",
      "Leading up to the scene, Conrad spends several weeks distancing himself from Belly as he struggles to handle his mom\u2019s worsening health. The couple eventually reaches a breaking point at prom when Conrad forgets Belly's corsage and tells her he isn\u2019t going to spend the night after the dance. Belly perceives his emotional distance as disinterest.",
      "Tension escalates and the intro of \u201cMayonaise\u201d slowly begins playing. Belly and Conrad dance at prom as the song\u2019s electric guitar starts to wail.",
      "But Conrad can\u2019t move past the fact that he feels like a disappointment to Belly. They leave the dance floor to escape the song\u2019s booming drums and talk outside. The two decide to end their relationship as the brooding song can still be heard playing from the dance floor.",
      "But \u201cMayonaise\u201d almost didn't set the wistful tone for this intense moment, Han reveals. Instead, she says one person advocated for featuring Mazzy Star\u2019s classic \u201cFade Into You.\u201d",
      "\"Which I love, it's a beautiful song,\" Han says. \"But I think it had been used on something else recently. You want to be mindful of that because you want the moment to have its own time.\"",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a good song, a lot of people are going to want to use it,\u201d she adds.",
      "The first two episodes of Season 3 of \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d premiered on July 16 on Prime Video. The new season already includes many twists and turns, set to songs such as \"Dreams\" by The Cranberries, Roan's \"Hot To Go,\" Swift's \"You\u2019re Losing Me\" and more.",
      "Over on Amazon Music, fans can receive further insight on the show's soundtrack. In a new playlist, Han provides commentary on the songs in Season 3. The track-by-track album will be updated through the finale, which is set to drop Sept. 17.",
      "\"The show\u2019s music has evolved as the characters have evolved,\" Han said in a statement about the playlist. \"It\u2019s always been a character of the show in its own right.\""

      "A bid by Netanyahu to occupy all of Gaza would follow similar calls from members of his far-right government upon whom his fragile coalition relies, and could mark a significant shift in policy since Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005.",
      "Officials from Netanyahu's office said in a statement shared with NBC News on Monday night that the Israeli leader had decided to \"occupy all of the Gaza Strip, including areas where hostages may be held.\"",
      "The statement was shared in Hebrew and the term used can be translated to mean both \"occupy\" and \"conquer.\" Netanyahu's office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on the intended definition, but Israeli media, including The Times of Israel, reported that Netanyahu intended to \"fully occupy\" the enclave.",
      "Israeli media reported that Netanyahu would hold a limited security meeting Tuesday to discuss the future of Israel's campaign in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu had said Monday he planned to convene the security Cabinet this week to \"instruct\" the Israeli military on how to achieve the three war objectives laid out at the start of Israel's offensive in Gaza: defeating Hamas, seeing the release of hostages who remain held in the enclave and removing the threat of possible future attacks. Asked to confirm if the meeting would take place Tuesday, his office did not respond directly and referred NBC News to his comments Monday.",
      "While the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, that left 1,200 dead and saw 250 taken hostages garnered worldwide sympathy for Israel, the country's actions in the territory have since sparked widespread international outrage.",
      "The United States remains the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, with American spending on Israel's military operations reaching more than $17.9 billion from Oct. 7 last year to Sept. 30, according to Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project.",

Meanwhile, most of its residents have been driven from their homes and more than 60,900 killed, including thousands of children, according to local health officials.",
      "Nearly 190 people in Gaza, including at least 94 children, have died from malnutrition since the war began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza.",
      "There is mounting opposition to the war among Israelis. Many have long despaired over the fate of of the estimated 20 living hostages remaining in Gaza, and recent protests have expressed outrage over the children dying from malnutrition.",
      "Fears for the hostages were also fueled after Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad released imagery in recent days showing visibly gaunt Israeli hostages Evyatar David and Rom Braslavski.",
      "Earlier this month, a group representing hundreds of retired Israeli security officials that calls itself the Commanders for Israel\u2019s Security\u2019s leadership addressed a letter to President Donald Trump calling on him to pressure Israel to end the war.",
      "In the letter, which was confirmed to NBC News, the group said it was its professional judgment that Hamas no longer posed a strategic threat \u2014 and that it was time to \u201cend the war, return the hostages\u201d and \u201cstop the suffering.\u201d",
      "While the reoccupation of Gaza is largely unpopular with the Israeli public, it is supported on the far right.",
      "Over the weekend, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for Israel to \"conquer\" Gaza to and to encourage Palestinians to leave the enclave.",
      "Ben-Gvir drew condemnation not only for his comments, but also for leading a group of worshippers in prayer at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount, violating a decades-old agreement allowing Jews to visit to Jerusalem\u2019s most sensitive holy site but not to worship there.",
      "Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for Israel to \"conquer\" Gaza, and called for rebuilding of Israeli settlements there alongside other right-wing ministers, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.",
      "Israel captured the Gaza Strip, then occupied by Egypt, after the 1967 war, but withdrew settlers \u2014 some of them forcefully \u2014 in 2005. In 2006, residents elected the Islamist militant and political group Hamas in legislative elections, precipitating clashes with the more secular Palestinian faction of Fatah.

      "But humanitarian organizations say the amount of aid that has entered the enclave is not enough, and without more food, growing numbers of Palestinians will die from hunger.",
      "NBC News takes a look at how much aid has entered Gaza in the week since Israel announced the new system, and how that stacks up to the needs of the population.",
      "A tally of aid",
      "Humanitarian aid is entering Gaza in three ways: airdrops, distribution by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and through the United Nations and other aid organizations\u2019 using the newly formed \u201chumanitarian corridors\u201d the Israeli military put in place last week.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which began distributing aid  in the enclave in late May, has been widely condemned for the hundreds of people killed, often by Israeli soldiers, near its aid sites, and for its limited distribution.",
      "Last Sunday, GHF distributed around 1 million meals and at least another 1.2 million from Monday to Wednesday, and 1.3 million on Thursday. GHF did not appear to publish the number of meals distributed on Friday, but on Saturday said it released at least 1.7 million meals.",
      "In a population of roughly 2 million people, that averages out to around half a meal to just under a full meal per person per day.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military branch responsible for overseeing aid into Gaza, said Sunday that a total of 1,200 aid trucks had entered the enclave over the past week and that the same number had been collected by the United Nations and other aid organizations. It said that \"hundreds of trucks remain inside Gaza\" and were still waiting to be picked up.",
      "Before Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza began, around 500 trucks carrying aid were entering the enclave daily, according to the British Red Cross and other organizations.",

      "While COGAT has shared information about trucks entering Gaza and being collected by aid groups on its social media pages over the past week, it has not updated its online dashboard for aid into Gaza since Monday, despite international focus on the matter.",
      "According to the World Food Program, only about two-thirds of the amount of food the U.N. organization has requested Israeli authorities allow into Gaza had been approved as of Thursday since the Israeli military began tactical pauses.",
      "How Israeli restrictions caused the hunger crisis",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza drastically worsened in March after Israel imposed a blockade barring the entry of aid into Gaza, in the midst of its ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Israel lifted the crippling blockade in May, but for months, it has allowed only a limited amount of aid to enter the enclave, most of which has been distributed by the U.S.- and Israel-backed group known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "COGAT did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusation that the amount of aid entering Gaza is not enough. It has previously accused humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, of exacerbating hunger by failing to collect and distribute aid to Palestinians fast enough.",

      "A lion that was being tracked by Oxford University researchers in western Zimbabwe has been killed by a trophy hunter, in what one wildlife campaigner called a \u2018harrowing echo\u2019 of Cecil the Lion\u2019s death in 2015.",
      "Blondie, a tourist favorite, was hunted down after being lured and baited out of Gwayi Conservancy, near Hwange National Park, according to the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting (CBTH), an advocacy organization based in the U.K.",
      "While lion hunting is not illegal in Zimbabwe, Blondie\u2019s killing was because he was under the country\u2019s minimum age of 6, according to Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves, the organization\u2019s founder.",
      "\u201cBlondie was a father, a leader, a national treasure, not a plaything for a rich Westerner with a gun,\u201d Gon\u00e7alves said. \u201cGovernments must act now.\u201d",
      "The beloved feline was killed in late June but his death only began to garner international attention in the last week.",
      "Some 10,000 lions have been shot by trophy hunters in the last decade, according to CBTH, which said African lion populations have declined by more than 90% in the last century.",
      "The safari company Africa Geographic sponsored the GPS collar that was fitted on Blondie.",
      "Africa Geographic\u2019s CEO, Simon Epsley, said the organization was \u201cdismayed and angered\u201d at the killing.",
      "\u201cThat Blondie\u2019s prominent collar did not prevent him from being offered to a hunting client confirms the stark reality that no lion is safe from trophy hunting guns,\u201d he said.",
      "Collars are used to track the animals, limit wildlife-human conflict and support conservation.",
      "Zimbabwean law allows a maximum of 100 lions above the age of 6 to be hunted each year in the country, where safaris and big game hunting are important sources of income.",
      "A spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Parks Agency, the government hunting regulator, denied that Blondie\u2019s killing had broken the law because he was older than 6.",
      "\u201cThis allegation that these people are saying the lion was less than 6 years? We don\u2019t know that. Was there any DNA which was taken to prove that the lion was less than 6 years? The answer is definitely no,\u201d Tinashe Farawo told NBC News.",
      "This claim was backed up by Michael Blignaut, co-owner of Victoria Falls Safari Service, the company allegedly behind the killing of Blondie.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately at this time I cannot comment,\u201d he told NBC News via the WhatsApp messaging service. \u201cI wanna assure you the hunt was done ethically and it was legal.\u201d",
      "The identity of the hunter, who presumptively paid thousands of dollars to kill the lion, has not been released.",
      "But Farawo denied that anything illegal happened, and said these sorts of hunts paid for conservation efforts.",
      "Born Free, another U.K.-based advocacy group, has expressed concern for Blondie\u2019s pride, saying the fate of its three female partners and a number of cubs was \u201cseriously in doubt.\u201d",
      "In 2015, Minnesota dentist Walter James Palmer sparked outrage when he admittedly killed Cecil the Lion after paying $50,000 for the experience.",
      "At the time, Palmer said he had the correct permits, worked with local guides, and had no reason to question the legitimacy of the hunt until after it was over.",
      "Zimbabwean authorities charged Theo Bronchorst, a professional hunter who allegedly took Palmer on the hunt, but later dropped them. Cecil was also being tracked by researchers at the University of Oxford\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit.",
      "After the worldwide outrage caused by Cecil\u2019s killing, Zimbabwean authorities vowed to crack down on trophy hunting  \u2014 but pressure groups say it hasn\u2019t worked.",
      "Mark Jones, Born Free\u2019s head of policy, said that that little has been learned since Cecil\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cThe very fact that they lure lions out of national parks suggests that there are no lions remaining in the hunting areas for them to hunt, reflecting the massive damage to lion populations that trophy hunting is doing,\u201d Jones said."

      "The United States and Rwanda have agreed for the African country to potentially accept hundreds of migrants deported from the U.S., the spokesperson for the Rwandan government and an official told Reuters, as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration takes a hardline approach toward immigration.",
      "The agreement, under which Rwanda would accept up to 250 migrants, was signed by U.S. and Rwandan officials in Kigali in June, said the Rwandan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that Washington had already sent an initial list of 10 people to be vetted.",
      "\u201cRwanda has agreed with the United States to accept up to 250 migrants, in part because nearly every Rwandan family has experienced the hardships of displacement, and our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation,\u201d said the spokesperson for the Rwandan government, Yolande Makolo.",

      "In May, the foreign minister said Rwanda was in the early stages of talks to receive immigrants deported from the United States.",
      "The Trump administration argues that third-country deportations help swiftly remove some migrants, including those with criminal convictions. Immigration hardliners see third-country removals as a way to deal with offenders who cannot easily be deported and could pose a threat to the public.",
      "Opponents have criticized the deportations as dangerous and cruel, since people could be sent to countries where they could face violence, have no ties and do not speak the language.",
      "The Trump administration has pressed countries to take migrants. It deported more than 200 Venezuelans accused of being gang members to El Salvador in March, where they were jailed until they were released in a prisoner swap last month.",
      "The Supreme Court in June allowed the Trump administration to deport migrants to third countries without giving them a chance to show they could be harmed. But the legality of the removals is being contested in a federal lawsuit in Boston, a case that could potentially wind its way back to the conservative-leaning high court.",
      "Rwanda signed an agreement with Britain in 2022 to take in thousands of asylum seekers, a deal that was scrapped last year by then newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer. No one was sent to Rwanda under the plan because of years of legal challenges."

It also comes days before the expiration of Trump\u2019s deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face additional tariffs.",

      "Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on de Moraes over alleged suppression of freedom of expression and the ongoing trial of Bolsonaro.",
      "Possible trouble ahead",
      "Creomar de Souza, a political analyst of Dharma Political Risk and Strategy, a political consultancy firm based in Brasilia, said Bolsonaro\u2019s house arrest opens a new moment for the country\u2019s opposition, which could gather steam in fighting against Lula\u2019s reelection bid next year.",
      "Now, de Souza said, \u201cthe 2026 election looks like turmoil\u201d and the political debate in Brazil will likely be split between two key struggles.",
      "\u201cOne is the effort of Bolsonaro supporters to keep strong on the right, no matter if it is pushing for amnesty in congress or putting themselves physically out there,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cThe second is how the Lula administration will try to show that the country has a government.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is just the start,\u201d he concluded.",
      "The latest decision from the top court keeps Bolsonaro under ankle monitoring, allows only family members and lawyers to visit him and seizes all mobile phones from his home.",
      "Lula was imprisoned for 580 days between 2018 and 2019 in a corruption conviction that was later tossed out by the Supreme Court, citing the bias of the judge in the case.",
      "Michel Temer, who became president after Dilma Rousseff was impeached in 2016, was arrested for 10 days in 2019 in connection with a graft investigation, which later ended without a conviction.",
      "Earlier this year, de Moraes ordered the detention of President Fernando Collor, who was in office from 1990 to 1992 until he was impeached. The 75-year-old former president was convicted for money laundering and corruption in 2023 and is now serving his more than eight-year sentence."

      "The Supreme Court froze the move while it considers the legality.",
      "Netanyahu and his supporters accuse Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara of exceeding her powers by blocking decisions by the elected government, including a move to fire the head of Israel\u2019s domestic security agency, another ostensibly apolitical office. She has said there is a conflict of interest because Netanyahu and several former aides face a series of criminal investigations.",
      "Critics accuse Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, of undermining judicial independence and seeking to concentrate power in the hands of his coalition government, the most nationalist and religious in Israel\u2019s history. Netanyahu denies the allegations and says he is the victim of a witch hunt by hostile judicial officials egged on by the media.",
      "An attempt by Netanyahu\u2019s government to overhaul the judiciary in 2023 sparked months of mass protests, and many believe it weakened the country ahead of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack later that year that triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a prominent watchdog group, said it filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court following Monday\u2019s vote.

      "A global \u201cplastics crisis\u201d is costing governments and taxpayers $1.5 trillion annually as they try to cope with escalating injuries, disability and deaths as the substance pollutes our land, seas and bodies, according to a new report by a leading medical journal.",
      "Plastic production is on course to triple by 2060, less than 10% of it is recycled, and around 8,000 megatons now pollute the planet, according to a review of recent studies published Sunday by The Lancet.",
      "That causes harm at every stage of its lifecycle: from the extraction of fossil fuels and production to its use by humans and eventual disposal into the environment, the British publication said.",
      "\u201cPlastics are a grave, growing, and under-recognised danger to human and planetary health,\u201d it said. \u201cPlastics cause disease and death from infancy to old age\u201d and are \u201ccontributing to climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.\u201d",
      "The harms \u201cfall disproportionately upon low-income and at-risk populations,\u201d it added.",
      "It is the latest dire warning by experts about the ubiquity of and threat posed by plastic, which the journal called \u201cthe defining material of our age.\u201d After decades of scientists\u2019 warning about plastic being found in the oceans and rivers, microplastics are now being discovered inside humans \u2014 including in breast milk and brain tissue.",
      "Sunday\u2019s release marked the start of a new monitoring system called \u201cThe Lancet Countdown on health and plastics,\u201d which it says will track political attempts to combat the problem.",
      "It was launched to coincide with the latest and final round of talks in Geneva, where 175 countries are trying to forge the world\u2019s first Global Plastics Treaty.",
      "Campaigners hope the talks, running Tuesday through Aug. 14, will result in mandatory targets to reduce plastic production. A group of countries, including China, Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia, have opposed the measures, instead lobbying for increased plastic recycling.",
      "According to The Lancet, such petrochemical giants are a \u201ckey driver\u201d of spiraling plastic production as they pivot their businesses toward plastic in response to the global decline in demand for fossil energy.",

      "Unborn babies, infants and young children are \u201cespecially at risk,\u201d with harms including miscarriage, physical malformations, reduced cognitive function and diabetes, it said. For adults, the risks include cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer.",
      "\u201cGiven the considerable gaps in knowledge of plastic chemicals, it is reasonable to conclude that the full extent of these chemicals\u2019 harms to health is underestimated and that the burden of disease currently attributed to them is undercounted,\u201d it said.",

      "On Thursday, Yu Zidi became the youngest-ever medalist at the World Aquatics Championships, which are being held in Singapore this year. On Sunday, she finished fourth in the women's 400 individual medley final.",
      "Yu was part of the Chinese team that took bronze in the women\u2019s 4x200-meter freestyle relay, with the United States winning silver and Australia winning gold. Though she did not compete in the final, she received a medal because she swam in the qualifying race.",
      "\u201cI was really excited to join the relay. It felt great,\u201d Yu told reporters Thursday. \u201cThe World Championships are fun, and I hope to swim faster.\u201d",
      "The Chinese prodigy began swimming around age 6 just to beat the heat in her home province of Hebei. She said she never thought about becoming a professional athlete until a coach approached her at a swimming pool one day.",
      "\u201cAt the time, I thought: why not give training a try?\u201d Yu told Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, in May.",
      "Yu, who is also the youngest person to medal at a major international competition since 1936, swims so fast that she qualified for the World Aquatics Championships even though the minimum age requirement is usually 14.",
      "She came close to medaling in three other events in Singapore, missing the podium by 0.06 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter medley Monday, 0.31 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter butterfly Thursday and 0.50 seconds in the women\u2019s 400-meter individual medley on Sunday.",
      "At the Chinese national championships in May, Yu finished the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 2:10.63, winning a silver medal and setting a world record in the event for any 12-year-old, male or female.",
      "Hailed as the world\u2019s greatest swimmer her age, Yu has been compared to phenoms such as Canada\u2019s Summer McIntosh, who won four golds in Singapore including the 400-meter medley. Though Yu came in fourth, she is already swimming that event about 15 seconds faster than McIntosh was at the same age.",
      "Her stunning performance before she\u2019s even a teenager has many wondering how she might shape competitive swimming in the years to come.",
      "But some Chinese sports fans and commentators have urged the public not to overhype the preteen rising star.",
      "Yu\u2019s sudden fame may expose her to \u201cdisproportionate\u201d pressure that could keep her from achieving her full potential, the state-backed digital news outlet Shanghai Observer said in an editorial Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe must let this 12-year-old grow her splash slowly into a wave,\u201d it said, adding that there is \u201cno need to rush into hero worship.\u201d",
      "The warning hinted at a shift in how China promotes its elite athletes in the wake of persistent doping allegations and what has been criticized as a \u201ctoxic\u201d fan culture.",
      "Success at the highest levels of sport has been central to China\u2019s construction of national identity, with the government focused on  dominating medal tables at the Olympics and other events.",
      "But the push for gold medals also puts a lot of stress on the countries\u2019 star athletes, as does the intensity of public scrutiny.",
      "Organized sports fandom first emerged around 2016 when Chinese social media users, jaded by sex scandals that had tarnished the wholesome image of pop stars they previously adored, began following Olympic athletes instead, said Zhang Bin, a veteran sports commentator in China.",
      "The new fans brought \u201csophisticated strategies\u201d from the entertainment industry, setting off \u201cfandom wars\u201d among different groups that tried to outdo each other in supporting their athletes, Zhang said.",
      "China\u2019s extreme sports fan culture, which can include fan mobs, cyberbullying of athletes and heckling behavior at sports events, was especially visible around the Paris Olympics last year.",
      "When gold-medal-winning diver Quan Hongchan returned to her hometown, visitors flocked to her home for days. Some livestreamed with their phones while others flew drones, and travel agencies even started offering tours of her village.",
      "Pan Zhanle, an Olympic champion swimmer, was praised for disbanding his official fan group after his success at the Paris Games overwhelmed him with a surge of new followers.",
      "The Chinese government has been cracking down, with its cyberspace watchdog saying in April that it had shut down over 3,700 social media accounts with illegal or noncompliant content aimed at Chinese athletes.",
      "But sometimes the frenzy goes beyond the internet. Chinese table tennis player Fan Zhendong, an Olympic gold medalist, said he was traumatized when a stranger sneaked into his hotel room in 2023.",
      "\u201cI never thought, as an athlete, I would have to go through something like this,\u201d he told Phoenix TV last week, adding that organized online abuse had caused him \u201csevere\u201d mental stress that contributed to several unexpected losses.",
      "Since sports prodigies naturally attract followers, fan groups could also be a concern for Yu in the future, said Zhang, who was at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore.",
      "China is often overprotective of its athletes, but it \u201cmay not be a good thing if Yu is living in isolation like protected giant pandas,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor athletes, learning to interact with the media is a necessary part of their development,\u201d Zhang added.",
      "Jessie Zhou, 23, a graduate student in Hong Kong who closely follows table tennis star Fan, said it was a \u201cgood call\u201d for Chinese media to cover Yu in a \u201crestrained tone\u201d while extreme sports fandom remains unresolved.",
      "\u201cJust let the kid stay focused on training,\u201d Zhou said."

      "In a post on X, Witkoff said the visit's purpose was to give Trump a \"clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza.\"",
      "After Gaza, Witkoff on Saturday visited Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, where families of Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas were demanding that the Israeli government secure a deal to release the remaining hostages. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "According to a statement by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Witkoff told them, \u201cWe will get your children home and hold Hamas responsible for any bad acts on their part.\u201d He added, \u201cWe will do what\u2019s right for the Gazan people.\u201d",
      "The protests came after a video of an Israeli hostage in Gaza, Rom Braslavski, was released by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad on Thursday. A day later, Hamas released a video of another Israeli hostage, Evyatar David, showing him alive but frail. It is unclear when the videos were filmed.",
      "\u201cWe cannot endure even one more minute without bringing him home,\u201d Braslavski\u2019s cousin Adam Hajaj said in a statement. \u201cThis video tore my family apart!\u201d",
      "Huckabee, meanwhile, hailed GHF's distribution of over a million meals a day, which at Gaza's population of roughly 2 million people averages to half a meal per person per day.",
      "GHF stepped in to distribute food in the weeks after Israel lifted its nearly three-month total blockade on all food and supplies entering the enclave. But the aid GHF distributed, alongside some limited quantities by other international organizations, fell far short of the needs of the population. Last Sunday, Israel said it was expanding aid access into Gaza after outrage mounted over the widespread starvation and surging deaths from malnutrition.",
      "GHF runs four aid sites in Gaza, and even though it claims independence from any government, it runs the sites inside Israel's militarized zone with the backing of the Israeli military.",
      "Witnesses and aid agencies have decried the aid delivery process, which, according to the U.N., has resulted in deaths of nearly 1,400 people while collecting aid, including 859 in the vicinity of the GHF sites.",
      "The Israeli military and the GHF have acknowledged that some shots have been fired but said only as warnings.",
      "\u201cUS-backed Israeli forces and private contractors have put in place a flawed, militarized aid distribution system that has turned aid distributions into regular bloodbaths,\u201d New York-based Human Rights Watch said Friday.",
      "Burgos' colleague, Dr. Tom Adamkiewicz, urged the diplomats to see \"what\u2019s happening to the children, the families, to these young boys and women and men that are being basically shot at like rabbits.\""
