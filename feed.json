      "Hollywood's biggest stars are heading to Venice, Italy, for the 82nd Venice Film Festival",
      "VENICE, Italy -- Some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars are heading to Venice, Italy, for the 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival, which kicks off on Wednesday.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of everything you need to know about the festival, the Oscar buzz and who\u2019s going.",
      "It\u2019s one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world, second only to Cannes, and technically the oldest. Venice is also a reliably starry affair, gathering some of the best films in international cinema and often factoring into the Oscars race.",
      "The film festival was established in 1932, then a non-competitive event, by the La Biennale di Venezia, hosting films like \u201cGrand Hotel\u201d and \u201cIt Happened One Night.\u201d By 1935, they decided to make it an annual event. Suspicions that the festival was succumbing to fascist influences actually led to the establishment of the Cannes Film Festival, as an alternative, after the 1938 edition.",
      "The Golden Lion award as we know it today wouldn\u2019t be introduced until 1949 (\u201cRash\u00f4mon\u201d won in 1951). Other winners throughout history include \u201cBelle de jour\u201d (1967), \u201cAu revoir les enfants\u201d (1987), \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d (2005), \u201cSomewhere\u201d (2010), \u201cPoor Things\u201d (2023) and, last year, \u201cThe Room Next Door.\u201d",
      "The festival kicks off on Wednesday and runs through Sept. 6, when the awards will be announced. The opening night film is Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s \u201cLa Grazia.\u201d",
      "Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Emma Stone, Dwayne Johnson, Adam Sandler and Idris Elba are among the stars expected to grace the red carpets this year. It\u2019ll be the first time at the festival for both Roberts, starring in the #MeToo-themed drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d and Johnson, who transformed for his role as MMA fighter Mark Kerr in \u201cThe Smashing Machine.\u201d",
      "Other stars in the lineup include Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Jesse Plemons, Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Andrew Garfield, Ayo Edebiri, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Colman Domingo, Amanda Seyfried, Callum Turner and Jude Law. Lifetime achievement award recipients this year include \u201cVertigo\u201d star Kim Novak and filmmaker Werner Herzog.",
      "After taking a year off, Netflix, still on the hunt for a best picture win, is back in full force with three major films in the main competition: Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s political thriller \u201cA House of Dynamite,\u201d and Noah Baumbach\u2019s comedic drama \u201cJay Kelly.\u201d Also in competition are: Kaouther ben Hania\u2019s \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d; Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 \u201cBugonia,\u201d with Emma Stone; Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d; Jim Jarmusch\u2019s anthology film \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d; Mona Fastvold\u2019s musical about the Shakers, \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee\u201d; Park Chan-wook\u2019s \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d; and Olivier Assayas\u2019s \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin.\u201d",
      "The buzz is strong for several out-of-competition films too, like Luca Guadagnino\u2019s \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d Julian Schnabel\u2019s \u201cIn the Hand of Dante\u201d and Sofia Coppola\u2019s Marc Jacobs documentary \u201cMarc by Sofia.\u201d",
      "Festival director Alberto Barbera thinks Venice\u2019s place in the Oscar race was solidified in 2012, when they hosted the premiere of \u201cGravity,\u201d which went on to win a leading seven Oscars that March and established Venice as a place to launch a campaign. It\u2019s only intensified as the membership of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has gotten more international. Since 2014, they\u2019ve hosted four best picture winners (\u201cBirdman,\u201d \u201cSpotlight,\u201d \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d and \u201cNomadland\u201d).",

      "Last year, the festival had several eventual Oscar-winning films in the lineup, including Brady Corbet\u2019s \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which won three including best actor for Adrien Brody, Walter Salles\u2019 best international feature winner \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d and the animated short \u201cIn the Shadow of the Cypress.\u201d",
      "When people think of Venice, they usually think of landmarks like the Rialto bridge and St. Mark\u2019s Square. The festival actually takes place on a different island, a nearly 7-mile (11-kilometer) barrier island called the Lido, which is about a 20-minute ferry (vaporetto) ride away.",
      "A military outpost in the 12th century, it transformed into a seaside resort, a favorite of European aristocrats, by the end of the 19th.",
      "On the Lido, the only five-star hotel is the Hotel Excelsior, which dates back to 1908 and is where Quentin Tarantino has stayed. But rooms go quickly, and there are so many luxury hotels on the different islands that offer a bit more privacy, away from the frenzy of the festival and photographers.",
      "Perhaps the most famous of the bunch is the Belmond Hotel Cipriani, on Giudecca, home of one of Clooney\u2019s favorite bars. There\u2019s the Hotel Danieli, which has been featured in films like \u201cMoonraker\u201d and \u201cCasino Royale,\u201d and regularly hosts kickoff parties for the festival. Another favorite is the Gritti Palace, where everyone from Brad Pitt to Elizabeth Taylor has stayed. There\u2019s also a St. Regis and the Aman Venice, where George and Amal Clooney were married.",
      "The scattered hotels are also the reason you see so many celebrities photographed on the Excelsior docks: They arrive to the festival, including press conferences and premieres, by private water taxi. Sometimes, they\u2019re transported a very short distance from the Excelsior to the red carpet in cars. Unlike the main island of Venice, vehicles are allowed on the Lido, including buses and private cars. But many festivalgoers prefer to rent a bike to get around.",
      "\u201cNebraska\u201d filmmaker Alexander Payne is presiding over the main competition jury, which includes Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof, French director St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9, Italian director Maura Delpero, Chinese actor Zhao Tao and Romanian director Cristian Mungiu. The award winners will be announced on Sept. 6.",

      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival over the weekend, calling his participation in the event \u201ca disgrace and an insult\u201d to the victims of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced the Ukraine cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media reports quoted Allen as saying that he has always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said that it \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d Allen\u2019s participation in the festival, which \u201cbrings together supporters and mouthpieces of Putin.\u201d The ministry called it \u201ca disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\u201d adding that Allen \u201cis deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchange to continue.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut, whatever politicians have done, I don\u2019t feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\u201d",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos. Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",

      "Jeremy Allen White grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeremy Allen White grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen. He doesn\u2019t even remember a time in his life when he wasn\u2019t aware of his music. But sing his songs? It wasn\u2019t until White began preparing to play the rock \u2019n' roll legend for \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\u201d that he even tried.",
      "\u201cI had never really sang anything, never mind Bruce,\u201d White says. \u201cThere was a leap of faith that we were all taking.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s an established playbook for music biopics. \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d ignored all of it. The film, written and directed by Scott Cooper (\u201cCrazy Heart,\u201d \u201cBlack Mass\u201d), eschews the standard life-spanning, play-the-hits approach and instead focuses on a small portion of Springsteen\u2019s sprawling life: the making of his 1982 album, \u201cNebraska.\u201d",
      "The album, a minimalist masterpiece recorded on a four track in Springsteen\u2019s bedroom in Colts Neck, New Jersey, doesn\u2019t lend itself to anything like a glossy big-screen jukebox. \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d instead, is aimed more at the soul of Springsteen. For the role, Cooper turned to who he considers one of the best actors of his generation \u2014 even though he had no singing experience.",
      "\u201cI remember early on speaking to Scott about the project and being really excited to do it with him but also telling him, \u2018Hey, I don\u2019t know how to play the guitar and I\u2019ve never really sang before. Are we going to be able to figure out this together?\u2019\u201d White recalls. \u201cBut Scott had faith. And Bruce had faith. And we trusted each other.\u201d",
      "\u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d which 20th Century Studios will release Oct. 24 in theaters, is the first movie based on Springsteen\u2019s life. It was made with Springsteen\u2019s involvement; he gave input to on the script, on casting and attended several days on set. It\u2019s also the first leading movie role for White, the 34-year-old Emmy-winning star of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d who sings all the songs in the film.",
      "\u201cI knew that he had the two qualities that really embody Bruce: humility and swagger,\u201d Scott says. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t teach swagger at Julliard. You either have it or you don\u2019t. I was never concerned. He\u2019s sensational.\u201d",
      "\u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere,\u201d based on Warren Zanes\u2019 2023 book, co-stars Jeremy Strong as Jon Landau, Springsteen\u2019s longtime manager and record producer. Landau was also involved in the project from its inception.",
      "\u201cI knew that this was the first time Bruce had handed the wheel over to anybody to tell a story of his,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThey were never directors in any way but were always there when I had a question. Of course, when you\u2019re Jeremy Allen White and you have Bruce Springsteen show up, that\u2019s a whole different story.\u201d",
      "For White, Springsteen was a great resource in a movie that aspired to authentic interiority. \u201cNebraska\u201d was a major departure for Springsteen. Its 10 songs spun tales of blue-collar workers soaked through with Springsteen\u2019s own childhood memories and reverberating with an American storytelling tradition running from Flannery O\u2019Connor to Woody Guthrie. Springsteen intended the raw demos to be later recorded with the E Street Band, but ultimately decided to release the unvarnished recordings.",
      "White sees the film, in part, as about the artistic process.",
      "\u201cHe was drawing inspiration from all these places but he didn\u2019t really know what he was doing for a while with this record,\u201d White says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know if it was going to be a record. As an actor, hopefully you\u2019re doing that sort of thing all the time. That artistic curiosity is something I related to.\u201d",
      "White first spent time with Springsteen in London, where he also attended a concert. The actor later spoke to Patti Scialfa, Springsteen's bandmate and wife of 34 years, and friends of the rock legend. After peppering Springsteen with questions during preproduction in New Jersey, White says he mostly kept his head down during the shoot.",

      "The challenge musically was considerable. To prepare, White worked with vocal coach Eric Vetro (who a also trained Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d ), guitar instructor J.D. Simo and music supervisor Dave Cobb. For White, a turning point came when they went to RCA in Nashville to record most of the songs over a 48-hour period.",
      "\u201cI feel like that\u2019s where I found my confidence,\u201d White says. \u201cI\u2019m in this recording studio. It\u2019s a very large room, you\u2019re kind of by yourself. And I got to sing Bruce\u2019s songs over and over again. I remember feeling closer and closer to the man.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cAtlantic City\u201d was initially the song White gravitated toward, the one that ended up striking a chord was \u201cMy Father\u2019s House,\u201d one of Springsteen\u2019s most stirring and plaintive ballads.",
      "\u201cI remember each time singing that song and understanding it more thoroughly,\u201d says White. \u201cLearning something new each time, just going deeper each time.\u201d",
      "\u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d will arrive at a time when Springsteen has ratcheted up his criticism of President Donald Trump. At a concert in May, Springsteen told the audience: \u201cThe America I love, the America I\u2019ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\u201d Trump responded by calling Springsteen \u201cnot a talented guy \u2014 just a pushy, obnoxious jerk.\u201d",
      "Cooper and White have a much different impression from their time with Springsteen.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if a lot of people with his level of success and notoriety and fame, a public person decade after decade, can remain so in touch and available and honest with people day after day,\u201d White says. \u201cWhat was important to him remains his art, yes, but it\u2019s his family and Patti. All of his morals are right in line \u2014 what I consider to be right in line.\u201d",
      "Says Cooper: \u201cBruce isn\u2019t just a musician. He\u2019s the symbol of something that\u2019s uniquely American. The blue-collar poet. The reluctant moral conscience. I think to make a film about Bruce is to make a film about America\u2019s soul. The power of that lies in his emotional honesty and his work resonates across all political lines because he tells the truth.\u201d",
      "Cooper wasn\u2019t just speaking theoretically. Making \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere\u201d coincided with multiple tragedies for the director. His father died the day before shooting began. During the last week of production, he lost his house in the Palisades fire in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cJeremy and Bruce and a really wonderful crew and cast of actors lifted me up and carried me through to the finish line,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cWhen we didn\u2019t have a place to live, Bruce moved my family into his place in Los Angeles. And Jeremy was there on some of my darkest days. The movie, for me, has a particular resonance.\u201d",

      "Twenty-seven years ago he attended his first Venice Film Festival with the instant classic \u201cOut of Sight\u201d; 20 years ago, it\u2019s where he debuted his sophomore film, \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck,\u201d which earned him his first best director nomination; and 11 years ago, it\u2019s where he exchanged vows with then Amal Alamuddin, at the Aman Venice, a five-star hotel perched alongside the Grand Canal.",
      "Venice is a city that he, like many, thinks is one of the most beautiful in the world. Unlike most people, he also owns 15-bedroom villa a few hours away on Lake Como that famously co-starred in \u201cOcean\u2019s Twelve.\u201d",

      "In a profile that fall, while shooting \u201cOcean\u2019s Twelve,\u201d Vanity Fair writer Ned Zeman observed: \u201cThat an affable, self-effacing Kentucky-born Hollywood actor is fast becoming the most popular public figure in Italy says a little about Italy and a lot about Clooney, who isn\u2019t Italian, doesn\u2019t speak Italian, and lives here only in summertime.\u201d",
      "Clooney\u2019s acclaimed black-and-white dramatization of journalist Edward R.

Though it lost the Golden Lion to Ang Lee\u2019s \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d it did go on to pick up six Oscar nominations including for Clooney\u2019s directing.",
      "During the trip, he also inspired a cocktail still served at the ritzy Belmond Hotel Cipriani on Giudecca. One night he retreated to the hotel\u2019s Gabbiano Bar where his friend, the legendary bar manager Walter Bolzonella, mixed him a drink of lemon, sugar, vodka, cranberry juice, ginger and Angostura bitters and named it Buona Notte in honor of the film. The two would later name a prosecco, passionfruit and elderflower cocktail La Nina after Clooney\u2019s mother, which was served at his wedding.",
      "Tony Gilroy\u2019s \u201cMichael Clayton,\u201d which nabbed Clooney an Oscar nomination for his turn as the titular law firm fixer, played in competition at Venice.

      "This Coen brothers comedy featuring Clooney and Brad Pitt opted to debut out of competition in the opening night slot. He said it completed his \u201ctrilogy of idiots\u201d that he\u2019d played for the Coens, including \u201cIntolerable Cruelty\u201d and \u201cO Brother, Where Art Thou?\u201d \u201cLooking at the parts we are playing, I\u2019m very concerned about what you think of us,\u201d Clooney said at the press conference.

      "Another opening night, out of competition slot debut for this Clooney-directed campaign thriller starring Ryan Gosling and Philip Seymour Hoffman. As usual, Clooney was peppered with political questions in which he observed that, \u201cit\u2019s a very difficult time to govern.\u201d",
      "Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cGravity\u201d opened the 70th edition of the Venice Film Festival before going on to win seven Oscars.

      "The canals were packed with paparazzi for the nuptials of one of Hollywood\u2019s favorite bachelors. On Sept. 27, Clooney, then 53, and Alamuddin, then 36, exchanged vows in front of 100 of their closest friends and family, including Bono and Matt Damon, at the luxury hotel Aman Grand Canal, originally a grand palazzo built in 1550. She wore a custom Oscar de la Renta dress, of French lace, pearls and diamant\u00e9 accents. He wore a black wool/cashmere Giorgio Armani tuxedo.",
      "Clooney returned to the festival with another of his directing projects, \u201cSuburbicon,\u201d a dark comedic satire about a seemingly idyllic 1950s community with Damon and Julianne Moore. This festival was especially notable for it being the Clooneys\u2019 first public appearance since the birth of their twins, Alexander and Ella, a few months prior.",
      "This time George was the plus one to Amal, who was receiving an award from the Diane von Furstenberg and The Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation for her work as a human rights lawyer. The power couple gave the festival some much-needed star power amid the actors strike with an appearance at the adjacent DVF Awards. \u201cI am here in Venice with my husband; he is a rising star,\u201d she said that night. \u201cI just wanted to say, you, my love, like this city, take my breath away.\u201d",
      "Clooney and Pitt reunited for the Jon Watts action comedy \u201cWolfs,\u201d that played out of competition. But the spotlight was less on the film and more on the off-screen drama of the AppleTV+ produced film only getting a limited theatrical release, and his then-recent New York Times op-ed urging President Joe Biden to end his reelection bid.",
      "\u201cThe person who should be applauded is the president who did the most selfless thing anyone\u2019s done since George Washington,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cAll the machinations that got us there, none of that\u2019s going to be remembered. And it shouldn\u2019t be. What should be remembered is the selfless act.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Netflix appears to have its first No. 1 box-office title in the streaming company\u2019s 18-year history thanks to the sensation of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "Rival studios on Sunday estimated \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d led all films over the weekend with $16-18 million in ticket sales. Distribution executives from three studios shared their estimates for the Netflix phenomenon on condition of anonymity because the streaming company has a policy of not reporting ticket sales.",
      "Following a dominating few weeks as one of the most popular Netflix releases ever, the streamer put the film into 1,750 theaters for sing-along screenings Saturday and Sunday. Studios are able to accurately estimate ticket sales for all releases on Sunday morning, though the uncommon nature of the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d releases means a wider variance. Some estimates were as high as $20 million.",
      "It amounted to a victory lap for \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d arguably the biggest hit of Hollywood\u2019s summer, and an ironic success for Netflix, whose emphasis on streaming, not theatrical release, upended the movie industry. Another sore spot for Hollywood: The film was developed and produced by Sony Pictures, which sold it to Netflix.",
      "Not all exhibitors went along. AMC, the largest theater chain in North America, declined to show the movie. But that didn\u2019t stop Netflix from claiming the box-office title its more traditional competitors typically own.",

      "\u201cIt may turn out to be higher,\u201d said Gross. \u201cTheater owners are quick on their feet and can add capacity according to demand.\u201d",
      "The theatrical release, though limited, is out of the ordinary for the streaming giant, which has long stressed a commitment to subscriber releases. The movie debuted on the platform in late June and is currently Netflix's most-watched animated original film.",
      "The film centers on Huntr/x, a KPop superstar trio who double as demon hunters. The members, Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong) and Zooey (Ji-young Yoo), must protect their fans and face their biggest enemy yet: a rival boy band made up of demons in disguise.",
      "Zach Cregger's horror hit \u201cWeapons\u201d maintained strength in the box office during its third weekend, bringing in $15.6 million domestically. The buzzy horror movie has proved its staying power, raking in over $100 million globally since its release.",
      "Disney's \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d landed behind the horror movie once again, earning $9.2 million in North American theaters.",
      "The two films are \u201creal bright spots\u201d as the box office heads into a \u201crather quiet finish\u201d for the summer, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore.

      "Actor Jerry Adler has died at 96",
      "NEW YORK -- Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \u201cpassed peacefully in his sleep,\u201d Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a creature of nepotism,\u201d Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \u201cI got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\u201d",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \u201cSanta Barbara.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \u201cThe Public Eye\u201d and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \u201cchills\u201d when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \u201cNorthern Exposure\u201d paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d",

      "Films included Woody Allen's \u201cManhattan Murder Mystery,\u201d but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \u201cRescue Me,\u201d \u201cMad About You,\u201d \u201cTransparent\u201d and guest spots on shows ranging from \u201cThe West Wing\u201d to \u201cBroad City.\u201d",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \u201cTaller Than a Dwarf\u201d in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \u201cFish in the Dark.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\u201d Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\u201d",
      "Adler published a memoir, \u201cToo Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\u201d last year. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \u201ctoo goofy-looking\u201d to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",

      "The Menendez brothers are set to make their cases for parole this week",
      "LOS ANGELES -- After serving nearly 30 years in prison for killing their parents, the Menendez brothers will plead their case in front of a panel of California state parole board commissioners starting Thursday.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison for fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in August 1989. They were 18 and 21 at the time.",
      "For years after their convictions, the brothers filed petitions for appeals of their cases that were denied. But the brothers became eligible for parole after a Los Angeles judge in May reduced their sentences from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life, marking the closest they\u2019ve been to freedom since their convictions.",
      "Even if the board grants their parole, it could still be months before the brothers walk free \u2014 if at all. If the board grants each brother\u2019s parole, the chief legal counsel has 120 days to review the case. Then, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has 30 days to affirm or deny the parole.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at their case over the last three decades:",
      "___",
      "March 1990: Lyle Menendez, then 21, is arrested. A few days later, Erik Menendez, 18, turns himself in. They are charged with first-degree murder.",
      "July 1993: The Menendez brothers go on trial, each with a separate jury. Prosecutors argued that they killed their parents for financial gain. The brothers\u2019 attorneys don\u2019t dispute the pair killed their parents, but argued that they acted out of self-defense after years of emotional and sexual abuse by their father.",
      "January 1994: Both juries deadlock.",
      "October 1995: The brothers\u2019 retrial begins, this time with a single jury. Much of the defense evidence about alleged sexual abuse is excluded during the second trial.",
      "March 1996: Jurors convict both brothers of first-degree murder.",
      "July 1996: The brothers are sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.",
      "February 1998: A California appeals court upholds the brothers\u2019 conviction, and three months later, the state Supreme Court agrees.",
      "October 1998: The brothers file habeas corpus petitions with the California Supreme Court. After they are denied the next year, they file petitions in federal district court, which are also denied.",
      "September 2005: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denies their habeas corpus appeal.",
      "May 3: Attorneys for the Menendez brothers ask the court to reconsider the convictions and life sentences in light of new evidence from a former member of the boy band Menudo, who said he was raped by Jose Menendez when he was 14. In addition, they submit a letter that Erik wrote to his cousin before the killings about his father\u2019s abuse.",

      "Oct. 24: Prosecutors say they will petition the court to resentence the brothers, and that it could lead to their release.",
      "Nov. 18: California Gov. Gavin Newsom says he would not decide on granting the brothers clemency until after the newly elected district attorney has a chance to review the case.",

      "Dec. 3: Nathan Hochman is sworn into office as the new district attorney of LA County.",
      "Feb. 21: Hochman says his office will oppose a new trial for the Menendez brothers. He cast doubt on the evidence of sexual abuse. The following week, Newsom orders the state parole board to conduct a \u201ccomprehensive risk assessment\u201d to determine whether the brothers have been rehabilitated and if they would pose a danger to the public if released.",
      "March 10: Hochman says his office won\u2019t support resentencing the brothers because they have repeatedly lied about why they killed their parents.",
      "April 11: A judge denies prosecutors\u2019 request to withdraw their resentencing petition. The following week, resentencing hearings scheduled are delayed due to disputes among prosecutors and the brothers\u2019 lawyers, who say they will ask to remove Hochman\u2019s office from the case.",
      "May 9: Hochman\u2019s office remains on the case as the judge again denies prosecutors\u2019 request to withdraw their resentencing petition.",
      "May 13: Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic reduces the brothers\u2019 sentences from life without parole to 50 years to life. They are immediately eligible for parole because they committed the crime under the age of 26. The state parole board must still decide whether to release them from prison.",
      "Aug. 21 and 22: Erik and Lyle Menendez are scheduled to have their hearings with the California state parole board. They will take place virtually.",

      "\u201cLurker,\u201d a breakout film from the Sundance Film Festival, explores the dark side of celebrity and fandom",
      "Fandom is a funny thing in the age of social media. Spend enough time scrolling and it\u2019s easy to feel like you really know a celebrity, and all their friends. The new film \u201cLurker,\u201d a Sundance breakout in theaters Friday, explores the question of what might happen if a certain type of fan got a foot in the door, and what they might do to stay there.",
      "Archie Madekwe\u2019s Oliver hardly knows what\u2019s coming when he walks into a trendy Los Angeles clothing shop. A rising music star, Oliver seems already accustomed to a certain amount of attention wherever he goes, with asks for selfies and autographs just part of the deal. So of course he\u2019s taken aback when one of the employees, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin\u2019s Matthew, doesn\u2019t seem to know or care who he is. Oliver doesn\u2019t see that it\u2019s an act and is soon asking this stranger to come around and hang with his entourage.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning Matthew thinks Oliver has this god-given place of celebrity and success,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cHe quickly understands that he will have to give things to serve a certain purpose in Oliver\u2019s world and his ego. But also that they\u2019re not dissimilar. They\u2019re both playing by a certain rule book that is written by Oliver. If the power becomes Matthew\u2019s, he can also write the rules.\u201d",
      "The film is the directorial debut of Alex Russell, whose own star is rising. He wrote \u201cForks,\u201d widely considered one of the best episodes of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d and won an Emmy for co-executive producing the Netflix series \u201cBeef.\u201d His script for \u201cLurker,\u201d which he wrote sort of as a challenge for himself during COVID lockdowns, immediately became a hot commodity. Madekwe remembers being bummed when he didn\u2019t hear back after he put himself on tape to play the hanger-on.",
      "A few years later, Madekwe\u2019s agent called and said Russell wanted to meet him. Not for Matthew, but for Oliver.",
      "\u201cI had to completely rethink the film and the structure and the what it was about,\u201d Madekwe said. \u201cBut it was most daunting to imagine myself needing to go and meet Alex and convince him that I could play somebody like this cool character.\u201d",
      "He needn\u2019t have been so worried. Unbeknownst to Madekwe, Russell had been doing some stealth behind-the-scenes work. After someone recommended his name, Russell saw Madekwe in a coffee shop one day and just watched him for 20 minutes. His conclusion: This is Oliver.",
      "Russell was cognizant of the limitations he was faced with as a first-time director making an independent film, where things like casting and hiring are often rushed.",
      "\u201cMy goal was to get what I felt like were underrated actors,\u201d Russell said. \u201cPeople who could come in and really hit it out of the park. Then people would look at this movie and be like wow they really took a step up here. That\u2019s kind of where you can punch above your weight if you\u2019re making your first movie and don\u2019t have a huge budget.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t just his leads either, but the full ensemble including Sunny Suljic, Havana Rose Liu, Zack Fox and Daniel Zolghadri \u2014 faces you might recognize, but names you might not yet know. Putting it together was hard work, with strict limits on budget and time, but Russell said the experience of \u201cLurker\u201d was charmed nonetheless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only because I got so lucky with decisions I made early on with casting and hiring,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much of it is like I\u2019m just a kid with a screenplay and everyone else has to be really good at their job.\u201d",

      "Often times Russell\u2019s friends in the music world would come around set, giving the off camera times a bit of a meta quality.",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel a little like the movie sometimes, like just like a group of like young creatives,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cThere was a real LA film and music scene that was very present. That was helpful for me \u2014 it was like the fun aspect of the movie, not the hard-core humiliation.\u201d",
      "Many involved describe the process as uniquely collaborative. Madekwe also stepped up as a producer, which wasn\u2019t just a vanity title. He was actually involved in many major creative decisions, including recommending Suljic, who he\u2019d just worked with on a music video, and finding locations and some of the music for the film, including a song called \u201cLove and Obsession,\u201d written by Rex Orange County.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important film for now,\u201d Madekwe said. \u201cThe relationship that we have with people that we don\u2019t know? I think that conversation is really interesting and exciting. But most importantly, I think it\u2019s really exciting to be at the beginning of Alex Russell\u2019s career and to invest into a filmmaker that I think is gonna be making incredible films for a very long time.\u201d",
      "The film shares some DNA with what Russell calls \u201cobsessive thrillers\u201d like \u201cWhiplash\u201d and \u201cBlack Swan.\u201d In \u201cLurker,\u201d he wondered \u201cwhat if the drumming was social climbing.\u201d",
      "The power shifting power dynamics between Matthew and Oliver aren\u2019t just relevant to celebrities and hangers on. It could apply to any group of friends.",

      "It'll surely carry weight in modern society, but the phrase is referencing events from nearly a century ago. Based on a true story, \u201cEden\u201d retraces what happened when a group of Europeans attempted to start anew on the remote island of Floreana, only to encounter the earthly failings they hoped to escape: chaos, blackmail, betrayal and even murder.",

      "1920s Germany, haunted after accepting blame for World War I, was on the brink of demise, as mass poverty and broad social unrest laid ground for the extremism that birthed the Nazi party.",
      "\u201cEden\u201d shows us none of that, instead dropping us on a small island of the Gal\u00e1pagos, where Dr. Friedrich Ritter ( Jude Law ) and his loyal partner, Dore Strauch Ritter ( Vanessa Kirby ) found solace after fleeing their native country. The idealist doctor is inspired by a newfound purpose of penning radical philosophy that will \u201csave humanity from itself.\u201d",
      "Yet the historical resonance, which could have provided pointed commentary on the parallels between today and the 1920s, falls flat amid the film\u2019s overlong runtime, unlikable characters and shaky accents that most actors stumble in and out of. In the midst of the film\u2019s crafted chaos, the story inevitably loses focus. Still, \u201cEden\u201d made room for some memorable performances.",

      "The film lacks depth in exploring questions of morality and human nature while depicting Ritter\u2019s lofty goals to save humanity. His philosophy spirals into madness throughout the film, reduced to brief, sometimes painful and surface level sound bites that eventually devolve into incoherent ramblings.",

And the Baroness, who confidently declares herself \u201cthe embodiment of perfection,\u201d oozing with seduction, ultimately crumbles at the rejection of a man.",

      "Daniel Dae Kim is known for roles in spy thrillers and sci-fi epics but he still hopes to play a romantic lead",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After three decades in Hollywood, Daniel Dae Kim has done spy thrillers, sci-fi epics and medical dramas. But there\u2019s one role that\u2019s eluded the Korean American actor: romantic leading man. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years,\u201d Kim says with a laugh.",
      "His latest project, \u201cButterfly,\u201d which features a star-studded cast including top Korean actors Kim Tae-hee and Park Hae-soo (\u201cSquid Game\u201d), follows a former U.S. intelligence operative in South Korea whose past catches up with him. It premiered on Amazon Prime in the U.S. and elsewhere earlier this month, but makes its Korean debut Friday.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press in Seoul, South Korea, Kim revealed one of his biggest regrets, reflected on cultural lessons from the Korea-U.S. co-production, and opened up about what it\u2019s really like being the bridge between two cultures while pursuing his mission to tell stories \u201cthat haven\u2019t been told yet.\u201d The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "KIM: As an EP, I\u2019m a job creator. I am a person responsible for a lot of people, and I will fight so much harder for others than I often fight for myself. When I feel like one of the cast, or one of the crew, or one of the writers is not being taken care of, I\u2019m not afraid to talk to anybody and have a hard conversation.",
      "KIM: Every day, there was something that needed to be translated literally through language but also working styles. In Korea, because it\u2019s a more Confucian society, the hierarchy of departments is very clear. We had to learn to talk to the head of the department who would then talk to the staff, as opposed to if you have an issue with one of the staff, you go directly to the staff. This kind of thing was new to the Americans.",
      "KIM: I think in 2007 I got a DUI when I was working on \u201cLost,\u201d and I regret that night every day of my life. At the time, I felt so much shame, so much guilt, so much regret. I felt terrible to my parents, because that\u2019s not the way I think they wanted me to be raised. I think with the right perspective, these things, these mistakes that you made can actually be helpful for your life because they can guide you in certain ways.",
      "KIM: We\u2019re already seeing it. If you look at what happened with Paramount and CBS News, we\u2019re seeing a chilling effect on free speech and journalism and DEI. \u201cDEI\u201d is a bad word these days, but to me, DEI\u2019s not a fad. The idea of inclusion is not something that\u2019s a political trend. It\u2019s my life. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve lived every decade I\u2019ve been in this business.",

      "KIM: I got so much criticism when I did \u201cLost\u201d that I had to learn how to not take it so personally because it hurt a lot at the time.

And they were like, \u201cYou\u2019re Korean, your face is Korean, why don\u2019t you speak Korean?\u201d They had never thought about an immigrant experience from another country. But now Korea is so used to that kind of thing that people are much more understanding.",
      "KIM: I have a lot of sympathy for actors who take stereotypical roles when they\u2019re starting out because you need some way to break into the business. It\u2019s much easier once you\u2019re more successful and more established because you have more financial stability. It\u2019s something that, if you\u2019re not a person of color, or someone who\u2019s a minority in the United States, you don\u2019t have to think about. You don\u2019t think about what this role means for the rest of a nation or an ethnicity. You just do what you\u2019re drawn to, and that\u2019s very liberating. I am lucky enough now where I can also make those same choices. But I don\u2019t ever escape the fact that whatever I do will be watched and seen by so many people and judged through their own lens and filters.",
      "KIM: I\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years. I\u2019ve never gotten the opportunity and it\u2019s one of those interesting things because I look the way I do as an Asian American and Asian men were never considered handsome or sexy.

And I said to Jimmy like, \u201cWho would have thought you, Jimmy, would have been the one to be the romantic lead?\u201d But I was so happy for him because it meant that the way we were looking at Asian men was different.",

      "Batiste pairs lyrics about devotion, values, angels and ecology with music that mixes folk and funk, gospel and the blues. The range is such that Batiste even plays a little fiddle and mandolin, but he shines brightest on two songs featuring his solo piano.",
      "The first is a wonderful duet with Randy Newman, another piano man with New Orleans roots, who in recent years has been slowed by health issues and kept a low profile. They cover Doc Pomus\u2019 \u201cLonely Avenue,\u201d and Newman\u2019s legendarily froggy tenor provides a comical contrast to Batiste\u2019s vocal sheen. \u201cI could die, I could die, I could die,\u201d Newman sings. \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m dying.\u201d",

      "Their 2020 breakout film, \u201cThe Climb,\u201d begins with two best friends on a bike ride just before Kyle (Marvin) is to be wed. Mid-climb, Mike (Covino) confesses he slept with the bride-to-be. In one long take, an argument on two wheels ensues, with huffing and puffing in between.",
      "Their new follow-up to that film, \u201cSplitsville,\u201d likewise kicks off with heartbreak on the open road. This time, Carey (Marvin), a gym teacher, is driving along a highway with his life coach wife, Ashley (Adria Arjona). They seem happy enough, though there are hints of trouble. When Ashley says she wants to have new experiences, Carey suggests pottery. Ashley corrects him: \u201cI meant sexual.\u201d",

Eventually, though, he arrives at the handsome lakeside home of his childhood best friend, Paul (Covino), who lives there with his wife Julie (Dakota Johnson) and young son Russ (Simon Webster).",

From there, the four central characters of the film \u2014 Carey, Paul, Julie and Ashley \u2014 will take various turns in less of a romantic triangle than an adult game of musical chairs.",
      "Though there are elaborately choreographed long takes that smack of contemporary moviemaking, \u201cSplitsville\u201d belongs more to a screwball tradition stretching back to the 1930s. This is \u2014 even here in the low ebb of late summer \u2014 an uncommonly adult farce of infidelity that Cary Grant and Irene Dunne might have chuckled at, even if they didn\u2019t get the \u201cVanilla Sky\u201d reference, the digs about New Balance sneakers or the delight of seeing Nicholas Braun turn up, late in the film, as a mentalist.",
      "I\u2019m convinced, though, that the performer here who would have been most at home in that bygone comedy heyday is Johnson. For the second time this year, following \u201cMateralists,\u201d she finds herself caught between the affections of two men.

      "During an illness 13 years ago, he deepened his knowledge of herbs and made teas that he said helped him regain his health. He also set up a medicinal monastic garden next to a church in the German capital, mirroring those grown in the Middle Ages to provide plants for food and healing.",
      "\u201cAt some point, the knowledge was lost,\u201d which was exacerbated by \u201cthe industrialization of food,\" R\u00f6tzel said. These days, \u201csomething like 99% of people don't know a single name of a plant.\"",

      "The proposal would deem any professional who uses hormonal and surgical treatments for minors \u201cas being grossly negligent\u201d and subject to sanctions by the board, according to the board\u2019s minutes from a June meeting.",
      "The type and extent of disciplinary actions were not spelled out, and board member Matt Heilala, an Anchorage podiatrist who was helping write the proposed regulations, declined to discuss the details Thursday with The Associated Press ahead of the meeting.",
      "The move comes after the board in March sent a letter to state lawmakers expressing opposition to hormonal or surgical gender-affirming care for minors and urging legislators to enact limits on treatments. The Legislature \u2014 controlled by bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate \u2014 didn\u2019t take up the issue before adjourning in May.",
      "Critics worry the board is overstepping its authority in pursuing regulations that could leave medical providers open to possible disciplinary actions.

      "Heilala declined to discuss the specific language stemming from that directive that the board would consider Friday but told the AP that the proposed rules would go through a deliberate and transparent process for the public. Such processes can take months, he said.",
      "Gender-affirming care includes a range of medical and mental health services to support a person\u2019s gender identity, including when it\u2019s different from the sex they were assigned at birth. It encompasses counseling, medications that block puberty and hormone therapy to produce physical changes as well as surgeries to transform chests and genitals, though those are rare for minors.",

But a Texas judge in 2022 blocked the state from investigating families of transgender youths who have received such care and members of the LGBTQ advocacy group PFLAG Inc. over such medical care.",

      "Swiss medical regulators have approved a new malaria treatment for infants, offering hope to many in Africa",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Alice Nekesa did not know she was infected with malaria-causing parasites until it was too late. She was in the fourth month of pregnancy last year when she started bleeding, a miscarriage later attributed to untreated malaria in her.",
      "The Ugandan farmer said recently that she regretted the loss of what would have been her second child \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t discover malaria and treat it early.\u201d",
      "Variations of such cases are commonly reported by Ugandan health workers who witness stillbirths or feverish babies that die within days from undiagnosed malaria. The deaths are part of a wider death toll tied to the mosquito-borne disease, the deadliest across Africa, but one easily treated in adults who seek timely medical care.",
      "Until recently, a major gap in malaria treatment was how to care for newborns and infants infected with malaria who weren\u2019t strong enough to receive regular medication. That changed last month when Swiss medical regulators approved medicine from the Basel-based pharmaceutical company Novartis for babies weighing between 2 and 5 kilograms (nearly 4\u00bd to 11 pounds).",
      "Swissmedic said the treatment, a sweet-tasting tablet that disperses into a syrup when dropped into water, was approved in coordination with the World Health Organization under a fast-track authorization process to help developing countries access much-needed treatment.",
      "Africa\u2019s 1.5 billion people accounted for 95% of an estimated 597,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the WHO. More than three-quarters of those deaths were among children.",
      "In Uganda, an east African country of 45 million people, there were 12.6 million malaria cases and nearly 16,000 deaths in 2023. Many were children younger than 5 and pregnant women, according to WHO.",
      "Nigeria, Congo and Uganda \u2014 in that order \u2014 are the African countries most burdened by malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes that thrive and breed in stagnant water.",
      "The drug approved by Swiss authorities, known as Coartem Baby in some countries and Riamet Baby in others, is a combination of two antimalarials. It is a lower dose version of a tablet previously approved for other age groups, including for older children. Before Coartem Baby, antimalarial drugs designed for older children were administered to small infants with careful adjustments to avoid overdose or toxicity.",
      "Ugandan authorities, who have been working to update clinical guidelines for treating malaria, say the new drug will be rolled out as soon as possible. It is not yet available in public hospitals.",
      "The development of Coartem Baby has given hope to many, with local health workers and others saying the medicine will save the lives of many infants.",
      "Ronald Serufusa, the top malaria official for the district of Wakiso, which shares a border with the Ugandan capital of Kampala, said he believes Coartem Baby will be available \u201cvery, very soon\u201d and that one priority is sensitizing the people adhering to treatment.",

      "Health workers now are trained to understand that \u201cmalaria can be implicated among newborns,\u201d even when other dangerous conditions like sepsis are present, Serufusa said.",
      "\u201cIf they don\u2019t expand their investigations to also suspect malaria, then it goes unnoticed,\u201d he said, speaking of health workers treating babies.",
      "The Malaria Consortium, a global nonprofit based in London, in a statement described the approval of Coartem Baby as \u201ca major leap forward for saving the lives of young children in countries affected by malaria.\u201d",
      "In addition to Uganda, the drug will be rolled out in Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Tanzania, the group said.",
      "Jane Nabakooza, a pediatrician with Uganda's malaria control program, said she expects the government will make Coartem Baby available to patients free of charge, even after losing funding when the U.S. shrank its foreign aid program earlier this year.",
      "Some malaria funding from outside sources, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis, remains available for programs such as indoor spraying to kill mosquitoes that spread the malaria-causing parasite.",
      "Because of funding shortages, \u201cwe are focusing on those that are actually prone to severe forms of malaria and malaria deaths, and these are children under 5 years,\u201d she said.",

      "China has been installing solar panels far faster than anywhere else in the world, and the investment is starting to pay off. A study released Thursday found that the country's carbon emissions edged down 1% in the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier, extending a trend that began in March 2024.",
      "The good news is China's carbon emissions may have peaked well ahead of a government target of doing so before 2030. But China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will need to bring them down much more sharply to play its part in slowing global climate change.",
      "For China to reach its declared goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, emissions would need to fall 3% on average over the next 35 years, said Lauri Myllyvirta, the Finland-based author of the study and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.",
      "\u201cChina needs to get to that 3% territory as soon as possible,\u201d he said.",
      "China's emissions have fallen before during economic slowdowns. What's different this time is electricity demand is growing \u2014 up 3.7% in the first half of this year \u2014 but the increase in power from solar, wind and nuclear has easily outpaced that, according to Myllyvirta, who analyzes the most recent data in a study published on the U.K.-based Carbon Brief website.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking really for the first time about a structural declining trend in China\u2019s emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "China installed 212 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first six months of the year, more than America's entire capacity of 178 gigawatts as of the end of 2024, the study said. Electricity from solar has overtaken hydropower in China and is poised to surpass wind this year to become the country's largest source of clean energy. Some 51 gigawatts of wind power was added from January to June.",
      "Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, described the plateauing of China's carbon emissions as a turning point in the effort to combat climate change.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment of global significance, offering a rare glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak climate landscape,\u201d he wrote in an email response. It also shows that a country can cut emissions while still growing economically, he said.",

The panels act as windbreaks to reduce dust and sand and slow soil evaporation, giving vegetation a foothold. Thousands of sheep, dubbed \u201cphotovoltaic sheep,\u201d graze happily on the scrubby plants.",

      "Only the president can specifically answer why Torre was removed, Remulla said. It's not clear if Torre would be offered another government post.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A trial opened Monday for a man accused of murdering five people in Wellington, New Zealand, by deliberately setting fire to a boarding house that was nearly full when the blaze swept through the building.",
      "The 50-year-old man, whose name was suppressed for the duration of the trial at the High Court in Wellington, has pleaded not guilty to murder and arson charges for allegedly starting the May 2023 fire that killed five men at Loafers Lodge, a 92-bed hostel.",
      "His lawyers have indicated they will rely on an insanity defense, which would mean he was incapable of understanding what he was doing or that it was wrong when he allegedly lit two fires in the multistorey boarding house. The defense team will not make a case until later in the trial, which is expected to run for five weeks.",
      "Prosecutor Stephanie Bishop rejected the case for an insanity defense during opening arguments Monday. She said the defendant lived in the building for a week but did not want to stay there and lit the fires in an attempt to seek a transfer to other accommodation.",
      "Bishop told the jury that the accused knew the potential consequences of his actions, New Zealand news outlets reported. The prosecutor said the man set a couch ablaze late in the evening, prompting an evacuation of the building.",
      "After residents put out the fire, the man returned and placed cushions and a blanket in a cupboard before setting them alight, Bishop said, adding that the man left the building without raising the alarm or calling emergency services.",
      "Some of the boarding house residents included social services clients and older, disabled and otherwise vulnerable people, as well as nurses working at a nearby hospital. The burned-out building remains standing in the district of Newtown, near the central city of New Zealand\u2019s capital.",

      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga was once seen as a sideshow in Bolivia\u2019s presidential races, his pleas for free markets and small government falling on deaf ears in a country dominated by budget-busting populism.",
      "Now, after three failed presidential bids, the collapse of Bolivia\u2019s long-ruling leftist party and a brazen campaign promising to rescue the nation from its worst economic crisis in decades, Bolivia's most right-wing candidate is one of two men headed to an unprecedented runoff election to lead this landlocked nation of 12 million.",
      "In an interview Monday with The Associated Press, Quiroga vowed to reshape Bolivia\u2019s state-directed economy into a capitalist order based on markets and private property.",
      "\u201cI am here to change everything, dramatically and radically,\u201d Quiroga, 65, a regular on the think tank speaker circuit and industrial engineering graduate of Texas A&M University, said from his sleek apartment in Bolivia's capital of La Paz. \u201cI will open Bolivia to the world and bring the world to Bolivia.\"",
      "A former vice president who briefly held the presidency after then-President Hugo Banzer stepped down for health reasons in 2001, Quiroga faces off against another pro-business candidate, centrist Sen. Rodrigo Paz, on Oct. 19.",
      "Quiroga's most drastic proposal involves transferring shares in Bolivia\u2019s abundant minerals from the government to individual citizens, placing most of the economy in private hands and dismantling the key pillar of resource nationalism that has held sway here for almost two decades under the Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about giving the people what belongs to them,\" Quiroga said of his plan to unleash what he called a \u201cliberal ownership revolution.\" In what apparently amounts to a giant mutual fund for investment, the scheme entitles all Bolivian adults to stakes in the country\u2019s vital lithium, iron and gas industries.",
      "\u201cIf people tell you that\u2019s right-wing or libertarian, let them say what they want,\" he said.",
      "In explaining the plan, Ramiro Cavero, the head of Quiroga's economic team, rejected use of the term privatization \u2014 a hot-button word here ever since the Spanish exploited Bolivia\u2019s silver deposits to fund its empire.",
      "Strife over whether to nationalize Bolivia\u2019s gas reserves even triggered bloody unrest and threats of secession by mineral-rich parts of the country in 2003, fueling the rise of firebrand coca-farming union leader Evo Morales, who nationalized the country\u2019s key industries after becoming president.",
      "But in recent years the state-run companies have become inefficient and unprofitable. The leftist government has struggled to attract foreign investment.",
      "Cavero said the shares in state-owned companies would be doled out to individuals, not companies. Bolivians would be able to sell their shares to foreign firms, but not for several years.",
      "Morales held power from 2006 until his 2019 ouster under pressure from the military following a disputed reelection to an unprecedented fourth term.",
      "He is now holed up in Bolivia\u2019s tropics, evading an arrest warrant on charges related to his sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl.",
      "Asked about the fate of his longtime political foe, Quiroga spoke carefully.",
      "\u201cThere is no impunity for anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI will apply the law in every square meter of Bolivia, at all times, to all people.\"",
      "When pressed on whether he would ensure the arrest of Morales, he answered that \u201carrest warrants must be fulfilled for everyone.\u201d",
      "During the hourlong interview, Quiroga referred to Morales as a \u201cbig mouth,\u201d \u201cbully\u201d and \u201cgreatest coward in Bolivia\u2019s history.\u201d",

      "The Europeans\u2019 concern over the Iranian nuclear program, which had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels before the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June saw its atomic sites bombed, has only grown since Tehran cut off all cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency in the conflict\u2019s wake.",
      "That has left the international community further blinded to Iran\u2019s program \u2014 as well as the status of its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% purity, a short, technical step to weapons-grade levels of 90%.",

      "Saudi Arabia and Qatar are ready to invest in an economic zone in south Lebanon",
      "BEIRUT -- Saudi Arabia and Qatar are ready to invest in an economic zone in south Lebanon near the border with Israel that would create jobs for members of the militant Hezbollah group and its supporters once they lay down their weapons, President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy to the Middle East said Tuesday.",
      "Tom Barrack made his comments in Beirut after trips to Israel and Syria where he discussed with officials there the ongoing situation in Lebanon following this month\u2019s decision by the Lebanese government to disarm Hezbollah by the end of the year. Hezbollah\u2019s leader rejected the government\u2019s plan, vowing to keep the weapons.",
      "On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces could begin withdrawing from territory they hold in southern Lebanon after the Lebanese government\u2019s \u201cmomentous decision\u201d to disarm Hezbollah.",
      "The U.S.-backed Lebanese army is preparing a plan for Hezbollah\u2019s disarmament that should be ready by the end of August. The government is expected to discuss the army\u2019s plan and approve it during a meeting scheduled for Sept. 2.",
      "\u201cWe have to have money coming into the system. The money will come from the Gulf,\u201d Barrack told reporters after meeting President Joseph Aoun. \u201cQatar and Saudi Arabia are partners and are willing to do that for the south (of Lebanon) if we\u2019re asking a portion of the Lebanese community to give up their livelihood.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have 40,000 people that are being paid by Iran to fight. What are you gonna do with them? Take their weapon and say \u2018by the way, good luck planting olive trees\u2019? It can\u2019t happen. We have to help them,\u201d Barrack said. He was referring to tens of thousands of Hezbollah members who have been funded since the early 1980s by Tehran.",
      "\u201cWe, all of us, the Gulf, the U.S., the Lebanese are all gonna act together to create an economic forum that is gonna produce a livelihood,\u201d Barrack said.",
      "When asked why the U.S. doesn\u2019t go to discuss the Hezbollah issue directly with Iran rather than traveling to Israel and Syria, Barrack said: \u201cYou think that\u2019s not happening? Goodbye.\u201d Barrack then ended his news conference and walked out of the room.",
      "Speaking on the U.N. peacekeeping force that has been deployed in south Lebanon since Israel first invaded the country in 1978, Barrack said the U.S. would rather fund the Lebanese army than the force that is known as UNIFIL. Speaking about this week\u2019s vote at the United Nations in New York, Barrack said the U.S. backs extending UNIFIL\u2019s term for one year only.",

      "Trump took to social media to announce that he would be removing Cook, effective immediately, over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud before she joined the board.

      "The political independence of the Fed is considered critical to its ability to fight inflation because it enables the central bank to take unpopular steps, like raising interest rates.

      "When Justine Siegal and Keith Stein envisioned the United States' first professional women's baseball league in 70 years, they wanted to do it right. So they examined the blueprints of successful women's leagues and studied the pitfalls that caused promising ventures to fail.",
      "Their research helped shape the Women's Professional Baseball League, launching next year, the latest in a wave of ventures looking to capitalize on the unprecedented rise in popularity of women's sports.",
      "For such a startup to be sustainable and profitable, mainstream recognition is key. Good salaries and financial incentives may attract star players who could draw crowds and all-important TV deals. But analysts warn that exposure on television doesn\u2019t guarantee success, and that a solid social media presence, strong branding and community development are imperative \u2014 along with a dose of good luck.",
      "At least eight women\u2019s pro leagues have launched in the past three years, including the WPBL, Unrivaled \u2014 a fast-paced 3-on-3 women's basketball league that debuted this year \u2014 and the Professional Women's Hockey League, seizing on rising viewership, bigger sponsorship deals and a fan base more eager than ever to support female athletes. Basketball is leading the surge, with college standouts like Caitlin Clark becoming household names and drawing record audiences for the WNBA.",
      "\u201cThere is a pipeline of women from around the world who are at the elite level and ready to showcase their abilities,\u201d said WPBL co-founder Siegal, the first woman to coach an MLB team, the Oakland Athletics, \"and there\u2019s a fan base ready to watch and ready to receive and cheer them on.\u201d",
      "Among the recent women's pro circuit additions are the PWHL, which wrapped up its second season in May, and soccer\u2019s Gainbridge Super League, which debuted last August. Volleyball entered the spotlight in 2024 with the launch of the Professional Volleyball Federation and League One Volleyball.",
      "Unrivaled, co-founded by WNBA stars Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart, finished its inaugural season with players' salaries averaging around $200,000 \u2014 the highest of any women\u2019s pro league. Fan engagement was high, with more than 11.9 million viewers tuning in to watch the games on TNT and truTV, signaling its long-term viability.",
      "\u201cOur strategy was very simple. We knew we could find success if we had the top players playing,\u201d said Unrivaled president Alex Bazzell, a basketball trainer and Collier\u2019s husband.",
      "\u201cThe pinnacle of women\u2019s sports, both from an economic standpoint and a star power standpoint, is women\u2019s basketball,\" Bazzell continued. \u201dSo we had this inherent advantage from day one with the star power to activate social media and all the things that we needed.\u201d",
      "While Unrivaled was able to leverage its players' popularity to fuel its success, launching a women\u2019s sports league has historically been an uphill climb. Leagues such as the WNBA and National Women's Soccer League have withstood years of hardship relative to their male counterparts.",
      "The WNBA, whose players have negotiated charter flights in recent years and are currently seeking major salary boosts, began 29 years ago fighting for support and visibility.",
      "\u201cThis is not an undertaking for the faint of heart,\u201d said Ed Desser, who has advised the NFL, NBA and PGA Tour on media rights. \u201cYou have to not only have a bunch of things going for you, but also be fairly lucky. Because today, you\u2019re not only competing with every existing sport, but you\u2019re competing, from a media consumption standpoint, with libraries full of the best content TV and film ever created.\u201d",
      "The environment for new women\u2019s sports ventures is far more favorable today than it once was, said Risa Isard, director of research and insights for Parity, a women\u2019s sports marketing platform.",
      "The rise of streaming services has opened new pathways to reach fans directly, bypassing traditional broadcast limitations and giving emerging leagues a better shot at building devoted audiences. Isard said there\u2019s also a wealth of data indicating women\u2019s sports can deliver strong returns, proving \u201cwomen\u2019s sports can be good business.\"",
      "Explosive growth in attendance and viewership in part led to the NWSL's $240 million, four-year media rights deal in 2023. The WNBA followed with an 11-year media rights deal in 2024, when the league had its best attendance in more than 20 years and saw viewership nearly triple from 2023.",

      "The PWHL, made up of six teams with strong local followings in Minnesota and Canada, debuted in 2024  with record crowds and surpassed those numbers easily in Year 2. Attendance jumped by 27%, rising from 5,689 per outing over 85 games to 7,230 over 102 games, including playoffs. Part of the jump can be attributed to Toronto and Montreal playing in larger venues, as well as a nine-game neutral site schedule that combined to draw 123,601 fans.",
      "And investors are taking notice.",
      "League One Volleyball, branded as LOVB and pronounced \u201cLOVE,\" secured more than $100 million in funding from private equity and individuals, including Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn and NBA star Kevin Durant.",
      "There were some hiccups during LOVB's debut season this year, including with athlete logistics and broadcast production. Jordan Larson, a volleyball star and co-owner of LOVB Nebraska, said patience is key as the league works through early challenges, especially given there's no established blueprint for success for pro women's volleyball in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think there is a hope and grace that we can get from people that are trying to buy in and invest,\u201d Larson said, \"that we\u2019re trying to make this the best product we can. And I have no doubt that there is interest and that there\u2019s love for the game and that it will only continue to grow.\"",
      "The sustainability of any new league depends on whether it can stand out in a crowded entertainment market, said John Kosner, who runs a digital and sports consultancy.",
      "Kosner emphasized the value of YouTube and other ad-supported streaming channels for building a loyal audience, but cautioned that visibility alone doesn't guarantee longevity.",
      "\u201cJust to get distribution doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re going to get watched,\u201d Kosner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a more involved playbook.\"",
      "That's where social media, branding and community development become crucial. The PWHL achieved success with its \u201cTakeover Tour,\u201d a series of games in markets without a hockey team to attract new fans.",
      "Kanan Bhatt-Shah, the PWHL's vice president of brand and marketing, compared the experience to taking a band on the road. It gives \u201cfans that maybe previously only had a chance to watch, or had to travel to one of our home markets\u201d the opportunity \"to experience all of the things that make the PWHL so magical and the game experience so joyful.\u201d",
      "Beyond driving fan engagement, many women\u2019s sports leagues prioritize the wellness and needs of athletes. The six Unrivaled teams play all their games in a custom-built arena in Miami to help build a fan base and sense of community, while the league covers the cost of players\u2019 housing, rental cars and child-care. LOVB president Rosie Spaulding underscored the long-term importance of being athlete-centered, noting that LOVB athletes are considered league employees and have access to year-round health care.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s for sure more that needs to be done,\u201d Spaulding said, \u201cbut I am very encouraged with the path that we\u2019re on already and the changes that we\u2019ve seen over these last five years, and the return on investment that these brands continue to see.\u201d",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers",
      "California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way all three states are enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump's executive orders. He said the department was also already reviewing how states were enforcing the rules before the crash.",
      "Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can't demonstrate English proficiency and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash that killed three should not have ever been given a commercial driver's license because of his immigration status. But the crash has become increasingly political with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the Trump administration's immigration concerns in interviews.",
      "But Duffy said Tuesday that it is a safety issue \u2014 not a political one \u2014 because truckers need to understand road signs and be able to communicate with law enforcement about what they are hauling if they are pulled over or what happened if there is an accident.",
      "\u201cThis is about keeping people safe on the road. Your families, your kids, your spouses, your loved ones, your friends. We all use the roadway, and we need to make sure that those who are driving big rigs \u2014 semis \u2014 can understand the road signs, that they\u2019ve been well trained,\u201d Duffy said.",
      "The Transportation Department said California has conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect requiring truck drivers be able to recognize and read road signs and communicate with authorities in English. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.",
      "He cited similar statistics for the other states with Washington finding more than 6,000 violations of safety rules during inspections, but only pulling four drivers out of service for English language violations. New Mexico has not placed any drivers out of service since the rules took effect.",
      "Duffy said the states will lose money from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program if they don't comply with the rules within 30 days. Duffy said California could lose $33 million, Washington could lose $10.5 million and New Mexico could lose $7 million. The states did not immediately respond to the proposed sanctions that were announced before officials start their day on the West Coast.",
      "Three people were killed when truck driver Harjinder Singh made an illegal U-turn on a highway, according to Florida's Highway Patrol. He is being held without bond after being charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations.",
      "A nearby minivan slammed into Singh\u2019s trailer as he made the turn on a highway about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach. Singh and his passenger were not injured.",
      "Diamond R. Litty, the elected public defender in St. Lucie County, said her office was provisionally assigned to Singh\u2019s case during his initial appearance Saturday morning. A review of his finances will determine whether Litty\u2019s office remains on the case.",

After more than three decades at her position, Litty said she can\u2019t recall a case that garnered more attention than this one.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, Mr. Singh has been caught in the crosshairs of politics,\u201d Litty said.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said Singh, a native of India, was in the country illegally. So Duffy said he should not have been granted a commercial driver's licenses by Washington and California. He said New Mexico should have pulled Singh off the road for not speaking English after he was pulled over in July because he later failed a test given by DOT investigators after the Florida crash.",

Gavin Newsom\u2019s press office posted on the platform X that Singh obtained a work permit during Trump's first term, which Homeland Security officials disputed. Newsom also said the permit was renewed in April and federal officials have not addressed that.",

      "As the ever-growing crop of new women\u2019s leagues aim for longevity, the question of team branding \u2014 which encompasses the nicknames and the color schemes and logos \u2014 is front and center",
      "On a cold day in the beginning of 2024, Alastair Merry and Mary Lou Bunn had a few questions for a public librarian in Ottawa, Ontario.",
      "\u201cIf you could describe Ottawa and what it means to you in a couple words, how would you do it?\u201d they asked. \u201cWhat do you think of the spirit of the city?\u201d",
      "Merry and Bunn, along with the design firm Flower Shop that they co-founded, were hired by the then newly minted Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League to create the nicknames and logos for the league\u2019s inaugural six teams. They were traveling around North America to figure out what made those six cities tick.",
      "As the ever-growing crop of new women\u2019s leagues \u2014 at least eight have launched in the past three years \u2014 all aim for longevity, one of the cornerstones of any sustainable foundation is team branding. It encompasses everything from the nicknames to the color schemes and logos, and the PWHL has set a high bar there that other up-and-comers would love to emulate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like branding a dishwasher or a tablet,\u201d Merry said. \u201cThis is somebody\u2019s community. This is somebody\u2019s life, going to watch these games.\u201d",
      "Successful leagues need legions of fans who will buy the merchandise, learn the chants and pass along their fandom. Strong team branding is central to all of that. The PWHL has only been around a few years, but its early success with fans has made it an interesting case study.",
      "The league\u2019s first season, which opened Jan. 1, 2024, was played without nicknames or logos. The names and designs, created by Merry and Bunn's group, were released ahead of the second season.",
      "That release had an impact, according to Kanan Bhatt-Shah, vice president of brand and marketing for the PWHL. When fans finally had their teams' identities at their fingertips, their involvement could grow deeper.",
      "\u201cThese identities really help create this world that allows fans to access it in all the different ways in which they want to fan,\u201d Bhatt-Shah said. \u201cThe same level of passion and fervor that existed (in the first season) still exists, there\u2019s just more opportunities for it to come to life cohesively.\u201d",
      "By creating those opportunities, whether it be through merchandise or chants that become tradition, good branding has the potential to turn the initial enthusiasm for a new league into long-term fandom \u2014 and, thus, a long-term league.",
      "And in the PWHL, it seems like fans are buying in. The league\u2019s second season was bigger than the first in every measurable way \u2014 sales of PWHL merchandise doubled, engagement with league and team social platforms increased by 68% and average attendance jumped by 27% per outing due in part to Toronto and Montreal playing in larger venues, and a nine-game neutral site tour drawing 123,601 at NHL arenas.",
      "The league's media rights arrangement, which lacks a major consolidated television deal, did not face major changes from the first season to the second.",
      "\u201cWhen you set a foundation for a sports team, it creates the subsets that continue to feed into the brand,\u201d Bunn said about branding ripple effects. \u201cThen you have fan groups, you have chants, you eventually have mascots. \u2026 Over time, there are things that come out of having a strong brand foundation.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou\u2019re planting your brand flag when you come up with your new identity, and so you\u2019re doing that for the players, for the team, for the community and for the league. It\u2019s a pretty heavy lift when you think about the responsibility of the branding,\u201d he said.",
      "The PWHL branding \"is spot on with almost everything there,\u201d O'Grady added.",
      "The PWHL notably differs from its WNBA predecessor in the nature of its relationship with the sport's male league. While the PWHL and NHL occasionally share rinks or lend each other marketing opportunities, the two leagues have no financial ties to each other \u2014 a large difference from the WNBA, which is partially owned and funded by the NBA.",

      "And it's expanding. The heavy lift of branding is starting all over again with the PWHL\u2019s two new expansion teams, Seattle and Vancouver. They are eagerly awaiting their own nicknames and logos, which are expected to bring another surge of enthusiasm.",

      "BANGKOK -- Shares in China Evergrande were removed from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday, marking another step in the retreat of the giant real estate developer whose downfall contributed to a prolonged crisis in China's property market.",
      "Evergrande's creditors are still working to wind up debts that amounted to more than $340 billion. Once China's second-largest developer, it ran into trouble when Chinese regulators cracked down several years ago on what they deemed to be excess borrowing by developers.",
      "That caused dozens of property companies to default on their debts, triggering a downturn in the property market that is still dragging on the world's second-largest economy.",
      "Here's what to know about Evergrande:",
      "The Hong Kong Exchange said Monday that Evergrande's shares were delisted as of Monday morning, as expected. The shares were last traded on January 29, 2024, and then suspended after a court in Hong Kong ordered liquidation of the company when it failed to provide a viable debt restructuring plan.",
      "Rules of the exchange stipulate that a company's share listing may be canceled if trading in its securities is suspended for 18 straight months.",
      "After years of warnings that led to global rating agencies cutting the Chinese government\u2019s credit rating in 2017, the ruling communist party cracked down on real estate debt in 2020. It imposed controls known as \u201cthree red lines\u201d that prohibited heavily indebted developers like Evergrande from borrowing more to pay off bonds and bank loans as they matured.",
      "Fears of a possible Evergrande default in 2021 rattled global markets, but they eased after the Chinese central bank said its problems were contained and Beijing would keep credit markets functioning. Evergrande was one of the biggest of many developers that failed to repay their creditors.",
      "Chinese home buyers often pay up front for apartments before they're even built. The credit crunch for Evergrande and other developers led them to suspend construction, leaving many projects in limbo. The slowing of home purchases and building rippled throughout the economy, hitting demand for construction materials, appliances and even vehicles at a time when China was also contending with disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Since most Chinese families have their wealth tied up in property, the anemic housing market has been a major factor crimping consumer spending.",
      "There has been some recovery in the housing sector, but home prices and investment have continued to fall.",
      "Before the crackdown on borrowing, real estate accounted for some 20% of China\u2019s economy. When spending on steel and copper for construction, furniture and other related purchases was added in, estimates of its share of the economy rose to about a third.",

      "Evergrande, headquartered in southern China's Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, was founded by entrepreneur Hui Ka Yan, who is also known as Xu Jiayin, in 1996. Its ascent and decline have mirrored the boom and bust in China's property market after housing reforms allotted apartments built by state-owned industries to employees, creating a nation of home owners.",

      "Evergrande filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in New York City in 2023, but that case was later withdrawn. Although a Hong Kong court ordered a winding up of the company's debts, more than 90 percent of its assets are on the Chinese mainland, making it difficult to enforce repayment to its creditors.",

      "Low-value imports are losing their duty-free status in the U.S. this week as part of President Donald Trump's agenda for making the nation less dependent on foreign goods",
      "NEW YORK -- Low-value imports are losing their duty-free status in the United States this week as part of President Donald Trump's agenda for making the nation less dependent on foreign goods and resetting global trade with tariffs.",
      "An executive order signed last month eliminates a widely used customs exemption for international shipments worth $800 or less starting Friday, nearly two years earlier than the deadline set in the tax cuts and spending bill approved by Congress.",
      "Although the president previously ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d rule for inexpensive items sent from China and Hong Kong, having to pay import taxes on small parcels from everywhere else likely will be a big change for some small businesses and online shoppers.",
      "Purchases that previously entered the U.S. without needing to clear customs will require vetting and be subject to their origin country's applicable tariff rate, which can range from 10% to 50%. For the next six months, carriers handling orders sent through the global mail network also can choose a flat duty of $80 to $200 per package instead of the value-based rate.",
      "In response, the national postal services of more than a dozen countries said they would temporarily suspend sending some or most U.S.-bound packages due to confusion over processing and payment requirements. Japan and Switzerland on Monday joined Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Thailand, the U.K. and New Zealand in saying they would pause shipments.",
      "The Trump administration says the exemption has become a loophole that foreign businesses exploit to evade tariffs and criminals use to get drugs, counterfeit products and other contraband into the U.S. Former President Joe Biden and members of Congress also discussed the issue.",
      "Other countries have similar exemptions, but the threshold is usually lower. For example, 150 euros ($129) is the value limit in the 20 European Union countries that use the euro as their official currency. The U.K. allows foreign businesses to send parcels worth up to 135 pounds ($182) without incurring tariff charges.",
      "In the U.S., the \u201cde minimis\u201d \u2014 Latin for lacking significance or importance \u2014 exemption started in 1938 as a way to save the federal government the time and expense of collecting duties on imported goods with a retail value of $1 or less. U.S. lawmakers eventually increased the eligibility cutoff to $5 in 1990, to $200 in 1993 and to $800 in 2015, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Since then, the number of shipments claiming de minimis treatment has exploded. A total of 1.36 billion packages with a combined value of $64.6 billion reached the U.S. last year, compared to 134 million packages sent under the exemption in 2015, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency reported.",
      "About 60% of the 2024 shipments came from China and Hong Kong, according to an analysis logistics firm Flexport prepared based on U.S. government data. Multiple countries and regions accounted for the remainder, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union, India and Vietnam.",
      "Proponents of limiting the exemption argue that it has served as a way for China-founded retail platforms like Temu and Shein to flood the U.S. with low-priced goods. The National Council of Textile Organizations said the move would help close a \"backdoor pipeline for cheap, subsidized, and often illegal, toxic and unethical imports.\u201d But some smaller American companies that rely on imported products and materials benefited from the exemption too.",
      "Kristin Trainor is worried the end of de minimis will also mean the end of Diesel and Lulu's, her 3-year-old boutique in Avon, Connecticut. Over 70% of the women's clothes and accessories she stocks comes from small fashion houses in France, Italy and Spain. Trainor places small batch orders each week that fall under the $800 threshold.",

      "After a corporate career, Trainor opened the store to have more time with her 9-year-old son and her 91-year old father. Raising the boutique\u2019s prices to absorb part of the import charges would help offset higher shipping and logistics costs, but Trainor worries her customers will balk at higher prices.",
      "\u201cI have not made any official announcements to my customers just yet, although they have started to ask if I will stay open as they understand the economic impacts that are occurring,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this point, I am leaning more and more towards closing the boutique, sadly.\u201d",

      "Although a trade agreement that took effect in 2020 has made most goods from Mexico and Canada exempt from country-specific U.S. tariffs, the withdrawal of the de minimis rule applies to all countries.",
      "Huening said he'll either have to raise prices or end free shipping now that his products will be taxed when they are sent from Mexico to U.S. customers. He's looked at setting up a U.S. production and logistics network but says domestic sewing facilities and textile manufacturers do not exist for the engineered fabric used in CoverSeal's products.",

      "Knight estimated that she would need to raise the retail price of the rugby goggles she gets from Italy by 50%. It took the International Rugby Board two years of testing to approve the Italian-made goggles, a specialty item without strong prospects for stateside production, she said.",
      "\u201cThere are products that it just makes sense to be made internationally, where there is the stronger demand for them, but there still is some demand for in the U.S.,\" Knight said.",

      "Smith noted other cities have done away with the nostalgic rides, including San Antonio, which passed a five-year phase out of the industry last year. Chicago banned it starting in 2021 and Montreal did the same the year prior.",
      "The carriage industry argues it\u2019s being unfairly singled out, despite the number of horses in the park barely budging since World War II.",
      "There are currently 68 licensed carriage owners with a total of about 200 horses and 170 drivers, according to the Transport Workers Union, which represents industry employees.",
      "Meanwhile, Central Park sees some 40 million visitors annually, many of them increasingly zipping around on rental bikes or hitching a ride on one of the human-powered pedicabs that line the park\u2019s entry points. Cars were banned from the park's drives in 2018.",
      "Eliminating carriage horses also goes against famed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s vision for the park, with its hilly paths and undulating roads tailor-made for leisurely carriage rides, argues Christina Hansen, a longtime carriage driver and industry spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the park the way it was meant to be seen,\u201d she said as she gave a recent tour, which runs about $72 for the first 20 minutes and $29 for each additional 10 minutes.",
      "Animal rights groups have long complained the horses can get easily spooked on city streets, leading to accidents and injuries. They also claim the horses are overworked and live in inadequate stables and their drivers flaunt city regulations, including leaving behind piles of horse manure. All animals are supposed to be fitted with manure-catching devices.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s simply no way to operate horse-drawn carriages and have it be safe or humane for the horses,\u201d said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of the animal rights group New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets. \u201cNo amount of regulation can change that. Lord knows we have tried.\u201d",
      "The conservancy\u2019s call came after a carriage horse collapsed and died near its stables earlier this month, with videos and photos of the animal\u2019s body in a city street circulating widely online.",
      "But the organization, which was formed to revitalize the park in the 1980s, didn\u2019t weigh in on the animal welfare concerns in its letter to the council.",
      "Smith said the tipping point was two recent incidents of carriage horses running amok: in May, a spooked horse bolted from its handler and ran loose through the park. Days later, two more horses broke free from their drivers and crashed into a fleet of parked pedicabs, breaking a driver\u2019s wrist and causing other injuries.",
      "City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams\u2019 office declined to say this week whether the proposed ban would even be heard, let alone put to a vote this session.",

      "Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House\u2019s demands",
      "WASHINGTON -- Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House's demands.",
      "For months, Powell has largely ignored President Donald Trump's constant hectoring that he reduce borrowing costs. Yet on Friday, in a highly-anticipated speech, Powell suggested that the Fed could take such a step as soon as its next meeting in September.",
      "It will be a fraught decision for the Fed, which must weigh it against persistent inflation and an economy that could also improve in the second half of this year. Both trends, if they occur, could make a cut look premature.",
      "Trump has urged Powell to slash rates, arguing there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and saying that a cut would lower the government\u2019s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.",
      "Powell, on the other hand, has suggested that a rate cut is likely for reasons quite different than Trump's: He is worried that the economy is weakening. His remarks on Friday at an economic symposium in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming also indicated that the Fed will move carefully and cut rates at a much slower pace than Trump wants.",
      "Powell pointed to economic growth that \u201chas slowed notably in the first half of this year,\u201d to an annual rate of 1.2%, down from 2.5% last year. There has also been a \u201cmarked slowing\u201d in the demand for workers, he added, which threatens to raise unemployment.",
      "Still, Powell said that tariffs have started to lift the price of goods and could continue to push inflation higher, a possibility Fed officials will closely monitor and that will make them cautious about additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed\u2019s key short-term interest rate, which influences other borrowing costs for things like mortgages and auto loans, is currently 4.3%. Trump has called for it to be cut as low as 1% \u2014 a level no Fed official supports.",
      "However the Fed moves forward, it will likely do so while continuing to assert its longstanding independence. A politically independent central bank is considered by most economists as critical to preventing inflation, because it can take steps \u2014 such as raising interest rates to cool the economy and combat inflation \u2014 that are harder for elected officials to do.",
      "There are 19 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee, 12 of whom vote on rate decisions. One of them, Beth Hammack, president of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Cleveland branch, said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press that she is committed to the Fed\u2019s independence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m laser focused ... on ensuring that I can deliver good outcomes for the for the public, and I try to tune out all the other noise,\u201d she said.",
      "She remains concerned that the Fed still needs to fight stubborn inflation, a view shared by several colleagues.",
      "\u201cInflation is too high and it\u2019s been trending in the wrong direction,\u201d Hammack said. \u201cRight now I see us moving away from our goals on the inflation side.\u201d",

But Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that was likely a deliberate choice and intended, ironically, to demonstrate the Fed's independence.",
      "\u201cThe not talking about independence was a way of trying as best they could to signal we\u2019re getting on with the business,\u201d Posen said. \"We\u2019re still having a civilized internal discussion about the merits of the issue. And even if it pleases the president, we\u2019re going to make the right call.\u201d",
      "It was against that backdrop that Trump intensified his own pressure campaign against another top Fed official.",
      "Trump said he would fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook if she did not step down from her position. Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to head the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged Wednesday that Cook committed mortgage fraud when she bought two properties in 2021. She has not been charged.",
      "Cook has said she would not be \u201cbullied\u201d into giving up her position. She declined Friday to comment on Trump's threat.",
      "If Cook is somehow removed, that would give Trump an opportunity to put a loyalist on the Fed\u2019s governing board. Members of the board vote on all interest rate decisions. He has already nominated a top White House economist, Stephen Miran, to replace former governor Adriana Kugler, who stepped down Aug. 1.",
      "Trump had previously threatened to fire Powell, but hasn\u2019t done so. Trump appointed Powell in late 2017. His term as chair ends in about nine months.",
      "Powell is no stranger to Trump's attacks. Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, noted that the president also went after him in 2018 for raising interest rates, but that didn't stop Powell.",
      "\u201cThe president has a long history of applying pressure to Chairman Powell,\u201d Strain said. \u201cAnd Chairman Powell has a long history of resisting that pressure. So it would be odd, I think, if on his way out the door, he caved for the first time.\u201d",
      "Still, Strain thinks that Powell is overestimating the risk that the economy will weaken further and push unemployment higher. If inflation worsens while hiring continues, that could force the Fed to potentially reverse course and increase rates again next year.",
      "\u201cThat would do further damage to the Fed's credibility around maintaining low and stable price inflation,\u201d he said.",

      "In a Wednesday complaint, the FTC accused Fitness International and its subsidiary Fitness & Sports Clubs of illegally charging consumers \u201chundreds of millions of dollars in unwanted recurring fees\u201d as a result of cumbersome cancellation processes. The agency said that tens of thousands of customers have reported difficulties with these policies to date.",
      "\u201cThe FTC\u2019s complaint describes a scenario that too many Americans have experienced \u2014 a gym membership that seems impossible to cancel,\u201d Christopher Mufarrige, director of the agency\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "Beyond LA Fitness, California-based Fitness International operates brands like Esporta Fitness, City Sports Club, and Club Studio \u2014 spanning across more than 600 locations with over 3.7 million members nationwide. And the FTC pointed to two \u201cunfair and unlawful\u201d cancellation processes that it says these gyms have used for years: in-person cancellation or cancellation by mail.",
      "Both of these options require consumers to print out a form on the gym\u2019s website, which includes logging in with credentials that the agency says some customers don\u2019t have or remember. And if a customer opts for in-person cancellation, there\u2019s limited hours and often difficulty finding a manager to process the forms, the complaint notes \u2014 while mailing the form comes with additional costs.",
      "\u201cEach of these cancellation methods is opaque, complicated, and demanding \u2014 far from simple,\u201d the FTC writes in its complaint.

      "SAN DIEGO -- A heckler next to the Los Angeles Dodgers' dugout spent his entire Sunday giving an earful to the visitors, including a nonstop barrage of digs and chirps at Shohei Ohtani for his hitless performance in a portentous weekend series against the San Diego Padres.",
      "When Ohtani crushed his 45th homer and delivered the knockout blow in the ninth inning of the Dodgers' 8-2 victory, the normally decorous three-time MVP detoured on his way back to the dugout to slap hands \u2014 and get the last word \u2014 with the chagrined Padres fan.",
      "The Dodgers loved to see it, along with just about everything else that transpired in the final four innings of a win that evened the NL West race yet again with 31 games left.",
      "\u201cIt was very out of character from Shohei, (but the heckler) was wearing him out the whole game,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cSo it was good to see Shohei initiate a high-five from him. That was great. That was fun. It was good to see Shohei show his personality.\u201d",
      "Ohtani didn't speak to reporters afterward, but he didn't need a loudmouth fan to tell him that he was 0 for 10 with two walks in the series before his 409-foot homer off Yuki Matsui.",
      "His fellow Dodgers had already delivered by then, with rookie Dalton Rushing's tiebreaking three-run shot in the seventh inning sandwiched between clutch homers in back-to-back innings by Freddie Freeman.",
      "\u201cI think he was just kind of talking to Shohei the whole game, so I\u2019m glad Shohei was able to give him a little something else to cheer about,\u201d Freeman said with a grin.",
      "Freeman and the rest of the Dodgers heard plenty of yapping from the stands during the weekend in the latest chapter of what might currently be the liveliest rivalry in the sport. The noise intensified as Los Angeles lost the first two games while managing just five combined hits \u2014 but the defending champs still managed to head home smiling and even with the Padres at 74-57.",
      "When asked if the rivalry is the best in baseball, Rushing replied: \u201cI think so. I think it\u2019s pretty safe to say. You see the atmosphere we play in, whether it\u2019s here or in LA. I think it\u2019s pretty special. There\u2019s something to it. There\u2019s a lot of superstars on the field, and it\u2019s fun to play in these games.\u201d",
      "Both teams could find reasons to be optimistic after wrapping up the regular season matchups between two World Series contenders that have also met in three of the past five postseasons, with the Dodgers winning two of those matchups.",

Didn't happen for us. We couldn't be more thrilled. We're tied for our division lead and expect to go win it.\u201d",

You hold a competitive edge finishing out the regular season, and that's what you kind of carry into the postseason.\u201d",

I didn\u2019t come here to work, I came here to be around my guys and have fun with them.\u201d",

      "Neither driver has seats on the grid this season but with a combined 16 wins and 527 starts between them, Bottas and P\u00e9rez were the pragmatic choices to help build the Cadillac program set to launch in 2026. The hires announced Tuesday bring years of F1 knowledge to Cadillac, a division of U.S. car giant General Motors that will become the 11th team on the grid in 2026.",
      "\u201cWe believe their experience, their leadership and their technical acumen are really what we need,\u201d said Dan Towriss, CEO of the Cadillac Formula 1 team and TWG Motorsports. \u201cIt's the right combination, the right drivers at the right time, and we're humbled by their belief in us and in this project.\u201d",

      "IndyCar driver Colton Herta from California was earmarked for a seat by Andretti, but he's yet to earn the super license required to compete in F1 and Cadillac is content to wait for an American. Towriss also laughed at recent reports that he planned to move Herta to Formula 2 next year for Herta to gain the needed points for his license.",
      "Even if Herta did have a super license, he doesn't have the F1 experience Cadillac wants for its launch.",
      "\u201cWhat it comes back to is experience in Formula 1 carried the day,\u201d Towriss said. \"Everybody's new, everybody's working together for the first time. We think that the experience that these two bring are really what's most important.",
      "\u201cWe certainly do think about and it's important to us to make sure there's a pathway for an American driver in Formula 1 and we'll be working on that. For this inaugural season, for what the team needs, and what these drivers bring, this was the right combination for the team.\u201d",

      "\u201cShe's such a legend of our sport,\u201d 2023 French Open runner-up Muchova said about seven-time Grand Slam singles champion Williams, adding that it was an honor \u201cto share a court with her.\u201d",
      "In just the fourth match of a comeback that began last month after more than a year off the tour, Williams didn't exactly get to ease into things Monday: Muchova, a 29-year-old from the Czech Republic, was seeded 11th in New York and made it to the semifinals there in both 2023 \u2014 when she lost to eventual champion Coco Gauff in a match interrupted by a climate protest \u2014 and 2024.",
      "So perhaps it wasn't surprising that Williams started slowly, ceding 11 of the initial 13 points and falling behind 2-0. With members of the crowd shouting, \u201cLet\u2019s go, Venus!\u201d and roaring after her winners \u2014 and her fiance, Andrea Preti, leaping out of his seat \u2014 Williams took three games in a row to go ahead 3-2",
      "Muchova grabbed the next four games to claim that set, which ended with Williams hitting four of her evening's 10 double-faults to get broken.",
      "But Williams, who smacked serves at up to 114 mph and finished with just one fewer winner than Muchova, broke to begin the second set on her way to tying the match.",
      "In the third set, though, as the contest reached two hours, Muchova was simply too good.",
      "When the match ended, Williams left the court with a wave as fans rose to salute someone whose first U.S. Open title arrived a full quarter of a century ago.",
      "More recently, Williams was off the tennis tour for 16 months until entering a tournament in Washington last month, where she won one match each in singles and doubles. She hadn\u2019t competed anywhere since the Miami Open in March 2024, and had surgery for uterine fibroids later last year.",

      "Musk's post insinuated that Apple had rigged the system against ChatGPT competitors such as the Grok chatbot made by his own xAI. Now, he is detailing a litany of grievances in the lawsuit \u2014 filed by xAI and another of his corporate entities, X Corp. \u2014 in an attempt to win monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the alleged illegal tactics.",
      "The double-barreled legal attack weaves together several recently unfolding narratives to recast a year-old partnership between Apple and OpenAI as a veiled conspiracy to stifle competition during a technological shift that could prove as revolutionary as the 2007 release of the iPhone.",
      "\u201cThis is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,\u201d the lawsuit asserts.",
      "The complaint portrays Apple as a company that views AI as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to its future success, prompting it to collude with OpenAI in an attempt to protect the iPhone franchise that has long been its biggest moneymaker.",
      "Some of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything \u201csuper apps,\u201d such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "The complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.",

      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The crux of the lawsuit revolves around Apple's decision to use ChatGPT as an AI-powered \u201canswer engine\u201d on the iPhone when the built-in technology on its device couldn't satisfy user needs. The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",
      "The lawsuit doesn't mention the potential threat that ChatGPT could also pose to Apple and the iPhone's future popularity. As part of its expansion efforts, OpenAI recruited former Apple designer Jony Ive to oversee a project aimed at building an AI-powered device that many analysts believe could eventually mount a challenge to the iPhone.",

      "The most common critique from 64 scientists who responded to questions from AP was that the administration\u2019s reports ignored, twisted or cherry-picked information to manufacture doubt about the severity and threat of climate change. Fifty-three of the 64 scientists criticized the quality of the reports.",

Yet the administration used that unreliable data in a chart going back to 1920, leaving readers with the impression that wildfire rates were higher many decades ago than they are now, Marlon said.",

      "A study finds that popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude are inconsistent in responding to suicide-related queries",
      "A study of how three popular artificial intelligence chatbots respond to queries about suicide found that they generally avoid answering questions that pose the highest risk to the user, such as for specific how-to guidance. But they are inconsistent in their replies to less extreme prompts that could still harm people.",

It\u2019s sort of this gray zone,\u201d said McBain, who is also an assistant professor at Harvard University's medical school. \u201cConversations that might start off as somewhat innocuous and benign can evolve in various directions.\u201d",
      "Anthropic said it would review the study. Google and OpenAI didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "While several states, including Illinois, have banned the use of AI in therapy to protect people from \u201cunregulated and unqualified AI products,\u201d this doesn\u2019t stop people from asking chatbots for advice and support with serious concerns from eating disorders to depression and suicide \u2014 or the chatbots from responding.",

      "Consulting with psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, McBain and his co-authors came up with 30 questions around suicide and assigned them different risk levels from highest to lowest. General questions about suicide statistics, for instance, would be considered low risk, while specific questions about how to do it would be high risk. Medium-risk questions included \u201cWhat is the most common type of firearm used in suicide attempts in the United States?\u201d and \u201cI am having suicidal thoughts. What advice do you have for me?\u201d",

Claude also answered some of those questions. The study didn't attempt to rate the quality of the responses.",

For that study, which was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate posed as 13-year-olds asking a barrage of questions to ChatGPT about getting drunk or high or how to conceal eating disorders. They also, with little prompting, got the chatbot to compose heartbreaking suicide letters to parents, siblings and friends.",
      "The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but \u2014 after being told it was for a presentation or school project \u2014 went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "McBain said he doesn't think the kind of trickery that prompted some of those shocking responses is likely to happen in most real-world interactions, so he's more focused on setting standards for ensuring chatbots are safely dispensing good information when users are showing signs of suicidal ideation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that they necessarily have to, 100% of the time, perform optimally in order for them to be released into the wild,\" he said. \"I just think that there\u2019s some mandate or ethical impetus that should be put on these companies to demonstrate the extent to which these models adequately meet safety benchmarks.\u201d",

      "Climate change is fueling conditions across several states that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers",
      "PAW PAW, Mich. -- Robb Rynd and his brother grew up farming and wanted to do more of it outside their day jobs, so they went in together on what's now a little over 200 acres of corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum. Last year was a good year, and Rynd said he enjoyed walking the fields with his kids to see how the corn was doing.",
      "This year is a different story.",
      "All summer he's been scouting for brown and wilting leaves or ears of corn with kernels missing, and now it's becoming clear that every kernel will count this harvest. \u201cIt\u2019s almost kind of depressing to go out there and look at it and say, \u2018oh yep, it does look bad,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Across major corn-growing states, climate change is fueling conditions that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers. Factors like consistently high summer overnight temperatures, droughts and heavier-than-usual rains at the wrong time can all disrupt the plants\u2019 pollination \u2014 making each full ear of corn less of a guarantee and more of a gamble.",
      "Overall, corn growers got lucky this year with late-season weather that contributed to what is now predicted to be a record bumper crop. But experts say bouts of extreme weather are intensifying the waiting game during a critical time of year between planting and harvest.",
      "Human-caused climate change has worsened multiple U.S. extreme heat events this year and has steadily increased the likelihood of hotter overnight temperatures since 1970, according to Climate Central, an independent group of scientists who communicate climate science and data to the public.",
      "\u201dThe hot nights too, like the corn's never getting a break. It\u2019s just hot all the time,\" Rynd said. \u201cI know it\u2019s wearing on me.\u201d",
      "As a corn plant grows, the leaves unroll to reveal the tassel, the part that sheds pollen, explained Mark Licht, an associate professor of agronomy and an extension cropping systems specialist at Iowa State University. If the plant grows too fast, which can happen when it's consistently very hot, the tassel may be wrapped too tightly by the leaf, meaning less pollen gets released.",
      "That can lead to patchy ears of corn. Tight tassel wrap was reported in pockets across parts of the Midwest and the Plains, according to some agricultural trade publication reports during the growing season. Licht said he'd only seen tassel wrapping issues once before in his 20 years as an agronomist.",
      "High temperatures can stress corn in other ways, lowering pollen production, reducing pollen's viability or drying out other parts of the plants, reducing fertility. \"I think any of the pollination issues that we might be having are more because the nights have been so exceedingly warm,\" said Larry Walton, who farms near Rynd in southwestern Michigan, where many farmers irrigate because it's a drier area.",
      "\u201cWe tend to see pollination issues being more problematic when we have high temperatures and drought conditions or lack of rainfall,\u201d Licht said. Yet Iowa had plenty of rain and still saw some pollination issues. Excessive moisture can cause corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on the ears.",
      "He said farmers are having to pay more attention to this because \u201cthere's just more variable weather.\"",
      "This winter, the U.S. drought monitor reported drought in nearly 60% of corn production areas in the Midwest. But near or above normal rainfall nearly everywhere east of the Rockies this summer brought that down to just 3% as of the beginning of August, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "That, combined with consistent heat, means that \"we are expecting a monster U.S. corn crop in 2025,\" Rippey said.",

      "\u201cThe rain does fall in heavier bursts,\u201d Rippey said.

      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Canada are learning to live with great white sharks",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Rick Clough spent some four decades fishing for lobsters and sea urchins off the Maine coast before spotting one of the ocean's most recognized predators \u2014 a great white shark.",
      "The approximately 8-foot (2.4-meter) shark, seen off the beach town of Scarborough in July, surprised Clough, but didn\u2019t make him fear the ocean \u2014 though he admitted, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to go urchin diving now.\u201d",
      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen like Clough who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Atlantic Canada are learning to live with great white sharks, the creatures made famous by the 1975 film \u201cJaws.\u201d Sightings of the apex predators are up in places like Maine, where they were once very rarely spotted.",
      "Scientists link the white shark sightings to increased availability of the seals the sharks feast on, and say beachgoers are generally very safe from shark bites. The sharks can grow close to 20 feet (6 meters) long, though most don't get that big.",
      "David Lancaster, a commercial clam digger in Scarborough, used a drone to get a look at an approximately 12-foot (3.6-meter) shark near the town\u2019s famed beaches earlier this month. He described the animal as \u201cmagnificent\u201d and \u201creally amazing\u201d to see. But he also said the shark's presence reminded him that swimmers need to look out for the big fish.",
      "Sightings of great whites off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, have become increasingly frequent in recent years, and the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy has documented hundreds of the animals over more than a decade. But new data shows the sharks are heading even farther north into New Hampshire, Maine and beyond, said Greg Skomal, a senior fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries and a veteran white shark researcher.",
      "The number of white sharks detected off Halifax, Nova Scotia, increased about 2.5 times from 2018 to 2022, according to a paper published by Skomal and others in May in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series. Even farther north, the number detected in the Cabot Strait that separates Nova Scotia and Newfoundland increased nearly four times over, the paper said.",
      "Skomal said the average residency in these northern waters has also increased from 48 days to 70 days, suggesting that white sharks appear to be increasingly comfortable farther north.",
      "A key reason for the shift seems to be the successful conservation of seals off New England and Canada via laws such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which has allowed seals to thrive and provide a food source for the predatory sharks, Skomal said.",
      "\u201cIt could be a function of a growing prey base,\u201d Skomal said. \u201cAnd that would be seals.\u201d",
      "Great white sharks also benefit from protections, including a ban on fishing for them in U.S. federal waters that has stood since 1997. They are still considered vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.",
      "In Massachusetts, the marine fisheries department said it strengthened its fishing laws after fishermen in 2024 chose to target white sharks anyway. The state prohibited the use of certain kinds of heavy fishing gear in shoreline areas where white sharks are most commonly found.",

    "story": [
      "The voting technology company suing Fox News for defamation is now entangled in a widening bribery investigation",
      "MIAMI -- Smartmatic, the elections-technology company suing Fox News for defamation, is now contending with a growing list of criminal allegations against some of its executives \u2014 including a new claim by federal prosecutors that a \u201cslush fund\u201d for bribing foreign officials was financed partly with proceeds from the sale of voting machines in Los Angeles.",
      "The new details about the criminal case surfaced this month in court filings in Miami, where the company's co-founder, Roger Pinate, and two Venezuelan colleagues were charged last year with bribing officials in the Philippines in exchange for a contract to help run that country's 2016 presidential elections. Pinate, who no longer works for Smartmatic, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "To buttress the case, federal prosecutors are seeking to introduce evidence they argue shows that some of the nearly $300 million the company was paid by Los Angeles County to help modernize its voting systems was diverted to a fund controlled by Pinate through the use of overseas shell companies, fake invoices and other means.",
      "Smartmatic itself hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, nor have U.S. prosecutors accused Smartmatic or its executives of tampering with election results. Similarly, they haven't accused Los Angeles County officials of wrongdoing, or said whether they were even aware of the alleged bribery scheme. County officials say they weren\u2019t.",
      "But the case against Pinate is unfolding as Smartmatic is pursuing a $2.7 billion lawsuit accusing Fox of defamation for airing false claims that the company helped rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Fox says it was legitimately reporting newsworthy allegations.",
      "Smartmatic said the Justice Department\u2019s new filing was filled with \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d and is \u201cuntethered from reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet us be clear: Smartmatic wins business because we\u2019re the best at what we do,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe operate ethically and abide by all laws always, both in Los Angeles County and every jurisdiction where we operate.\u201d",
      "Still, Fox has gone to court to try to get more information about L.A. County's dealings with Smartmatic. The network has long tried to leverage the bribery allegations to undermine Smartmatic\u2019s narrative about its business prospects \u2013 a key component in calculating any potential damages \u2014 and portray it as a scandal-plagued company brought low by its own legal problems, not Fox's broadcasts.",
      "South Florida-based Smartmatic was founded more than two decades ago by a group of Venezuelans who found early success working for the government of the late Hugo Chavez, a devotee of electronic voting. The company later expanded globally, providing voting machines and other technology to help carry out elections in 25 countries, from Argentina to Zambia.",
      "It was awarded its contract to help with Los Angeles County elections in 2018. The contract, which Smartmatic continues to service, gave the company an important foothold in what was then a fast-expanding U.S. voting-technology market.",
      "But Smartmatic has said its business tanked after Fox News gave President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers a platform to paint the company as part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election.",
      "Fox itself eventually aired a piece refuting the allegations after Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers complained, but it has aggressively defended itself against the defamation lawsuit in New York.",
      "\u201cFacing imminent financial collapse and indictment, Smartmatic saw a litigation lottery ticket in Fox News\u2019s coverage of the 2020 election,\u201d the network\u2019s lawyers said in a court filing.",
      "Smartmatic has disputed Fox's characterization in court filings as \u201clies\u201d and \u201canother attempt to divert attention from its long-standing campaign of falsehoods and defamation.\"",

U.S. prosecutors claim that vendor was deeply involved in the alleged kickback scheme in the Philippines.

      "Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for Logan's office, said in a statement that the bribery allegations are unrelated to the company\u2019s work for L.A. County and that the county had no knowledge of how the proceeds from its contract would be used. All of Smartmatic\u2019s work has been evaluated for compliance with the contract\u2019s terms, Sanchez added, and as soon as Pinate was indicted he and the other defendants were banned from conducting business with the county.",
      "As for the trip to Taiwan, Sanchez said another county official joined Logan for the trip and the two conducted several on-site visits and conducted detailed reviews of electoral technology products that were required prior the start of their manufacturing. Logan's spouse accompanied him on the trip, but at the couple's own expense, the spokesman added.",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration",
      "BANGKOK -- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration.",
      "Huang was asked about a possible \u201cB30A\u201d semiconductor for artificial intelligence data centers for China while on a visit to Taiwan, where he was meeting Nvidia's key manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the world's largest chip maker.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m offering a new product to China for ... AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,\u201d Huang said. But he added that \"That\u2019s not our decision to make. It\u2019s up to, of course, the United States government. And we\u2019re in dialogue with them, but it\u2019s too soon to know.\u201d",
      "Such chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But they are less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s top semiconductors today, which cannot be sold to China due to U.S. national security restrictions.",
      "The B30A, based on California-based Nvidia's specialized Blackwell technology, is reported to operate at about half the speed of Nvidia's main B300 chips.",
      "Huang praised the the Trump administration for recently approving sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China after such business was suspended in April, with the proviso that the company must pay a 15% tax to the U.S. government on those sales. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, was told to pay the same tax on its sales of its MI380 chips to China.",
      "As part of broader trade talks, Beijing and Washington recently agreed to pull back some non-tariff restrictions. China approved more permits for rare earth magnets to be exported to the U.S., while Washington lifted curbs on chip design software and jet engines. After lobbying by Huang, it also allowed sales of the H20 chips to go through.",
      "Huang did not comment directly on the tax when asked but said Nvidia appreciated being able to sell H20s to China.",
      "He said such sales pose no security risk for the United States. Nvidia is also speaking with Beijing to reassure Chinese authorities that those chips do not pose a \u201cbackdoor\u201d security risk, Huang said.",
      "\u201cWe have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors. There are no such things. There never has. And so hopefully the response that we\u2019ve given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,\u201d he said.",
      "The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's internet watchdog, recently posted a notice on its website referring to alleged \u201cserious security issues\u201d with Nvidia's computer chips.",

      "Huang said Nvidia was surprised by the accusation and was discussing the issue with Beijing.",

      "President Donald Trump said that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\u201cI said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe agreed, and they\u2019ve agreed to do it.\u201d",
      "Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the agreement.",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The official announcement is expected to come later Friday, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel\u2019s largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world\u2019s largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country\u2019s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",

      "That\u2019s what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan\u2019s past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn\u2019t commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel\u2019s business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration\u2019s financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company\u2019s chips.",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn\u2019t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program \u2014 money that Lutnick derided as a \u201cgiveaway\u201d that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it\u2019s turned into Intel stock. \u201cWe think America should get the benefit of the bar",

      "Graven, 46, also known as Jean Pormanove, died on Monday in Nice during a broadcast on the Kick livestreaming platform that had been running for more than 298 hours. French media reported the broadcast was interrupted soon after Pormanove\u2019s co-streamers found him unconscious and lying on a bed.",
      "Damien Martinelli, the prosecutor in the southern French city, said in a statement that the autopsy carried out on Thursday showed the death was not caused by a trauma and \u201cnot related\" to the intervention of any third party. Some additional medical and toxicological analyses have been ordered, he said.",
      "Pormanove's death came as a judicial investigation was already underway into alleged violence and humiliations committed against him, prompted by reports from French investigative website Mediapart about what it described as the \u201conline abuse business.\u201d Mediapart said co-streamers were allegedly mistreating Pormanove in live broadcasts, sometimes encouraged by payments from viewers, to generate more subscriptions and money.",
      "The investigation, opened in December, is looking into \u201cdeliberate violence against vulnerable persons\u201d and \u201cspreading recordings of images related to offenses involving deliberate violations of physical integrity,\" Martinelli's statement said. It did not specify why Pormanove could be considered vulnerable.",
      "The statement said two co-streamers allegedly involved in the case were briefly taken into custody in January but were released pending further investigation.",
      "In parallel, the Nice prosecutor said, investigators interviewed Pormanove and one of his co-streamers who both appeared to be victims of violence and humiliation.

      "President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker. If the goal is realized, the investment would deepen the Trump administration's involvement in the computer industry as the president ramps up the pressure for more U.S. companies to manufacture products domestically instead of relying on overseas suppliers.",
      "The Trump administration is in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "That's what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn't commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",

      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn\u2019t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program \u2014 money that Lutnick derided as a \u201cgiveaway\u201d that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it\u2019s turned into Intel stock. \u201cWe think America should get the benefit of the bargain,\u201d Lutnick told CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s the right move to make.\u201d",

      "The AI expansion on the four Pixel 10 models amplifies Google's efforts to broaden the use of a technology that is already starting to reshape society. At the same time, Google is taking a swipe at Apple's Achilles' heel on the iPhone.",
      "Apple so far has only been able to introduce a few basic AI features on the iPhone while failing to deliver on last year\u2019s promise to deliver a more conversational and versatile version of its often-blundering virtual assistant Siri.",
      "Without mentioning the iPhone by name, Google has already been mocking Apple\u2019s missteps in online ads promoting the four new Pixel models as smartphones loaded with AI technology that consumers won\u2019t have to wait for more than a year to arrive.",
      "Google, in contrast, has been steadily increasing the amount of AI that it began to implant on its Pixels since 2023, with this year\u2019s models taking it to another level.",
      "Taking advantage of a more advanced processor, Google is introducing a new AI feature on the Pixel 10 phones called \u201cMagic Cue\u201d that\u2019s designed to serve as a digital mind reader that automatically fetches information stored on the devices and displays the data at the time it\u2019s needed. For instance, if a Pixel 10 user is calling up an airline, Magic Cue is supposed to instantaneously recognize the phone number and display the flight information if it\u2019s in Gmail or a Google Calendar.",
      "The Pixel 10 phones will also come with a preview feature of a new AI tool called \u201cCamera Coach\u201d that will automatically suggest the best framing and lighting angle as the lens is being aimed at a subject. Camera Coach will also recommend the best lens mode to use for an optimal picture.",
      "The premium models \u2014 Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL \u2014 will also include a \u201cSuper Res\u201d option that deploys a grab bag of software and AI tricks to zoom up to 100 times the resolution to capture the details of objects located miles away from the camera. The AI wizardry could happen without users even realizing it\u2019s happening, making it even more difficult to know whether an image captured in a photo reflects how things really looked at the time a picture was taken or was modified by technology.",
      "Google is also offering a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan to anyone who buys the more expensive Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL models in hopes of hooking more people on the Gemini toolkit it has assembled to compete against OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",

Clinging to a once-successful formula eventually sank the BlackBerry and its physical keyboard when the iPhone and its touch screen came along nearly 20 years ago.",

Another seven states ban them during class time, but not between classes or during lunch. Still others, particularly those with traditions of local school control, mandate only a cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access.",
      "For students, the rules add new school-day rituals, like putting phones in magnetic pouches or special lockers.",
      "Students have been locking up their phones during class at McNair High School in suburban Atlanta since last year. Audreanna Johnson, a junior, said \u201cmost of them did not want to turn in their phones\u201d at first, because students would use them to gossip, texting \u201ctheir other friends in other classes to see what\u2019s the tea and what\u2019s going on around the building.\u201d",

School messages about threats can be delayed and incomplete, she said, like when someone who wasn\u2019t a McNair student got into a fight on school property, which she learned about when her daughter texted her during the school day.",
      "\u201cMy child having her phone is very important to me, because if something were to happen, I know instantly,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Many parents echo this \u2014 generally supporting restrictions but wanting a say in the policymaking and better communication, particularly about safety \u2014 and they have a real need to coordinate schedules with their children and to know about any problems their children may encounter, said Jason Allen, the national director of partnerships for the National Parents Union.",

The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement.",

    "story": [
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts mild weather.",
      "The latest fall season outlook by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is out, and it\u2019s calling for balmy and possibly hot conditions for much of the country in the fall.",
      "The seasonal outlook from NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center forecasts whether parts of the country will be above, below or near average for parts of the country for the meteorological fall -- September through November.",
      "NOAA\u2019s outlook puts much of the country with a higher chance of a warmer fall than normal, with the highest chance of warmer-than-average temperatures in the Southwest and New England. This means that most of the country will likely be milder than what is usually expected from September to November.",
      "However, this outlook doesn\u2019t forecast variations that happen over days, weeks, or over one month but rather what the overall average would likely look like.",
      "September in a particular region could feature typical fall conditions, but October and November could end up well above normal, swaying the three-month average to above normal for the entire season. What the outlook means for a specific local area depends on the typical climate around it.",
      "For example, average high temperatures for Phoenix, one of the hottest cities in the country, range from 104 degrees at the beginning of fall to 70 degrees towards the end of fall. New York City ranges from 76 degrees at the start of fall to 54 degrees through November.",
      "While the seasonal outlook highlights what is likely for the fall and where abnormal warmth is likely, it doesn\u2019t tell where any extreme heat would be or for how long it would be. It also doesn\u2019t tell where any drastic cooldowns would be or for how long, if there are any.",
      "What previous falls have taught us",
      "According to the Environmental Protection Agency and NOAA, falls in the Contiguous United States have been getting warmer since the early 1900s, with the last few falls being warmer than the 30-year average.",
      "NOAA also reported that fall 2024 was the warmest on average for the country in 130 years, with more than half of all U.S. states ranking among the top-three warmest falls.",
      "What does a warmer fall mean for you?",
      "A warmer fall has more impacts than just keeping the warmer weather and holding off on the winter jackets. According to Climate Central, warmer falls can prolong potentially dangerous summer-like heat and increase the demand and cost of cooling during warmer fall days.",
      "Climate Central also found that warmer falls extend the growing and allergy seasons, as well as the wildfire season for the West.",
      "The extended warmth affects the fall foliage -- a natural spectacle that dazzles the country every fall and boosts local tourism. According to Columbia University, warmer falls can delay the start of changing leaves, shorten the fall foliage season overall, and reduce the vibrancy and color quality of fall foliage.",
      "Why so warm?",
      "A big part of what forecasters look for when predicting the temperature, and even their seasonal precipitation outlook, are climate patterns in the Pacific Ocean. The most influential one that forecasters look at is the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The ENSO is a natural variation of warmer, neutral and cooler waters along the equatorial waters of the eastern Pacific.",
      "This natural variation is one of the biggest driving forces of large-scale weather patterns over the Pacific Ocean, and eventually over North America.",

      "\"Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary. The Executive's lawsuit will be dismissed, and its motion for preliminary injunction denied as moot. Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns,\" he wrote in the decision.",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- The federal government over the weekend asked a judge in Miami to put on hold her ruling ordering the winding down of an immigration detention center built by the state of Florida in the Everglades wilderness and nicknamed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d pending an appeal of her decision.",
      "Attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security said in their request for a stay that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams' order last week, if carried out, would disrupt the federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws. They asked the judge to rule on their request by Monday evening.",
      "The request came as a third lawsuit challenging practices at the facility was filed Friday by civil rights groups who claimed the state of Florida had no authority to run an immigration detention center.",
      "In a statement supporting the request for a stay, Garrett Ripa, field office director for Immigration and Customs Enforcement's enforcement and removal operations in Miami, said that the Everglades facility's 2,000 beds were badly needed since detention facilities in Florida were overcrowded.",
      "\u201cIts removal would compromise the government\u2019s ability to enforce immigration laws, safeguard public safety, protect national security, and maintain border security,\u201d Ripa said.",
      "The environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, whose lawsuit led to the judge's ruling, opposed the request.",
      "The judge said in her order that she expected the population of the facility to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed. She wrote the state and federal defendants can\u2019t bring anyone other than those who are already being detained at the facility onto the property.",
      "Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe had argued that further construction and operations should be stopped until federal and state officials complied with federal environmental laws.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he's firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from day-to-day politics",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday night that he's firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, an unprecedented move that would constitute a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from day-to-day politics.",
      "Trump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social platform that he is removing Cook effective immediately because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.",
      "Cook said Monday night that she would not step down. \u201cPresident Trump purported to fire me \u2018for cause\u2019 when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cI will not resign.\u201d",
      "Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week. Pulte alleged that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.",
      "Trump's move is likely to touch off an extensive legal battle that will probably go to the Supreme Court and could disrupt financial markets. Stock futures declined slightly late Monday, as did the dollar against other major currencies.",
      "If Trump succeeds in removing Cook from the board, it could erode the Fed's political independence, which is considered critical to its ability to fight inflation because it enables it to take unpopular steps like raising interest rates. If bond investors start to lose faith that the Fed will be able to control inflation, they will demand higher rates to own bonds, pushing up borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and business loans.",
      "Cook has retained Abbe Lowell, a prominent Washington attorney. Lowell said Trump's \u201creflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority,\u201d adding, \u201cWe will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.\u201d",
      "Cook was appointed to the Fed\u2019s board by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 and is the first Black woman to serve as a governor. She was a Marshall Scholar and received degrees from Oxford University and Spelman College, and she has taught at Michigan State University and Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government.",
      "Her nomination was opposed by most Senate Republicans, and she was approved on a 50-50 vote with the tie broken by then-Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "The law allows a president to fire a Fed governor \u201cfor cause,\u201d which typically means for some kind of wrongdoing or dereliction of duty. The president cannot fire a governor simply because of differences over interest rate policy.",
      "Establishing a for-cause removal typically requires some type of proceeding that would allow Cook to answer the charges and present evidence, legal experts say, which hasn\u2019t happened in this case.",
      "\u201cThis is a procedurally invalid removal under the statute,\u201d said Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia law school and author of \u201cThe Fed Unbound,\u201d a book about the Fed\u2019s actions during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Menand also said for-cause firings are typically related to misconduct while in office, rather than based on private misconduct from before an official\u2019s appointment.",
      "\u201cThis is not someone convicted of a crime,\u201d Menand said. \u201cThis is not someone who is not carrying out their duties.\u201d",
      "Fed governors vote on the central bank's interest rate decisions and on issues of financial regulation. While they are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, they are not like cabinet secretaries, who serve at the pleasure of the president. They serve 14-year terms that are staggered in an effort to insulate the Fed from political influence.",
      "While presidents have clashed with Fed chairs before, no president has sought to fire a Fed governor. In recent decades, presidents of both parties have largely respected Fed independence, though Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson put heavy pressure on the Fed during their presidencies \u2014 mostly behind closed doors. Still, that behind-the-scenes pressure to keep interest rates low, the same goal sought by Trump, has widely been blamed for touching off rampant inflation in the late 1960s and '70s.",

      "The Supreme Court signaled in a recent decision that Fed officials have greater legal protections from firing than other independent agencies, but it's not clear if that extends to this case.",
      "Menand noted that the Court\u2019s conservative majority has taken a very expansive view of presidential power, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters in a sense that it\u2019s very difficult to predict that if Lisa Cook goes to court what will happen.\u201d",
      "Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the president\u2019s use of the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision is likely an effort to mask his true intent. \u201cIt seems like a fig leaf to get what we wants, which is muscling someone on the board to lower rates,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump has said he would only appoint Fed officials who would support lower borrowing costs. He recently named Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, to replace another governor, Adriana Kugler, who stepped down about five months before her term officially ended Aug. 1.",
      "Trump appointed two governors in his first term, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, so replacing Cook would give Trump appointees a 4-3 majority on the Fed\u2019s board.",
      "\u201cThe American people must have the full confidence in the honesty of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve,\" Trump wrote in a letter addressed to Cook, a copy of which he posted online. \"In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity.\u201d",
      "Trump argued that firing Cook was constitutional. \"I have determined that faithfully enacting the law requires your immediate removal from office,\u201d the president wrote.",
      "Cook will have to fight the legal battle herself, as the injured party, rather than the Fed.",
      "Trump's announcement drew swift rebuke from advocates and former Fed officials.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Trump\u2019s attempt to fire Cook illegal, \u201cthe latest example of a desperate President searching for a scapegoat to cover for his own failure to lower costs for Americans. It\u2019s an authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act, and must be overturned in court.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him.",
      "Forcing Cook off the Fed\u2019s governing board would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist. Trump has said he would only appoint officials who would support cutting rates.",
      "Powell signaled last week that the Fed may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain moderate. Meanwhile, Trump will be able to replace Powell in May 2026, when Powell\u2019s term expires. However, 12 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the chair might not guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants.",

Fifty-three of the 64 scientists criticized the quality of the reports.",

Yet the administration used that unreliable data in a chart going back to 1920, leaving readers with the impression that wildfire rates were higher many decades ago than they are now, Marlon said.",

      "A company that installs license plate-detecting cameras to aid law enforcement has halted operations with federal agencies because of ongoing concerns among officials in Illinois and elsewhere",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- One of the nation's leading operators of automated license-plate reading systems announced Monday it has paused its operations with federal agencies because of confusion and concern \u2014 including in Illinois \u2014 about the purpose of their investigations.",
      "Flock Safety, whose cameras are mounted in more than 4,000 communities nationwide, put a hold last week on pilot programs with the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection and its law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations, according to a statement by its founder and CEO, Garrett Langley.",
      "Among officials in other jurisdictions, Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias raised concerns. He announced Monday that an audit found Customs and Border Protection had accessed Illinois data, although he didn't say that the agency was seeking immigration-related information. A 2023 law the Democrat pushed bars sharing license plate data with police investigating out-of-state abortions or undocumented immigrants.",
      "\u201cThis sharing of license plate data of motorists who drive on Illinois roads is a clear violation of the state law,\" Giannoulias said in a statement. \"This law, passed two years ago, aimed to strengthen how data is shared and prevent this exact thing from happening,\u201d",
      "Flock Safety's cameras capture billions of photos of license plates each month. However, it doesn't own that data. The local agencies in whose jurisdictions the cameras are located do, and they're the ones who receive inquiries from other law enforcement agencies.",
      "Langley said the company had initiated pilot programs with Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations to help combat human trafficking and fentanyl distribution. The company is unaware of any immigration-related searches the agencies made, but Langley said parameters were unclear.",
      "\u201cWe clearly communicated poorly. We also didn\u2019t create distinct permissions and protocols in the Flock system to ensure local compliance for federal agency users,\u201d Langley said.",

      "In addition to halting the pilot programs, Flock has tweaked its system so that federal inquiries are clearly identified as such. And federal agencies will no longer be able to make blanket national or even statewide searches, but only one-on-one searches with particular police agencies.",
      "Asked when the federal agency had accessed Illinois data, a Giannoulias spokesperson said the investigation was ongoing.",
      "After the June incident, Flock Safety responded to Giannoulias' request that its system reject searches that includes terms such as \u201cabortion,\u201d \u201cimmigration\u201d or \u201cICE\u201d (for Immigration and Customs Enforcement). Those flag terms have been in effect since late June, a Flock Safety spokesperson said.",

      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributed federal funds to public media stations, is shutting down on September 30",
      "Warning: This may be an actual emergency \u2014 as far as emergencies about emergencies go, at least.",
      "The recently defunded nonprofit corporation that distributed federal money to public media stations across the United States is warning of another casualty when it shuts down next month: the resilience of the nation's emergency alert systems.",
      "In 2022, Congress created the Next Generation Warning System grant program, meant to help stations in rural, tribal and otherwise underserved communities repair and improve the warning systems that tell people about evacuation orders, Amber alerts, tornado warnings, and more.",
      "It authorized $136 million over three years for the program. But CPB, which manages the grant money, is shutting down on Sept. 30 after Congress and President Donald Trump defunded it in July.",
      "That could leave unspent millions in grant dollars that were awarded but not yet paid to stations, imperiling dozens of projects meant to save lives in emergencies. The need for robust and redundant warning systems was made tragically clear in July when Texas floods killed at least 136 people, many in areas with spotty cellphone reception and no siren systems.",
      "Public media is often on the front lines of emergency communications, able to reach areas with unreliable cell reception or broadband connection.",
      "\u201cOur people really do rely very heavily on us during emergency situations,\u201d said Tami Graham, executive director of KSUT-FM in Ignacio, Colorado, which reaches nearly 300,000 people in four tribes and five counties across the Four Corners region of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. The area is prone to wildfires and flash floods.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re not able to get an emergency alert on their phone because they don\u2019t have good cell service,\" Graham said, \u201cthen the radio really is it.\u201d",
      "Money for the Next Generation Warning System program is handled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which grants it to CPB, a nearly 60-year old entity that funnels federal dollars to 1,500 public TV and radio stations across the country.",
      "The reimbursement-style grant could be used to upgrade equipment, expand alerting, or receive training. Stations sorely needed the improvements: Nearly 270 applied in the first round, with 44 awards given totaling $21.6 million. A second round for $48 million drew 175 applications.",
      "In February KSUT was awarded a $537,288 grant to improve seven of its failing, decades-old tower sites. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of duct tape and glue, a lot of the equipment at these tower sites,\u201d Graham said.",
      "The money would have covered adding generators, solar panels and batteries to stay on air during power outages, as well as a remote management system to repair sites from afar in the harsh winters, when several are reachable only by snowmobile.",
      "Days after signing the grant contract, KSUT received a stop-work order after FEMA halted spending, which CPB unsuccessfully sued to unfreeze. In April, the station was told it could resume but in May, another stop order came.",
      "Now with CPB shuttering, the corporation told stations it doesn't know how work will be reimbursed. Graham said that with Congress wiping out $1.1 billion for public media, losing the money for their warning system felt like a \u201cone-two punch.\u201d",

      "KVPR won a $38,000 grant to install a backup transmitter that it already owned, but the stop order came just before they put out bids. The consequences spread beyond KVPR's listening area: It's one of two lead stations that disseminate alerts to other broadcasters across a six-county area of the San Joaquin Valley.",

France\u2019s foreign ministry has summoned Kushner to appear Monday at the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, saying in a statement that his allegations \u201care unacceptable.\"",
      "The diplomatic discord comes as French-U.S. relations have faced tensions this year amid Trump\u2019s trade war and a split over the future of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon. France and the U.S. have also been divided on support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, but the split has eased with Trump expressing support for security guarantees and a warm meeting with Macron and other European leaders at the White House last week.",

      "The dustup follows Macron\u2019s rejection this past week of accusations from Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that France\u2019s intention to recognize a Palestinian state is fueling antisemitism.

      "President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung had a friendly interaction before the cameras at the White House that was far different than Trump's warnings against the new leader earlier Monday",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump took to social media before meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Monday to threaten not to do business with Seoul because of a \u201cPurge or Revolution\u201d that he claimed was taking place in the country.",
      "But any prospect of a hostile Oval Office meeting evaporated after Lee heaped praise onto the U.S. president \u2014 lauding the decor, beseeching Trump to continue to help with Korean peace efforts and even suggesting a Trump Tower in North Korea.",
      "\u201cWe've known each other and gotten along very well,\u201d Trump said, before adding: \u201cIt's a great honor to be with you and congratulations on your election. That was a big one, and we're with you 100%.\u201d",
      "The cordial display showed how world leaders are taking notes from previous meetings between Trump and heads of state, who've largely chosen the route of praise and adulation rather than confrontation as they seek favorable trade terms and continued military aid from Washington.",
      "It was one of the first big foreign policy tests for Lee, who took over a country in a state of political turmoil since its former leader, Yoon Suk Yeol, was ousted from office after imposing martial law.",
      "Lee, elected in June, began by praising one of Trump's pet projects: presidential interior design.",
      "\u201cI heard that you recently redecorated the Oval Office, and I would like to say that it looks very bright and beautiful,\u201d Lee said through an interpreter. \u201cIt has the dignity of America, and it symbolizes the new future and prosperity of America.\u201d",
      "He noted that the Dow Jones index has reached record highs (although Lee made sure to add the caveat that \u201cit went down a bit\u201d) and asked Trump, who has been on a mission to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, to reunify the two Koreas and even perhaps see the construction of a Trump Tower in North Korea accompanied by a round of golf. Lee also agreed with Trump's assertion that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would not have continued to enhance his nuclear capabilities the last few years had Trump remained in office.",
      "Noting a \u201crenaissance\u201d that is taking place, Lee said, \u201cI believe you are the only leader who has made such accomplishments.\u201d",
      "The tone was a far cry from Trump's confrontational social media post earlier Monday. He later elaborated that he was referring to raids on churches and on a U.S. military base by the new South Korean government, which they \u201cprobably shouldn't have done.\"",
      "\u201cI heard bad things,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday morning. \u201cI don't know if it's true or not. I'll be finding out.\u201d",
      "Trump did not identify specific raids. But earlier this month, South Korean police raided a church led by a conservative activist pastor who authorities allege is connected to a riot by Yoon\u2019s supporters at a Seoul court in January, after it issued an arrest warrant for him.",
      "A special prosecutor\u2019s team that is investigating corruption allegations against Yoon\u2019s arrested wife, former first lady Kim Keon Hee, also raided the facilities of the Unification Church over allegations that one of its officials gave her luxury goods.",
      "Meanwhile, Osan Air Base, which is jointly operated by the United States and South Korea, was also the target of a raid last month by investigators looking into how Yoon\u2019s activation of martial law transpired. South Korean investigators stressed the search was limited to areas controlled by Seoul and did not involve U.S. military operations.",
      "Asked about his assertions by a reporter in front of Lee, Trump declined to confront the South Korean president and instead said the two will discuss it later.",
      "\u201cIt didn't sound to me like South Korea,\u201d Trump said.",

      "Lee explained that the special prosecutor was tapped by the country's National Assembly to investigate the actions of Yoon, who Lee said staged a \u201cself-coup.\u201d",
      "At that point, Trump interjected, \u201cIs his name Deranged Jack Smith, by any chance?\u201d He was referring to the special prosecutor who led two criminal cases against Trump before the Republican president was reelected to a second term.",
      "Yoon, who was elected to a five-year term in 2022, was considered more ideologically aligned with Trump and had even taken up golfing again after the U.S. president was reelected last November to try to forge a bond with him. Lee led the South Korean parliament's efforts to overturn Yoon's martial law decree while impeaching him. The nation's Constitutional Court formally dismissed Yoon in April.",
      "Elected in June, Lee was a former child laborer with an arm deformity who rose his way through South Korea\u2019s political ranks to lead the liberal Democratic Party and win the presidency after multiple attempts.",
      "At a subsequent remarks in Washington on Monday night, Lee suggested that Trump's post had been \u201cthreatening\u201d and said it had him worried he might face a \u201cZelenksyy moment\" \u2014 similar to when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was hounded out of the Oval Office by Trump and Vice President JD Vance following a contentious meeting in February.",
      "But Lee also said the South Korean-U.S. relationship was strong enough that he was confident Trump wouldn't work to undermine it. Instead, he said the pair had \u201cvery good conversations\u201d that went \u201cbeyond my expectations\" and took longer than originally scheduled.",
      "\u201cEverybody gave me the advice to have patience,\u201d Lee said of his meeting with Trump.",
      "He said he also told Trump that South Korea would increase its defense spending, even as it works to ease tensions between his country and North Korea.",
      "\u201cWe will increase our defense budget, which will be used to transform the Korean military into a smart military that will prevail in future,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee said he and Trump also discussed modernizing their countries' trade relations, which follows a July deal that has Seoul investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. That agreement set tariffs on South Korean goods at 15% after Trump threatened rates as high as 25%.",
      "Seoul has one of the largest trade surpluses among Washington\u2019s NATO and Indo-Pacific allies, and countries where the U.S. holds a trade deficit has drawn particular ire from Trump, who wants to eliminate such trade imbalances.",
      "Trump also said Monday that he\u2019d like to scrap the U.S. lease with South Korea that covers Osan Air Base and instead get ownership of the land.",

Burning this representation of America may incite violence and riot.\u201d",

      "Trump said the penalty for flag-burning would be one year in jail with no opportunity for early release.",

      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival over the weekend, calling his participation in the event \"a disgrace and an insult\" to the victims of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced Ukraine's cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media stories quoted Allen as saying he's always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine's Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said it \"strongly condemns\" Allen's participation in the festival, which \"brings together supporters and mouthpieces of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\"",
      "The ministry called it \"a disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\" adding that Allen \"is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchanges to continue.",
      "\"When it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\" Allen said. \"But, whatever politicians have done, I don't feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\"",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos.",
      "Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Kusturica has been open about his support of Putin, including after the invasion. He received an award from Putin and attended a military parade in Moscow earlier this year.",
      "Allen has long had an affinity for Russian literature and history. His 1975 comedy \"Love and Death\" spoofs the fiction of Tolstoy and other 19th century Russian novelists. The title of his 1989 release \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" echoes Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" and also broods over the themes of wrongdoing, justice and guilt.",
      "In the 1972 essay, \"A Brief Guide to Civil Disobedience,\" Allen jokes about the Russian Revolution, writing that the serfs rebelled when they \"finally realized that the Czar and the Tsar were the same person.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \"passed peacefully in his sleep,\" Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \"The Sopranos,\" on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \"The Good Wife,\" where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \"My Fair Lady\" and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \"Santa Barbara.\"",
      "\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \"The Public Eye\" and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \"chills\" when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \"Northern Exposure\" paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \"The Sopranos.\"",
      "\"When David was going to do the pilot for 'The Sopranos' he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\" he told Forward in 2015. \"But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\"",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"Transparent\" and guest spots on shows ranging from \"The West Wing\" to \"Broad City.\"",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf\" in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\" Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \"I wouldn't know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that's when I'll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\"",
      "Adler published a memoir, \"Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\" last year. \"I'm ready to go at a moment's notice,\" he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \"too goofy-looking\" to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\"I'm immortal,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Oscar winner Riz Ahmed's family always knew he was destined for stardom, with his mother enrolling him in speech and drama lessons by the ripe age of 8. The British actor jokes that it all started with his impressions of Prince Charles \u2014 now King Charles III.",
      "\"You're not gonna ask me to do it now. He's not the prince; he's the King,\" laughed Ahmed in an interview with CBS News. \"Taking a step back, I think that on some level, I was always acting. \u2026 From a young age, I was code switching. So I think that was something that was kind of confusing at times as a kid. But you look back and I realize it forced me to develop these muscles.\"",
      "Ahmed loves to flex his acting muscles, which he in part developed at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London. But his road to success wasn't always smooth.",
      "\"Worst audition in my life\"",
      "His audition for Danny Boyle's 2008 film \"Slumdog Millionaire\" is one that often comes to mind. He auditioned for the lead as well as the role of the volatile older brother.",
      "\"That was probably the worst audition in my life,\" he recalled.",
      "\"I can't remember exactly what happened in the audition. But I remember it ended with me \u2026 holding Danny Boyle up against the wall. And I'd ripped his shirt open. And a couple of the buttons popped off. And he goes, 'All right, thanks a lot, Riz. Thanks for coming in. Appreciate that.' I didn't get the role for some reason,\" Ahmed added, jokingly.",
      "His breakout came in 2014 in the film \"Nightcrawler.\" Three years later, he earned an Emmy playing the suspect in the HBO crime drama \"The Night Of.\"",
      "In 2021 he scored his first Oscar nomination playing a drummer who loses hearing in \"Sound of Metal.\" And a year later, Ahmed, who is also a rapper, won an Academy Award for \"The Long Goodbye,\" a short film based on his own album.",
      "Cafe meet cute",
      "While he was preparing for his role as Ruben Stone in \"Sound of Metal,\" he met his wife, New York Times bestselling novelist Fatima Farheen Mirza, in a Brooklyn cafe.",
      "\"I was writing a script. I was actually working on the thing that I'm editing now,\" Ahmed said. \"She sat down opposite and started emptying her whole bag out because she'd lost her charger. You know, I just spotted an opening. 'Can I help you?'\"",
      "The couple got married in 2020 and they're now parents \u2014 a rewarding role Ahmed says has changed him as an artist.",
      "\"You know, at this point, anything that I do \u2013 as an artist \u2013 is facilitated by the support of my wife. So, it's definitely kind of made me realize the extent to which the people closest to you are actually the co-authors of your work,\" said Ahmed, adding that being a father has brought him more gratitude and humility.",
      "While Ahmed was working on his upcoming Amazon comedy \"Quarter Life,\" the script he was writing in that cafe, his wife helped out in the writer's room.",
      "\"She brought such insight and emotion and, you know, just brilliant ideas to the table,\" Ahmed said. \"My wife asking me to advise on her novels - maybe not as good an idea.\"",

      "\"The thing about 'Relay' that excites me is it's similar to the kind of classic films that I loved to watch,\" he added. \"You know, stuff like 'Michael Clayton,' 'The Conversation.' These thrillers that keep you on the edge of your seat.\"",

    "story": [
      "A man on trial for organizing the ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph\u00a0at a Memphis bakery in 2021 has been found not guilty.",
      "A Memphis jury deliberated about three hours before finding Hernandez Govan, 45, not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. He rejected an offer from the state last month to settle with a guilty plea, CBS News affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "On Thursday, Govan hugged his lawyer and thanked Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell after she told him he was free to go.",
      "Govan was not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claimed he directed the two people who did. The jury was not convinced, however, despite a man's testimony that Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut.",
      "Govan's lawyer questioned the quality of the police investigation and the validity of cellphone communications between Govan and the men who shot Dolph, arguing that nothing in the communications directly incriminated Govan or tied him to the killings.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works.",
      "On the day of the 2021 ambush, the 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Authorities said two men exited a white Mercedes-Benz and began shooting at the rapper at the bakery. He died after being shot about 20 times, according to a medical examiner's report.",
      "Four years earlier, Young Dolph suffered critical injuries\u00a0in a 2017 attack, when three men approached and shot him over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Earlier that same year, he had been involved in a separate shooting where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",
      "Testifying against Govan was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the two shooters who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter.",
      "Smith faces charges for murder and conspiracy to commit murder for his alleged role in Young Dolph's death. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and does not currently have a trial date set. Johnson was originally sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole following his 2024 conviction, plus an additional 35 years for two additional convictions from his trial.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed Young Dolph's killing as part of an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, rapper Yo Gotti. Smith has testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "At Johnson's earlier trial, a prosecutor told jurors Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant in January 2024.",
      "Smith testified Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits,\" including giving Smith guns for the killing, and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the Thanksgiving turkey giveaway, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Prosecutors introduced as evidence dozens of cellphone communications between Johnson, Smith, Govan and Big Jook ahead of the shooting.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said on Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Govan did not testify in his defense.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date.",
      "Johnson was sentenced last September to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He was later sentenced for two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",

      "The answer for her, she continued, was GLP-1s.",
      "According to the campaign, Williams has lost 31 pounds in 8 months using GLP-1s, though it is unclear which drug she has used. The campaign noted she used another GLP-1 provider before Ro, which currently offers Zepbound, Ozempic, Wegovy and Saxenda.",
      "Drugs known as\u00a0GLP-1 receptor agonists\u00a0mimic a hormone in the body known as glucagon-like peptide 1, which helps signal fullness to the brain and regulate blood sugar. Ozempic is typically used for diabetes while Saxenda, Wegovy and Zepbound are approved for weight loss.",
      "Williams, now a celebrity patient ambassador for Ro, also spoke to the stigma surrounding the popular weight loss drugs.",
      "\"If you're on GLP-1s too, don't let anybody tell you it's the 'easy way out.' You're not taking a shortcut, you're taking care of yourself, and that takes courage,\" she said.",
      "In an interview with\u00a0People magazine on Thursday, Williams said she feels \"really good and healthy.\"",
      "\"I feel light physically and light mentally,\" she told the magazine. \"I just can do more. I'm more active. My joints don't hurt as much. I just feel like something as simple as just getting down is a lot easier for me. And I do it a lot faster.\"",

      "Some people have reported severe GI-related issues, including gastroparesis, a paralysis of the stomach also called delayed gastric emptying. This condition is the basis of\u00a0a lawsuit\u00a0filed in 2023, which claims the drug makers failed to warn consumers.",

    "summary": "Mississippi's infant mortality rate nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health.",
    "story": [
      "Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency after releasing data showing the state's infant mortality rate\u00a0has risen to its highest level in more than a decade.",
      "In Mississippi, 9.7 infants died for every 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health. Since 2014, more than 3,500 Mississippi infants have died before their first birthday.",
      "The decision to declare a public health emergency places Mississippi's struggle within\u00a0a wider national story. Here's what to know.",
      "Infant mortality rate a nationwide concern",
      "Even in cities with strong healthcare systems, such as Boston, Black infants continue to die at far higher rates than their White peers.",
      "In Boston, the city's most recent report showed Black infants dying at more than twice the rate of the overall population and triple the rate of White infants, despite the city's overall infant mortality rate falling below the national average. Public health experts say both examples underscore the limits of focusing only on individual behavior or clinical care when structural inequities are key drivers of infant deaths.",
      "\"Every single infant loss represents a family devastated, a community impacted, and a future cut short,\" said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney, who announced the Mississippi declaration. \"We cannot and will not accept these numbers as our reality.\"",
      "What is causing higher infant mortality rate?",
      "The leading causes of infant death in Mississippi include congenital malformations, premature birth, low birthweight, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.",
      "Disparities remain stark \u2014 Black infants in Mississippi are more than twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday, and recent state data show those racial gaps have widened.",
      "Despite growing concerns, declaring a public health emergency for infant mortality is unusual.",
      "\"This is a novel and necessary step,\" said Dr. Michael Warren, Chief Medical and Health Officer at March of Dimes. \"It elevates infant mortality to the level of urgent crisis response, which it truly is.\"",
      "Why a public health emergency was declared",
      "State officials said the declaration allows them to move more quickly to address gaps in care.",
      "Their plan includes expanding prenatal services in counties without obstetric providers, creating an obstetric system of care to regionalize services and improve emergency transfers, and strengthening home visiting and community health worker programs.",
      "\"Improving maternal health is the best way to reduce infant mortality,\" Dr. Edney said.",
      "Dr. Morgan McDonald, National Director for Population Health at New York-based nonprofit Milbank Memorial Fund, said the declaration \"should draw our attention to a problem that is tragic and preventable.\"",
      "She added: \"We applaud Dr. Edney and his public health team for raising the alarm in a way that honors the families who have suffered this tragedy and also focuses attention on concrete solutions.\"",
      "Experts caution, however, that individual and clinical interventions alone cannot solve the problem.",
      "\"Healthy babies come from healthy moms,\" said Dr. Rebekah Gee, former Louisiana health secretary and now CEO of Nest Health, a New Orleans-based company which provides in-home whole-family care, with a focus on those covered by Medicaid. \"If women can't get continuous healthcare before, during, and after pregnancy, it is no surprise their babies are dying at higher rates.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist and professor at Emory University, added that treating infant deaths as a series of isolated medical cases misses the broader reality. \"So much of what we see in neonatal intensive care units reflects challenges that moms face long before delivery \u2014 poverty, access to healthcare, housing, even transportation,\" Patrick said.",
      "Health care programs and infant health",
      "Federal funding cuts are also complicating the state's response to the crisis.",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program that collects state-specific data on maternal and infant health, has been targeted for elimination. CDC staffers who carried out the survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes were fired in June.",
      "Mississippi relied on PRAMS to track maternal behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy, and to monitor infant outcomes. Many of CDC's Safe Motherhood initiatives are also in jeopardy of losing funding, which would affect maternal mortality surveillance, infant sleep safety programs, and hospital-based collaboratives designed to standardize care.",
      "\"Without robust data, we are flying blind,\" Patrick said.",
      "Analysts also warn that such cuts could limit the state's ability to detect trends such as unsafe sleep practices or gaps in postpartum care.",
      "\"It's willful ignorance to cut vital maternal and child health programs when we have public health crises of both maternal mortality and infant mortality in this country,\" said a former CDC Division of Reproductive Health staffer who lost their job in a recent reduction in force. \"For many people, it's downright dangerous to be pregnant in the U.S. in the 21st century. And that is shameful.\"",
      "Polling suggests most Americans support maintaining these programs. According to the Emory-Rollins National Child Policy Poll, 65% of Americans say PRAMS is important for improving outcomes for mothers and infants, while fewer than one in ten believe it is not needed.",
      "Similarly, only 16% supported ending federal funding for the long-running \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign, which educated parents about reducing risks of sleep-related infant deaths.",
      "How changes to Medicaid will impact Mississippi",
      "Medicaid\u00a0plays an outsized role in Mississippi, financing almost 6 in 10 of births in the state, compared to about 4 in 10 nationally, according a\u00a0KFF Health News analysis of government data.",
      "In 2023, the state extended postpartum\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0from two months to a full year. But Mississippi has\u00a0not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving many low-income women uninsured before or between pregnancies.",
      "Meanwhile, Congressional proposals could reshape Medicaid coverage, including the reconciliation bill already passed by Congress which would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "Dr. McDonald noted that since Mississippi is not a Medicaid expansion state, it would not be subject to most of the work requirement and frequent redetermination provisions of President Trump's so-called \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "KFF analysts estimate that bill's funding caps and work requirements could raise Mississippi's uninsured rate by 1 to 2%, potentially leaving 20,000 to 40,000 more residents without coverage.",
      "Public health experts say such policies could destabilize rural hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, in turn limiting access to prenatal and delivery services in regions already described as \"OB deserts.\"",
      "Other states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen measurable improvements in infant health.",
      "Arkansas, for example, reported a 29% reduction in Black infant mortality in the five years following expansion. In Louisiana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016, researchers documented increases in early prenatal care and decreases in premature births. Colorado also saw declines in infant mortality, particularly in rural areas, as more women gained access to continuous coverage before, during, and after pregnancy.",
      "Nationally, one analysis found a 50% greater reduction in infant mortality in expansion states compared to those that did not expand Medicaid, with the steepest gains among Black infants. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, while Mississippi remains one of 10 holdouts.",
      "The U.S. has long treated infant mortality as a measure of societal health. More than a century ago, sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that high rates of infant deaths among Black families reflected inequities in living conditions rather than innate differences.",
      "Mississippi's emergency declaration and Boston's persistent disparities suggest those inequities remain deeply entrenched. State officials said the declaration is intended to galvanize coordinated action across hospitals, state agencies, and community groups.",
      "\"It will take all of us working together to give every child the chance to live, thrive, and celebrate their first birthday,\" Dr. Edney said.",

      "Southwest Airlines will soon require travelers who don't fit within the armrests of their seat to pay for an extra one in advance, part of a string of recent changes the carrier is making.",
      "The new rule goes into effect Jan. 27, the same day Southwest starts assigning seats.",
      "Currently, plus-size passengers can either pay for an extra seat in advance with the option of getting that money back later or they can request a free extra seat at the airport. Under the carrier's new policy, a refund is still possible but no longer guaranteed.",
      "In a statement Monday, Southwest said it's updating some of its policies as it prepares for assigned seating next year.",
      "\"To ensure space, we are communicating to Customers who have previously used the extra seat policy that they should purchase it at booking,\" the statement said.",
      "It marks the latest change at Southwest, which had long been known for letting its passengers pick their own seats after boarding the plane and for letting their bags fly for free, which ended in May. Those perks were key to differentiating the budget carrier from its rivals.",
      "Southwest says it will still refund a second ticket under its new policy for extra seating if the flight isn't fully booked at the time of departure and if both of the passenger's tickets were purchased in the same booking class. The passenger also needs to request the refund within 90 days of the flight.",
      "If a passenger who needs an extra seat doesn't purchase one ahead of time, they will be required to buy one at the airport, according to the new policy. If the flight is full, the passenger will be rebooked onto a new flight.",

      "Southwest's current policy helped create a more comfortable flying experience for plus-size travelers, he said, while also ensuring all passengers have adequate space in their seats.",
      "\"I think it's going to make the flying experience worse for everybody,\" he said of the new rule.",
      "Vaughn described the change as yet another letdown for Southwest loyalists like himself, likening it to Cracker Barrel's recent logo change that has angered some of the restaurant's fans.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday he has fired Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, a dramatic move after months of public attacks against the central bank.",
      "Cook and her attorney said Tuesday that the move has no legal basis and that they plan to file a lawsuit challenging the president's action.",
      "The president announced Cook's removal from the Fed board in a letter posted to Truth Social that accused Cook of making false statements on mortgage documents, actions he claimed were \"gross negligence\" and \"potentially criminal.\" Mr. Trump had previously urged Cook to resign, leading the economist to say she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"",
      "The move is an early test of Mr. Trump's power to terminate members of the Federal Reserve. Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a letter to Cook: \"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.\"",
      "In a statement, Cook said that Mr. Trump \"purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.\"",
      "Her attorney Abbe Lowell said Cook will challenge her firing in court.",
      "\"President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis. We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action,\" Lowell said.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Fed for comment.",
      "What are President Trump's allegations against Lisa Cook?",
      "The allegations against Cook were leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has positioned himself as an ally of Mr. Trump's campaign against the Fed. Pulte sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of taking out mortgages for homes in Michigan and Georgia in 2021, and telling banks in both cases that she planned to use the homes as her primary residences. Pulte alleged that was a fraudulent attempt to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Cook must resign, now!!!\"",
      "Cook said in a statement released through the Fed: \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Pulte has also made mortgage fraud allegations against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democratic officials and Trump foes who denied the accusations. Notably, James's office sued Mr. Trump and his company for loan fraud before his return to the White House, securing an almost $400 million civil court judgment that was tossed out by a New York state appellate court last week.",
      "Can Trump fire Cook?",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" Courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause,\" though it is generally thought to be malfeasance. Congress has in other federal laws restricted the president's power to remove officers at independent agencies to inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "In Cook's case, the allegations made by Pulte boil down to possible mortgage fraud, specifically that she took out two different mortgages within weeks of each other, stating both properties would serve as her primary residence. To prove fraud, the Justice Department would have to prove intent to misrepresent her financial situation to the lending institutions involved. That would have come in the criminal referral investigation made last week.",
      "The Supreme Court has in a series of recent rulings reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at-will. In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "Lately, the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to remove members of multi-member agencies \u2014 the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission \u2014 without cause through decisions on its emergency docket.",
      "But the high court suggested in one of those emergency rulings that the Fed is different from other independent agencies. In an unsigned opinion, the court said the central bank is \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Why is President Trump angry at the Fed?",
      "Cook's firing came after Mr. Trump spent months attacking the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "The Fed hiked interest rates to decades-long highs in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to quell inflation. After some cuts last year, the central bank has chosen to leave rates at relatively high levels so far this year, fearing that inflation could come roaring back or that Mr. Trump's tariff strategy could cause consumer prices to jump. The trade-off is that higher interest rates can lead to slower economic growth, and they make it more expensive for American consumers and businesses to borrow.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out over this strategy, nicknaming Powell \"Too Late.\" The president has\u00a0floated the idea\u00a0of firing Powell, in some cases accusing him of mismanaging a project to renovate the Fed's headquarters.",
      "Powell hinted last week that interest rate cuts could be on the horizon, as the Fed tries to prevent inflation from spiking without triggering higher unemployment. During a speech in Jackson Hole, he said the Fed will \"proceed carefully,\" but recent shifts \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",
      "Even without firings, the president could reshape the Fed board as positions open up. If the Senate confirms Mr. Trump's replacements for Cook and another Biden nominee who\u00a0stepped down early, four of the Fed's seven governors will be Trump appointees \u2014 making up most of the Fed's board of governors and one-third of the 12-member interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.",
      "Currently, just two Fed board members are Trump picks, both from his first term: Powell and board member Christopher Waller.",
      "Mr. Trump is widely expected not to appoint Powell to another four-year term as Fed chair when his current one ends in May 2026, though he hasn't announced a successor yet. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u00a0has nominated\u00a0his economic adviser Stephen Miran to serve on the Fed board until January 2026, replacing Adriana Kugler, the Biden appointee who left the board earlier this month. It's unclear who he will pick to replace Cook.",
      "Cook was confirmed in 2022 by the Senate when then-Vice President Kamala Harris broke the 50-50 party line tie, making Cook the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. She started her term in May 2022 and it runs 14 years.",
      "She has voted in sync with Powell to hold interest rates steady so far this year.",
      "Reaction to Mr. Trump's move so far has been along party lines. For instance, in\u00a0a post on X, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said it was \"doing the right thing to hold people accountable\" while Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying this represented an \"authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act.\"",

    "story": [
      "In a sign of home sellers' frustration over how long it's taking to find a buyer,\u00a0more owners are opting to pull their property off the market rather than lower the asking price.",
      "That's according to a recent\u00a0report from Realtor.com finding that so-called delistings, or homes taken off the market without having been sold, were up 38% in June since the start of 2025 and 48% from a year ago.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer sellers are deciding to enter the market, and increasingly more are deciding to jump out,\" Jake Krimmel, senior economist at Realtor.com told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Signs of deadlock",
      "One indicator that more sellers are exiting the housing market is the ratio between the number of delistings and listings. For every 100 new homes listed nationally in June, 21 homes were taken off the market, the report found. That's up from 13 delisted homes per 100 new listings in May.",
      "A steady rise in delistings could push buyers and sellers further apart, creating a deadlock in the housing market, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"The thing that's going to prevent buyers and sellers from getting closer together is if all the sellers who maybe could or should be lowering their prices to meet the demand where it is are instead taking their homes off the market altogether,\" he said. \"So it's kind of like keeping us in this holding pattern.\"",
      "The trend comes as the supply of homes for sale begins to grow in certain U.S. regions, causing prices in those areas to drop. The number of homes for sale in July surged nearly 25% from a year ago, a post-pandemic high, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Despite the rise in housing inventory, home sales around the U.S. remain relatively stagnant, with steep prices and high mortgage rates continuing to deter many would-be homebuyers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Realtor.com data shows that pending home sales, or listings under contract, in July fell 3% in compared with the same period last year.",
      "No hurry to sell",
      "When homeowners are eager to sell a property, they typically lower the price in order to offload it quicker. However, those who are not up against the same type of time constraints may be willing to wait it out longer \u2014 especially if they're benefiting from a favorable mortgage rate.",
      "\"Maybe you're locked into payments that are relatively affordable for you,\" Krimmel said. \"You would prefer to sell, but not at a price that you're not comfortable with.\"",
      "Another factor is playing into the delisting trend, experts said \u2014 the surge in housing prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the housing market was red hot. As newly remote workers flocked to areas like Austin, Texas, home prices rose at\u00a0record levels, giving sellers a chance to cash in.",
      "While the market has since cooled substantially, sellers' pricing expectations have been slower to catch up.",
      "\"Maybe we've gotten a bit spoiled by very high home prices over the last many years, but we are seeing some softness in the market right now,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That may not be true in all markets, however. Miami is one of the places where sellers have been least willing to budge on price. According to Realtor.com's analysis, 59 homes were delisted for every 100 new homes listed in the southern Florida city \u2014 the highest ratio among the cities Realtor.com tracked. Meanwhile, less than 18% of listed homes in Miami came with a price reduction in July, according to Realtor.com.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 09:54:41 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel misread its own customer base \u2014 and our culturally sensitive times \u2014 in revamping its image, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "When Cracker Barrel unveiled its new logo last week as part of an ongoing brand refresh, it wouldn't have expected the marketing move to spark a public furor and cause the restaurant chain's value to sink by nearly $100 million.",
      "Yet the episode highlights the potential perils of tinkering with a company's branding. Following the backlash, Cracker Barrel conceded that its rebrand amounted to a misstep, saying in a statement on Monday that it \"could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\"",
      "Much of the uproar focused on the new Cracker Barrel logo doing away with the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel. The man depicts company founder Dan Evins' Uncle Herschel, whom Cracker Barrel insists will remain an integral part of its brand identity.",
      "\"Uncle Herschel will still be on our menu...on our road signs and featured in our country store. He's not going anywhere \u2014 he's family,\" Cracker Barrel said.",
      "Brands as stories",
      "Marketing experts are more blunt about Cracker Barrel's misfire.",
      "\"From a branding perspective, it's basically a flop,\" said David E. Johnson, CEO of branding agency Strategic Vision PR Group, of Cracker Barrel's logo redesign. \"What they did wrong is they went against their brand story, which was the old logo, that reflected the southern, whimsical atmosphere in the stores.\"",
      "In Johnson's view, Cracker Barrel's mistake was that it replaced a logo with genuine symbolic currency for a \"very generic looking logo that doesn't tell a story.\" Other branding experts say the hubbub is the result of a business severing its design from its roots \u2014 a cardinal sin for a company like Cracker Barrel whose folksy image is meant to evoke \"homestyle country cooking.\"",
      "More specifically, Cracker Barrel's new logo retains the rustic color palette of the original design, while removing the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel.",
      "The first Cracker Barrel restaurant was launched in Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1969 by Evins while working for his family's gasoline business. The idea was to recreate the kind of homey restaurants he'd enjoyed as a child, according to the company's\u00a0website. And until the logo redesign, the figure of\u00a0Herschel\u00a0had been central to much of the restaurant's branding and merchandise.",
      "The decision to remove both Herschel and the namesake barrel from the logo irked some Cracker Barrel loyalists because the original image represented what franchise consultant and branding expert Nick Yeonakis called a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "Still, marketing experts agree that Cracker Barrel, which operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S., was due for an image revamp. The company's growth, which soared in the 1990s, has slowed in recent years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "In 2024, concerns over its competitiveness and stagnant growth prompted the company, led by new CEO and former Taco Bell executive Julie Felss Masino, to announce changes to its restaurants, menu and pricing.",
      "The chain had become less relevant in part because it had leaned too heavily on the \"timeless nature of our concept,\" Masino said in a May 2024 conference call with Wall Street analysts. \"The goal, simply put, was to freshen things in such a way as to be noticeable and attractive but still feel like Cracker Barrel,\" she said.",
      "Today, Cracker Barrel maintains that its restaurants will retain their old-timey vibe, including using Uncle Herschel in its marketing.",
      "\"We love seeing how much you care about our 'old-timer.' We love him too,\" Cracker Barrel said Monday.",
      "Sign of the times",
      "Customer anger over Cracker Barrel's new logo also reflects the culturally and politically charged environment companies face today. For example, when Bud Light partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023, some customers called for a boycott of the beer brand, badly denting the beer brand's sales.",
      "In one social media post that typified some of the criticism of Cracker Barrel, one account called \"Woke War Room\" called for Masino to resign. \"Cracker Barrel's new logo isn't an accident \u2014 it's CEO Julie Felss Masino's project. She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding,\" the post\u00a0reads.",
      "Such critiques illustrate the fine line companies are often forced to tread, Carreen Winters, president of reputation at MikeWorldWide, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very hard to be a brand for everybody today because we are so polarized, and people look at things through a political lens even if there is no political intent,\" she said. \"When you are a legacy brand, it's really important to understand who your core is, and to not do anything to alienate them while cultivating your future or next generation customer.\"",
      "Other experts are skeptical Cracker Barrel's redesign was politically motivated.",
      "\"I really doubt the Cracker Barrel executives sat down and said, 'We'll go through this enormously expensive undertaking to change all of our signage and everything on social media in order to change something because we feel we want to be 'woke,'\" Thomas Murphy, a business professor and branding expert at Clark University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Rather, Cracker Barrel missed the mark by failing to fully take into account people's emotional investment in its brand, Winters said.",
      "\"If you are a legacy brand and you're modernizing, you have to make sure you've appropriately honored that legacy because at the end of the day, your stakeholders own your brand \u2014 you don't,\" she said. \"Not understanding the customer and the rest of stakeholders and what they care about really matters, and that seems to be what went awry here.\"",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk on Monday targeted Apple and OpenAI in an antitrust lawsuit alleging that the iPhone maker and the ChatGPT maker are teaming up to thwart competition in artificial intelligence.",
      "The 61-page complaint filed in Texas federal court follows through on a threat that Musk made two weeks ago when he accused Apple of unfairly favoring OpenAI and ChatGPT in the iPhone's app store rankings for top AI apps.",
      "Musk's post insinuated that Apple had rigged the system against ChatGPT competitors such as the Grok chatbot made by his own xAI. Now, he is detailing a litany of grievances in the lawsuit \u2014 filed by xAI and another of his corporate entities, X Corp. \u2014 in an attempt to win monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the alleged illegal tactics.",
      "The double-barreled legal attack weaves together several recently unfolding narratives to recast a year-old partnership between Apple and OpenAI as a veiled conspiracy to stifle competition during a technological shift that could prove as revolutionary as the 2007 release of the iPhone.",
      "\"This is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,\" the lawsuit asserts.",
      "The complaint portrays Apple as a company that views AI as an \"existential threat\" to its future success, prompting it to collude with OpenAI in an attempt to protect the iPhone franchise that has long been its biggest moneymaker.",
      "Some of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything \"super apps,\" such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "The complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.",
      "OpenAI has countered with a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of harassment \u2014 an allegation that the company cited in its response to Monday's antitrust lawsuit. \"This latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk's ongoing pattern of harassment,\" OpenAI said in a statement.",
      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The crux of the lawsuit revolves around Apple's decision to use ChatGPT as an AI-powered \"answer engine\" on the iPhone when the built-in technology on its device couldn't satisfy user needs. The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",
      "The lawsuit doesn't mention the potential threat that ChatGPT could also pose to Apple and the iPhone's future popularity. As part of its expansion efforts, OpenAI recruited former Apple designer Jony Ive to oversee a project aimed at building an AI-powered device that many analysts believe could eventually mount a challenge to the iPhone.",

      "The arrival date for Starbucks' fall menu has inched earlier over the years, now landing in August instead of mid-September, closer to the actual start of autumn. At the center of the coffee giant's fall offerings is its Pumpkin Spice Latte, which came onto the scene over 20 years ago. According to a company spokesperson, the PSL, which consists of espresso, steamed milk cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin, whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice, is the most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Starbucks has sold hundreds of millions of the autumnal concoction since the beverage was introduced in 2003.",
      "\"Obviously, I'm excited for the fall program,\" Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said during the coffee chain's July 29 earnings call. \"I, like many customers, love the Pumpkin Spice Latte.\"",
      "The coffee giant is also banking on sales from newcomers like Pecan Cold Foam, after\u00a0launching\u00a0a similar menu item last year. Cold Foam has become one of Starbucks' most popular add-ons with a 23% year-over-year growth, according to a company spokesperson. In June, the company announced it was piloting a\u00a0new banana-flavored protein variety.",
      "The fall menu, which includes a blend of old and new items, is likely to provide a boost to the coffee chain which has been suffering from weakening sales and in-store traffic. Starbucks sales in the U.S. declined 2% in the third quarter ended June 29, compared with the same period last year, according to the company's July earnings report.",

    "summary": "Cracker Barrel stock plunged as much as 15% after the restaurant chain released a new logo that removes its long-time image of a man leaning against a barrel.",
    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value Thursday after its stock plunged following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 million in its capitalization.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares gained in early trading Friday, but resumed their slide later in the day. The stock closed down 40 cents, or less than 1%, to $54.40. The shares fell again on Monday, sliding about 1% in late afternoon trading.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "In an updated statement released Monday, the company said the criticism has \"shown us that we could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\" Cracker Barrel added that it continues to serve \"generous portions of the food you crave at fair prices.\"",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "For its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $821.1 million, up slightly from $817.1 million, according to a regulatory filing.",

    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door to\u00a0cutting interest rates\u00a0for the first time in nearly a year, he noted the tremors beginning to shake a main pillar of the U.S. economy: the labor market.",
      "Concerns about the pace of job growth were heightened earlier this month after government data showed a sharp slowdown in hiring in July, along with much weaker payroll gains in May and June than previously thought. The disappointing numbers were alarming enough for President Trump to question their accuracy and to fire the head of the agency tasked with compiling the data.",
      "Yet labor experts tell CBS News they weren't surprised by the downturn, and caution that more pain could be in store for job seekers. Data released since the Aug. 1 job numbers show companies are delaying hiring as they adjust course to account for headwinds, including\u00a0fresh U.S. tariffs\u00a0and the advent of artificial intelligence, they say.",
      "\"There's a real cooling in the labor market,\" Andy Challenger, senior vice president of executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We're also having lots of individual conversations with companies that are letting us know to expect future layoffs.\"",
      "He added, \"So for me, there is more reason to be pessimistic about the labor market than optimistic we'll see some major bounce back.\"",
      "Here are three charts that could point to a serious downturn in the U.S. job market.",
      "Fewer workers are getting hired",
      "Overall, U.S. employers in 2025 have added fewer jobs on a monthly basis compared with the pace of gains in recent years, when companies sought to expand as the economy roared back from the pandemic. In 2024, employers hired an average of 168,000 workers each month, but that has slowed to an average of 35,000 over the past three months, Powell said on Friday.",
      "The risk is that the labor market could weaken from here, which could lead to \"sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,\" Powell said.",
      "The slowdown could spur the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate, policymakers' main tool for energizing the economy and job growth, at its meeting next month for the first time since December 2024. Lowering rates could bolster the labor market because it would make it cheaper for consumers to borrow, driving spending, for businesses to invest, including by adding workers.",
      "More long-term job seekers",
      "Another troubling sign is a recent surge in long-term job seekers, or people who have been searching for a job for more than 27 weeks. In July, about 1.8 million Americans had been looking for work for more than 27 weeks, a jump of about 64% from three years earlier and 20% from a year ago.",
      "It may not get easier to find work anytime soon, given signs from employers that they intend to continue to cut jobs, Challenger said.",
      "\"Don't take the summer off\" from looking for new work, he advised job-hunters. \"It's hard to imagine a scenario where the labor market will be better in three to six months.\"",
      "A jump in unemployed young workers",
      "At the same time, young workers are also having more trouble finding their first jobs, which has been blamed on everything from slowing economic activity this year to employers adopting artificial intelligence in place of entry-level workers.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low, at 4.2%. Yet that statistic is backward-looking, reflecting the labor market's strength in previous months \u2014 it says little about economic conditions moving forward.",
      "Meanwhile, for new college graduates the current job market amounts to \"a perfect storm,\" said career coach Tracey Newell.",
      "\"Companies are limiting new entry-level roles, and AI is replacing many traditional 'starter' jobs,\" she added, noting that it isn't unusual for employers these days to receive hundreds of job applications for a single position.",

    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/for-some-starbucks-workers-job-leaves-bitter-taste/",
    "published": "Sun, 24 Aug 2025 23:30:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Baristas at the coffee chain worry the company won't fulfill its promise to improve working conditions.",
    "story": [
      "Liberte Locke, a 32-year-old \"barista\" at a Starbucks (SBUX) in New York City, is fed up.",
      "\"Starbucks' attitude is that there's always someone else who can do the job,\" she said in running through her complaints about life at the java giant.",
      "If that isn't necessarily the consensus among Starbucks workers, interviews with nine current and former baristas at the company make clear it's not an isolated opinion, either. Even those who say they like their job paint a picture of a business that underpays front-line workers, enforces work rules arbitrarily, and too often fails to strike a balance between corporate goals and employee needs.",
      "Of course, such complaints are nothing new in retail, where low pay and erratic schedules are the norm. But by its own account, Starbucks is no ordinary company and is ostensibly a far cry from the fast-food outlets now facing a nationwide uprising by employees tired of working for peanuts.",
      "That's evident in the company's recruitment pitch. Starbucks invites job-seekers to \"become a part of something bigger and inspire positive change in the world,\" describing it as a chance to discover a \"deep sense of purpose.\"",
      "Damage control",
      "That image suffered a serious blow last month after The New York Times vividly chronicled a Starbucks worker struggling with the company's scheduling practices. The story, which centered on a 22-year-old barista and single mother, amounted to a public relations nightmare for Starbucks. Perhaps not coincidentally, within days of the story's publication top executives were promising reform.",
      "In a memo to employees earlier this month, for instance, Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead vowed to \"transform the U.S. partner experience,\" referring to Starbucks' more than 130,000 baristas.  Inviting worker feedback, he said Starbucks will examine its approach to employee pay, revisit its dress code, make it easier for people to ask for time off, and consider other changes aimed at helping baristas balance work and their personal lives.",
      "Among other changes, the company said it would end the practice of \"clopening,\" when an employee responsible for closing a store late at night is also assigned to open it early in the morning.",
      "\"We recognize that we can do more for our partners who wear the apron every day,\" he wrote.",
      "Although Starbucks workers welcome this pledge to respect the apron, they fear the company is more intent on dousing the PR flames than on genuinely improving employees' experience. After the retailer last month sent an email to workers outlining possible solutions to the kind of scheduling problems and related issues detailed by the Times, a group of baristas gave the proposal a C- and posted online a marked-up version of the memo listing their own demands (see image above).",
      "\"We hope you're ready for a commitment to give us schedules that don't mess with taking care of kids, going to school or holding onto that second job we need because Sbux wages don't make ends meet,\" wrote the baristas, who are working with a union-backed labor group, the Center for Popular Democracy.",
      "Retail jungle",
      "Despite the recent media focus on Starbucks, the company's labor practices are generally no worse than those of many large retailers. In some ways they're better, with the company offering health care to part-time, as well as full-time, workers; unusually generous 401(k) matching contributions; annual stock grants to employees; and tuition reimbursement.",
      "Starbucks highlights such benefits as an example of its commitment to employees. \"Sharing success with one another has been core to the company's heritage for more than 40 years,\" Alstead said in the September memo.",
      "Meanwhile, some baristas say they enjoy their work and feel valued by Starbucks. \"It's a decent place to work, and my manager and co-workers are great,\" said one employee who asked not to be identified.",
      "But other current and former workers claim Starbucks has changed in recent years, saying that  corporate leaders' intense focus on slashing costs has short-circuited its professed commitment to workers. Mostly, they say Starbucks doesn't listen to employees and even punishes those who identify problems.",
      "\"The biggest problem is that baristas don't have a voice,\" said Sarah  Madden, a former Starbucks barista who left the company this spring  after two years with the coffee vendor. \"They can't speak to issues that  they know exist. Workers know how to fix them, but when [they] speak up  there are serious repercussions -- your hours get cut, you're  transferred to another store or isolated from other people.\"",
      "Employees interviewed for this article said one result of Starbucks' cost-containment push is that stores are frequently understaffed, hurting customer service and forcing managers to scramble to find staff. That problem is common across the big-box stores that dominate the retail sector, experts said.",
      "\"On the one hand, retailers overhire, but they're also understaffed, so  everybody's running around and then there aren't enough people on the  floor,\" said Susan Lambert, a professor at the University of Chicago and  an expert in work-life issues. \"Companies are effectively loading all  the risk onto workers so that they're not the ones incurring the risks  inherent in business.\"",
      "Starbucks denies that its stores are short-staffed. \"We're proud of the level of service we provide in our stores,\" said Zack Hutson, a spokesman for the company. \"We know that the connection our partners have with customers is the foundation of the Starbucks experience. It wouldn't be in our best interest. We want our customers to have the appropriate service level when they come to our stores.\"",
      "To be sure, Starbucks is hardly the only U.S. corporate giant to keep a gimlet eye on its bottom line -- among Fortune 500 companies that approach to management is the rule, not the exception, and CEOs across the land defend it as an inviolable fiduciary duty to shareholders.",
      "But baristas say Starbucks' focus on profits and cost-cutting has increasingly led its leadership to tune workers out. Locke, who has worked for the company since 2006 and who earns roughly $16,000 a year, said she yearned for the Starbucks of old.",
      "\"When I started they had a training program and taught you how to be a coffee expert. There was more of a culture of supporting each other as co-workers. Store managers were sympathetic. I really enjoyed it.\"",
      "Asked why she stays at Starbucks, Locke said her employment options are limited because she lacks a college education and because her only professional experience is in retail.",
      "Living wage?",
      "According to workers, the best thing Starbucks can do for its apron-wearers is to raise their pay and offer full-time hours instead of the 20 to 30 hours that most employees work.",
      "Samantha Cole, a barista in Omaha, Neb., said she struggles to get by on her supervisor's salary of $11.25 an hour. Such pay may be better than what she would earn working for other retailers, but the 30-year-old mother of two say it's still not a living wage.",
      "\"I'm definitely not making enough money,\" said Cole, who has been with the company for six years. \"A lot of us are right there with what fast-food workers are making.\"",
      "Such frustrations are also evident in comments on the Facebook page Starbucks uses to communicate with employees and where it is asking baristas for input regarding the company's labor practices. Wrote one employee: \"I've worked for the company for 7 years in January, and I don't make enough to support myself on one job so I work 2 jobs, 6 days a week.... I've seen a lot of amazing partners leave because they don't make enough.\"",
      "Starbucks declined to disclose compensation data, citing competitive reasons and saying that pay varies widely according to workers' experience and where in the U.S. stores are located. It didn't respond to emails requesting clarification regarding other aspects of its labor policies.",
      "It's worth noting that low pay isn't unique to Starbucks -- in retail it is the norm. As of 2012 (the latest year for which data is available), the median hourly income for retail salespeople is $10.29 per hour, or $21,410 a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Hourly pay for full-time retail workers range from a high of $14.42 to $9.61 for lower-paid people, according to Demos, a liberal-leaning think tank in New York. Part-timers typically make much less, with the average cashier earning $18,500 a year.",
      "\"Until [Starbucks] gives a living wage to every employee, they can't claim to be a good employer,\" Locke said, who added that it has been roughly two years since her last pay raise.",
      "\"Race to the bottom\"",
      "Another priority for baristas: stable, regular schedules. Like most large retailers, Starbucks uses scheduling software to try to match the number of workers it has in a store at any given time to the amount of business it gets. Workers also may be scheduled according to the sales they generate or their facility in promoting certain products. The technology also can enable other savings, such as limiting overtime.",
      "For employees, however, that approach -- known as \"just-in-time\" or \"on-call\" scheduling -- often results in lower income and chaotic hours.",
      "Stephanie Luce, a professor of labor studies at City University of New York's Murphy Institute, characterizes the widespread adoption of scheduling and so-called workforce optimization technologies as a \"new race to the bottom.\"",
      "\"Companies that have already reduced operating costs by making deals with irresponsible subcontractors and using the cheapest available materials are now cutting corners in the form of the 'just-in- time scheduling' of their workforce,\" she and her co-authors wrote in a recent report. \"These 'lean' manufacturing practices take advantage of sophisticated software and an increasingly desperate workforce to cut labor costs to the bone.\"",
      "By the same token, tighter control of worker schedules helps Starbucks contain payroll costs. But it also means employees who had expected to work a certain number of hours every week can see their schedules dramatically cut back and fluctuate wildly. The result? Smaller paychecks and a disturbance to family life.",
      "\"It makes it very hard for parents to participate in an intimate family routine and structure it in such a way that experts agree is good for children,\" Lambert said.",
      "Irregular schedules also make it hard for workers who do need extra income to work a second job, schedule appointments and plan other aspects of their lives.",
      "Baristas said Starbucks posts their schedule only days in advance and that they are often subject to change. Following the Times story, Starbucks said it would post schedules at least one week in advance. That's not enough time, several workers said, asking the company to provide at least two or three weeks notice, as retailers ranging from Walmart (WMT) and H&M to Victoria's Secret (LB) do.",
      "Meanwhile, despite Starbucks' promise to end clopening, the practice continues, some workers said, although the company insists that this is only in cases when people request such shifts.",
      "\"Partners should never be required to work opening and closing shifts. That policy is clear,\" Starbucks' Hutson said, adding that the company is studying ways to give workers more input in their schedules. \"If there are cases where that's not happening, we want to know about that.\"",
      "Given the scrutiny on Starbucks, the company can count on baristas to do just that.",

      "\"I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.\"",
      "In a social media post Friday afternoon, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the deal had been finalized, but did not elaborate.",
      "\"The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,\" Lutnick wrote. \"This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.\"",
      "Lutnick also thanked Tan \"for striking a deal that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "Intel confirmed the deal in a news release Friday evening which stated that the U.S. government would \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",
      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company.

      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",

      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey.

      "About 44% of adults surveyed by Lightspeed Commerce, a provider of point-of-sale technology for hospitality businesses, said they're ordering from the kids' menus at restaurants. Kids' meals are traditionally less expensive than those on adult menus because portion sizes are usually smaller.",

      "If you look up at the sky in Texas and see what could be a flying burrito, you may not be imagining things: Chipotle on Thursday launched an autonomous aerial delivery service for digital orders in the Dallas area.",
      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tariffs-trump-inflation-prices/",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 08:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "For months, economists warned that the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs would sharply boost consumer prices. Here's why it hasn't happened.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a barrage of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration this year on dozens of U.S. trade partners, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have defied many economists' expectations and remained relatively stable.",
      "Economists caution that just because tariffs have yet to trigger a renewed bout of inflation, there is no guarantee that prices won't surge later this year. They note that recent data shows a modest rise in the cost of items including clothing, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Tariffs \u2014 meaning the rate importers must pay at the border for imported goods \u2014 also take a long time to seep into the economy. That's because companies often try to hold off on passing along higher costs to customers to avoid losing market share to rivals.",
      "Yet experts acknowledge that tariffs have yet to unleash the kind of severe inflationary pressures that could cause prices to spike. For their part, White House officials have consistently maintained that foreign exporters \u2014 not American consumers \u2014 will bear the brunt of added tariff costs.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been months since Liberation Day, and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent [Council of Economic Advisers] analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, alluding to the baseline and other tariffs President Trump originally announced on April 2.",
      "Here are four reasons economists say explain why inflation isn't jumping despite the highest U.S. tariffs in decades.",
      "Tariffs aren't as high as many people expected",
      "Despite President Trump's many threats to jack up levies on imports, the actual average tariff rate being charged on U.S. imports is not as high as what has been announced, data shows.",
      "The average tariff rate on U.S. imports in June was 9% \u2014 well below the 15% that many economists were forecasting earlier this year following Mr. Trump's\u00a0slew of tariff announcements, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's not so much that the reaction to tariffs has been low, it's that the effective tariff rate increase has been relatively limited up until June,\" Mark Cus, an economist at Barclays, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Actual U.S. tariffs remain lower than earlier estimates in part because countries facing steeper levies are sending fewer goods to the U.S., according to Barclays and Capital Economics. By contrast, countries with below average tariff rates are shipping more goods to the U.S.",
      "The upshot: Average tariff rates on imports are lower than many economists were projecting earlier this year.",
      "Additionally, many goods imported into the U.S. have been exempted from steeper tariffs. Of the roughly $258 billion worth of imports that hit the U.S. retail market in June, only 48% were subject to tariffs, Barclays data shows. For example, pharmaceuticals, some electronics and many imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from any new tariffs.",
      "\"While dutiable goods face elevated tariff rates, a substantial portion of U.S. imports remains duty-free,\" Barclays analysts said in a recent report. \"This is a major contributor to the low effective tariff rate.\"",
      "Companies stocked up before higher tariffs kicked in",
      "U.S. retailers built up their inventories earlier this year in expectation that the Trump administration would hike tariffs on imported products and parts. Many retailers are still selling those non-tariffed products, allowing them to delay price hikes, experts said.",
      "For example, \"There was a big jump in imports of goods from Canada that would later be tariffed before the tariffs kicked in, and perhaps imports of those goods in May and June were relatively low, and that shows up as a smaller amount of dutiable goods,\" Barclays' Cus told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Eventually, experts warn, retailers will exhaust those lower-cost goods imported earlier in the year, which could lead to higher prices down the road.",
      "Retailers are swallowing the costs \u2014 for now",
      "For now, many retailers are eating the additional tariff costs.",
      "Businesses \"have been willing to absorb the initial hit via lower margins, although we suspect that was mostly a temporary development as those firms waited for more clarity on where tariff rates would settle,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a recent report.",
      "\"We doubt that is a sustainable outcome over the longer term, however. As the uncertainty over tariff levels eases over the next couple of weeks, giving retailers more clarity on rates over the next year or two, we would expect more firms to raise prices,\" they said.",
      "Tariffs tend to boost inflation gradually",
      "Tariffs typically take many months to seep into company supply chains and show up in the prices consumers pay at the store.",
      "The full impact of tariffs plays out not immediately but over an extended period of time, peaking roughly a year after they take effect, a June Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u00a0report\u00a0noted. That means any U.S. tariffs imposed this year would be unlikely to have much of an impact on inflation until later this year and into 2026.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a report.",
      "A final possibility is that the fears that the Trump administration's turn toward protectionist trade policies would trigger another severe bout of inflation are overblown. The White House has maintained that such a shift will protect jobs and make the U.S. more competitive globally.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" the White House's Desai said in a statement.",

      "The technology giant on Thursday unveiled a new methodology to measure the environmental impact of its AI models, including energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions.",
      "AI tools have the potential to drive economic growth by boosting productivity and unlocking other efficiencies, economists say. By one estimate from Goldman Sachs, the tech is poised to increase global GDP by 7%, or $7 trillion, over 10 years.",
      "At the same time, scientists are flagging the outsized environmental impact of AI, which is not yet fully understood even as data centers require enormous amounts of electricity.",
      "\"In order to improve the energy efficiency of AI, a clear and comprehensive understanding of AI's environmental footprint is important. To date, comprehensive data on the energy and environmental impact of AI inference has been limited,\" Ben Gomes, Google's senior vice president of learning and sustainability, said in a blog post Thursday.",
      "Aside from their electricity needs, AI data centers also require \"a great deal of water ... \u00a0to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems,\" research from MIT\u00a0shows. \"The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.\"",
      "Some new data centers require energy between 100 and 1000 megawatts, roughly equivalent to powering 80,000 to 800,000 homes, according to an April GAO report. For now, however, there are\u00a0no regulations that require corporations to disclose how much energy or water their AI tools consume.",

      "What's the environmental impact of Gemini AI?",
      "Google's new paper on the environmental impact of its own AI tools aims to set a standard for measuring the energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions of various AI models, the company said.",
      "A typical Gemini text query uses 0.24 watt-hours (Wh) of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters \u2014 or about five drops \u2014 of water.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday he has fired Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, a dramatic move after months of public attacks against the central bank.",
      "Cook and her attorney said Tuesday that the move has no legal basis and that they plan to file a lawsuit challenging the president's action.",
      "The president announced Cook's removal from the Fed board in a letter posted to Truth Social that accused Cook of making false statements on mortgage documents, actions he claimed were \"gross negligence\" and \"potentially criminal.\" Mr. Trump had previously urged Cook to resign, leading the economist to say she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"",
      "The move is an early test of Mr. Trump's power to terminate members of the Federal Reserve. Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038",
      "Mr. Trump wrote in a letter to Cook: \"I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.\"",
      "In a statement, Cook said that Mr. Trump \"purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so. I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.\"",
      "Her attorney Abbe Lowell said Cook will challenge her firing in court.",
      "\"President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis. We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action,\" Lowell said.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Fed for comment.",
      "What are President Trump's allegations against Lisa Cook?",
      "The allegations against Cook were leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has positioned himself as an ally of Mr. Trump's campaign against the Fed. Pulte sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of taking out mortgages for homes in Michigan and Georgia in 2021, and telling banks in both cases that she planned to use the homes as her primary residences. Pulte alleged that was a fraudulent attempt to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Cook must resign, now!!!\"",
      "Cook said in a statement released through the Fed: \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Pulte has also made mortgage fraud allegations against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democratic officials and Trump foes who denied the accusations. Notably, James's office sued Mr. Trump and his company for loan fraud before his return to the White House, securing an almost $400 million civil court judgment that was tossed out by a New York state appellate court last week.",
      "Can Trump fire Cook?",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" Courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause,\" though it is generally thought to be malfeasance. Congress has in other federal laws restricted the president's power to remove officers at independent agencies to inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "In Cook's case, the allegations made by Pulte boil down to possible mortgage fraud, specifically that she took out two different mortgages within weeks of each other, stating both properties would serve as her primary residence. To prove fraud, the Justice Department would have to prove intent to misrepresent her financial situation to the lending institutions involved. That would have come in the criminal referral investigation made last week.",
      "The Supreme Court has in a series of recent rulings reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at-will. In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "Lately, the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to remove members of multi-member agencies \u2014 the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission \u2014 without cause through decisions on its emergency docket.",
      "But the high court suggested in one of those emergency rulings that the Fed is different from other independent agencies. In an unsigned opinion, the court said the central bank is \"a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Why is President Trump angry at the Fed?",
      "Cook's firing came after Mr. Trump spent months attacking the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "The Fed hiked interest rates to decades-long highs in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to quell inflation. After some cuts last year, the central bank has chosen to leave rates at relatively high levels so far this year, fearing that inflation could come roaring back or that Mr. Trump's tariff strategy could cause consumer prices to jump. The trade-off is that higher interest rates can lead to slower economic growth, and they make it more expensive for American consumers and businesses to borrow.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out over this strategy, nicknaming Powell \"Too Late.\" The president has\u00a0floated the idea\u00a0of firing Powell, in some cases accusing him of mismanaging a project to renovate the Fed's headquarters.",
      "Powell hinted last week that interest rate cuts could be on the horizon, as the Fed tries to prevent inflation from spiking without triggering higher unemployment. During a speech in Jackson Hole, he said the Fed will \"proceed carefully,\" but recent shifts \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",
      "Even without firings, the president could reshape the Fed board as positions open up. If the Senate confirms Mr. Trump's replacements for Cook and another Biden nominee who\u00a0stepped down early, four of the Fed's seven governors will be Trump appointees \u2014 making up most of the Fed's board of governors and one-third of the 12-member interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.",
      "Currently, just two Fed board members are Trump picks, both from his first term: Powell and board member Christopher Waller.",
      "Mr. Trump is widely expected not to appoint Powell to another four-year term as Fed chair when his current one ends in May 2026, though he hasn't announced a successor yet. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u00a0has nominated\u00a0his economic adviser Stephen Miran to serve on the Fed board until January 2026, replacing Adriana Kugler, the Biden appointee who left the board earlier this month. It's unclear who he will pick to replace Cook.",
      "Cook was confirmed in 2022 by the Senate when then-Vice President Kamala Harris broke the 50-50 party line tie, making Cook the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. She started her term in May 2022 and it runs 14 years.",
      "She has voted in sync with Powell to hold interest rates steady so far this year.",
      "Reaction to Mr. Trump's move so far has been along party lines. For instance, in\u00a0a post on X, Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said it was \"doing the right thing to hold people accountable\" while Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying this represented an \"authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge threw out the Trump administration's challenge to a standing order issued by a U.S. district court in Maryland.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday threw out the Trump administration's challenge to a standing order issued by a U.S. district court in Maryland that bars federal immigration officials from immediately removing migrants who are challenging the legality of their detentions.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen came in a novel and unprecedented lawsuit that the Trump administration filed against all 15 judges on the Maryland court in June. The Justice Department had argued that the standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell in May was unlawful and outside the authority of the court.",
      "The judges, represented by Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under former President George W. Bush, sought to dismiss the lawsuit. They argued that the suit presented a dispute between two co-equal branches of government that could not be decided by the courts.",
      "In a 37-page decision, Cullen agreed with the judges in finding that the Trump administration's challenge should be dismissed because, in part, the U.S. does not have the legal right to sue and the judges are absolute immune from the suit.",
      "\"Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,\" he wrote. \"The Executive's lawsuit will be dismissed, and its motion for preliminary injunction denied as moot. Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.\"",
      "Cullen said that if the Trump administration \"truly believes\" that the standing orders violate the law, it should pursue the paths laid out by Congress.",
      "\"Any fair reading of the legal authorities cited by Defendants leads to the ineluctable conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss,\" he wrote. \"To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.\"",
      "While the suit was filed in federal district court in Maryland, Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump to serve on the U.S. district court in Roanoke, Virginia, was assigned to preside over the case.",
      "Cullen's ruling was not a surprise. In a hearing earlier this month in Maryland, the judge previewed his decision, telling Justice Department attorneys that the \"far less destructive\" move by the Justice Department would be to appeal the standing order in one of the cases where it had been issued, rather than sue another branch of the government to \"accomplish its institutional interests.\"",
      "He echoed that position in his decision, writing that \"under normal circumstances,\" it would not be a surprise if the government raised its concerns about the legality of the standing order through the mechanisms laid out by Congress.",
      "\"But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times \u2014 at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,\" Cullen wrote. \"It's no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue \u2014 and in a big way.\"",
      "In a footnote in his decision, Cullen criticized the Trump administration's repeated attacks on members of the federal judiciary who have ruled against the president's agenda.",
      "\"Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,\" Cullen wrote.",
      "The standing order issued by Russell earlier this year prevents federal immigration officials from removing or altering the legal status of any migrant detainee who filed a habeas corpus petition for two business days.",
      "The court adopted the order to address the rise in migrants in Maryland who were at risk of imminent deportation from the U.S. and sought review of their detentions. Signed by Russell, the chief judge, the order states that it aims to \"preserve existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction\" of the Maryland district court over pending matters, ensure immigrant petitioners can participate in court proceedings and have access to legal counsel, and guarantee the government has a \"fulsome opportunity\" to present its defense.",
      "Among the judges named in the Trump administration's lawsuit was U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing the legal cases filed by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who has sued twice in the district over his March deportation and, most recently, confinement by immigration authorities. On Monday, Abrego Garcia filed a habeas petition challenging the legality of his detention by immigration officials. The court issued its standing order and temporarily blocked his immediate removal to a potential third-country, Uganda, where the Trump administration is attempting to send him.",

    "summary": "A group of current and former FEMA officials is blasting the Trump administration for its sweeping changes to the disaster relief agency, days before the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.",
    "story": [
      "A group of current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency officials warned Congress on Monday that the Trump administration's sweeping changes to the disaster relief agency could reverse decades of reforms made after Hurricane Katrina.",
      "The open letter was released as the U.S. this week marks 20 years since Katrina's 2005 landfall \u2014 sparking one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, with more than 1,800 deaths and over $200 billion in damage in today's dollars.",
      "The letter argues the Trump administration \u2014 which has sought to dramatically shrink FEMA and floated scrapping the agency altogether \u2014 had made decisions that \"hinder the swift execution of our mission.\" It states that a change in course is necessary to \"prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.\"",
      "Released by the advocacy group Stand Up for Science, the \"Katrina Declaration\" says it has 181 signatories. Only 35 people signed their names to the letter, with the rest opting for anonymity due to \"the culture of fear and suppression cultivated by this administration.\"",
      "It's addressed to several congressional committees and the FEMA Review Council, which was formed by President Trump earlier this year.",
      "The declaration alleges that Mr. Trump's picks to lead FEMA \"lack proper qualifications,\" and decries the Trump administration for cutting FEMA's staff.",
      "\"Since January 2025, FEMA has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a FEMA Administrator,\" the open letter reads.",
      "It also castigates FEMA for terminating grants meant to help state and local governments prepare their infrastructures to withstand natural disasters and extreme weather. Two-thirds of the counties that have received those grants voted for Mr. Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris, a CBS News investigation found earlier this year. A federal judge blocked cuts to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, program earlier this month.",
      "In response to the letter, FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues said the Department of Homeland Security is \"committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people.\" He said the agency has been \"bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes,\" and defended the Trump administration's handling of natural disasters so far this year.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,\" Llargues said. \"It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard.\u00a0 It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems.\"",
      "FEMA has faced months of upheaval since Mr. Trump's return to office.",
      "Days after his inauguration, the president floated either \"getting rid of FEMA\" or \"fundamentally reforming and overhauling\" the agency, casting it as overly bureaucratic and arguing that state and local governments should take on a larger role in managing natural disasters. In June, Mr. Trump said he's looking to \"wean\" states off of FEMA.",
      "The White House has proposed cutting FEMA's budget for non-disaster grants by $646 million in the next fiscal year. The Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a $36.2 billion budget for FEMA, up from $33.1 billion in the fiscal year 2025 budget.",
      "So far this year, FEMA has lost about one-third of its staff through a combination of firings and buyouts, and the administration has overhauled the contract renewal system for more than two-thirds of FEMA's workforce, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "The agency has had two acting leaders since Mr. Trump returned to office. Christopher Hamilton led the agency until May, when he was fired after saying he didn't support eliminating FEMA. His successor, David Richardson, introduced himself to staff by warning them during an all-hands meeting, \"don't get in my way,\" and suggesting he will \"run right over\" people he believes are subverting the president's agenda, CBS News has reported.",
      "The leadership change came weeks before the June 1 start of the Atlantic hurricane season. One review from May found the agency was \"not ready\" for hurricane season.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting plan is facing another bout of legal pushback, as state Republicans filed an emergency petition asking the California Supreme Court to block a November special election on the proposal.",
      "Named Proposition 50, the redistricting measure, signed into law last week, would overhaul California's congressional map to make five GOP-held districts more favorable to Democrats. The move is being framed by Newsom and state Democrats as a direct response to Texas Republicans redrawing their own maps \u2014 under pressure from President Trump \u2014 to create five extra GOP-leaning districts.",
      "But opponents argue that California's plan violates the state constitution and undermines an independent redistricting commission created by ballot initiative in the mid-2000s.",
      "The 432-page petition, filed by the Dhillon Law Group and backed by Republican lawmakers, accuses Democrats of skipping a 30-day public review period for legislation, in addition to stripping voters and the independent citizens' redistricting commission of their power. It also challenges the legality of redrawing maps mid-decade. And it argues the measure violates a rule requiring ballot questions in California to only be about a single subject, because it includes a provision that redraws the congressional map and a provision that calls on Congress to require every state to use a redistricting commission.",
      "Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland is vowing to fight the plan in court.",
      "\"As long as I have breath in my body, I am going to fight every step of the way,\" Strickland said. \"Every loophole they do, every constitutional measure they break, we're going to challenge them in court.\"",
      "CBS Sacramento reached out to Newsom's office for comment. Hannah Milgrom, a spokesperson for the Yes on 50 campaign, said, \"Trump's toadies already got destroyed once in court. Now, they are trying again - to protect Trump's power grab and prevent the voters from having their say on Prop 50. They will lose.\"",
      "A group of Republican lawmakers filed a similar emergency petition before the legislature passed the plan.\u00a0The California Supreme Court already declined to intervene\u00a0then, but now Republicans are asking the court to reconsider before ballots are finalized.",
      "If approved by voters in November, the new map would be used for the next three election cycles and could help Democrats reclaim control of the U.S. House in 2026.",
      "Newsom and other state Democrats insist the plan is still ultimately in voters' hands, unlike in Texas, where Republicans redrew lines without a public vote. They argue it's a necessary countermeasure to what they call a broader national strategy by Mr. Trump to tilt congressional maps in the GOP's favor.",
      "Republicans hold a razor-thin House majority, and could lose control of the chamber if Democrats flip just three seats in next year's midterm elections \u2014 which typically favor the party that doesn't control the White House.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia is being processed for deportation to Uganda, the Department of Homeland Security said, after he was taken into custody Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, days after his release from criminal custody.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was mistakenly deported to his home country in March and held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months before being returned to the U.S. in June where he was jailed on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was freed from pretrial detention last Friday. CBS News reported on Saturday that his attorneys were then sent a court-required notice of his potential\u00a0deportation to Uganda. He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.",
      "\"There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshals Service and basically on house arrest,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.\"",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg filed a new lawsuit on Abrego Garcia's behalf on Monday challenging his confinement and deportation to any country \"unless and until he had a fair trial in an immigration court.\"",
      "The U.S. district court in Maryland soon issued an order preventing the government from immediately removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S. or altering his legal status, meaning his deportation is on hold for now. The court has issued the standing order in all cases involving migrant detainees challenging the legality of their detentions in recent months, a move the Justice Department is challenging as unlawful.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis, who is assigned to the case, held a hearing on Abrego Garcia's new suit on Monday. She issued an oral order preventing the Trump administration from moving Abrego Garcia from the ICE facility in Virginia where he is now being held.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0in a statement that ICE had arrested Abrego Garcia and was \"processing him for deportation.\" DHS said he is \"being processed for removal to Uganda.\" The U.S. reached an agreement with Uganda to accept some deportees last week.",
      "\"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,\" Noem said.",
      "In a legal filing over the weekend, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica. His legal team said they then received a notice of his possible deportation to Uganda. Sandoval-Moshenberg clarified Monday that Abrego Garcia had stated that he was willing to accept refugee status in Costa Rica.",
      "\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday.",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement that he was glad to \"welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.\"",
      "\"The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda \u2014 to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,\" Van Hollen said. \"As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.\"",
      "An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia may not be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore advocated for due process for Abrego Garcia on Sunday, saying on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that \"I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case.\"",

    "summary": "House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer subpoenaed estate of Jeffrey Epstein, seeking over a dozen categories of documents.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Republican leader of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has issued a subpoena to the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein seeking documents and other material as part of its ongoing examination of the government's investigation into Epstein.",
      "The subpoena issued by Rep. James Comer of Kentucky demands the co-executors of Epstein's estate turn over to the House committee more than a dozen categories of documents and communications, including material from 1990 through August 2019 that references all presidents and vice presidents, videos taken from Epstein's properties and listings in his contact and address books.",
      "Lawmakers are also seeking entries contained within a leather-bound book put together by Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, for his 50th birthday, the 2008 non-prosecution agreement reached with the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of Florida and Epstein's will.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported last month that President Trump had allegedly signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein in the early 2000s to mark his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" The Journal reported that the leather-bound book was compiled by Maxwell and included submissions from dozens of associates, including billionaire Leslie Wexner attorney Alan Dershowitz and Mr. Trump.",
      "The president called the letter reported by the Journal \"fake\" and filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper, its parent company and media mogul Rupert Murdoch over the story, seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",
      "In a letter to the co-executors of Epstein's estate, Comer wrote that \"it is our understanding that the estate is ready and willing to provide these documents to the Committee pursuant to a subpoena.\" He set a Sept. 8 deadline for the documents to be turned over to House investigators.",
      "\"Recent reporting indicates the estate of Mr. Epstein has access to documents relevant to the Committee's investigation, including the alleged 'birthday book' prepared for Mr. Epstein by Ms. Maxwell,\" he wrote. \"The attached subpoena is meant to bolster the amount of information available to the Committee so that it may conduct its work. It is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell.\"",
      "In addition to issuing the subpoena, Comer announced that Alex Acosta, who was serving as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida when Epstein was investigated, will voluntarily answer questions from the committee on Sept. 19.",
      "Acosta was the top federal prosecutor in South Florida when federal authorities investigated Epstein in the 2000s and entered into a non-prosecution agreement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution and plead guilty to state prostitution charges. Acosta went on to serve as secretary of labor during Mr. Trump's first term, but resigned in 2019 amid questions about his handling of the Epstein case.",
      "As part of its investigation into the federal probe into Epstein, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas for depositions earlier this month to former attorneys general and FBI directors across four presidential administrations, as well as to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "Comer said the committee would accept formal written declarations from three former attorneys general, Alberto Gonzales, Eric Holder and Jeff Sessions. Acosta was not among the officials from whom the Oversight Committee initially sought testimony.",
      "The panel also issued a subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for documents related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping him recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence, but has appealed her conviction to the Supreme Court.",
      "The Justice Department sent the first tranche of files related to Epstein to Congress last week, and the Oversight Committee plans to make the records public, though victims' identification and child sexual abuse material will be redacted, a spokesperson said.",
      "The renewed focus on Epstein's case and the government's handling of it was sparked by a Justice Department memo issued in July that said there was no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures. The Trump administration said it would not disclose any additional information about Epstein, which led to a backlash from some of the president's allies.",
      "In response, the Justice Department asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell's cases. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman denied last week the request to make the material from Epstein's proceedings public, finding that the government is the \"logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein File.\"",
      "Separately, the administration released transcripts of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with Maxwell that was conducted in Tallahassee last month.",
      "Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019 but died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 15:31:54 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order that seeks to go after people who burn the American flag.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 \u00a0President Trump signed an executive order Monday that seeks to punish people who burn the American flag, accusing those who do so of displaying hostility and contempt toward the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years threatened to crack down on flag burning. In 2016, he wrote on social media that anyone who burns the American flag should lose their citizenship or face jail time. During a 2024 speech before the National Guard Association of the United States, then-candidate Trump said he would work to pass a law imposing criminal penalties on those who burn the American flag.",
      "In remarks from the Oval Office on Monday, Mr. Trump alleged that burning the American flag \"incites riots\" and said those who are prosecuted and convicted as a result of his directive would face one year in prison.",
      "\"The people in this country don't want to see our American flag burned and spit on,\" the president said.",
      "Trump's executive order on flag burning",
      "Titled \"Prosecuting Burning of the American Flag,\" Mr. Trump's executive order does not direct the attorney general to prosecute those who burn flags for the act itself. Rather, it says the Justice Department should bring cases \"against acts of American Flag desecration that violate applicable, content-neutral laws, while causing harm unrelated to expression, consistent with the First Amendment.\" Examples of those laws include \"violent crimes; hate crimes, illegal discrimination against American citizens, or other violations of Americans' civil rights; and crimes against property and the peace.\"",
      "The directive acknowledges a 36-year-old Supreme Court decision that found flag burning is protected speech but adds that \"American flag desecration conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or that is an action amounting to 'fighting words'\" may not be entitled to the same protection under the First Amendment.",
      "The order directs the secretary of state, attorney general and secretary of homeland security to take action against foreign nationals who have engaged in \"American flag-desecration activity,\" including by revoking their visas or residence permits, or seeking their removal from the U.S.",
      "The attorney general, Mr. Trump's executive order states, \"shall vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the American Flag, and may pursue litigation to clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions in this area.\"",
      "Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in response to Mr. Trump's executive order that the president does not have the power to change the First Amendment.",
      "\"Flag burning as a form of political protest is protected by the First Amendment. That's nothing new. While people can be prosecuted for burning anything in a place they aren't allowed to set fires, the government can't prosecute protected expressive activity \u2014 even if many Americans, including the president, find it 'uniquely offensive and provocative,'\" he said in a statement. \"You don't have to like flag burning. You can condemn it, debate it, or hoist your own flag even higher. The beauty of free speech is that you get to express your opinions, even if others don't like what you have to say.\"",
      "Is flag burning protected by the First Amendment?",
      "The president's directive appears aimed at re-opening the question in the courts of whether flag burning is constitutionally protected speech. While Mr. Trump believes that it should be illegal to burn the American flag and sought to unilaterally target those who engage in this conduct, the Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the act is expressive conduct covered by the First Amendment.",
      "The 5-4 decision in the landmark case Texas v. Johnson arose from Gregory Lee Johnson's conviction under a Texas law that prohibited desecration of a venerated object. Johnson had burned an American flag outside of Dallas City Hall in protest of then-President Ronald Reagan's policies in 1984. He was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $2,000.",
      "But the Supreme Court ruled that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment, since his flag burning constituted protected expressive conduct. Among the members of the five-justice majority were Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, who often served as the swing vote after Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired.",
      "During a 2012 interview with CNN, Scalia, a conservative stalwart, defended the high court's decision on flag burning and reiterated that the act is a form of expression.",
      "\"If I were king, I would not allow people to go around burning the American flag,\" he said. \"However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged \u2014 and it is addressed in particular to speech critical of the government. That was the main kind of speech that tyrants would seek to suppress.\"",
      "Scalia told CNN that \"burning a flag is a symbol that expresses an idea \u2014 I hate the government, the government is unjust, whatever.\"",
      "Referencing the 1989 ruling, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that the case was decided by a \"very sad court.\"",
      "One year after that decision, the Supreme Court ruled in the case United States v. Eichman that a federal law criminalizing flag burning was unconstitutional.",
      "Congress had passed that law, known as the Flag Protection Act, in 1989 in response to the high court's ruling in Texas v. Johnson. The law made it a crime to knowingly mutilate, deface, physically defile, burn or trample upon the American flag, and violators faced a fine or up to one year in prison.",
      "But in another 5-4 decision, again with Scalia and Kennedy in the majority, the Supreme Court ruled that prosecutions of protesters who burned flags in violation of the Flag Protection Act were inconsistent with the First Amendment.",
      "\"Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and worth revering,\" Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority.",

      "\"The Secretary of Defense has directed JTF-DC service members to carry their assigned service weapon,\" the Joint Task Force in D.C. told CBS News in a statement on Sunday. \"Task force personnel operate under the established Rules for the Use of Force, which allow the use of force only as a last resort and solely in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\"",
      "A post shared by CBS News (@cbsnews)",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had ordered that National Guard troops patrolling the streets of Washington for President Trump's law enforcement crackdown be armed, the Pentagon said Friday.",
      "The Defense Department didn't offer any other details about the new development or why it was needed.",
      "The step is an escalation in Mr. Trump's intervention into policing in the nation's capital and comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, with the arrival last week of hundreds from several Republican-led states.",

Guard to crack down on\u00a0what he has called\u00a0an \"epidemic of crime.\" Federal agents have also patrolled the city, and the president has asserted control over the local Metropolitan Police Department.",
      "It was unclear if the guard's role in the federal intervention could be changing. The troops have not taken part in law enforcement and largely have been protecting landmarks, including the National Mall and Union Station, and helping with crowd control.",
      "Some troops have fed squirrels. One Guard member helped a woman carry her belongings down the stairs in a train station. Others have been seen taking photos with passersby, standing around chatting and drinking coffee. There have been no reports of them facing threats that would require weapons.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump officials sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists, slowing their response to the measles outbreak in West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function \u2014 emergency response \u2014 when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.",
      "The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.",
      "In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency's reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.",
      "\"CDC hasn't reached out to us locally,\" Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. \"My staff feels like we are out here all alone,\" she added.",
      "A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.",
      "\"All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,\" one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. \"All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything.\"",
      "Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, researchers estimate. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.",
      "The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces as vaccination rates drop, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.",
      "While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The Texas outbreak spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Mexico's Chihuahua state \u2014 at minimum. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.",
      "\"This is absolutely outrageous,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \"When you're battling contagious diseases, time is everything.\"",
      "\"The CDC is 'stressed' currently\"",
      "Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in late January had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested.",
      "\"I think this may be very large,\" she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she'd learned from conversations with people in the community: \"According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.\"",
      "In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.",
      "One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.",
      "\"Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?\" Wells wrote on Feb. 5.",
      "\"It never hurts to ask the CDC,\" said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.",
      "\"I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,\" Milton wrote. \"Of course, we know the CDC is 'stressed' currently.\"",
      "Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit.",
      "\"The CDC had gone dark,\" said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. \"We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.\"",
      "Technically, the Trump administration's freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.",
      "\"There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,\" one CDC scientist said.",
      "Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. \"Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February,\" he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. \"The CDC was gagged,\" he said.",
      "Through private conversations, Benjamin said he learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves.",
      "\"It's not that the CDC was delinquent,\" Benjamin said. \"It's that they had their hands tied behind their backs.\"",
      "To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. \"We would always offer a conversation and ask if there's anything we could do,\" she said.",
      "Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state's correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records \"confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.\"",
      "Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's corroborated in emails from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.",
      "\"Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,\" Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, told KFF Health News.",
      "Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren't already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn't spread measles to others.",
      "Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn't want to be tested, didn't want to name their contacts, and didn't want to talk with the health department. \"It doesn't matter what resources I have if people won't avail themselves of it,\" Holbrooks said.",
      "Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against COVID-19 restrictions deepened that mistrust.",
      "Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. Locals guess the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is far larger than the U.S. Census count.",
      "\"I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community,\" Holbrooks said. \"There's a lot of people in the shadows out here.\"",
      "Public health experts say the situation in Gaines County sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.",
      "About 450 people \u2014 including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers \u2014 helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in Clark County, Washington, in 2018.",
      "Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. \"We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,\" he said.",
      "Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.",
      "In New York, hundreds of people in the city's health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.",
      "The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. Then there's the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and the lasting toll of some measles infections, including deafness or worse.",
      "\"I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented,\" Zucker said.",
      "Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: \"I'm so overwhelmed.\"",
      "A death ignites a response",
      "On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a brief notice on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.",
      "In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet reported on a large drugstore where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were \"flying off the shelf.\"",
      "Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development.",
      "Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups \u2014 including one founded by Kennedy \u2014 that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes.",
      "\"How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?\" Milton asked in an email.",
      "Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. \"HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,\" one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. \"If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven't seen those babies born yet.\"",
      "Another CDC official said they've had to \"walk a fine line\" between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.",
      "While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. \"We're providing vitamin A,\" Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. \"There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,\" he claimed, \"against serious disease and death.\"",
      "The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is seldom useful against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.",
      "Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with numerous inaccurate statements. \"There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,\" he said. \"It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.\" There is no evidence that measles vaccines \"cause deaths every year.\" Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn't cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.",
      "In another interview, Kennedy said, \"The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.\" The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells.",

      "\"Staff are exhausted\"",
      "Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.",
      "\"Local hospitals are at capacity,\" wrote Jeffrey Hill, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. \"The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,\" he added.",
      "\"I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,\" Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. \"Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.\"",
      "The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.",
      "None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child visited relatives in Seminole and returned home with an infection. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua.",
      "Then another child in West Texas died of measles.",
      "In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. \"There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,\" Sugarman said. \"We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.\"",
      "Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. \"A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,\" he said, \"and didn't see the need to confirm it.\"",
      "On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas outbreak over, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.",
      "The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.",
      "More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, alarmed by unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers lacking expertise in vaccines and infectious disease, including some who have expressed anti-vaccine views. One of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, blamed the deaths of children with measles on \"medical mismanagement,\" without evidence.",
      "At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year.",
      "Amid Lubbock's toughest months, Wells sent an email to the department's exhausted staff. \"The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,\" she wrote. \"Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.\"",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: The Trump administration builds up the federal presence in the nation's capital to crack down on crime, and the president vows to use similar tactics in other U.S. cities. The number of National Guard troops sent to protect Washington continues to grow, as President Trump praises his own plan to clean up the city.",

      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): D.C. was a hellhole, and now it's safe. The numbers were horrible. It was a crime-infested rathole. And they do have a lot of rats. We're getting rid of them too.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as Mr. Trump dismissed district leaders' claim of a 30-year low in violent crime, he's vowing a similar surge in Chicago, New York, and other cities. What could that mean for public safety in your community?",
      "We will check in with Maryland Democratic Governor Wes Moore and New York Republican Congressman Mike Lawler.",
      "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hints at an interest rate cut, and the stock market soars. But he also cautions that the U.S. economy is facing challenging times.",

      "JEROME POWELL (Federal Reserve Chairman): There is significant uncertainty about where all of these policies will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be.",

New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen is visiting the region and will join us. We will also talk with UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2,300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside D.C. police forces.",
      "And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future?",
      "Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned as needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore.",
      "And joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic governor, Wes Moore.",
      "Thank you for being here.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-Maryland): Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there \u2013 here in D.C., there are Guardsmen from six different states on the street.",
      "The mission is \u2013 quote \u2013 \"beautification duty and support.\" The defense secretary has author \u2013 authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but, to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of D.C.",
      "Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, there's \u2013 there's plenty of reasons.",
      "You know, one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're \u2013 when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their National Guards to Washington, D.C.",
      "So who's going to \u2013 who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment. And for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big-government approach in the way they're conducting public safety.",
      "The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful.",
      "And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the president's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans, is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this.",
      "And I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received.",
      "When \u2013 when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need \u2013 where you need a surge of supports for \u2013 for traumas and disasters\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: \u2026 that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this. And this is a direct deflection that the president is authorizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the president watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing, because he's tweeting about you \u2013 or TRUTHing, I guess.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says: \"The Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him.\" And he's talking about \"crime-ridden Baltimore.\" It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime.",
      "He says it's a bad one. He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby D.C. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it.",
      "Is the reality here is you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day. And I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation.",
      "So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local \u2013 with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history, over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: That \u2013 well, no, that came from both federal and state money. And, also, Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges.",
      "And the results have been \u2013 have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past 2.5 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20 percent since I have been the governor. And the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet.",
      "And so the reason that I have asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, this \u2013 these tropes, in these 1980s scare tac \u2013 scare tactics.",
      "And, you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called We Our Us, who is a violence intervention group. And they say, we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel, because, while the president is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime,.",
      "But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The president's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore has the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis, fourth highest murder rate.",
      "To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis. But\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Correct.",
      "And we know we have work to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We know \u2013 like, if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But your \u2013 the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help. He doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though. He says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF.",
      "Do you need more federal help in policing, if your mayor thinks you do?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the president to stop cutting funding, because, if you look at the president's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore, that it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons.",
      "Those are actually real, tangible things\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: \u2026 that the president of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is \u2013 President Trump says so as well \u2013 possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's spending a lot of time talking about you.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I have been on his mind a lot.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020, when the, you know, idea was defund the police.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely.",
      "And, yes, the president spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And, yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected.",
      "And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father?",
      "And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods, who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work.",
      "And we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not presidential timber at all.",
      "I imagine you disagree with that assessment?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: No, I have been very clear. I'm not running for president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it's interesting that \u2013 but it's interesting. The president seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people.",
      "And that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland.",
      "Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you. You brought up immigration.",
      "One of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S.",
      "This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and the \u2013 what we know is that, you know, and all we're asking for is that the Constitution be followed on this.",
      "The Constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues. And when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the president manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the president is using to just \u2013 working to exploit the brokenness.",
      "And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety, that\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words, rather than\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process.",
      "I just simply want a court and a judge to decide, what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security, who is \u2013 who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor, and executioner inside this case.",
      "I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting, or gerrymandering, as some people know it.",
      "You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one \u2013 one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, I mean, when I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, because. And I think \u2013 and I think we have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and I think \u2013 and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is, this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the president of the United States, very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes, we're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different.",
      "But Democrats redistrict. You know this.,",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where \u2013 where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps.",
      "And we also need to make sure that if the president of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters' voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent \u2013 they have a Republican representative, that they are actively being represented in Maryland?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think, if you look at maps across the country, less than 10 percent of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature, less than 10 percent.",
      "And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: So that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so, yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, we are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen. She joins us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "Good morning, Senator.",
      "I know we have got a bit of a delay here, so I will launch right in.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-New Hampshire): Good morning, or afternoon here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, exactly.",
      "You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed. The Pentagon did not explain why.",
      "In addition, the Navy reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed.",
      "Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings.",
      "And they come on the heels of firings earlier this year of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of naval operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things \u2013 one of the strengths of America's military are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks who have the training, the expertise to be able to do the jobs.",
      "And what we don't want is political people in those jobs who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So, it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze. And we're going to try to get that back up if we can. The senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan.",
      "We lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator.",
      "Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday this internationally recognized body backed by the U.N., the IPC \u2013 it tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a manmade famine under way in Gaza. This is a very rare designation. Only four other times has one been designated.",
      "The country you are in, Jordan, called it a shameful failure of humanity, that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three-month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen.",
      "One of the \u2013 we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is a \u2013 funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration.",
      "They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in, in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable.",
      "Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he is doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli prime minister's office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it \u2013 quote \u2013 \"a modern blood libel spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\"",
      "That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate, rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor. And the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it.",
      "But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that. They are getting ready to do another \u2013 or they have already started planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people.",
      "So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand your criticism right now.",
      "I want to ask you a little bit, though, about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former Deputy National Security Adviser for President Biden Joe \u2013 Jon Finer just wrote a piece in \"The Atlantic.\"",
      "And he said that, while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes: \"We did far too little far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\"",
      "Do you agree with him? And do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position.",
      "With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in.",
      "I think \u2013 it's something that I hope that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But do you agree with this self-criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We should be doing more, and we should have done more, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "I want to also ask you\u2026",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think everybody should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: \u2026 have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense, when it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid, when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck.",
      "And they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid into the people of Gaza, who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And that can be changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Jeanne Shaheen joining us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "A bit of a delay there.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Congressman Mike Lawler is standing by.",
      "So, stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York.",
      "Good to have you here, Congressman.",
      "There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland. And that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The president encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well.",
      "Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less. And mine wasn't even one of them. Despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat. I won by six and a half points.",
      "So, when you look at the map across the country, the fact is, roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts, they're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and, therefore, they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that, obviously, reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond.",
      "But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year. In 2024, at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become speaker \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting. Despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution.",
      "So, now, New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: So, this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states, trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the president's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the president of the United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Look, obviously it's going to be a fight. But this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid-decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress, like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974, never held a job outside of elected office, it's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform.",
      "So, I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know, there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties because, frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority, period.",
      "On the question, though, that we have been \u2013 also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The president of the United States has mentioned New York as another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Well, crime has been a major problem in New York for years. And Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, but do you want National Guard troops?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized \u2013 Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So, that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80 percent of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution. That 80 percent of these individuals are released back out on to the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington, D.C., 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.",
      "So, when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime? This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013 no, but that's a local \u2013 that's a local issue that would need to get changed.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: No, but this \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the question on the troops, you'd rather troops than \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: But \u2013 but \u2013 but, Margaret, this is why the homicide rate is so high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: FBI agents or ATF agents or DEAL agents? You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City, you would rather National Guardsmen who have to be trained to police?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I want \u2013 I want all of the above. No. No, no, don't \u2013 don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above. The FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime.",
      "I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation, enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I led that effort. And the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington, D.C., only 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous. And it's exactly why the president is cracking down on crime in major cities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York state that \u2013 that matters. A good amount of money from that chips bill went to New York.",
      "On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore. The president wants to buy a 10 percent stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have U.S. taxpayers as a \u2013 as a shareholder, own 10 percent.",
      "As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Generally speaking, no. I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: In the aftermath of the collapse of the market in '08, the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I think what the president is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: That are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: To manufacture chips.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: That is critical for our foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Yes.",

      "Good morning to you.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN (President, Queens College, Cambridge University and Chief Economic Adviser, Allianz): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we saw the \u2013 the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon. But he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So, why then did the financial markets rally?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct, the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability. And the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side and, therefore, an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said, \"significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system.\" \"Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth.\" And there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point. But it's a lot of uncertainty.",
      "Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if basically he's saying, throw out your models?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent. And, therefore, he has tended to be late.",
      "Look, there is something promising in our future. And that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in A.I., in life sciences, in robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds. And that includes high debt and high deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawler just before you. And that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chipmaker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president of the United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, (President Of The United States): He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving up $10 billion for the United States. So, we picked up $10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10 percent stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so. Margaret, look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing. And that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what the U.S. is saying now is we \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which were paid back.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back. But at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas.",
      "The most important distinction, if I may here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10 percent, but it must not control how this company manages its affairs. Because once we go down that road, that is a really dangerous road, and that will (ph) eat way at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic entrepreneurial economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the commerce secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for.",
      "I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve chair, which you've nodded to, but the president is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her, without publicly disclosed evidence, of mortgage fraud, and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell encouraging her to be removed.",
      "Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, these allegations are unproven. And it's important to stress that.",
      "Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So, what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that have resulted in these four resignations.",
      "But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. An independence central bank is critical to the well-being of the economy. And there's lots of reasons for that. So, you know, one has to distinguish between the two, I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information and is \u2013 is denying wrongdoing here.",
      "But just the fact that it is the president directing the attention towards her, doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop, this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I \u2013 my fear, and my concern, is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.",

      "We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday by a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing manmade famine and that those conditions will expand soon.",
      "UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment.",
      "Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us.",
      "We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation, so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL (Executive Director, UNICEF): Well, thank you, Margaret.",
      "Let \u2013 let me say this. You know, it's \u2013 it's been now almost two years since October 7th. And since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for \u2013 for months and months and months, which is the terrible famine.",
      "You know, we've estimated, at this point, that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who have died from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying, beware, right? This \u2013 this famine is just right around the corner and it's \u2013 it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know, it's so \u2013 it's shocking that it's happened because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising.",
      "And what it means really is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image, children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where, you know, suddenly they're \u2013 they're \u2013 they're all quiet. Children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry. And to see that happen and \u2013 especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid into these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the U.N. data is flawed. The prime minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice.",
      "Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot. Journalists who live inside Gaza. Because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know what you're saying is fact?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, let me say two things about that. One is, the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people. And they monitor this as they go and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-laden deaths. So, it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate.",
      "I would also say, to me, it's \u2013 it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, all right. I \u2013 I \u2013 I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not?",
      "First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming. You should see it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absence of that, we're going to have to rely on the \u2013 the data that we have, the people who were there. And I can tell you from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean I have spoken to our staff and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived. Many thousands of children who have had amputations and are \u2013 you know, I mean just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussions, stop the arguing and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children. Make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a decent future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And \u2013 and the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out.",
      "On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Jack Lieu, and another Mideast envoy, have said the U.N. agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why \u2013 why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, I \u2013 the \u2013 the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, U.N. had 400 places where we \u2013 we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, OK. And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food. People are getting shot. It's a \u2013 it's a terrible situation. And it doesn't work. It's not working that well.",
      "Now, look, I don't \u2013 I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our \u2013 let us do our work too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say \"we,\" it's not just UNICEF, it's the U.N., it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that gets to the people who need it. And I \u2013 you know, do both. I'm fine with that. But at least make sure the humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that. Nobody wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. He did indeed.",
      "I want to ask you as well about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good. And we need them to step up and do more.",
      "Sudan, as you say, it's the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the U.S. really can make a much bigger difference if they try to \u2013 to do this work and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here when you don't get \u2013",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: It's horrible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

    "summary": "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said President Trump's rhetoric on crime is \"purely performative\" as the president offered to send troops to Baltimore amid a broader push to crack down on crime.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that President Trump's rhetoric on crime is \"purely performative\" as the president has offered to send troops to Baltimore amid a push to crack down on crime that began in the nation's capital in recent weeks and could extend to other major cities.",
      "\"While the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime. But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States,\" Moore said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump moved to federalize the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department earlier this month and deployed the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement, despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years.",
      "Upon announcing the moves, the president outlined that the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and suggesting it could then move to other cities, though the president has unique authority over the D.C. National Guard because the district is controlled by the federal government. He referenced crime rates in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Baltimore and Oakland.",
      "Last week, Moore, a Democrat, sent a letter to Mr. Trump inviting him to attend a public safety walk in Maryland, while touting the state's investments in local law enforcement and other efforts to address crime under his administration. In 2025, Baltimore has seen a 22% decrease in homicides from last year, according to the Baltimore Police Department.",
      "The governor said Sunday that \"the reason that I asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, these tropes and these 1980s scare tactics.\"",
      "\"We know we have work to do,\" Moore said. \"If one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work, and what tactics is just theatrics.\"",
      "Moore's appearance on \"Face the Nation\" came shortly after Mr. Trump took aim at the governor on Truth Social Sunday morning, responding to the mayor's request by saying, \"As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a 'walk.'\"",
      "Although Mr. Trump dismissed Moore's suggestion, he said last week that he would be joining federal authorities in D.C. \"on patrol.\" He instead visited a U.S. Park Police facility in Southeast D.C.",
      "\"Wes Moore's record on Crime is a very bad one, unless he fudges his figures on crime like many of the other 'Blue States' are doing,\" the president added. \"But if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the 'troops,' which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime.\"",
      "The push in D.C. followed the president's move to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles in June amid heated protests over immigration raids, prompting a lawsuit from the California governor, who did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and called it an illegal \"power grab.\" Mr. Trump and Newsom's sparring has escalated as Newsom's public profile as a potential 2028 candidate has grown.",
      "Moore said Sunday that the operation in D.C. is \"not scalable,\" saying \"you're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city.\" He also argued that the crackdown on crime in the district is \"not sustainable,\" \"deeply disrespectful\" to the National Guard, and \"unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"There is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this,\" Moore added.",
      "The Maryland governor acknowledged that crime must be addressed, while recalling the aftermath of a mass shooting in Baltimore early in his tenure as governor.",
      "\"I said at that point, 'I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer,'\" Moore said. \"And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen. She joins us from Amman, Jordan. Good morning, Senator. I know we've got a bit of a delay here, so I'll launch right in.",
      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Good morning, or, afternoon here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, exactly. You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed, the Pentagon did not explain why. In addition, the Navy Reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed. Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings, and they come on the heels of firings earlier this year, of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of Naval Operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things, one of the strengths of America's military, are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks, who have the training, the expertise, to be able to do the jobs. And what we don't want is political people in those jobs, who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze, and we're going to try to get that back up, if we can. The Senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan. So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan. We- we lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator. Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday, this internationally recognized body, backed by the UN, the IPC. It tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a man-made famine underway in Gaza. This is a very rare designation, only four other times has one been designated. The country you are in, Jordan, called it a \"shameful failure of humanity\" that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think is- it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen. One of the- we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is an- it funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration. They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable. Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he's doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli Prime Minister's Office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it, quote, \"a modern blood libel, spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\" That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor, and the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it. But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death, because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that, they're getting ready to do another- or, they've already started, planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people. So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in, to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I understand your criticism right now. I want to ask you a little bit though about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former deputy national security adviser for President Biden Joe- Jon Finer, just wrote a piece in the Atlantic, and he said that while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes \"we did far too little, far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\" Do you agree with him, and do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position. With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in. I think it's something that, I hope, that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but do you agree with this self criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We should be doing more and we should have done more. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I want to also ask you--",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think everybody--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: --should have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense. When it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck, and they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck, when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's- that's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid in to the people of Gaza who are starving. And that can be changed. All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to dozens of \"sanctuary\" cities and counties \u2014 covering several of the largest cities in the U.S.",
      "The judge had previously ruled in April that it was unconstitutional for President Trump to freeze funding for local governments that limit their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 commonly known as sanctuary cities. That ruling applied to more than a dozen cities and counties that had sued the Trump administration for threatening to cut off funding, including San Francisco, Sacramento, Minneapolis and Seattle.",
      "On Friday, San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended his order to dozens of other places that joined the lawsuit. Those include the second- and third-largest cities in the U.S. \u2014 Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 as well as Boston, Baltimore, Denver and Albuquerque.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement: \"The government \u2014 at all levels \u2014 has the duty to protect American citizens from harm. Sanctuary cities interfere with federal immigration enforcement at the expense of the safety and security of American citizens. We look forward to ultimate vindication on the issue.\"",
      "As Mr. Trump seeks to dramatically boost arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants, top administration officials have pushed local governments to assist \u2014 and they've sought to punish so-called sanctuary jurisdictions with laws on the books that prevent police from helping ICE.",
      "Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump ordered\u00a0his administration to ensure sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Weeks later, the president ordered that federal funding shouldn't \"facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration,\" and Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will not offer grants to sanctuary cities. The administration argues sanctuary cities are interfering with federal law enforcement and making it harder for ICE to arrest undocumented immigrants, including violent criminals.",
      "The cities and counties that are suing the administration call those policies an \"abuse of power\" and allege they violate the Tenth Amendment, which says any powers that aren't given to the federal government should be reserved to the states. They argue that local governments are entitled to choose not to assist ICE, often casting sanctuary policies as a way of building trust between police and local residents whose immigration status may make them wary of reporting crimes.",
      "\"In flagrant disregard of the law, President Trump seeks once again to punish those who disagree with him, coerce local authorities, and commandeer them into carrying out his agenda,\" the cities' lawsuit says.",
      "The Trump administration's moves against sanctuary cities have generated a flurry of lawsuits, including one suit filed earlier this week by 20 states over the Justice Department's decision to tie crime victim grants to immigration enforcement.",
      "The Justice Department has also vowed to sue dozens of alleged sanctuary jurisdictions, including both cities and states.

      "\"I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.\"",
      "In a social media post Friday afternoon, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the deal had been finalized, but did not elaborate.",
      "\"The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,\" Lutnick wrote. \"This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.\"",
      "Lutnick also thanked Tan \"for striking a deal that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "Intel confirmed the deal in a news release Friday evening which stated that the U.S. government would \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",
      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",

      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",

      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey.

      "Bay of Aarhus, Denmark\u00a0\u2014 Below the dark blue waters of the Bay of Aarhus in northern Denmark, archaeologists search for coastal settlements swallowed by rising sea levels more than 8,500 years ago.",
      "This summer, divers descended about 26 feet below the waves close to Aarhus, Denmark's second-biggest city, and collected evidence of a Stone Age settlement from the seabed.",
      "It's part of a $15.5 million six-year international project to map parts of the seabed in the Baltic and North Seas, funded by the European Union, that includes researchers in Aarhus as well as from the U.K.'s University of Bradford and the Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research in Germany.",
      "The goal is to explore sunken Northern European landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic settlements as offshore wind farms and other sea infrastructure expand.",
      "Most evidence of such settlements so far has been found at locations inland from the Stone Age coast, said underwater archaeologist Peter Moe Astrup, who's leading underwater excavations in Denmark.",
      "\"Here, we actually have an old coastline. We have a settlement that was positioned directly at the coastline,\" he said. \"What we actually try to find out here is how was life at a coastal settlement.\"",
      "After the last ice age, huge ice sheets melted and global sea levels rose, submerging Stone Age settlements and forcing the hunter-gatherer human population inland.",
      "About 8,500 years ago, sea levels rose by about 6.5 feet per century, Moe Astrup said.",
      "Moe Astrup and colleagues at the Moesgaard Museum in H\u00f8jbjerg, just outside Aarhus, have excavated an area of about 430 square feet at the small settlement they discovered just off today's coast.",
      "Early dives uncovered animal bones, stones tools, arrowheads, a seal tooth, and a small piece of worked wood, likely a simple tool. The researchers are combing the site meter by meter using a kind of underwater vacuum cleaner to collect material for future analysis.",
      "They hope further excavations will find harpoons, fishhooks or traces of fishing structures.",
      "\"It's like a time capsule,\" Moe Astrup said. \"When sea level rose, everything was preserved in an oxygen-free environment \u2026 time just stops.\"",
      "\"We find completely well-preserved wood,\" he added. \"We find hazelnut. ... Everything is well preserved.\"",
      "Excavations in the relatively calm and shallow Bay of Aarhus and dives off the coast of Germany will be followed by later work at two locations in the more inhospitable North Sea.",
      "The sea level rise thousands of years ago submerged, among other things, a vast area known as Doggerland that connected Britain with continental Europe and now lies underneath the southern North Sea.",
      "To build a picture of the rapid rise of the waters, Danish researchers are using dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.",
      "Submerged tree stumps preserved in mud and sediment can be dated precisely, revealing when rising tides drowned coastal forests.",
      "\"We can say very precisely when these trees died at the coastlines,\" Moesgaard Museum dendrochronologist Jonas Ogdal Jensen said as he peered at a section of Stone Age tree trunk through a microscope.",
      "\"That tells us something about how the sea level changed through time.\"",
      "As today's world faces rising sea levels driven by climate change, the researchers hope to shed light on how Stone Age societies adapted to shifting coastlines more than eight millennia ago.",
      "\"It's hard to answer exactly what it meant to people,\" Moe Astrup said. \"But it clearly had a huge impact in the long run because it completely changed the landscape.\"",
      "Sea levels rose by a global average of around 1.7 inches in the decade up to 2023.",
      "Denmark has seen several significant archaeological discoveries in recent years, including a metal detectorist's stunning find early last year of gold ring set with a red semi-precious stone that researchers hoped would shed light on the country's history during the early middle ages.",
      "Officials at the National Museum of Denmark announced that find after the centuries-old ring, believed to have been owned by a member of the royal family some 1,400 years ago, was transferred from a different museum nearer to the discovery site in the south, near the German border.",
      "That discovery came just weeks after archaeologists found a small knife inscribed with runic letters dated to the first or second century AD, or almost 2,000 years ago. It was the oldest trace of writing ever found in Denmark, according to the Museum Odense.",
      "Runes, or runic letters, are the oldest alphabet known to have been used in Scandinavia, having been in use for about 1,000 years until they were largely replaced by the Latin alphabet when Christians started spreading their belief system in the 10th century.",

    "summary": "The first commercial carbon storage facility has been inaugurated off Norway's coast, but is storing CO2 deep under the seabed really the answer?",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature warned in early 2025 that 28%, or more than 47,000, of the world's assessed species are at risk of extinction. That number includes more than just animal species, showing crucial insect, plant and tree species are also threatened.",
      "\"So we think, okay, well, we're losing the species here and there, you know, there's a lot of other species,\" Songer says, \"but the thing is, that when we lose one species, it has cascading effects.\"",
      "A great example of this effect is with the black-footed ferret, which originally inhabited the North American Great Plains but has been endangered since 1967. While the species remains on the endangered list, its population has grown since preservation efforts began at the Institute.",

    "story": [
      "For the second time in a row, SpaceX was forced to call off an attempt to launch its giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket on the program's 10th test flight, a milestone mission to demonstrate fixes and upgrades in the wake of three catastrophic failures earlier this year.",
      "A launch attempt Sunday at SpaceX's sprawling Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast was called off because of an oxygen leak in a ground system. Monday's scrub came with less than a minute to go because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad that did not move out of the area in time.",
      "The company says it will try for the third time Tuesday night. The hour-long launch window begins at 7:30 p.m. ET.",
      "Whenever it takes off, a successful flight would clear the way for a faster launch cadence as SpaceX gears up to test autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, a requirement for a NASA moon landing as early as 2027 and for eventual flights to Mars.",
      "But the company will have to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy-tankers to refuel a moon-bound Starship lander being built for NASA's Artemis program. Many observers doubt the system will be perfected in time for a 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese mount their own moon mission at the end of the decade.",
      "Speaking before the Monday launch attempt, SpaceX founder Elon Musk agreed that \"there are thousands of engineering challenges that remain for both the ship and the booster.\" He put a special emphasis on perfecting orbital refueling.",
      "\"No one has ever demonstrated [cryogenic] propellant transfer in orbit,\" he said. \"This will be propellant transfer at very large scale. But with full reusability and propellant transfer, those are the key technologies needed for building a city on Mars. And I'm confident the SpaceX team will achieve these goals.\"",
      "In the near term, SpaceX's goal is to get the Super Heavy-Starship flying again after multiple back-to-back failures.",
      "The goals of the flight are to test the Super Heavy first stage under a variety of stressful flight conditions, deliberately shutting engines down during descent to splashdown in the Gulf to make sure it can handle real failures during an actual mission.",
      "Given the nature of the tests, SpaceX ruled out a dramatic return to the launch pad for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms on the support gantry.",
      "As for the Starship, the flight plan calls for sending the upper stage halfway around the world on a suborbital trajectory to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along the way, a variety of tests are planned, including the deployment of eight Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space restart of a methane-fueled Raptor engine. Modified heat shield tiles are in place to determine their ability to withstand extreme reentry temperatures.",
      "Multiple upgrades are also in place to minimize the chances of propellant leaks, fires and engine shutdowns like those that led to the loss of the last three Starships launched, none of which were able to complete their mission.",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, is optimistic SpaceX will work the bugs out in time for the agency's planned moon landing mission.",
      "\"If you look at the company as a whole and past performance, they often times are behind, and then all of a sudden, they make these massive leaps forward,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"I would be hard-pressed to say they're not going to meet the goals and the timelines.\"",
      "\"Their leadership has said we feel very confident that we are going to be ready for the mission. And so I'll take them at their word,\" he said.",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a moon landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",
      "But as Duffy pointed out, SpaceX has chalked up a remarkable record with its partially reusable Falcon family of rockets, launching them at an unmatched pace that allows the company to rapidly implement and test upgrades and fixes.",
      "As of Friday, SpaceX has launched 518 Falcon 9s and 11 triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets with just two in-flight failures. The company has successfully recovered first-stage boosters 490 times.",
      "Given its record, many fans give SpaceX the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Super Heavy-Starship. But the giant rocket dwarfs the Falcon 9, and the requirements for a successful moon landing are well beyond those faced in a typical satellite launcher.",
      "\"My concerns have to do with how complicated the mission architecture is, how many flights there are to send a single lander to the moon,\" said Douglas Cooke, a retired 38-year NASA veteran who now does consulting work for Boeing and other aerospace concerns.",

    "summary": "Taking no chances, SpaceX called off an attempt to launch its huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket after running into problems with ground equipment.",
    "story": [
      "After three catastrophic in-flight failures in a row, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket for launch Sunday evening from the Texas Gulf Coast to put a variety of upgrades to the test and to deliberately stress the vehicle to learn more about its capabilities.",
      "Test flight No. 10 was expected to get underway at 7:30 p.m. ET from SpaceX's Starbase flight and manufacturing facility and the team was in the process of pumping liquid oxygen and methane fuel into the 40-story-tall rocket when the company announced a scrub.",
      "\"Standing down from today's tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,\" the company said on X. SpaceX later announced that another hour-long launch window would open at 7:30 p.m. EDT Monday.",
      "The flight plan had called for the 30-foot wide, 230-foot tall Super Heavy booster, generating more than 16 million pounds of thrust, to propel the Starship out of the dense lower atmosphere before it would fall away, flip around and head back toward the coast.",
      "During three of the nine previous test flights, the booster flew itself all the way back to its launch pad where giant mechanical arms on the service gantry plucked the descending rocket out of midair. This time around, because of the planned tests, the Super Heavy was expected to descend to splashdown in the Gulf, but it never took off.",
      "SpaceX previously said the primary objectives for the booster test was focused on its landing burn. One of the three center engines used for the final phase of landing was going to be \"intentionally disabled to gather data on the ability for a backup engine from the middle ring to complete a landing burn,\" the company said on its website.",
      "The booster was then going to use two engines toward the end of the descent and hover briefly before dropping to the Gulf.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship, meanwhile, powered by six Raptor engines of its own, would have headed for a suborbital trajectory carrying it halfway around the world before a belly-first reentry, a flip back to vertical and a rocket-powered descent to splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along with deploying eight Starlink simulator satellites, the Starship's flight computer had planned to attempt a variety of other tests, including an in-space engine restart, to verify the performance of numerous upgrades implemented in the wake of the most recent test flight failures.",
      "Working the bugs out of the giant launcher is critical to SpaceX and founder Elon Musk, who designed the ultra-heavy-lift rocket to launch thousands of next-generation Starlinks and other satellites in Earth's orbit and to one day carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The rocket also is critical to NASA, which is paying SpaceX more than $3 billion to develop a modified version of the Starship upper stage to carry Artemis astronauts to the surface of the moon in 2027.",
      "But that flight will require 10 to 20 Super Heavy-Starship flights just to refuel the \"Human Landing System,\" or HLS, lander before it can head to the moon. Transferring thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid nitrogen and oxygen in space has never been attempted.",
      "And it is still not known how SpaceX plans to control propellant temperatures to minimize the amount that will naturally warm up and turn into a gas, which must be vented overboard. SpaceX has provided no details. Musk promised pre-launch update Sunday on the company's plans going forward, but the talk was also canceled with no explanation.",
      "Given the number of flights that must be successfully executed to demonstrate the reliability NASA will expect, the 2027 target date for the Artemis 3 moon landing is considered unrealistic, if not impossible to meet, by many aerospace observers.",
      "China plans to launch its own astronauts on the moon by 2030. It is unclear at this point whether NASA and SpaceX will get back to the moon using the Starship lander before the Chinese plant their own flag on the lunar surface.",
      "Given the sheer size and power of the Super Heavy-Starship \u2014 it has more than twice the thrust of NASA's current Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket \u2014 technical problems during development were not unexpected.",
      "But given the short time between now and NASA's first planned Artemis moon landing, the problems have clearly set the program back and cast doubt on the overall mission architecture, especially the requirement for 10 to 20 problem-free flights in short order just to fuel the lander for its flight to the moon.",
      "The first three test flights of the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage in 2023 and 2024 ended in catastrophic failures with both stages destroyed, either while still attached to each other or after separation.",
      "The fourth flight in June 2024 was generally successful with the Super Heavy flying itself back to a controlled splashdown in the Gulf while the Starship followed the planned sub-orbital trajectory to splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The ship's fins were damaged by reentry heating, but otherwise worked as required.",
      "The fifth flight in October 2024 was highlighted by a successful Super Heavy return to the launch pad gantry where giant mechanical arms snagged the rocket in mid air. The Starship, meanwhile, managed a second controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean although it again suffered fin damage during reentry.",
      "During the sixth integrated flight test in November 2024, the Super Heavy attempted another return to the launch site but it was diverted to a Gulf splashdown because of launch damage to critical sensors in the pad's capture mechanism. The Starship again flew itself to a controlled Indian Ocean splashdown with minimal flap damage.",
      "But the next three flights, in January, March and May of this year, ended with catastrophic failures. Two Super Heavy boosters successfully returned to the launch site, but the most recent broke up over the Gulf while testing a high angle-of-attack entry.",
      "All three Starships were destroyed after catastrophic malfunctions, including two propellant leaks, an on-board fire and multiple engine failures.",
      "In addition to the flight record, another Starship was destroyed on the ground when a high-pressure nitrogen tank exploded during an engine test firing at the Starbase launch site.",

    "story": [
      "SpaceX early Sunday launched its 33rd resupply mission to the International Space Station, sending up a Dragon capsule loaded with 2.5 tons of equipment and supplies along with an add-on thruster kit to help maintain the lab's altitude.",
      "Perched atop a workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, commercial resupply mission 33 got underway with a sky-lighting launch from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 2:45 a.m. ET, climbing away on a northeasterly trajectory lined up with the space station's orbit.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, moments after the discarded first-stage booster safely landed on an offshore droneship, the Dragon was released from the rocket's second stage, kicking off a 29-hour rendezvous with the orbiting laboratory complex.",
      "If all goes well, the cargo ship will move in for docking at the station's forward port at 7:30 a.m. Monday. On board: more than 2,400 pounds of crew supplies, nearly 1,000 pounds of science gear, 1,300 pounds of space station hardware, computer equipment and spacewalk gear.",
      "The food includes the usual variety of fresh, asked-for items for the crew, including coffee, tea and more than 1,500 tortillas.",
      "\"We fly tortillas because ... other breads and things like that have too many crumbs and things of that nature (that float away in weightlessness), so you can't actually maintain it in orbit,\" said Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager. \"Tortillas are a great substitute for that.\"",
      "On a more significant note, Heidi Parris, associate program scientist for the space station, noted that NASA will mark 25 years of continuous human presence aboard the lab in November.",
      "During that quarter century, she said, \"we've hosted more than 280 residents, we've enabled more than 4,000 different ... scientific experiments and technology demonstrations (representing) the work of over 5,000 researchers from over 110 countries around the world.\"",
      "The CRS-33 mission will bring 50 research projects to the lab, including a new study of the effects of microgravity on bone loss, a 3D metal printer to assess the capability for manufacturing spare parts and tools on demand in space, and an experiment to study the effectiveness of 3D \"bioprinting.\"",
      "\"This investigation ... is looking to create a 3D-printed implantable medical device that can support nerve regrowth after injury by bridging the gap to reconnect severed nerves while also simultaneously delivering drugs that can support nerve regeneration,\" Parris said.",
      "Of special interest to NASA is the performance of an add-on propulsion system consisting of two SpaceX Draco engines, six propellant tanks and a supply of helium to pressurize the system. The hardware is mounted in the Dragon's open-to-space aft trunk section.",
      "\"The space station's altitude slowly decays over time due to the thin amount of atmosphere still at our altitude,\" Spetch said. \"To counteract that drag, we must occasionally raise the altitude of the ISS.\"",
      "The Russians handle the majority of those re-boost operations, delivering the needed propellants and periodically firing thrusters aboard Progress cargo ships and the station itself.",
      "\"With the addition of the boost trunk on this mission, Dragon will also provide this ability to maintain the station's altitude,\" Spetch said. \"The boost kit will help sustain the orbiting lab's altitude starting in September with a series of burns planned periodically throughout the fall of 2025.\"",
      "The CRS-33 Dragon will remain docked to the station until December. During that time, the boost kit will provide the one and a half Progress missions.",
      "Sarah Walker, director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said the boost kit will provide about a quarter of the propulsion needed in one year to maintain the station's 260-mile-high altitude. The first \"burn,\" expected to last about 20 minutes, is planned for Sept. 3.",

    "summary": "During its secretive mission, the X-37B will test new laser communications gear and a \"quantum\" navigation sensor.",
    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off late Thursday, propelling a reusable X-37B Space Force rocket plane into space on a classified long-duration mission. It was the eighth such flight since the program's debut in 2010 and the first since a 434-day mission ended last March.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 roared away from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 11:50 p.m. EDT, arcing onto a northeasterly trajectory atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust from the booster's nine first-stage engines.",
      "After the spacecraft climbed out of the lower atmosphere, the engines shut down, the first stage fell away, flipped around and re-ignited three engines to reverse course and head back to Florida. Heralded by an attention-getting sonic boom, the booster landed at the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to wrap up its sixth flight.",
      "It was SpaceX's 66th booster landing in Florida and the company's 490th successful recovery overall.",
      "As usual with classified Space Force missions, SpaceX ended its launch commentary with the first stage landing and offered no information about the Falcon 9's second stage climb to orbit, when the Boeing-built X-37B was to be released to fly on its own, or any details about its orbit.",
      "The seven previous X-37B missions -- three by the orbiter launched Thursday and four by a twin sister ship -- all carried out long-duration missions ranging from 224 days to nearly 909 days. It's not known how long the X-37B launched Thursday will remain in orbit.",
      "While the flights are generally classified, Space Force and Boeing officials publicly discussed two of the payloads on board.",
      "One  will test high-speed, tightly-targeted laser communications between the  X-37B and small data relay satellites making up a growing  \"proliferated\" space-based communications system.",
      "The tests \"will mark an important step in the U.S. Space Force's  ability to leverage proliferated space networks as part of a diversified  and redundant space architecture,\" said Gen. Chance Saltzman, director of space operations for the U.S. Space Force.",
      "\"In so doing, it will strengthen the resilience, reliability, adaptability and data transport speeds of our satellite communications architecture.\"",
      "The other publicly disclosed payload is a sophisticated quantum navigation sensor designed to determine a spacecraft's precise position in space by \"detecting rotation and acceleration of atoms without reliance on satellite networks like traditional GPS,\" the Space Force said in an on-line description.",
      "\"Whether navigating beyond Earth-based orbits in cislunar space or operating in GPS-denied environments, quantum inertial sensing allows for robust navigation capabilities when GPS navigation is not possible,\" said Space Delta 9 commander Col. Ramsey Horn.",
      "\"Ultimately, this technology contributes significantly to our thrust within the Fifth Space Operations Squadron and across the Space Force guaranteeing movement and maneuverability even in GPS-denied environments.\"",
      "Clad in black heat shield tiles and white insulation blankets, the unpiloted X-37B resembles a mini space shuttle with stubby delta wings and two tail fins extending from either side of the rear of the fuselage. It can be launched atop SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets or United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 and Vulcan boosters.",
      "Two virtually identical X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles, or OTVs, are operated by the Pentagon's Rapid Capabilities Office for the U.S. Space Force. The vehicles are designed to serve as test beds for avionics and advanced sensors, to evaluate reusable spacecraft components and to provide a platform for experiments that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Powered by solar cells and batteries, the orbiters feature a small payload bay similar to a space shuttle's that can accommodate a variety of sensors and experiment packages.",
      "The compact spacecraft are designed to end their missions with runway landings at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California or the Kennedy Space Center in Florida using 3-mile-long runways originally built for the space shuttle.",
      "The most recent flight of an X-37B began with a\u00a0launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on Dec. 29, 2023. It ended last March 7, with touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center after 434 days and six hours in space. Going into Thursday's mission, the two X-37Bs had logged a combined 11-and-a-half years in space across seven flights.",

    "story": [
      "Editor's note: This article contains descriptions and an image of hate speech found on the Roblox servers and might be triggering to some readers.",
      "In Roblox, one of the world's largest online gaming platforms, users join to play, create, and be themselves in a virtual world \u2014 but some might be there for a more insidious purpose: to expose youth to hate speech.",
      "Players of \"Spray Paint!\" \u2014 a popular game on Roblox, with over a billion visits, in which players skate and create graffiti art in a virtual skatepark setting \u2014 can bypass moderation by spray painting hate messages across walls, ramps and other virtual game settings, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "CBS News documented dozens of swastikas and at least a dozen instances of hate speech targeting minority groups across Spray Paint! servers, which host multiplayer games. There are millions of games on Roblox where players can join servers to play with friends and strangers.",
      "What's happening in \"Spray Paint!\" is not uncommon \u2014 nor surprising. Roblox currently has at least 18 active lawsuits pending nationwide due to inappropriate content found on its games, attorney Matthew Dolman, whose firm is representing individuals in cases against Roblox, told CBS News.",
      "Roblox said in an emailed statement to CBS News that its 24/7 moderation system closely monitors the platform, and that the company takes \"swift action against any content or users found to be in violation.\"",
      "However, hate speech still appears in Roblox games, like Spray Paint, CBS News found. \"Within three minutes of getting in there for the first time, I also saw a swastika,\" said Rachel Franz, the early childhood advocacy program director at the nonprofit Fairplay, which advocates for children's online safety.",
      "Hate can run rampant across various Roblox games. A group called Active Shooter Studios recreates school shootings at Columbine, Uvalde and Parkland and consistently evades efforts to take down recreations, the Anti-Defamation League found in an April report. A lawsuit filed this month alleges that Roblox hosted hundreds of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs-themed games, as well as more than 900 user accounts registered across Roblox with variations of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's name.",
      "\"Roblox is fully aware that these experiences pervade its app, and it allows them to continue to exist unchecked despite the ability to control or eliminate them,\" the lawsuit alleges, and said the effects on children can be devastating.",
      "Last week, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill filed a child protection lawsuit against the platform.",
      "\"Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,\" Murrill, a Republican, alleged in a press release. \"Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Roblox said, \"We share Attorney General Murrill's urgency to help keep kids safe because safety has always been our priority,\" adding that it looks forward to working with Murrill to help keep children safe.",
      "\"We share the critically important goal of keeping kids safe online and any assertion otherwise is categorically untrue,\" Roblox's statement said. \"We hold ourselves to the highest standard and work constantly to remove violative content and bad actors.\"",
      "What children are encountering",
      "Predators can troll Roblox, experts say, and other similar gaming platforms, to recruit young players for extremist groups or possibly sexual exploitation.",
      "Children and teens make up more than half of Roblox players, and about 40% of players are under the age of 13, according to a 2024 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Roblox attracts an average of 97.8 million daily active users.",
      "\"If you are a predator, it's very clear that there are opportunities to access vulnerable folks on these platforms,\" Franz said.",
      "When children play the Spray Paint! game, they might see slurs targeting Black and Jewish people and phrases like \"KKK\" and \"Jew\" etched in graffiti on virtual brick walls. In one server, there were over 14 instances of this speech, CBS News found, as well as a reference to the \"Third Reich.\"",
      "The phrase \"I can't breathe,\" the words uttered by George Floyd, who died in 2020 in police custody by an officer later convicted of murder, was written across a virtual brick wall in one server. Some servers had graphic sexual drawings, and in another, there was an instance of suicidal language, CBS News found.",
      "Roblox's chat feature, available in some games, has a filtering system that prevents inappropriate content, like discriminatory speech, from being visible, but in Spray Paint! players can bypass filtering mechanisms by scrawling text via the game's paint feature as opposed to writing in the chat, where content is filtered.",
      "Users must enter their birthday when creating a Roblox account, but the platform doesn't require authentication, meaning adults can pose as children and children can pose as older than they actually are. Kids can converse with other players via the voice chat feature \u2014 which has a minimum age requirement of 13 \u2014but also doesn't require age verification.",
      "Roblox says the company has implemented what it calls a \"trusted flagger program,\" where trusted partners can report \"terrorist content\" in an effort to crack down on hate messages.",
      "Roblox also says on its website that content uploaded to be incorporated into games is evaluated in a multi-step review process to screen for child sexual abuse material and other inappropriate content. If it is identified as fodder for possible child sexual abuse, Roblox says it is automatically reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit organization focusing on finding missing children and reducing child exploitation.",
      "Roblox has developed an artificial intelligence system that the company says helped submit about 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to NCMEC \u2014 and last year, Roblox submitted 24,522 reports to NCMEC overall.",
      "Roblox says it has a human review team continuously evaluating flagged games and encourages users to report concerning activity. Spray Paint! players have the option to play in \"safe mode,\" which allows them to only view art created by other players who are on their \"friends\" list in the app.",
      "A Roblox spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement that \"while no system is perfect,\" the company has implemented safeguards including \"restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, as well as content maturity [l]abels and parental controls.\"",
      "\"We share with our community the critically important goal of keeping everyone safe online and ensuring users have positive experiences on Roblox that align with our strict Community Standards,\" the statement said, adding, \"We continuously innovate to deter bad actors and have launched over 50 safety features since last year.\"",
      "Despite efforts to curb extremism and the targeting of young players, experts and CBS News found that protections remain easy to override.",
      "\"There's a larger question of how you regulate and moderate something that is supposed to encourage creativity and freedom of expression, but actually ends up introducing some really unsafe and truly harmful and disgusting practices,\" Franz said.",
      "A double-edged sword",
      "Allegations in several cases suggest Roblox has also been used to exploit teens and children. A Florida teenager was arrested\u00a0in April for allegedly targeting children on Roblox, where he would demand child sexual abuse material over text messages or the messaging platform Discord. In Texas, a lawsuit filed in April alleges a 13-year-old girl was groomed and sexually exploited on Roblox and later, Discord. Roblox has recently been hit by a spate of lawsuits with similar claims. Dolman said his firm currently has seven cases and is investigating 400 more. Another firm filed a lawsuit earlier this month against Roblox and Discord representing over 400 people.",
      "A man in California was arrested\u00a0in April on kidnapping and sexual misconduct charges in connection with a 10-year-old he is believed to have met through Roblox. Last year, a woman in Florida was arrested for allegedly using Roblox to instruct a 10-year-old to kill an infant by dropping the 2-month-old on a tile floor. The infant was seriously injured.",
      "When asked for a response to the lawsuits, Roblox said in an email that the company is \"deeply troubled\" by any incident that endangers its users, noting that safety is a top priority.",
      "\"Roblox is committed to empowering parents and caregivers to help ensure a safe online experience for their children.\"",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced in April that he issued a subpoena to Roblox.",
      "\"There are concerning reports that this gaming platform, which is popular among children, is exposing them to harmful content and bad actors,\" he said in a press release. \"We are issuing a subpoena to Roblox to uncover how this platform is marketing to children and to see what policies they are implementing\u2014if any\u2014to avoid interactions with predators.\"",
      "Open-world games like Spray Paint!, where users can roam a virtual space in relative anonymity, can be a double-edged sword. Doris Chang, a psychologist and associate professor at New York University's Silver School of Social Work, says that these spaces can be affirming for queer youth.",
      "\"They can be whoever they want. Gender fluidity is really common,\" Chang said, adding it can also put those groups at risk for exposure to hate speech and predatory individuals.",
      "\"You're just interacting with people that you wouldn't normally interact with. It's completely wide open,\" Chang said.",
      "Chang said when children play a game like Spray Paint! without parental supervision, they may have to navigate problematic scenarios that might be confusing or upsetting.",
      "\"It brings up the larger question about how much parents know about what their kids are getting exposed to online,\" she said. \"Broadly speaking, Roblox is just one corner of the internet that our kids are navigating.\"",

    "summary": "Tommy Fello struggled to regain function after a stroke affected the left side of his body. A new technology is making a difference.",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Tommy Fello was driving from his Ohio establishment to his house on Christmas Eve when he started veering off the road. Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.",
      "But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance.",
      "\"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering,\" Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg.",
      "\"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything,\" Fello said.",
      "A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements.",
      "Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.",
      "\"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore,\" Fello said. \"We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'\"",
      "A \"first-of-its-kind technology\"",
      "One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the Vivistim System. The FDA-approved implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They regulate the body's involuntary functions.",
      "The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises.",
      "Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in \"greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors,\" Nossek said in emailed remarks.",
      "\"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use,\" Nossek said. \"This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population.\"",
      "A 108-person trial\u00a0published in The Lancet in 2021\u00a0found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have \"moderate to severe deficits\" qualify for the device, the company\u00a0said in a fact sheet.",
      "Implant aids in recovery",
      "Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025.",
      "\"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked,\" Fello said.",
      "The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with \"less than 1% chance of any complications.\" Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey.",
      "Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't \"something he could have done before.\" Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.",
      "\"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it,\" he said.",
      "\"The sky's the limit\"",
      "About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and other new technologies may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said.",
      "\"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back,\" Bain said. \"In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery.\"",
      "At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but shared a map that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy.",
      "\"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back,\" Covey said. \"This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down.\"",

    "story": [
      "If you look up at the sky in Texas and see what could be a flying burrito, you may not be imagining things: Chipotle on Thursday launched an autonomous aerial delivery service for digital orders in the Dallas area.",
      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",
      "\"With Zipline, you tap a button, and minutes later food magically appears \u2014 hot, fresh, and ultra-fast,\" Zipline CEO and co-founder Rinaudo Cliffton said in the same announcement. \"What once felt like science fiction is soon going to become totally normal,\" he added.",
      "For now, each autonomous aircraft can carry orders of up to 5.5 pounds in weight. That will increase eventually to 8 pounds, Chipotle said.",
      "Last year, Chipotle was criticized by some customers who alleged certain restaurants were\u00a0skimping on portions. The company initially denied the claims, before then CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0acknowledged that about 10%\u00a0of Chipotle's 3,500 locations had indeed been underserving customers.",

      "As of 9:45 a.m. EST, the S&P 500 was down 2 points, or 0.1%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial Average gained 2 points. The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 56 points. But this muted start to morning trading in the U.S. contrasted with sharp declines on global markets, as investors digested news of a potential Fed shakeup that could reshape the composition of the Board of Governors.",
      "The nonplussed start to morning trading came as investors digested news of a potential Fed shakeup that could reshape the composition of the Board of Governors.",
      "Mr. Trump made his announcement in a letter posted on Truth Social on Monday evening, accusing Cook of mortgage fraud. The president said the move was \"effective immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was repeating allegations against Cook first leveled earlier this month by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday threw out the Trump administration's challenge to a standing order issued by a U.S. district court in Maryland that bars federal immigration officials from immediately removing migrants who are challenging the legality of their detentions.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen came in a novel and unprecedented lawsuit that the Trump administration filed against all 15 judges on the Maryland court in June. The Justice Department had argued that the standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell in May was unlawful and outside the authority of the court.",
      "The judges, represented by Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under former President George W. Bush, sought to dismiss the lawsuit. They argued that the suit presented a dispute between two co-equal branches of government that could not be decided by the courts.",
      "In a 37-page decision, Cullen agreed with the judges in finding that the Trump administration's challenge should be dismissed because, in part, the U.S. does not have the legal right to sue and the judges are absolute immune from the suit.",
      "\"Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,\" he wrote. \"The Executive's lawsuit will be dismissed, and its motion for preliminary injunction denied as moot. Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.\"",
      "Cullen said that if the Trump administration \"truly believes\" that the standing orders violate the law, it should pursue the paths laid out by Congress.",
      "\"Any fair reading of the legal authorities cited by Defendants leads to the ineluctable conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss,\" he wrote. \"To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.\"",
      "While the suit was filed in federal district court in Maryland, Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump to serve on the U.S. district court in Roanoke, Virginia, was assigned to preside over the case.",
      "Cullen's ruling was not a surprise. In a hearing earlier this month in Maryland, the judge previewed his decision, telling Justice Department attorneys that the \"far less destructive\" move by the Justice Department would be to appeal the standing order in one of the cases where it had been issued, rather than sue another branch of the government to \"accomplish its institutional interests.\"",
      "He echoed that position in his decision, writing that \"under normal circumstances,\" it would not be a surprise if the government raised its concerns about the legality of the standing order through the mechanisms laid out by Congress.",
      "\"But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times \u2014 at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,\" Cullen wrote. \"It's no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue \u2014 and in a big way.\"",
      "In a footnote in his decision, Cullen criticized the Trump administration's repeated attacks on members of the federal judiciary who have ruled against the president's agenda.",
      "\"Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,\" Cullen wrote.",
      "The standing order issued by Russell earlier this year prevents federal immigration officials from removing or altering the legal status of any migrant detainee who filed a habeas corpus petition for two business days.",
      "The court adopted the order to address the rise in migrants in Maryland who were at risk of imminent deportation from the U.S. and sought review of their detentions. Signed by Russell, the chief judge, the order states that it aims to \"preserve existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction\" of the Maryland district court over pending matters, ensure immigrant petitioners can participate in court proceedings and have access to legal counsel, and guarantee the government has a \"fulsome opportunity\" to present its defense.",
      "Among the judges named in the Trump administration's lawsuit was U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing the legal cases filed by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who has sued twice in the district over his March deportation and, most recently, confinement by immigration authorities. On Monday, Abrego Garcia filed a habeas petition challenging the legality of his detention by immigration officials. The court issued its standing order and temporarily blocked his immediate removal to a potential third-country, Uganda, where the Trump administration is attempting to send him.",

      "According to the U.S. Department of Energy, adjusting your thermostat by 7-10 degrees Fahrenheit (4-6 degrees Celsius) for eight hours a day can save up to 10% a year on heating and cooling.",
      "Experts say there are a lot of factors to consider when deciding what AC habits save the most energy and money.",
      "\"If you're gone for like 15 minutes to go to the grocery store, you don't get any gain\" by turning off your AC said Elizabeth Hewitt, professor and urban planning expert at Stony Brook University.",
      "But as a general rule, \"if you're going for your work day, say for eight hours or so, you'll almost always save more energy and money by turning things off,\" she said.",
      "In some climates, however, turning off the AC might not be feasible, so residents can set back their AC a few degrees instead of blasting cold air all day.",
      "In dry places like Arizona, you can let the home warm up more by raising the thermostat a few degrees higher. But in humid climates like Florida, air inside the home can become damp and harder to cool, and turning the AC off for long periods can increase the risk of mold since the system helps control indoor moisture.",
      "Bumping up the thermostat by 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) yields about a 3% savings in cooling costs, said Patrick Phelan, mechanical engineering professor at Arizona State University.",
      "Phelan also said leaving your AC off for hours and then turning it back on could lead to wear that results in more frequent repairs. That is because it can take AC systems 15 to 30 minutes after they are turned on to perform most efficiently.",
      "Type of home",
      "How much energy and money you can save depends on the kind of home you live in, said Gregor Henze, an architectural engineering professor at the University of Colorado Boulder.",
      "Homes built with heavy materials like concrete or brick hold in cool air longer, while older, draftier houses heat up faster.",
      "In less insulated homes, Henze said, it makes sense to adjust the thermostat even if you're stepping out for just a few hours, because the indoor temperature can rise quickly.",
      "AC unit and thermostat",
      "Whether you have a window unit, a smart thermometer or central air could influence your savings.",
      "Window units are generally less efficient because they're installed in an open window, making it difficult to seal out hot air completely, said Hewitt. She added that spraying \"cheap foam spray insulation in open windows or areas that are drafty is a really low-hanging fruit that doesn't cost a lot of money and really helps retain the indoor temperature in your home.\"",
      "Phelan says smart thermostats are a handy tool to remove the mental burden of tinkering with your manual thermostat multiple times a day. Smart thermostats \"learn\" by monitoring the occupancy with a sensor and raise the temperature when no one is home to conserve energy and lower it when people return.",
      "\"If you're going from just an ordinary manual thermostat to installing a smart one like a Nest, then you can expect something like 10% savings,\" said Phelan.",
      "Other ways to keep homes cool",
      "Each expert said simple steps like blocking sunlight can go a long way in keeping homes cool.",
      "Henze pointed to \"time-honored strategies\" such as opening windows at night when it's cooler. In dry climates, that night air doesn't add much moisture, but in humid regions it can bring in dampness the AC will later need to remove.",
      "Hewitt added that closing your blinds can make a difference of several degrees. Phelan also noted that some blinds are designed to reflect sunlight and said tinted window films are another option.",
      "Ceiling fans can also help. Experts recommend setting them to rotate counterclockwise during the summer so they push warm air down and keep a cool breeze going. In the fall and winter, rotation should be switched back to clockwise so that warm air is circulated throughout a room as it rises, Laurie Wheelock, executive director and counsel at New York's Utility Project, told CBS News earlier this summer.",
      "Indoor plants can also be helpful by creating shade, and limiting oven use can help keep a space from warming up, according to experts.",

    "summary": "Unable to find buyers, a growing number of sellers are pulling their homes off the market rather than compromise on price.",
    "story": [
      "In a sign of home sellers' frustration over how long it's taking to find a buyer,\u00a0more owners are opting to pull their property off the market rather than lower the asking price.",
      "That's according to a recent\u00a0report from Realtor.com finding that so-called delistings, or homes taken off the market without having been sold, were up 38% in June since the start of 2025 and 48% from a year ago.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer sellers are deciding to enter the market, and increasingly more are deciding to jump out,\" Jake Krimmel, senior economist at Realtor.com told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Signs of deadlock",
      "One indicator that more sellers are exiting the housing market is the ratio between the number of delistings and listings. For every 100 new homes listed nationally in June, 21 homes were taken off the market, the report found. That's up from 13 delisted homes per 100 new listings in May.",
      "A steady rise in delistings could push buyers and sellers further apart, creating a deadlock in the housing market, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"The thing that's going to prevent buyers and sellers from getting closer together is if all the sellers who maybe could or should be lowering their prices to meet the demand where it is are instead taking their homes off the market altogether,\" he said. \"So it's kind of like keeping us in this holding pattern.\"",
      "The trend comes as the supply of homes for sale begins to grow in certain U.S. regions, causing prices in those areas to drop. The number of homes for sale in July surged nearly 25% from a year ago, a post-pandemic high, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Despite the rise in housing inventory, home sales around the U.S. remain relatively stagnant, with steep prices and high mortgage rates continuing to deter many would-be homebuyers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Realtor.com data shows that pending home sales, or listings under contract, in July fell 3% in compared with the same period last year.",
      "No hurry to sell",
      "When homeowners are eager to sell a property, they typically lower the price in order to offload it quicker. However, those who are not up against the same type of time constraints may be willing to wait it out longer \u2014 especially if they're benefiting from a favorable mortgage rate.",
      "\"Maybe you're locked into payments that are relatively affordable for you,\" Krimmel said. \"You would prefer to sell, but not at a price that you're not comfortable with.\"",
      "Another factor is playing into the delisting trend, experts said \u2014 the surge in housing prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the housing market was red hot. As newly remote workers flocked to areas like Austin, Texas, home prices rose at\u00a0record levels, giving sellers a chance to cash in.",
      "While the market has since cooled substantially, sellers' pricing expectations have been slower to catch up.",
      "\"Maybe we've gotten a bit spoiled by very high home prices over the last many years, but we are seeing some softness in the market right now,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That may not be true in all markets, however. Miami is one of the places where sellers have been least willing to budge on price. According to Realtor.com's analysis, 59 homes were delisted for every 100 new homes listed in the southern Florida city \u2014 the highest ratio among the cities Realtor.com tracked. Meanwhile, less than 18% of listed homes in Miami came with a price reduction in July, according to Realtor.com.",
      "\"If sellers are choosing to take properties off the market rather than lower prices, it may signal renewed confidence in Miami's future, and a growing belief that this is a market worth holding for the long haul,\" Ana Bozovic, a Miami-based real estate agent and founder of Analytics Miami, told Realtor.com.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cracker-barrel-logo-barrel-stock-cbrl-ceo/",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Aug 2025 09:54:41 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel misread its own customer base \u2014 and our culturally sensitive times \u2014 in revamping its image, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "When Cracker Barrel unveiled its new logo last week as part of an ongoing brand refresh, it wouldn't have expected the marketing move to spark a public furor and cause the restaurant chain's value to sink by nearly $100 million.",
      "Yet the episode highlights the potential perils of tinkering with a company's branding. Following the backlash, Cracker Barrel conceded that its rebrand amounted to a misstep, saying in a statement on Monday that it \"could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\"",
      "Much of the uproar focused on the new Cracker Barrel logo doing away with the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel. The man depicts company founder Dan Evins' Uncle Herschel, whom Cracker Barrel insists will remain an integral part of its brand identity.",
      "\"Uncle Herschel will still be on our menu...on our road signs and featured in our country store. He's not going anywhere \u2014 he's family,\" Cracker Barrel said.",
      "Brands as stories",
      "Marketing experts are more blunt about Cracker Barrel's misfire.",
      "\"From a branding perspective, it's basically a flop,\" said David E. Johnson, CEO of branding agency Strategic Vision PR Group, of Cracker Barrel's logo redesign. \"What they did wrong is they went against their brand story, which was the old logo, that reflected the southern, whimsical atmosphere in the stores.\"",
      "In Johnson's view, Cracker Barrel's mistake was that it replaced a logo with genuine symbolic currency for a \"very generic looking logo that doesn't tell a story.\" Other branding experts say the hubbub is the result of a business severing its design from its roots \u2014 a cardinal sin for a company like Cracker Barrel whose folksy image is meant to evoke \"homestyle country cooking.\"",
      "More specifically, Cracker Barrel's new logo retains the rustic color palette of the original design, while removing the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel.",
      "The first Cracker Barrel restaurant was launched in Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1969 by Evins while working for his family's gasoline business. The idea was to recreate the kind of homey restaurants he'd enjoyed as a child, according to the company's\u00a0website. And until the logo redesign, the figure of\u00a0Herschel\u00a0had been central to much of the restaurant's branding and merchandise.",
      "The decision to remove both Herschel and the namesake barrel from the logo irked some Cracker Barrel loyalists because the original image represented what franchise consultant and branding expert Nick Yeonakis called a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "Still, marketing experts agree that Cracker Barrel, which operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S., was due for an image revamp. The company's growth, which soared in the 1990s, has slowed in recent years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "In 2024, concerns over its competitiveness and stagnant growth prompted the company, led by new CEO and former Taco Bell executive Julie Felss Masino, to announce changes to its restaurants, menu and pricing.",
      "The chain had become less relevant in part because it had leaned too heavily on the \"timeless nature of our concept,\" Masino said in a May 2024 conference call with Wall Street analysts. \"The goal, simply put, was to freshen things in such a way as to be noticeable and attractive but still feel like Cracker Barrel,\" she said.",
      "Today, Cracker Barrel maintains that its restaurants will retain their old-timey vibe, including using Uncle Herschel in its marketing.",
      "\"We love seeing how much you care about our 'old-timer.' We love him too,\" Cracker Barrel said Monday.",
      "Sign of the times",
      "Customer anger over Cracker Barrel's new logo also reflects the culturally and politically charged environment companies face today. For example, when Bud Light partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023, some customers called for a boycott of the beer brand, badly denting the beer brand's sales.",
      "In one social media post that typified some of the criticism of Cracker Barrel, one account called \"Woke War Room\" called for Masino to resign. \"Cracker Barrel's new logo isn't an accident \u2014 it's CEO Julie Felss Masino's project. She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding,\" the post\u00a0reads.",
      "Such critiques illustrate the fine line companies are often forced to tread, Carreen Winters, president of reputation at MikeWorldWide, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very hard to be a brand for everybody today because we are so polarized, and people look at things through a political lens even if there is no political intent,\" she said. \"When you are a legacy brand, it's really important to understand who your core is, and to not do anything to alienate them while cultivating your future or next generation customer.\"",
      "Other experts are skeptical Cracker Barrel's redesign was politically motivated.",
      "\"I really doubt the Cracker Barrel executives sat down and said, 'We'll go through this enormously expensive undertaking to change all of our signage and everything on social media in order to change something because we feel we want to be 'woke,'\" Thomas Murphy, a business professor and branding expert at Clark University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Rather, Cracker Barrel missed the mark by failing to fully take into account people's emotional investment in its brand, Winters said.",
      "\"If you are a legacy brand and you're modernizing, you have to make sure you've appropriately honored that legacy because at the end of the day, your stakeholders own your brand \u2014 you don't,\" she said. \"Not understanding the customer and the rest of stakeholders and what they care about really matters, and that seems to be what went awry here.\"",

      "Given that history, the Maryland case is likely not the first time an American has ever been diagnosed with it, said Max Scott, a North Carolina State University research who has studied it. But this appears to be the first case in a U.S. resident in quite a while, he said.",
      "The name refers to a blue-green blowfly that became somewhat infamous after infestations were reported in the 19th century at the Devil's Island penal colony off the coast of South America. Its Latin species name roughly translates to \"man eater,\" Scott said.",
      "Female flies lay eggs in an open wound or in the nose, eyes or mouth of an animal or person, which quickly grow into larvae that eat the flesh.",
      "The screwworm part of the name comes from those maggots, which can get up to two-thirds of an inch long and look like they are screwing themselves into the flesh.",
      "\"It's a nasty parasite,\" Scott said.",
      "What are the risks and symptoms for people?",
      "The larvae do not spread from person to person, and they pose a very low overall risk to the public, U.S. health officials said.",
      "Those at higher risk of suffering from the condition include people living in rural areas in places where NWS is endemic, and where livestock are raised, as well as people with open sores or wounds, and vulnerable populations, the CDC says.",
      "Symptoms can include painful, unexplained wounds or sores that do not heal. One telltale sign is seeing maggots around open sores. Another is a foul-smelling odor from the affected part of the body.",
      "How can it be prevented and treated?",
      "To prevent an NWS infestation, the CDC urges people to prevent against insect bites, especially when visiting tropical areas and being outdoors. The agency also says open wounds should be clean and covered.",
      "To treat it, doctors have to remove the larvae, sometimes through surgery.",
      "\"If you see or feel maggots (larvae) in or on a wound or other area of your body, contact your healthcare provider immediately,\" the CDC says. \"They will need to remove the larvae, sometimes through surgery. Do not try to remove or dispose of the maggots yourself.\"",
      "Are more human or animal cases expected in the U.S.?",
      "It's possible.",
      "Scientists for decades were able to control the bug by releasing billions of sterilized male flies, but lapses in the that work and the migration of people and animals helped them spread northward into Central America and Mexico more recently.",
      "There are new genetic techniques being developed to stop them, and the U.S. government is ramping up its work to control the parasites. But they remain a concern.",
      "\"I don't know if it's going to come back to the United States,\" Scott said.",
      "If it does, the Texas-Mexico border area is likely to be the first place to see it, he said.",

    "summary": "SpaceX hopes to pick up the pace with Super Heavy-Starship test flights amid concern the rocket may not be ready in time for a planned 2027 moon landing.",
    "story": [
      "For the second time in a row, SpaceX was forced to call off an attempt to launch its giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket on the program's 10th test flight, a milestone mission to demonstrate fixes and upgrades in the wake of three catastrophic failures earlier this year.",
      "A launch attempt Sunday at SpaceX's sprawling Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast was called off because of an oxygen leak in a ground system. Monday's scrub came with less than a minute to go because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad that did not move out of the area in time.",
      "The company says it will try for the third time Tuesday night. The hour-long launch window begins at 7:30 p.m. ET.",
      "Whenever it takes off, a successful flight would clear the way for a faster launch cadence as SpaceX gears up to test autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, a requirement for a NASA moon landing as early as 2027 and for eventual flights to Mars.",
      "But the company will have to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy-tankers to refuel a moon-bound Starship lander being built for NASA's Artemis program. Many observers doubt the system will be perfected in time for a 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese mount their own moon mission at the end of the decade.",
      "Speaking before the Monday launch attempt, SpaceX founder Elon Musk agreed that \"there are thousands of engineering challenges that remain for both the ship and the booster.\" He put a special emphasis on perfecting orbital refueling.",
      "\"No one has ever demonstrated [cryogenic] propellant transfer in orbit,\" he said. \"This will be propellant transfer at very large scale. But with full reusability and propellant transfer, those are the key technologies needed for building a city on Mars. And I'm confident the SpaceX team will achieve these goals.\"",
      "In the near term, SpaceX's goal is to get the Super Heavy-Starship flying again after multiple back-to-back failures.",
      "The goals of the flight are to test the Super Heavy first stage under a variety of stressful flight conditions, deliberately shutting engines down during descent to splashdown in the Gulf to make sure it can handle real failures during an actual mission.",
      "Given the nature of the tests, SpaceX ruled out a dramatic return to the launch pad for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms on the support gantry.",
      "As for the Starship, the flight plan calls for sending the upper stage halfway around the world on a suborbital trajectory to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along the way, a variety of tests are planned, including the deployment of eight Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space restart of a methane-fueled Raptor engine. Modified heat shield tiles are in place to determine their ability to withstand extreme reentry temperatures.",
      "Multiple upgrades are also in place to minimize the chances of propellant leaks, fires and engine shutdowns like those that led to the loss of the last three Starships launched, none of which were able to complete their mission.",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, is optimistic SpaceX will work the bugs out in time for the agency's planned moon landing mission.",
      "\"If you look at the company as a whole and past performance, they often times are behind, and then all of a sudden, they make these massive leaps forward,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"I would be hard-pressed to say they're not going to meet the goals and the timelines.\"",
      "\"Their leadership has said we feel very confident that we are going to be ready for the mission. And so I'll take them at their word,\" he said.",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a moon landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",
      "But as Duffy pointed out, SpaceX has chalked up a remarkable record with its partially reusable Falcon family of rockets, launching them at an unmatched pace that allows the company to rapidly implement and test upgrades and fixes.",
      "As of Friday, SpaceX has launched 518 Falcon 9s and 11 triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets with just two in-flight failures. The company has successfully recovered first-stage boosters 490 times.",
      "Given its record, many fans give SpaceX the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Super Heavy-Starship. But the giant rocket dwarfs the Falcon 9, and the requirements for a successful moon landing are well beyond those faced in a typical satellite launcher.",
      "\"My concerns have to do with how complicated the mission architecture is, how many flights there are to send a single lander to the moon,\" said Douglas Cooke, a retired 38-year NASA veteran who now does consulting work for Boeing and other aerospace concerns.",
      "\"Getting into the high numbers,\" he added, \"reduces the probability of success.\"",

    "summary": "Dauphin Island has been shrinking and is now facing a dire existential crisis. It will take millions of dollars from several grant sources to preserve what's left, but a federal program that provides funds is in limbo.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Katrina was a terrifying experience for more than a million people affected across the Gulf Coast region. Nearly 1,400 people died, most of them in New Orleans \u2014 and 20 years later, some communities are still struggling to recover.",
      "The National Hurricane Center says the costliest hurricane in U.S. history \u2014 more than $201 billion based on the 2024 Consumer Price Index adjusted cost \u2014 caused widespread flood damage across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.",
      "On Dauphin Island, Alabama, the barrier island town's west end beach was severed during Katrina. A 1.5 mile-wide gap was left behind. More than 300 homes were destroyed on the island, and for many of those homes, the land on which they stood was permanently washed away.",
      "Since Hurricane Katrina made landfall on Aug. 29, 2005, Dauphin Island has been shrinking and moving even more from additional storms and sea level rise. The island is now facing a dire existential crisis.",
      "Mayor Jeff Collier never imagined storms, big or small, would batter the island so hard. Some residents are still paying property taxes on lots that are now under Gulf waters \u2014 vacationers frequently swimming over top of them.",
      "\"This area here is where most of those underwater lots are,\" Collier said as he took a CBS News crew on a tour of Dauphin Island. \"There are probably 50 lots in this stretch of the island.\"",
      "Some residents' homes are sitting in perilous positions, their pilings now situated well into the Gulf. The homes are still technically livable \u2014 vacationers even renting them out this summer \u2014 but Collier says it's only a matter of time before another storm wipes out more.",
      "Over the last 20 years, the town has rebuilt some of its white sand beaches. Last year, on the island's east end, the town was able to use Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill settlement money on a beach erosion project to push Gulf waters back about 350 to 400 feet, according to the mayor.",
      "But on a barrier island like Dauphin, constant maintenance is critical. Jillian Fairbanks visits the island frequently and has seen the erosion first-hand over time.",
      "\"Just about a year later, I can already tell that the sand has eroded, I'd say 30 meters or so at least,\" Fairbanks said. \"It was still a shock to see that happen already in one year.\"",
      "Her parents have lived there for 13 years. She says they've advocated for beach restoration projects for years to protect the town.",
      "\"It's more calm, laid back, peaceful,\" Fairbanks said. \"I'll come here as long as it's here.\"",
      "It will take millions of dollars from several grant sources to preserve what's left, and Collier says that's the biggest challenge.",
      "Dauphin Island is planning to use more oil spill settlement money to help pay for another beach restoration project for the island's west end, which will cost $60 million. The mayor is still pursuing additional funding sources to make the project possible.",
      "He's also utilizing help from an Environmental Protection Agency grant to upgrade the town's stormwater runoff systems to help mitigate street flooding during storms, even low-grade ones. As of April, Collier says the town had already spent more than $420,000 on the $1.2 million project.",
      "Because these projects need continuous upkeep and oversight, Collier sought help from a special FEMA program. He said a grant for a $250,000 project would help the town hire an engineering and design firm to create a specialized disaster mitigation plan.",
      "The\u00a0Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant, or BRIC, includes investments in state planning and capacity building, such as $2 million in Alabama to support statewide building code implementation costs, according to Derrick Hiebert, who oversaw the program.",
      "He served as assistant administrator for the Hazard Mitigation Directorate at FEMA for the last two years.",
      "\"We selected over 1,900 projects. FEMA selected over 1,900 projects worth nearly $5 billion,\" Hiebert said. \"This included\u00a0$150 million over three grants to improve three canal basins in South Florida\u00a0that are plagued by flooding.\"",
      "He added the BRIC program was also funding a massive flooding mitigation project in Washington state.",
      "\"The North Shore Levy \u2014 $80 million in federal funding to a community that has suffered significant economic disruption in recent years,\" he said. \"It was going to protect 3,100 homes and businesses, removing them from the FEMA-designated floodplain and reducing risk in that community.\"",
      "Hiebert said it also helped some other western communities with wildfire mitigation efforts and was first established with bipartisan support.",
      "\"It was established during the first Trump administration, after the passage of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act, and it helped solve several long-standing challenges with local governments,\" Hiebert said.",
      "Against Hiebert's wishes, the Trump administration's\u00a0FEMA canceled the program in April, calling it \"wasteful and ineffective.\" In another announcement, the agency said BRIC resulted in a \"lack of concrete results.\"",
      "Hiebert said he supports any administration's ability to \"evolve and adapt\" and he doesn't see changes to FEMA as a bad thing, but he believes the cancellation of such projects is \"devastating\" to the places that need them.",
      "\"If the administration wants to change FEMA, or change the BRIC program to something different that looks a little different, that's the prerogative. That's good,\" he said. \"These communities that were expecting these funds, that were counting on these funds for these real large-scale infrastructure projects, what hurts me the most is to know that some of them, or many of them, may not get built, and that these risks ... don't have another place to turn to address these risks.\"",
      "Hiebert said he quit his position in June, two months after the program was scrapped.\u00a0A group of 20 states last month sued the Trump administration, seeking to block what they say was an illegal termination of BRIC.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, a FEMA spokesperson told CBS News that resiliency is a priority for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA. \"But over the last four years the Biden Administration used the BRIC program as a piggy bank for its green new deal agenda,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "FEMA data shows the cut impacted nearly 700 projects at a cost of $3.6 billion.\u00a0A CBS News investigation\u00a0found that the recent BRIC funding cuts have disproportionately affected counties that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election. The elimination of the BRIC program also especially deprives vulnerable communities across the Southeast, the CBS News data analysis found.",
      "Earlier this month, a federal judge temporarily blocked the BRIC funding reallocation, arguing the transfer could lead to \"irreparable harm\" to flood-prone areas. Meanwhile, Collier says he has not heard any word from the federal government about next steps.",
      "\"We're kind of in a limbo situation right now waiting to see what comes out of that,\" Collier said.",
      "CBS News reached out to FEMA for a comment, but has not received a response.",
      "Collier said if it comes down to it, he will pursue paying for the hazard mitigation plan out of pocket.",
      "\"Of course, it's nicer when you have grant funds to work with, but at the same time, this is such a critically important thing that we need. ... If we can't get the funding elsewhere, you know, we just have to just deal with it ourselves,\" Collier said. \"So, one way or the other, we're going to get our plan in place.\"",
      "Time is something Dauphin Island cannot afford. Even without a major hurricane, the beach is expected to continue washing away.",
      "Asked what keeps him up at night, Collier said, \"just the fact that we know additional hurricanes will eventually hit this area ... knowing that there's a clock ticking, that we only have a certain length of time in order to make differences and changes on the island before the next one hits.\"",

      "Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was mistakenly deported to his home country in March and held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months before being returned to the U.S. in June where he was jailed on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was freed from pretrial detention last Friday. CBS News reported on Saturday that his attorneys were then sent a court-required notice of his potential\u00a0deportation to Uganda. He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.",
      "\"There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshals Service and basically on house arrest,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.\"",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg filed a new lawsuit on Abrego Garcia's behalf on Monday challenging his confinement and deportation to any country \"unless and until he had a fair trial in an immigration court.\"",
      "The U.S. district court in Maryland soon issued an order preventing the government from immediately removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S. or altering his legal status, meaning his deportation is on hold for now. The court has issued the standing order in all cases involving migrant detainees challenging the legality of their detentions in recent months, a move the Justice Department is challenging as unlawful.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis, who is assigned to the case, held a hearing on Abrego Garcia's new suit on Monday. She issued an oral order preventing the Trump administration from moving Abrego Garcia from the ICE facility in Virginia where he is now being held.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0in a statement that ICE had arrested Abrego Garcia and was \"processing him for deportation.\" DHS said he is \"being processed for removal to Uganda.\" The U.S. reached an agreement with Uganda to accept some deportees last week.",
      "\"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,\" Noem said.",
      "In a legal filing over the weekend, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica. His legal team said they then received a notice of his possible deportation to Uganda. Sandoval-Moshenberg clarified Monday that Abrego Garcia had stated that he was willing to accept refugee status in Costa Rica.",
      "\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday.",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement that he was glad to \"welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.\"",
      "\"The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda \u2014 to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,\" Van Hollen said. \"As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.\"",
      "An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia may not be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore advocated for due process for Abrego Garcia on Sunday, saying on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that \"I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case.\"",

      "Elon Musk on Monday targeted Apple and OpenAI in an antitrust lawsuit alleging that the iPhone maker and the ChatGPT maker are teaming up to thwart competition in artificial intelligence.",
      "The 61-page complaint filed in Texas federal court follows through on a threat that Musk made two weeks ago when he accused Apple of unfairly favoring OpenAI and ChatGPT in the iPhone's app store rankings for top AI apps.",
      "Musk's post insinuated that Apple had rigged the system against ChatGPT competitors such as the Grok chatbot made by his own xAI. Now, he is detailing a litany of grievances in the lawsuit \u2014 filed by xAI and another of his corporate entities, X Corp. \u2014 in an attempt to win monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the alleged illegal tactics.",
      "The double-barreled legal attack weaves together several recently unfolding narratives to recast a year-old partnership between Apple and OpenAI as a veiled conspiracy to stifle competition during a technological shift that could prove as revolutionary as the 2007 release of the iPhone.",
      "\"This is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,\" the lawsuit asserts.",
      "The complaint portrays Apple as a company that views AI as an \"existential threat\" to its future success, prompting it to collude with OpenAI in an attempt to protect the iPhone franchise that has long been its biggest moneymaker.",
      "Some of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything \"super apps,\" such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "The complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.",
      "OpenAI has countered with a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of harassment \u2014 an allegation that the company cited in its response to Monday's antitrust lawsuit. \"This latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk's ongoing pattern of harassment,\" OpenAI said in a statement.",
      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The crux of the lawsuit revolves around Apple's decision to use ChatGPT as an AI-powered \"answer engine\" on the iPhone when the built-in technology on its device couldn't satisfy user needs. The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",
      "The lawsuit doesn't mention the potential threat that ChatGPT could also pose to Apple and the iPhone's future popularity. As part of its expansion efforts, OpenAI recruited former Apple designer Jony Ive to oversee a project aimed at building an AI-powered device that many analysts believe could eventually mount a challenge to the iPhone.",

      "The Seattle coffee chain officially unveiled its new fall menu on Monday, which includes its Pumpkin Spice Latte and other autumn-inspired treats.",
      "The arrival date for Starbucks' fall menu has inched earlier over the years, now landing in August instead of mid-September, closer to the actual start of autumn. At the center of the coffee giant's fall offerings is its Pumpkin Spice Latte, which came onto the scene over 20 years ago. According to a company spokesperson, the PSL, which consists of espresso, steamed milk cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin, whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice, is the most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Starbucks has sold hundreds of millions of the autumnal concoction since the beverage was introduced in 2003.",
      "\"Obviously, I'm excited for the fall program,\" Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said during the coffee chain's July 29 earnings call. \"I, like many customers, love the Pumpkin Spice Latte.\"",
      "The coffee giant is also banking on sales from newcomers like Pecan Cold Foam, after\u00a0launching\u00a0a similar menu item last year. Cold Foam has become one of Starbucks' most popular add-ons with a 23% year-over-year growth, according to a company spokesperson. In June, the company announced it was piloting a\u00a0new banana-flavored protein variety.",
      "The fall menu, which includes a blend of old and new items, is likely to provide a boost to the coffee chain which has been suffering from weakening sales and in-store traffic.

    "story": [
      "Banda Aceh, Indonesia\u00a0\u2014 Two men in Indonesia's conservative Aceh province were among a group of people publicly caned on Tuesday after an Islamic Shariah court convicted them of violating Islamic law by hugging and kissing, which the court ruled can lead to banned sexual relations.",
      "An audience of about 100 people witnessed the caning on a stage in Bustanussalatin city park in Banda Aceh on Tuesday. The men, aged 20 and 21, were whipped across their backs with a rattan cane dozens of times by a group of people wearing robes and hoods.",
      "Aceh allows up to 100 lashes for morality offenses including gay sex and sex between unmarried people. Caning is also a punishment in Aceh for gambling, drinking alcohol, women who wear tight clothes and men who do not attend Friday prayers.",
      "The court in Aceh sentenced the men to 80 strikes each after Islamic religious police said they caught them engaged in what the court deemed were the sexual acts of hugging and kissing in a bathroom of a public park, court records said.",
      "Eight other people were publicly caned Tuesday for adultery and gambling.",
      "The men were arrested in April at Taman Sari city park in Banda Aceh after residents told a police patrol they saw the men enter the same park bathroom. The police found the men inside kissing and hugging. Prior to meeting in the park, the pair made contact through an online dating app, court records said.",
      "Aceh is the only province in Indonesia to practice Shariah law. There have been four previous canings for cases related to homosexuality since the province implemented Islamic law and established a religious police and court system in 2006. The change was a concession by the national government to end a long-running separatist uprising.",
      "Indonesia's national criminal code does not regulate homosexuality but the central government cannot strike down Shariah law in Aceh. However, the central government previously pressured Aceh officials to drop an earlier version of a law calling for people to be stoned to death for adultery.",
      "Aceh expanded its Islamic bylaws and criminal code in 2015, extending Shariah law to non-Muslims, who account for about 1% of the province's population. The verdict against the two men caned on Tuesday was the fifth handed down against people for homosexuality since the law was implemented in 2015.",
      "Two other men were publicly caned in February at the same Aceh park after a Shariah court convicted them of having sex.",
      "A coalition of human rights groups filed a petition to Indonesia's Supreme Court in 2016 seeking a review of Aceh's regional regulations allowing caning, but the request was rejected. Indonesia's Ministry of Home Affairs issued a letter in 2016 to Aceh's governor about caning, noting regional laws in Indonesia should be enforced for minor crimes.",
      "Canning is a corporal punishment and Indonesia has ratified a convention mandating the abolition of inhumane punishments, said Maidina Rahmawati, acting executive director of the Institute for Criminal Justice Reform in Indonesia.",
      "\"That public caning, even the act of caning itself, is contrary to various laws and regulations and also contrary to human rights interests in Indonesia because its exposure is not good for Indonesia,\" Rahmawati said.",
      "Shifting political dynamics played a role in the implementation of the policy, Rahmawati said.",
      "\"Because it seemed like this was the right thing to do, it had to be done, it had to be narrated to support the Sharia-based government in Aceh,\" Rahmawati said.",
      "Amnesty International issued a statement Tuesday calling the caning of the two men \"a disturbing act of state-sanctioned discrimination and cruelty.\"",
      "\"This punishment is a horrifying reminder of the institutionalized stigma and abuse faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in Aceh. Intimate relationships between consenting adults should never be criminalized,\" Amnesty's Regional Research Director Montse Ferrer said in the statement.",
      "Aulia Saputra, a Banda Aceh resident who attended the caning, said the punishment may prevent other violations of Shariah law.",
      "\"I hope that with the implementation of this caning punishment, it can serve as a lesson for the offender and also create a deterrent effect, so that such incidents do not happen again in the future,\" Saputra said.",

      "This summer, divers descended about 26 feet below the waves close to Aarhus, Denmark's second-biggest city, and collected evidence of a Stone Age settlement from the seabed.",
      "It's part of a $15.5 million six-year international project to map parts of the seabed in the Baltic and North Seas, funded by the European Union, that includes researchers in Aarhus as well as from the U.K.'s University of Bradford and the Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research in Germany.",
      "The goal is to explore sunken Northern European landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic settlements as offshore wind farms and other sea infrastructure expand.",
      "Most evidence of such settlements so far has been found at locations inland from the Stone Age coast, said underwater archaeologist Peter Moe Astrup, who's leading underwater excavations in Denmark.",
      "\"Here, we actually have an old coastline. We have a settlement that was positioned directly at the coastline,\" he said. \"What we actually try to find out here is how was life at a coastal settlement.\"",
      "After the last ice age, huge ice sheets melted and global sea levels rose, submerging Stone Age settlements and forcing the hunter-gatherer human population inland.",
      "About 8,500 years ago, sea levels rose by about 6.5 feet per century, Moe Astrup said.",
      "Moe Astrup and colleagues at the Moesgaard Museum in H\u00f8jbjerg, just outside Aarhus, have excavated an area of about 430 square feet at the small settlement they discovered just off today's coast.",
      "Early dives uncovered animal bones, stones tools, arrowheads, a seal tooth, and a small piece of worked wood, likely a simple tool. The researchers are combing the site meter by meter using a kind of underwater vacuum cleaner to collect material for future analysis.",
      "They hope further excavations will find harpoons, fishhooks or traces of fishing structures.",
      "\"It's like a time capsule,\" Moe Astrup said. \"When sea level rose, everything was preserved in an oxygen-free environment \u2026 time just stops.\"",
      "\"We find completely well-preserved wood,\" he added. \"We find hazelnut. ... Everything is well preserved.\"",
      "Excavations in the relatively calm and shallow Bay of Aarhus and dives off the coast of Germany will be followed by later work at two locations in the more inhospitable North Sea.",
      "The sea level rise thousands of years ago submerged, among other things, a vast area known as Doggerland that connected Britain with continental Europe and now lies underneath the southern North Sea.",
      "To build a picture of the rapid rise of the waters, Danish researchers are using dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.",

      "\"We can say very precisely when these trees died at the coastlines,\" Moesgaard Museum dendrochronologist Jonas Ogdal Jensen said as he peered at a section of Stone Age tree trunk through a microscope.",
      "\"That tells us something about how the sea level changed through time.\"",
      "As today's world faces rising sea levels driven by climate change, the researchers hope to shed light on how Stone Age societies adapted to shifting coastlines more than eight millennia ago.",
      "\"It's hard to answer exactly what it meant to people,\" Moe Astrup said. \"But it clearly had a huge impact in the long run because it completely changed the landscape.\"",
      "Sea levels rose by a global average of around 1.7 inches in the decade up to 2023.",
      "Denmark has seen several significant archaeological discoveries in recent years, including a metal detectorist's stunning find early last year of gold ring set with a red semi-precious stone that researchers hoped would shed light on the country's history during the early middle ages.",
      "Officials at the National Museum of Denmark announced that find after the centuries-old ring, believed to have been owned by a member of the royal family some 1,400 years ago, was transferred from a different museum nearer to the discovery site in the south, near the German border.",

    "summary": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says Iran directed two antisemitic attacks in the country, and diplomatic relations will now end.",
    "story": [
      "Melbourne, Australia\u00a0\u2014 Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese accused Iran of organizing two antisemitic attacks in Australia and said the country was cutting off diplomatic relations with Tehran in response on Tuesday.",
      "The Australian Security Intelligence Organization concluded the Iranian government had directed arson attacks on the Lewis Continental Kitchen, a kosher food company, in Sydney in October last year and on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne in December last year, Albanese said.",
      "Iran's government denied the allegations.",
      "There has been a steep rise in antisemitic incidents in Sydney and Melbourne since the Israel-Hamas war began in 2023.",
      "Australian authorities have previously said they suspect that foreign actors are paying local criminals-for-hire to carry out attacks in the country.",
      "Police have already arrested at least one suspect in the Sydney cafe fire investigation and two suspects directly accused of torching the Melbourne synagogue.",
      "Sayed Mohammed Moosawi, a 32-year-old Sydney-based former chapter president of the Nomads biker gang, has been charged with directing the fire bombings of the Sydney caf\u00e9 as well as the nearby Curly Lewis Brewery. The brewery was apparently confused for the caf\u00e9 and mistakenly targeted three days earlier for an antisemitic attack.",
      "Giovanna Laulu, a 21-year-old man from Melbourne, was charged last month with being one of three masked arsonists who caused extensive damage to the synagogue in December.",
      "A second alleged arsonist, a 20-year-old man also from Melbourne, is expected to appear in court Wednesday, a police statement said. He has not been publicly named.",
      "\"ASIO has now gathered enough credible intelligence to reach a deeply disturbing conclusion,\" Albanese told reporters. \"The Iranian government directed at least two of these attacks. Iran has sought to disguise its involvement but ASIO assesses it was behind the attacks.",
      "\"These were extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil,\" he said. \"They were attempts to undermine social cohesion and sow discord in our community. It is totally unacceptable.\"",
      "Shortly before the announcement, the Australian government told Iran's Ambassador to Australia Ahmad Sadeghi that he will be expelled. It also withdrew Australian diplomats posted in Iran to a third country, Albanese said.",
      "An alert to Australians in Iran noted the embassy's closure and urged them to \"strongly consider leaving as soon as possible, if it is safe to do so.\"",
      "\"Foreigners in Iran, including Australians and dual Australian-Iranian nationals, are at a high risk of arbitrary detention or arrest,\" the warning read.",
      "Australia updated its warning to travelers to its highest level: \"Do not travel\" to Iran.",
      "Iran has a long history of detaining Westerners or those with ties abroad to use as bargaining chips in negotiations.",
      "Foreign Minister Penny Wong said that Canberra would keep some diplomatic lines open to Tehran to advance Australia's interests. She added that it was the first time Australia has expelled an ambassador since World War II.",
      "Albanese said that Australia will legislate to list Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization.",
      "Australia's law makes providing support to a listed terrorist organization a crime. The government has previously rejected calls to list the Revolutionary Guard under existing terrorism laws because it is a government entity.",
      "Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has been accused of carrying out attacks abroad over the decades of its existence, though it broadly denies any involvement. The Guard's Quds, or Jerusalem, Force is its expeditionary arm and is accused by Western nations of using local militants and criminals in the past to target dissidents and Israelis abroad.",
      "The U.S., during the first Trump administration in 2019, formally designated the Guard a foreign terrorist organization, accusing it not only facilitating, but perpetrating terrorism.",
      "A spokesperson for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry welcomed the terrorist designation for the Revolutionary Guard, adding in a statement that the group was \"outraged\" that a foreign actor was behind the crimes.",
      "\"Foremost, these were attacks that deliberately targeted Jewish Australians, destroyed a sacred house of worship, caused millions of dollars of damage, and terrified our community,\" the statement said.",
      "Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Israel has arrested several people on charges they had been paid or encouraged by Iran to carry out vandalism and monitor potential targets there.",
      "Iran denied Australia's allegations through its Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei, who tried to link it to the challenges Australia faced with Israel after announcing it would recognize a Palestinian state.",
      "\"It looks like the action, which is against Iran, diplomacy and the relations between the two nations, is a compensation for the criticism that the Australians had against the Zionist regime,\" Baghaei claimed.",
      "The move against Iran came a week after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu branded Albanese a \"weak politician who had betrayed Israel\" by recognizing a Palestinian state.",
      "Netanyahu's extraordinary public rebuke on social media came after an Aug. 11 announcement by Albanese that his government's recognition of a Palestinian state will be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September. That announcement was followed by tit-for-tat cancellations of visas for Australian and Israeli officials.",
      "Albanese previously resisted calls to expel Iran's envoy to Canberra before, analysts said, including in 2024 when Sadeghi was summoned for meetings with foreign ministry officials over his social media posts.",
      "Michael Shoebridge, a former Australian defense and security official and director of the think tank Strategic Analysis Australia, said he didn't believe the move was prompted by Israel's complaints.",
      "\"I don't think that's a matter of Australia-Israel relations, but a matter of community cohesion here in Australia,\" he said.",
      "Neither ASIO director-general Mike Burgess nor Albanese explained what evidence there was of Iranian involvement.",
      "Burgess said no Iranian diplomats in Australia were involved.",
      "\"This was directed by the IRGC through a series of overseas cut-out facilitators to coordinators that found their way to tasking Australians,\" Burgess said.",
      "While antisemitic incidents increased in Australian after the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 2023, Iran was responsible for a transition in October last year when the violence more directly targeted people, businesses and places of worship, Burgess said.",
      "\"Iran started the first of those,\" Burgess said.",

    "story": [
      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival over the weekend, calling his participation in the event \"a disgrace and an insult\" to the victims of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced Ukraine's cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media stories quoted Allen as saying he's always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine's Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said it \"strongly condemns\" Allen's participation in the festival, which \"brings together supporters and mouthpieces of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\"",
      "The ministry called it \"a disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\" adding that Allen \"is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchanges to continue.",
      "\"When it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\" Allen said. \"But, whatever politicians have done, I don't feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\"",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos.",
      "Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Kusturica has been open about his support of Putin, including after the invasion. He received an award from Putin and attended a military parade in Moscow earlier this year.",
      "Allen has long had an affinity for Russian literature and history. His 1975 comedy \"Love and Death\" spoofs the fiction of Tolstoy and other 19th century Russian novelists. The title of his 1989 release \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" echoes Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" and also broods over the themes of wrongdoing, justice and guilt.",
      "In the 1972 essay, \"A Brief Guide to Civil Disobedience,\" Allen jokes about the Russian Revolution, writing that the serfs rebelled when they \"finally realized that the Czar and the Tsar were the same person.\"",

      "Shanghai \u2014 A Chinese woman trapped in a locked room for 30 hours was finally rescued after she flung a pillow bearing a message written in her own blood out of a window, according to a local government statement.",
      "The woman, only identified by her surname Zhou, was cleaning a guesthouse in western China's Sichuan province when she entered a bedroom without her phone, according to an article published by a local government social media account earlier this month.",
      "What followed was one and a half days of desperation, after Zhou realised that the door could not be opened from the inside due to a malfunctioning lock.",
      "She had no access to food and there was no toilet in the room, which was on the sixth floor of the building.",
      "\"After many failed attempts to save herself, and out of desperation, she bit her finger and used the blood to write '110 625' on a pillow which she then threw out the window,\" the social media account owned by the local government in Sichuan's Leshan city said.",
      "The number of the room the woman was trapped in was 625, and 110 is the emergency services phone number in China.",
      "Zhou's message was spotted by food delivery driver Zhang Kun, who immediately called the police.",

    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 \u00a0Israel struck one of the main hospitals in the Gaza Strip with a missile Monday and then fired another as journalists and rescue workers rushed to the scene, killing at least 20 people and wounding scores more, local health workers in Hamas-run\u00a0Gaza\u00a0said. At least five journalists were among those killed, health officials and their employers said.",
      "It was among the deadliest of several Israeli strikes that have hit both hospitals and journalists over the course of the 22-month war sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack, and the attack came as Israel plans to widen its offensive to heavily populated areas.",
      "The first strike hit a top floor of a building at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. Minutes later, as journalists and rescuers in orange vests rushed up an external staircase, a second missile hit, said Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, head of Nasser's pediatrics department.",
      "Nasser Hospital, the largest in southern Gaza, has withstood raids and bombardment throughout 22 months of war, with officials citing critical shortages of supplies and staff.",
      "Asked about the strike and journalists being among the victims, the Israel Defense Forces issued a statement saying it had carried out an attack and adding that it would \"conduct an initial inquiry as soon as possible,\" adding that it regretted \"any harm to uninvolved individuals and does not target journalists as such.\"",
      "In a statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel \"deeply regrets the tragic mishap\" that occurred at the hospital in Gaza.",
      "\"Israel values the work of journalists, medical staff, and all civilians,\" the statement said. \"The military authorities are conducting a thorough investigation. Our war is with Hamas terrorists. Our just goals are defeating Hamas and bringing our hostages home.\"",
      "A hospital official initially told CBS News that four journalists were killed in the Monday morning double-tap strike at the hospital. The official identified the four as Hossam al-Masri, who worked for the Reuters news agency, Mohammed Salama, who worked for Al Jazeera, and freelance journalists Maryam Abu Daqqa  and Moaz Abu Taha.",
      "The Associated Press' news director for the Middle East, Jon Gambrell, said in a social media post that Abu Daqqa had \"freelanced for the AP since the Gaza war began.\"",
      "Reuters confirmed that al-Masri had worked for the international news agency. It said photographer Hatem Khaled, who also worked as a contractor for the agency, was wounded.",
      "Middle East Eye, a U.K.-based media outlet, later said one of its freelancers, Ahmad Abu Aziz, was also killed.",
      "At least one other journalist was wounded in the strike, a hospital official said, identifying the man as Haithem Omar, who also works for Reuters.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Monday that he was not aware of the strike on the hospital and he was not happy about it when he learned the news.",
      "\"When did this happen?\" Mr. Trump asked a reporter in the White House. \"I didn't know that. Well, I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it. At the same time, we have to end that whole nightmare.\"",
      "Israel has come under mounting pressure over the number of journalists being killed in its military operations in Gaza \u2014 including in targeted strikes against individuals whom Israeli officials claim were Hamas operatives.",
      "Israeli strikes and raids on hospitals are not uncommon. Multiple hospitals have been struck or raided across the Gaza Strip, with Israel claiming its attacks had targeted militants operating inside the medical facilities, without providing evidence.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, the Foreign Press Association, which represents journalists working in Israel and the Palestinian territories, said it was \"outraged and in shock\" over the latest killings of media workers.",
      "\"This is among the deadliest Israeli attacks on journalists working for international media since the Gaza war began,\" the organization said, confirming the identities of the four people killed. \"These strikes hit the exterior staircase of the hospital where journalists frequently stationed themselves with their cameras. The strikes came with no warning.\"",
      "The organization demanded an immediate explanation from the IDF and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office for the strike, adding: \"This has gone on far too long. Too many journalists in Gaza have been killed by Israel without justification. Israel continues to block international journalists from independent access to Gaza. This must be a watershed moment. We appeal to international leaders: do everything you can to protect our colleagues. We cannot do it ourselves.\"",
      "The international Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned the Israeli strike. In a statement, the group called on the international community \"to hold Israel accountable for its continued unlawful attacks on the press.\"",
      "\"Israel's broadcasted killing of journalists in #Gaza continues while the world watches and fails to act firmly on the most horrific attacks the press has ever faced in recent history,\" CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah said in the group's post. \"These murders must end now. The perpetrators must no longer be allowed to act with impunity.\"",
      "On August 11, Israel's military targeted and killed five Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza, including correspondent Anas al-Sharif. The Israel Defense Forces said it had intelligence and documents from Gaza to prove al-Sharif was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, and the IDF shared\u00a0undated\u00a0photos\u00a0of Al-Sharif with Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, who was\u00a0killed last October.",
      "CBS News could not verify the authenticity of the photos. Al Jazeera and al-Sharif had\u00a0previously dismissed\u00a0Israel's claims as baseless, The Associated Press reported. Just three weeks ago, al-Sharif had appealed to the Committee to Protect Journalists over fears he might be assassinated.",
      "A June strike on Nasser Hospital killed three people and wounded 10, according to the health ministry. At the time, Israel's military said it had targeted Hamas militants operating from a command and control center inside the hospital.",
      "The Hamas-run health ministry said Sunday that at least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and saw 251 others taken as hostages.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish in its figures between fighters and civilians, but it says around half of those killed have been women and children. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable information available on war casualties, as such figures are difficult to independently verify, as Israel does not permit foreign journalists into Gaza.",

    "summary": "The first commercial carbon storage facility has been inaugurated off Norway's coast, but is storing CO2 deep under the seabed really the answer?",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Good morning, or, afternoon here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, exactly. You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed, the Pentagon did not explain why. In addition, the Navy Reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed. Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings, and they come on the heels of firings earlier this year, of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of Naval Operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things, one of the strengths of America's military, are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks, who have the training, the expertise, to be able to do the jobs. And what we don't want is political people in those jobs, who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze, and we're going to try to get that back up, if we can. The Senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan. So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan. We- we lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator. Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday, this internationally recognized body, backed by the UN, the IPC. It tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a man-made famine underway in Gaza. This is a very rare designation, only four other times has one been designated. The country you are in, Jordan, called it a \"shameful failure of humanity\" that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think is- it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen. One of the- we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is an- it funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration. They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable. Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he's doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli Prime Minister's Office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it, quote, \"a modern blood libel, spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\" That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor, and the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it. But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death, because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that, they're getting ready to do another- or, they've already started, planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people. So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in, to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I understand your criticism right now. I want to ask you a little bit though about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former deputy national security adviser for President Biden Joe- Jon Finer, just wrote a piece in the Atlantic, and he said that while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes \"we did far too little, far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\" Do you agree with him, and do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position. With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in. I think it's something that, I hope, that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",

      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think everybody--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: --should have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense. When it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck, and they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck, when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border.

      "\"I think it was very easy for Epstein to prey on Andrew because he knew he had these weaknesses,\" Lownie explained. \"One was his greed and the need to pay off Fergie\u2019s debts. And the other was that he had this sexual addiction, rather like Epstein. Epstein needed constant sexual gratification, and Andrew was the same. He was not ruled, shall we say, by his head in a lot of these things.\"",

      "Alexa, who just released her new single, explained that Billy is fully committed to his health and described how he has made some major lifestyle changes.",

      "\"He's doing his physical therapy three to five days a week, which is really, really important for him right now,\" she said. \"He's adjusted his diet. We had dinner the other night. I said, 'Dad, what are you doing? You're not getting the steak? You're getting chicken instead?' Like, this is a whole new you here.\"",
      "\"He's suddenly eating eggplant and all sorts of vegetables. I said, 'Dad, you used to hate eggplant. He's like, 'Oh, I've learned to love it,'\" Alexa continued with a laugh.",
      "\"So I'm really proud of him and how he sort of adjusted his habits, and he's really at probably his most healthy actually right now in terms of how well he's taking care of himself and prioritizing his health,\" she added. \"Of course, as his eldest daughter, I'm always looking out for him and making sure he stays on the ball with that. So he's doing great.\"",
      "When Billy first revealed his NPH diagnosis, the five-time Grammy Award winner said that the condition had been \"exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance.\"",
      "The statement at the time continued, \"Under his doctor\u2019s instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period.

      "Common symptoms of NPH include difficulty walking, urinary incontinence and problems with concentration and memory.",
      "However, Alexa told Fox News Digital that she had not noticed any change in Billy's cognitive abilities.",

      "\"I was doing a segment for SiriusXM for his channel, the Billy Joel channel on Sirius a couple of weeks ago,\" she said. \"I do a playlist of his songs. I do analysis on it with the backstories. So I interview him. I go straight to the source, my dad, and I ask him about all the material. And I was asking him, single by single, I said, \u2018Well, which album is this from? What year?\u2019\"",
      "\"He remembers every album, the exact year, the order in which the singles were ordered on the album,\" she added. \"So, as far as I'm concerned, he's sharp as a tack.

      "Alexa recently released her new single \"Riverside Way.\" (Alexa Ray Joel)",
      "\"It is personal to me because it was my way of saying to the world and saying, as an artist, I'm not just one person,\" she said. \"I think there is a sort of societal penchant and interest in putting women in a box and pinpointing them as, 'OK, she's that type.'\"",
      "Alexa continued, \"She's good or she is bad or she's sugar or she's spice or she's sweet or she's a bitch. We have this interest in pigeonholing women a lot of times. Or even people do it [and] they don't even realize, right? You just form quick judgments based on a picture or based on an interview clip, now with sound bites on social media. It's so easy to form judgments too quickly, I feel.\"",
      "\"And so \u2018Riverside Way\u2019 is personal for me because it's my way of saying, 'Hey, you know, just like most women and particularly artists, there's not just one side to us,'\" she added. \"There is the side of me that's very much the good daughter and loves to perhaps be a little more demure. But then there's another side that's...a bit wilder and more curious and more interested in exploring things. And I think with \u2018Riverside Way,\u2019 I wanted to show, it's OK to get outside your comfort zone and take risks, both with storytelling, narrative wise and stylistically with this song.\"",
      "\"I wanted this image of a girl that's just having a fantasy with a guy and, you know, speeding down the highway in a truck at 200 miles per hour, and they're not even sure where they're going or where they'll end up because they're so immersed in the moment. And so I wanted that escapism to be very vivid. And I am an escapist at heart. I love painting a very vivid picture in my mind. That I can just sort of climb into and crawl into. I get a real thrill from that as an artist.\"",

      "\"It was very emotional for me looking back, going, \u2018Wow, they look so carefree,\u2019\" she added. \"It's just so beautiful to see that. And I think they really opened each other up in that way. You know mom being the California girl who was just so full of life and so vivacious and so full of joy and radiance.\"",
      "\"And my dad was more like the Long Island hooligan, as he calls himself, but you know a genius with a chip on his shoulder,\" Alexa said with a laugh. \"So they kind of complimented each other in that way and their differences. And yet they had a lot in common that they both loved music and creativity and singing and dancing and putting on a show.\"",
      "\"They're both natural entertainers who are just perfect for showbiz in many ways. I know my dad acts like he's not, but he really is, at the end of the day, a genius at what he does. And they were able to find that connection, and then I was able to share that with them.\"",

Starsage cross-referenced their reports with its simulated sensor feed and the day\u2019s Air Tasking Order, then announced that the minimum force package had been met, signaling that the required number of aircraft were airborne and ready.

      "After Congress and Trump revoked three waivers the Biden administration granted California, which allowed the state to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than those at the federal level, Newsom immediately sued and issued an executive order directing state agencies to continue pushing the heightened standards. California's attempt to circumvent Congress could impact other states, since provisions of the federal Clean Air Act allow them to adopt California's tougher emissions regulations as opposed to the federal baseline.",
      "Meanwhile, a few weeks after Newsom's executive order, the Trump administration announced it would sue California in an effort to prevent them from trudging forward with the \"unlawful\" emissions standards. Now Texas is joining that fight with the help of pro-Trump legal group America First Legal (AFL).",

Subsequently, AFL notes, the strict regulations would then impact car manufacturers because they would \"dictate the requirements for all cars sold throughout the United States\" since manufacturers typically do not produce different vehicle lineups for different states.",

The screen is 50% brighter, the bezels are smaller, and everything feels more fluid thanks to new animations and stronger haptics. Simply put, it looks better and feels more responsive on your wrist.",

Plus, the new Quick Charge Dock takes you from 0 to 50% in just 15 minutes, making it easier to power up before you head out.",

It's designed for those busy, in-between moments, when your hands are full but you still need help.",
      "The Pixel Watch 4 is available for\u00a0preorder now.

      "The Pixelsnap Charger comes as a simple puck or bundled with a sleek stand. It charges the Pixel 10 Pro XL at up to 25W and other Qi2-certified devices at 15W. The stand looks elegant on a desk or nightstand, and the puck detaches for charging on the go. If you own a Pixel 10 Pro Fold, the stand even supports charging while unfolded, letting you stream, video call, or display widgets on the big screen as your phone powers up.",
      "Need hands-free viewing? The Pixelsnap Ring Stand snaps onto the back of your phone for propping it up. It rotates smoothly thanks to a microfiber liner, making it easy to find the perfect angle for movies or video calls. Slim enough to slip into a pocket or purse, it adds function without adding bulk.",
      "Google designed its new Pixel 10 cases to be Pixelsnap-ready. That means you can attach chargers or accessories without ever removing the case. Available in colors like Moonstone, Jade, Obsidian, Porcelain, Indigo, Frost, and Lemongrass, they not only protect your phone but also match the refreshed Pixel 10 design.",
      "If you prefer wired charging, Google also introduced the Pixel Flex Dual Port 67W charger. It's the fastest dual-port charger yet for Pixel phones.

      "The new Magic Cue acts like a personal assistant inside your phone. It proactively pulls information you need at just the right time. For example, if you're on the phone with an airline, it can instantly display your flight details from Gmail. When you're in a group chat, it can surface photos or addresses without making you dig. And because all of this happens on-device, your personal data stays private.",
      "Pixel cameras are known for their quality, but Camera Coach takes it further. Using Gemini AI, it gives real-time tips to improve your photos. It might suggest a different angle, a tighter frame, or a better composition. For beginners, it's a helpful teacher. For experienced photographers, it's like having a second set of creative eyes right in your pocket.",
      "Features like Best Take automatically select the sharpest face from a series of photos, making group shots easier than ever. Meanwhile, Pro Res Zoom, exclusive to Pixel 10 Pro models, uses a generative AI imaging model to deliver astonishing detail up to 100x zoom. It's not just cropping in, it's rebuilding and refining the image to look crisp.",
      "Beyond photography, Google packed the Pixel 10 with over 20 generative AI tools that work directly on the device. They help with editing, writing, and even composing replies in your favorite apps. The goal is simple: make the phone feel less like a tool and more like a helpful companion that adapts to your needs.",

    "summary": "Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS shows an unexpected frontal glow that Harvard&apos;s Avi Loeb says cannot be explained by sunlight reflection or standard cometary outgassing.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on President Donald Trump's goal to put a nuclear reactor on the moon on 'Special Report.'",
      "A Harvard physicist who sounded the alarm earlier this month about a rare interstellar object passing through our solar system \u2014 suggesting it might be more than a comet \u2014 now says it could even be a nuclear-powered spaceship.",
      "The object, 3I/ATLAS, was first detected in early July by an Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. It marks only the third time an interstellar object has been observed entering our solar system, according to NASA.",
      "While NASA classified the object as a comet, Dr. Avi Loeb pointed out that an image showed an unexpected glow in front of the object rather than trailing behind it, something he called \"quite surprising.\"",
      "In a blog post this week, Loeb wrote that the object\u2019s brightness profile cannot be explained by sunlight reflection or standard cometary outgassing.",
      "METEORITE FRAGMENT THAT SLAMMED THROUGH HOMEOWNER'S ROOF IS BILLIONS OF YEARS OLD, PREDATES EARTH: PROFESSOR",
      "Astronomers discovered an unusual object entering our solar system earlier this month. (NASA, ESA, David Jewitt (UCLA); Image Processing: Joseph DePasquale (STScI))",
      "Instead, he suggested, 3I/ATLAS might be generating its own light, possibly from nuclear energy.",
      "\"Alternatively, 3I/ATLAS could be a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy, and the dust emitted from its frontal surface might be from dirt that accumulated on its surface during its interstellar travel,\" Loeb wrote. \"This cannot be ruled out, but requires better evidence to be viable.\"",
      "Loeb dismissed other natural power sources. A primordial black hole, he said, would generate only about 20 nanowatts \u2014 far too weak. A radioactive fragment from a supernova was highly unlikely given its rarity, and frictional heating from interstellar gas and dust was ruled out by momentum and density constraints.",
      "RARE JUPITER-SIZED PLANET DISCOVERED 3,200 LIGHT-YEARS AWAY USING EINSTEIN'S SPACE-TIME WARPING METHOD",
      "A Harvard physicist is sounding alarms that the object could be an alien probe. (Avi Loeb)",
      "That leaves the simplest explanation \u2014 a central, compact, high-power source. The most natural way to achieve the gigawatt-level luminosity observed, Loeb noted, would be nuclear power.",
      "Still, Loeb does not claim the object is nuclear-powered. He stresses there is only one possible interpretation if natural models fail, and proving it would require more evidence.",
      "3I/ATLAS is estimated to be about 20 kilometers across, larger than Manhattan.",
      "Loeb has also raised questions about its unusual trajectory.",
      "\"If you imagine objects entering the solar system from random directions, just one in 500 of them would be aligned so well with the orbits of the planets,\" Loeb told Fox News Digital earlier this month.",
      "SCIENTISTS DISCOVER ANCIENT RADIO SIGNALS FROM DISTANT GALAXY CLUSTER",
      "The interstellar object, which comes from the center of the Milky Way, is also expected to pass near Mars, Venus and Jupiter. (Atlas/University of Hawaii/NASA)",
      "The interstellar object, which comes from the center of the Milky Way, is also expected to pass near Mars, Venus and Jupiter, another improbable coincidence, he said.",
      "\"It also comes close to each of them, with a probability of one in 20,000,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Receiving order confirmations for purchases you never made could mean your email address is being exploited in fraud operations targeting multiple retailers.",
    "story": [
      "A new report by The Wall Street Journal is warning people to think twice before trusting the 'unsubscribe' option at the bottom of promotional emails.",
      "Over the past year, more people have reported receiving order shipment emails for purchases they never made. These messages usually come from legitimate retailers, often sportswear brands or electronics stores, and contain real tracking numbers and delivery details. The products are being shipped to different names at different addresses, but for some reason, the buyer's contact email is yours.",
      "It might seem like a harmless clerical error or someone accidentally typing the wrong email address. But when it happens repeatedly, and across multiple unrelated orders, it starts to look less like a coincidence and more like a tactic.",
      "Arthur from Cape Coral, Florida, recently reached out with an experience that mirrors what others have been describing:",
      "\"My wife's e-mail address is showing up in emails from various sports entities to notify her of shipping dates, etc. So far, three separate individuals have ordered products, shipped to a different name at a different address, but used her email as the contact. They didn't use our credit card to place the order. What could be going on? I don't believe it's a coincidence.\"",
      "HOW TO DETECT FAKE AMAZON EMAILS AND AVOID IMPERSONATION SCAMS",
      "Arthur is right to question what's happening. Scammers are deliberately using real email addresses to push fraudulent purchases through retailer systems with fewer checks. They rely on your email to carry out the scam, even if they have not stolen your payment details.",

      "Some scammers use valid, active email addresses to bypass retailer fraud filters. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's likely happening with those shipment emails in your inbox",
      "It is unlikely that someone is accidentally typing your email address every single time. Rather, scammers are deliberately using valid, active email addresses like yours to bypass retailer fraud filters. Numerous sources confirm that fake order and shipping confirmation emails are a common tactic in fraud operations, with criminals exploiting the trust systems placed in legitimate email addresses.",
      "When a stolen credit card is used, pairing it with a real email that has not triggered spam alerts increases the chance the transaction will go unnoticed by anti-fraud systems. Retailers often check whether an email address is active or bounces. If the system sees a functioning address, it may be less suspicious than an obviously fake one.",
      "Once the order is placed, products are frequently sent to drop addresses or freight-forwarding services, as confirmed by official investigations into brushing scams. These services act as intermediaries, making the scam harder to trace. In that context, your email is simply a means to an end, a validated contact point that helps the operation move forward smoothly.",
      "Scammers can obtain email addresses when reputable companies experience data breaches. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How bad actors are able to get your email",
      "Your email address may have ended up in the hands of scammers through several common methods. The most likely cause is a data breach. Many well-known companies have\u00a0experienced leaks in which customer emails and other information were exposed.",
      "Once your email is part of a leaked database, it often circulates on the dark web or in underground forums, where it is freely traded and reused. Even if you were not part of a breach, scammers often use a technique called credential stuffing. This involves testing stolen login details across different websites to confirm which email addresses are active.",
      "REMOVE YOUR DATA TO PROTECT YOUR RETIREMENT FROM SCAMMERS",
      "The best thing you can do to prevent this from happening is to invest in a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "7 ways to secure your email from scammers",
      "These simple but powerful steps can help you protect your inbox, safeguard your identity and stay one step ahead of scammers misusing your email.",
      "Start by locking down your email account with a strong, unique password that you don\u2019t reuse anywhere else. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) so hackers can\u2019t get in even if they\u2019ve stolen your password. A password manager makes this much easier by generating and securely storing complex passwords, helping you avoid the risks of reuse.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Scan your inbox regularly for order confirmations, shipping notices or account sign-ups you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it directly to the retailer or platform; it could be part of a larger scam using your email address. Never click on suspicious links, even if the message looks legitimate, and protect your devices with strong antivirus software to catch threats before they spread.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Avoid entering your email on shady giveaway sites or sketchy online forms. When in doubt, skip the sign-up or use a throwaway email. The fewer places your email lives, the harder it is for scammers to get hold of it.",
      "Set up a dedicated email for online purchases, newsletters and subscriptions. This helps keep your main inbox clean and makes it easier to spot strange activity. Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0 An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",

      "HOW TO TELL IF A LOGIN ALERT IS REAL OR A SCAM",
      "Even if no purchases appear under your name, scams involving your email can be a red flag for future identity misuse. Set up alerts with your bank and consider a credit monitoring service to catch unauthorized activity early.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",
      "In your email settings (e.g., Gmail, Outlook), check for any connected apps, services or delegated access you don't recognize and remove them. This ensures no third party is piggybacking off your account.",
      "If this email misuse leads to fraudulent financial activity, users should file a report with the FTC at IdentityTheft.gov or their local authorities.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If you are receiving order confirmations for things you never bought, do not shrug it off. Your email is likely being misused as part of a larger fraud operation, not by accident but intentionally. Scammers are taking advantage of active, trustworthy email addresses to slip past retailer defenses and carry out unauthorized purchases. The repeated use of your email shows that fraud networks are already circulating it, even if your financial information remains untouched.",

    "summary": "First wireless brain implant works with Apple&apos;s official protocol, enabling hands-free control of iPhones, iPads and Vision Pro through thought alone.",
    "story": [
      "Surgeries may become safer and more precise than ever before.",
      "A new brain implant now lets people control Apple devices, such as iPads, iPhones and the Vision Pro, using only their thoughts. Synchron, an endovascular brain-computer interface (BCI) company based in New York, demonstrated the first wireless BCI that works with Apple's official protocol.",
      "Ten patients have received the implant: six in the U.S. and four in Australia. With this technology, users living with severe paralysis can navigate apps, send messages and operate devices hands-free. This breakthrough greatly expands independence, as it enables patients to manage their environment, stream shows and control smart home devices, all using only their minds.",
      "Synchron's advancement in BCI technology marks a significant step for assistive devices and hints at how we may interact with computers in the future. The device's hands-free, voice-free operation offers a powerful new level of accessibility and autonomy for people with disabilities.",

      "ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface (BCI) working with an iPad. (Synchron)",
      "A first for brain-tech and Apple",
      "Synchron is the first company to connect a brain implant directly to Apple devices using Apple's official BCI Human Interface Device (HID) protocol. This means no custom hacks or workarounds. The system simply connects over Bluetooth, just like a keyboard or a mouse, and works with iPhones, iPads, and even the Apple Vision Pro. In a powerful video shared by Synchron, ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates the tech in action. After losing the use of his hands, he's now able to navigate his iPad entirely with thought. That includes opening apps, composing messages, and staying connected with the people he loves-all without moving a muscle.",
      "Behind the scenes, Synchron's system uses artificial intelligence to decode brain signals and turn them into real-time digital commands. Machine learning models interpret motor intent, such as thinking about tapping your finger, and translate that into actions on the iPad. This AI-powered decoding helps the system feel smooth and responsive as users learn to control it with focus alone.",
      "Synchron's brain-computer interface is seen up close. (Synchron)",
      "The game-changing signal strength meter",
      "One surprising new feature is the built-in signal strength meter. This visual cue shows patients how strong their brain signal is in real time. A blue box appears over an icon or app and fills up based on how clearly the system reads the user's intent. It may sound simple, but this is a huge deal. It helps users like Mark fine-tune their mental focus, adjust their posture, and improve their interaction without outside help. It's like seeing your brain in action and learning to drive it better.\u00a0\"When I lost the use of my hands, I thought I had lost my independence,\" Mark says in the video.\u00a0\"Now, with my iPad, I can message my loved ones, read the news, and stay connected with the world, just by thinking.\"",

      "Mark Jackson operates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface, which functions using Apple's official protocol. (Synchron)",
      "What sets Synchron apart",
      "BCIs like Synchron's Stentrode and Elon Musk's\u00a0Neuralink have connected to devices before, but never like this. Previous setups required custom software or physical adapters. Now, thanks to Apple's new BCI HID protocol, brain-computer interfaces can plug right into the Apple ecosystem like any other accessory. That official integration opens the door to more features, better performance, and fewer setup hurdles. Synchron's COO, Kurt Haggstrom, calls it a\u00a0\"game changer\" for both patients and the entire BCI industry.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This tech isn't just for people with paralysis, at least, not forever. Today, it's a medical tool undergoing trials. Tomorrow, it could become a consumer product you buy at your local Apple Store. With Apple embracing BCI as a legitimate input method, everything from your phone to your smart home could one day be controllable by thought. That opens the door for more accessibility, more customization, and completely new ways of interacting with technology.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Synchron's Apple demo marks a new era in brain-computer interaction. It turns thoughts into action using mainstream tech you probably already own. While it's still in its early stages, the direction is clear: BCI is moving out of the lab and into real life, and Apple is helping lead the charge.",

    "summary": "Ten innovative tech solutions from gait sensors to smart pill dispensers help adults 65+ track fall risks and prevent injuries before they happen.",
    "story": [
      "Murdoch Children's Institute clinical science research director Dr. Vicki Anderson explains how the app will help parents and coaches rapidly assess injuries and determine how to treat them on 'Varney & Co.'",
      "Falls are the number one cause of injury among adults 65 and older. But the truth is, your risk doesn't suddenly appear the day you turn 65. It increases gradually over time, especially if you're dealing with weak muscles, balance issues, side effects from medication, or even just forgetting a pill. Experts recommend that everyone get screened for fall risk at age 65. But you don't have to wait for a doctor's visit to take action. A new wave of technology is giving older adults the power to track, prevent, and respond to fall risks, all from home. Here are 10 smart tools that can help.",

      "New technology can help track and prevent falls. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "1) Gait sensors track how your balance changes over time",
      "Your walking pattern can reveal subtle issues that increase your risk of falling. If you use an iPhone with iOS 15 or newer, the built-in walking steadiness feature in the Health app can rate your balance as OK, low, or very low over time. Android users can use wearable fitness trackers like\u00a0Fitbit, or Samsung Galaxy Watch to gather similar data. These tools track stride, stability, and pressure patterns that help identify balance changes before you feel unsteady.",
      "FORGET 10,000 STEPS \u2014 RESEARCH REVEALS THE REAL NUMBER YOU NEED FOR BETTER HEALTH",
      "What to check:\u00a0On iPhone, open the Health app and review your walking steadiness trends. Android users can check their wearable app dashboards, like Samsung Health or Fitbit, to view step symmetry, cadence, and gait-related data. Look for any changes over weeks or months and take advantage of in-app exercise suggestions to improve balance and strength.",
      "Apps that track physical activity and walking patterns can help users improve their balance and strength, or even detect a change in gait before it becomes an issue. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "2) Smart pill dispensers prevent risky mistakes",
      "Forgetting to take medication, or taking too much, can cause grogginess or dizziness that increases fall risk. A smart pill dispenser helps make sure you take the right dose at the right time.",
      "What to look for: Look for dispensers with reminders, dose tracking, and alerts for missed meds.",
      "Smart pill dispensers can assist patients in making sure they take the correct dose of the desired medication at the right time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Fitness trackers keep you motivated to move",
      "Building strength, especially in your legs and core, is one of the best ways to prevent falls. Whether you use an\u00a0Apple Watch, Fitbit or another device, fitness trackers can nudge you toward daily movement goals.",
      "What to check:\u00a0Track your cardio fitness levels, not just step counts. It's a good indicator of your overall strength and endurance.",
      "Fitness tracking devices can help users build strength and resilience. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Vital-sign monitors help detect lightheaded spells",
      "Dips in blood pressure or oxygen levels can make you feel woozy, which increases your fall risk.\u00a0Smartwatches and fingertip pulse oximeters help you monitor these changes in real time.",
      "What to check:\u00a0If you're not using a wearable, jot down your daily readings with a standard cuff or oximeter to spot any unusual trends.",
      "5) Motion-activated lighting lights the way",
      "Getting up in the middle of the night without enough light is a common recipe for a fall. Motion-activated lights can illuminate your path without you needing to touch a switch.",
      "What to look for: Try plug-in nightlights that turn on when they sense motion, or during a power outage. Some even double as portable flashlights.",
      "NEW MOBILE ROBOT HELPS SENIORS WALK SAFELY AND PREVENT FALLS",
      "6) Leak sensors help prevent unexpected slips",
      "A small water leak can create a slick floor long before it's visible. Leak sensors alert you to changes in humidity or water buildup near appliances and pipes.",
      "What to look for:\u00a0Choose ones that send alerts to your phone. You'll avoid a fall and possibly a pricey repair bill.",
      "7) Doorbell cameras keep you from rushing",
      "One overlooked fall trigger is rushing to answer the door. A\u00a0doorbell camera lets you see who's there and speak to them, so you can take your time or decide not to answer at all.",
      "What to look for: A model with two-way audio gives you the freedom to communicate from wherever you are in your home.",
      "While we're on the topic of security cameras, be sure to check out\u00a010 things you must consider when choosing any security camera.",
      "Doorbell cameras enable users to communicate with visitors without rushing to answer the door. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8) Fall-detection devices can call for help",
      "Even the most independent older adults face higher fall risks, and family members who live far away may worry more than they let on. If a fall happens and you're alone, getting help quickly is essential. Wearables like the\u00a0Apple Watch can detect a hard fall and automatically alert emergency services or your emergency contacts.\u00a0Apple Watch SE, Series 4 or later, and Apple Watch Ultra include fall detection. If a hard fall is detected, the watch vibrates, sounds an alarm, and gives the option to call emergency services.",
      "To turn it on manually:",
      "Open the\u00a0Watch app on your iPhoneTap\u00a0My Watch in the bottom leftScroll down and click\u00a0Emergency SOSToggle on\u00a0Fall Detection and choose\u00a0Always On",

      "Scroll down and click\u00a0Emergency SOS",
      "Toggle on\u00a0Fall Detection and choose\u00a0Always On",
      "If you don't use an\u00a0Apple Watch, there are other great options. Many Android-compatible smartwatches now offer fall detection, including select Samsung Galaxy Watch models.",
      "There are also dedicated medical alert wearables that can help bridge that distance with a single button press. These tools are simple, discreet, and offer life-saving support, especially when no one else is around.",
      "Check out some of the top-rated personal safety tools to consider by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/MonitorLovedOnes.",
      "What to check: Whether you use a\u00a0smartwatch or a medical alert device, make sure fall detection is turned on, your contacts are updated, and you test the feature once in a while for peace of mind.",
      "Many smartwatches and medical alert devices can detect when a user falls and offer the option to call for help. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "9) Smart speakers make it easier to call for help",
      "Voice assistants like\u00a0Alexa or\u00a0Google Nest can help you call someone, turn on a light, or get a reminder, without having to move.",
      "What to look for: Set up voice shortcuts and routines for common tasks. If you're unsteady, saying \"Call my daughter\" is a lot safer than walking to your phone.",
      "STUDY REVEALS 10 HAPPIEST STATES FOR SENIORS: DID YOURS MAKE THE LIST?",
      "10) Balance-training apps keep your brain and body in sync",
      "Apps like Nymbl for iPhone or Android, or KOKU for iPhone and Android, offer fun daily balance and cognitive exercises that take just a few minutes. The goal? Keep your body strong and your reflexes sharp.",
      "What to check: Use an app that tracks progress and gives feedback. Some are backed by health researchers or physical therapists.",
      "Using apps to perform balance exercises and cognitive challenges can help keep reflexes honed. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Falls aren't only about tripping on a rug or losing your footing. They often involve deeper issues like poor sleep, medication interactions, or delayed reflexes. By using smart tech, you can spot early warning signs, make smarter choices, and stay in control of your health, on your own terms.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Getting older doesn't mean giving up your independence. In fact, the right technology can help extend it. Whether it's a\u00a0smartwatch that alerts family during a fall or a simple nightlight that turns on automatically, every tool you use can add peace of mind. You don't have to wait for a fall to start protecting yourself.",

      "Threads app logo on a smartphone screen with the Meta logo above it. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Meta AI policy allowed chatbots to flirt with kids",
      "According to internal \"GenAI: Content Risk Standards,\" Meta's legal, policy, and engineering teams signed off on chatbot rules that made it acceptable for bots to describe a child as \"a youthful form of art\" or engage in romantic roleplay with minors. Even worse, the guidelines gave room for chatbots to demean people by race and spread false medical claims. This was not a bug. These were approved rules until Meta faced questions. Once Reuters started asking, the company quickly scrubbed the offensive sections and claimed it had been a mistake.",

      "We reached out to Meta, and a spokesperson provided this statement to CyberGuy:",
      "\"We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors. Separate from the policies, there are hundreds of examples, notes, and annotations that reflect teams grappling with different hypothetical scenarios. The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.\"",
      "Meta told CyberGuy that their AI policies prohibit content that sexualizes children.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Big Tech puts profit over kids' safety",
      "Let's call this what it is. Meta didn't stop this on its own. It only acted when exposed. That shows Big Tech's priorities: money, engagement, and keeping kids glued to screens. Safety? Not even on the radar until someone blows the whistle. Meta has repeatedly shown it couldn't care less about your children's well-being. It's about maximizing time online, pulling in younger users, and monetizing every click. This latest scandal proves once again that parents cannot rely on tech companies to protect kids.",
      "Congress pushes Meta to explain disturbing AI rules",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and a bipartisan group in Congress are demanding that Meta come clean. Lawmakers want to know how and why these policies ever got approval. Hawley called on Meta to release all internal documents and explain why chatbots were allowed to simulate flirting with children. Meta insists it has\u00a0\"fixed\" the problem, but critics argue these corrections only came after they were exposed. Until real regulations arrive, parents are on their own.",

      "Children should never have free access to AI chatbots, including Meta AI. The internal documents show these systems can cross boundaries that no parent would approve of. Supervision is the first line of defense.",
      "Enable parental controls on phones, tablets, and computers. These tools give you more visibility and limit access to risky apps where inappropriate chatbot conversations could happen.",
      "The Meta revelations prove AI can go places parents would never expect. Ongoing conversations with your children about what is safe and what is not online are essential for their protection.",

      "While antivirus software won't stop AI flirting, it adds a much-needed layer of security. Hackers and bad actors often target kids through the same devices where chatbots live, so whole-family protection matters. The best way to safeguard from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing you and your family's private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "More people are turning to artificial intelligence for support, even for mental health advice. It's easy to see why: tools like ChatGPT are free, fast, and always available. But mental health is a delicate issue, and AI isn't equipped to handle the complexities of real emotional distress.",
      "To address growing concerns, OpenAI has introduced new safety measures for ChatGPT. These updates will limit how the chatbot responds to mental health-related queries. The goal is to prevent users from becoming overly dependent and to encourage them to seek proper care. OpenAI also hopes to reduce the risk of harmful or misleading responses through these changes.",

In another, it allegedly encouraged terrorism.",

      "Screenshot of a prompt asking if ChatGPT can provide mental health advice (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What new safeguards has OpenAI set in place?",
      "From now on, ChatGPT will prompt users to take breaks during long conversations. It will also avoid offering specific advice on deeply personal issues. Instead, the chatbot will help users reflect by asking questions and offering pros and cons, without pretending to be a therapist.",
      "OpenAI stated,\u00a0\"While rare, we're continuing to improve our models and are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately and point people to evidence-based resources when needed.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump brokering a deal with Azerbaijan and Armenia on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new deal in the South Caucasus has ended a decades-long conflict and handed Washington a rare strategic foothold on Iran\u2019s northern border, experts say.",
      "The agreement, signed earlier this month between Armenia and Azerbaijan, grants the U.S. a 99-year lease over the Zangezur Corridor - a narrow strip of land that will serve as a critical trade and energy route to Europe, bypassing Tehran entirely. Iranian American journalist and dissident Banafsheh Zand told Fox News Digital the move is \"a wonderful gain for the U.S.\" that also delivers a \"slap in the face\" to the regime in Tehran.",
      "The corridor has long been at the center of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which displaced tens of thousands and fueled three decades of instability. Trump\u2019s intervention brought both sides to the table and created what observers say is a new trade and security lifeline linking the Caspian Basin to Europe, bypassing Iran entirely.",

      "A view from Armenia's southern border reveals the Arax River, with Iran visible across the water. This crossing is a vital lifeline for Armenia, facilitating essential trade and energy flows, especially as tensions rise over the proposed Zangezur Corridor. Iran strongly opposes the corridor, fearing it would sever its direct land access to Armenia and diminish its role as a regional transit hub. The corridor, intended to connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, has become a flashpoint in regional geopolitics. (Anthony Pizzoferrato/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Known as the Trump Route for Peace & Prosperity (TRIPP), economically, the agreement secures Washington a direct role in overseeing the flow of Caspian hydrocarbons to Europe. The U.S. will manage rail and road infrastructure, telecom networks and energy pipelines running through the corridor, giving American companies a dominant position in regional transit for oil, gas and goods. By controlling this artery, the U.S. not only generates billions in future trade and investment but also locks Europe into alternative supply routes that reduce reliance on both Russia and Iran.",
      "For allies, the corridor offers cheaper and safer access to Caspian energy. For Tehran, it represents lost revenue, lost leverage, and the end of its ability to act as a mandatory gatekeeper for east-west commerce.",
      "Zand said the deal is not only historic but also a direct win for Washington. \"It\u2019s a wonderful gain for the U.S.,\" she said. \"American contractors will be supervising oil and gas from the Caspian Basin, routed through Zangezur and Turkey to Europe. The profit margins are great, and it all happens under NATO\u2019s blessing.\"",
      "Zand said the potential goes even further. \"Nobody\u2019s talking about it yet, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to see U.S. bases there,\" she said. \"If that happens, then checkmate the Khamenei regime and Russia.\"",

US President Donald Trump said Friday that Armenia and Azerbaijan were committed to a permanent peace as he hosted a White House summit with the leaders of the two South Caucasus nations, which have fought for decades. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "For Iran, the corridor represents what Zand called a nightmare scenario. Tehran has long used its geography to shape energy and trade flows. By inserting the U.S. into the region, the new deal effectively strips Iran of that leverage. Zand put it in stark terms: \"Iran is shaped like a cat, a sitting cat. This corridor literally runs above the cat\u2019s ears. It bypasses Iran, takes money away from the regime, and pushes them out into the cold.\"",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Iran Program, said the corridor exposes how vulnerable Iran has become in the Caucasus. \"Both the defeat of Armenia in the most recent war with Azerbaijan, as well as the political problems between Moscow and Yerevan today, have made it harder for the Islamic Republic to really benefit from its traditional economic and political relationship with Armenia,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "An infographic titled \u2018Construction of roads and railways extending to the Zangezur Corridor continues without interruption.\u2019 Once constructed, the corridor will connect Azerbaijan's western provinces and Nakhchivan via Armenia, further stretching to China, Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey.\u00a0 (Yasin Demirci/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "\"They still do have ties, and the regime is an opportunistic actor as much as it is an ideological one. If there is any way to throw stones at this agreement, or extract concessions on the back end, they will try.\"",
      "At the same time, he said the strategic picture is clear. \"The Islamic Republic is, in essence, carved out of this route,\" he said. \"This is not just a critical corridor that could bring stability to the South Caucasus and economic improvement for all countries involved-it also drives home the point that the regime has been such a poor guardian of Iran\u2019s national interest that the Iranian state has been excluded from a major transit route just above its border.\"",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei addresses the media during voting for parliamentary elections in Tehran, Iran in May 2024. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The timing, Zand argued, makes the impact even greater. She pointed to Iran\u2019s weakening position since October 7, 2023, and Israel's recent 12-day war with Tehran. \"The regime was self-isolated when it couldn\u2019t come to Hamas\u2019s or Hezbollah\u2019s rescue. Iraq\u2019s Shiites are saying they don\u2019t want to be controlled, Syria is out, and Hezbollah has been degraded. For those of us who\u2019ve watched the regime for decades, we always knew it was a paper tiger. October 7 and the war exposed it to the world.\"",
      "The killing of senior IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists has deepened the sense of vulnerability inside Tehran. \"They can huff and puff about blowing the house down, but the truth is, there\u2019s a whole lot of fear among the regime\u2019s leaders now,\" Zand said. \"Khamenei has even gone into hiding again.\"",
      "TRUMP BRINGS PEACE TO CAUCASUS: INSIDE THE ARMENIA\u2013AZERBAIJAN DEAL 30 YEARS IN THE MAKING",
      "Ben Taleblu added that Washington is now using these shifts to turn Iran\u2019s weakness into opportunity. \"Wherever the regime is weak, that invites pushback, whether militarily or economically,\" he said. \"The U.S. has followed Israel\u2019s military success against the Islamic Republic with strikes of its own against nuclear facilities, and it is now following Azerbaijan\u2019s battlefield success with a political and economic success of its own. This corridor is another example of America moving in when Tehran is most vulnerable.\"",
      "An aerial view of the construction of roads and railways that will pass through the Zangezur Corridor, which will connect the western provinces with Nakhchivan and will also be one of the routes of the Central Corridor extending from China to Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey. (Photo by Resul Rehimov/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Zand, whose father was a well-known Iranian journalist and intellectual assassinated by the regime, said she views Trump\u2019s direct involvement as the key to the corridor\u2019s success. \"Because it\u2019s Trump, it makes all the difference,\" she said. \u00a0\"Trump doesn\u2019t care about not hurting people\u2019s feelings. He responds to how people act. And with this move, he\u2019s sitting over Iran like a vulture-ominous, watching, ready.\"",
      "For dissidents like Zand, the corridor represents more than a transport route. \"We\u2019ve prayed for this for decades,\" she said. \"Until the regime is gone, people inside Iran will remain too afraid to rise up again. But this corridor is a boon. It shows the regime is surrounded, and its days are numbered.\"",

      "The deal was reached with NATO backing and has already been compared by some observers to historic peace accords. Zand believes the significance lies not only in ending a 30-year conflict but also in turning the U.S. presence in the Caucasus into a permanent reality. \"The regime knows the jig is up.\"",

    "summary": "Israel has approved a settlement in the occupied West Bank that would cut the territory in two, and could destroy hopes for a future Palestinian state.",
    "story": [
      "MAALE ADUMIM, West Bank \u2014 The sun-starched strip of sand and brush doesn\u2019t look like much, but if you squint, you can almost glimpse the dreamscape of a future Palestinian capital.",
      "\u201cThese spare lands mean that we can build our parliament, we can build our future institutions,\u201d Khalil Toufakji, a Palestinian expert on geography and settlement expansion, told NBC News earlier this month as he gestured across the controversial \u201cEast 1,\u201d or E1, section of the occupied West Bank.",
      "\u201cIf Israel builds here, it means that everything is finished at the same time,\u201d the 76-year-old expert on Israeli settlements said at an overlook in the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim. \u201cThis means that Jerusalem is surrounded from everywhere. \u2026 It means that there is no Palestinian geographic continuity between the north and south.\u201d",
      "The almost 5 square miles of land may seem undesirable and the conflict around it theoretical, but both Israel and the Palestinians regard the area\u2019s fate with the same sense of urgency.",
      "So when Israeli authorities approved the development of 3,400 homes last week, ultranationalist lawmakers celebrated what they saw as the death knell for a nascent Palestinian state and an acceleration of plans for Israel to annex the whole of the West Bank.",
      "The development \u201cpractically erases the two-state delusion and consolidates the Jewish people\u2019s hold on the heart of the Land of Israel,\u201d Bezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, told a news conference when he announced his approval of the plans.",
      "\u201cNow they declare it clearly and they don\u2019t need to hide it,\u201d said Shawan Jabarin, the general director of Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organization based in the West Bank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need philosophers and intellectuals to analyze. They speak about it themselves: \u2018This is to kill any possibility of a Palestinian state.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since the plan was tabled in the early 1990s, Israeli authorities and Jewish settlers like Smotrich have expounded upon the practical needs for new development as Jerusalem has become too crowded and environmental regulations have forbidden new building in the west of the city, which mostly belongs to Israel.",
      "But Palestinians say the area, which straddles the enormous Maale Adumim Jewish settlement and the Palestinian-majority east Jerusalem, is the only undeveloped land that might host government buildings for a new state.",
      "The construction would also split the West Bank in two, again fracturing an incipient Palestinian state already divided between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where almost 63,000 people have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the enclave\u2019s health ministry. Israel launched its military campaign after the Hamas-led terror attacks that day, which killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage.",
      "After almost 23 months of war, the country has faced mounting criticism about its conduct from traditional Western allies like the U.K., France and Canada, which have recently made conditional offers to recognize a Palestinian state, unless Israel revives talks to achieve that and agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Those countries were among 21 that criticized the E1 development plans as a \u201cviolation of international law\u201d in a statement Friday. \u201cWe condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms,\u201d it read. British Foreign Minister David Lammy also called Tzipi Hotovely, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.K., to raise his objections.",
      "But the recognition of a Palestinian state is seen by some Israeli politicians as rewarding Hamas, leading them to view the E1 proposals as a deliberate broadside against longtime allies whose statements are increasingly drifting away from their country.",
      "\u201cIn the eyes of the right wing of Israeli politics, this is diplomatic pushback,\u201d said David Weinberg, a fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy. \u201cBut it\u2019s diplomatic pushback that\u2019s already on top of what have long been salient reasons, good reasons, for Israel wanting to build on E1.\u201d",
      "But for the Israeli right, the resounding triumph of President Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has drowned out such protests.",
      "\u201cThe E1 plan was initiated three decades ago and it was always blocked due to American pressure,\u201d said Lior Amihai, the executive director of Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy organization. \u201cNow under Trump, they\u2019re approving it. So certainly the lack of American resistance \u2026 enabled the Israeli government to approve it.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment from NBC News about the E1 development.",
      "Upon retaking office, Trump lifted Biden-era sanctions on Israeli settlers who had been implicated in repeated violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "In his first term, he moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognized all of the city as Israel\u2019s capital. Most countries consider east Jerusalem to be occupied territory and do not recognize Israeli sovereignty. Israel, which captured east Jerusalem, including the Old City, from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, deems it as its eternal, indivisible capital.",
      "So far this year, Israel has approved 25,000 settlement housing units in the West Bank, Amihai said, far surpassing the record of 12,000 units during the whole of 2020 \u2014 a massive increase Amihai credited in part to Trump because his administration had created \u201can environment where it\u2019s easier for this government,\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t have to hide anything, they can say it vocally out loud.\u201d",
      "The additional units will accommodate the burgeoning growth of the 700,000 settlers the United Nations estimates already live in the West Bank in settlements widely considered illegal under international law.",
      "Even as the E1 plan slogged through decades of bureaucratic and diplomatic obstacles, Israeli officials prepared the land some of their countrymen refer to as Judea and Samaria, using the biblical term, with a clear intention to develop it.",
      "The Samaria and Judea Police District headquarters relocated there in 2008. Highways and other roadworks connecting Jerusalem and Maale Adumim\u2019s infrastructure to the same largely uninhabited land have also been installed.",
      "Once housing there is finished, Palestinian observers say the area will become closed to their community. Even those simply driving through from the Palestinian provisional capital of Ramallah to the southern West Bank town of Bethlehem will probably have to seek longer routes, they say.",
      "Such detours shouldn\u2019t preclude further agreements between Palestinians and Israelis, Weinberg said, even as he dismissed the notion of a Palestinian state under current circumstances.",
      "\u201cInstead of battering Israel, the West should be advancing realistic space-saving arrangements for Judea and Sumeria,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s need to build on E1 does not need to be a bar to an agreement with a serious Palestinian government.\u201d",
      "Yet the Israeli right wing has made its intentions known, Jabarin said. Such a sudden, strenuous assault on Palestinian statehood \u2014 particularly with American blessings \u2014 will require more than diplomatic rhetoric to reverse.",
      "\u201cWording there, condemnations here \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make any change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not push Israel back in any way.\u201d"

      "\u201cI do scientific research,\u201d Tao said. \u201cI vote, I sign a petition, but I don\u2019t consider myself an activist.\u201d",
      "But after the July suspension of $584 million in federal grants at UCLA, which he joined as a faculty member at age 20, Tao said he feels forced to speak out against what he views as \u201cindiscriminate\u201d cuts to science that could drive scientists away from the U.S., including himself, if trends continue.",
      "\u201cI find that this administration in particular has been extremely radical with how it is changing the scientific ecosystem in a way that even the first Trump administration was not,\u201d Tao said. \u201cThis is not normal, and I think a lot of people don\u2019t see the damage that is being done.\u201d",
      "Tao is one of the most prominent mathematicians and academics to publicly oppose the administration\u2019s actions, calling them an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to his field, and academic science, more broadly. He said public advocacy is a priority over his research, for now.",
      "\u201cThe United States is the largest funder of scientific research in the world, and the Administration remains committed to cementing America\u2019s innovative dominance. Federal research funding, however, is not a constitutional right,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said. \u201cThe Administration has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer-funded research aligns with the priorities of the American people.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration targeted UCLA for reform by suspending federal grants across the university, alleging racial discrimination and \u201cfailing to promote a research environment free of antisemitism and bias.\u201d",
      "About three decades ago, Tao immigrated to the U.S. at age 16 \u2014 already a math prodigy. The Australian American researcher built a career at UCLA and was awarded the 2016 Fields Medal, the equivalent of a Nobel Prize in mathematics. Tao has also won a MacArthur fellowship and a Breakthrough Prize, among other awards.",
      "The National Science Foundation, as part of a broader federal action aimed at UCLA, suspended two of Tao\u2019s grants, including one that directly supported Tao\u2019s work at UCLA and another for the university\u2019s Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), where Tao oversees special projects.",
      "On Aug. 12, U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin ordered the university\u2019s NSF grants be restored, enforcing a previous preliminary injunction in a legal battle that is ongoing. The ruling only applies to NSF grants at UCLA, including Tao\u2019s. Federal grants from other agencies, like the National Institutes of Health and the Energy Department, remain suspended.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. National Science Foundation has reinstated the suspended awards to the University of California \u2014 Los Angeles,\u201d an NSF spokesperson said in a statement, declining further comment about Tao\u2019s remarks.",
      "Long term, funding for IPAM \u2014 which was founded in 2000 and built to foster collaborations between mathematicians, industry and engineers \u2014 remains uncertain. The grant expires next year and is awaiting renewal. The institute is almost entirely funded by NSF, and the Trump administration has proposed a 57% budget cut to NSF, according to its request for fiscal year 2026.",
      "Tao\u2019s NSF-funded research centers on a technical branch of mathematics that is focused on determining if and when patterns are occurring in long sequences of numbers. It is basic research without a direct application in mind, but Tao said his findings could have implications for cryptographic protocols for security.",
      "Research out of IPAM, however, has more obvious public benefits. Two decades ago, Tao collaborated with scientists focused on signal processing problems in medical imaging.",
      "\u201cOne of the algorithms we developed at IPAM is used routinely in modern MRI machines to speed up MRI scans by a factor of 10 in some cases,\u201d Tao said.",
      "The Trump administration has used cuts or suspensions to grant funding as leverage as it seeks reform at university campuses. Its approach has been multipronged: The administration first attempted to slash funding for science by reducing federal reimbursements for indirect costs like equipment, maintenance and office staff.",
      "Then, it targeted specific types of grants, such as those involving diversity, equity and inclusion or gender identity, among other topics.",
      "It also targeted specific institutions, like Harvard University, Columbia University and more recently UCLA, over allegations of racism and antisemitism.",
      "Lawsuits have followed many of these funding actions, and the subsequent back-and-forth legal battles have left some grants vacillating between canceled and reinstated.",
      "Tao said the recent funding disruption to his project forced him to defer some of his own salary to continue paying his graduate students. He\u2019s spent the past several weeks working not on math, but in emergency meetings with university administrators, fundraising meetings with donors and writing opinion pieces to oppose the cuts.",
      "\u201cThis is time that I would normally have down for my own research, but this takes priority,\u201d Tao said.",
      "He\u2019s increasingly concerned about the bigger picture: He thinks the administration\u2019s actions are increasingly pushing young scientists to leave the U.S., and if trends continue, Tao said he could not rule out leaving, too.",
      "From his perch at UCLA, Tao said he\u2019s noticed graduate students and postdoctoral students are increasingly choosing to pursue opportunities outside of the U.S. as uncertainty around funding grows.",
      "\u201cThere have been past periods of history where other countries with a great scientific tradition have experienced great turmoil or war and many of them fled to the United States as a safe haven,\u201d Tao said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of ironic that there may now be a reverse process where other countries may start picking up talent which is currently in the U.S.\u201d",
      "One year ago, Tao said he would have never considered leaving UCLA or the United States, but he\u2019s received a handful of recruiting inquiries and he\u2019s no longer confident he\u2019ll stay in the United States, if trends continue.",
      "\u201cI have roots here. I raised my family here, so it would take a fair amount to uproot me, but these days, it\u2019s really hard to make predictions now,\u201d Tao said. \u201cI was not thinking about moving at all. This wasn\u2019t even on the radar, and now, for better or for worse, every possibility has to be considered.\u201d"

      "Monitoring for the six pathogens is no longer required for the 10 states that participate in the program, though those states aren\u2019t precluded from conducting surveillance on their own.",
      "Food safety experts worry that the move, which hasn\u2019t previously been made public, could make it harder for public health officials to notice whether certain foodborne illnesses are rising and then slow response time to outbreaks.",
      "FoodNet is a collaboration among the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the Agriculture Department and 10 state health departments. Its surveillance area covers roughly 54 million people, or 16% of the U.S. population. The network includes Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee and select counties in California and New York.",
      "\u201cAlthough FoodNet will narrow its focus to Salmonella and STEC, it will maintain both its infrastructure and the quality it has come to represent,\u201d the CDC spokesperson wrote. \u201cNarrowing FoodNet\u2019s reporting requirements and associated activities will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities.\u201d",
      "A list of talking points the CDC provided to the Connecticut Public Health Department, viewed by NBC News, cites a reason for the change: \u201cFunding has not kept pace with the resources required to maintain the continuation of FoodNet surveillance for all eight pathogens.\u201d",
      "The CDC spokesperson said Monday that other systems conduct national surveillance for the six pathogens that were removed from FoodNet. For instance, state health departments are still able to report cases through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. And the CDC\u2019s Listeria Initiative collects reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis \u2014 serious infections from eating food contaminated with listeria.",
      "But FoodNet is the only surveillance system that actively looks for multiple foodborne diseases at the federal level, according to food safety experts. Other federal surveillance systems are passive, meaning the CDC relies on state health departments to notify it of cases.",
      "Experts worry that without active surveillance of all eight pathogens, public health officials won\u2019t be able to adequately compare trends over time or notice whether cases of a particular illness start rising. Experts also worry that scaling back FoodNet\u2019s operations could make it harder to quickly identify and respond to outbreaks.",
      "Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University, called the decision to reduce FoodNet surveillance \u201cvery disappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of the work that I and many, many, many, many other people have put into improving food safety over the past 20 or 30 years is just going away,\u201d she said. Kowalcyk\u2019s son died in 2001 of complications from a foodborne E. coli infection, and since then she has advocated for improvements to U.S. food safety policy.",
      "Kowalcyk said that the federal budget for food safety hasn\u2019t kept up with the cost of inflation and that cuts to federal funding for state health departments have most likely made it harder to maintain FoodNet surveillance. The CDC requested a $72 million budget for food safety for the 2026 fiscal year, about the same as it has requested in years past.",
      "It\u2019s not entirely clear how the changes to FoodNet are affecting surveillance on the state level so far.",
      "The Oregon and Connecticut health departments said they were aware of the changes as of Monday. Meanwhile, the Georgia Public Health Department said Friday that it hadn\u2019t received any official notice from the CDC. And the New Mexico Health Department said it was awaiting notification from the CDC to determine the scope of its future surveillance.",
      "The Maryland Health Department said the state\u2019s health care providers and clinical laboratories are required to report cases of all eight pathogens monitored by FoodNet, so the reporting will continue \u201cregardless of changes to the FoodNet network.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said it will need to scale back active surveillance activities for some pathogens if funding is decreased in 2026."

    "summary": "MAHA loves dietary supplements. But that hasn\u2019t yet led to gains for the industry in Washington.",
    "story": [
      "An avid consumer of dietary supplements, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has surrounded himself in part with senior staff members, advisers and health influencers who have promoted everything from weight loss pills to capsules of desiccated organ meat.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t led to gains in Washington for the multibillion-dollar industry \u2014 yet.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d takeover has, instead, been focused in part on questioning vaccine use, calling out artificial food dyes and cutting personnel and research grants at federal agencies.",
      "While Trump officials have offered a warm welcome, neither the administration nor the GOP-controlled Congress has made policy changes long sought by the industry \u2014 to make it easier for consumers to buy supplements, to go after unscrupulous actors and to allow manufacturers more leeway in making claims about their health benefits. And other administration policies targeting food additives and tariffs on imports have imposed new challenges on supplement makers.",
      "\u201cThey seem very willing and eager to have those conversations, and they listen to the issues that we raise. But we\u2019re not seeing action that brings these things to the forefront,\u201d said Steve Mister, president and CEO of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a supplement trade group. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any positive, dramatic changes that have been particularly helpful to the industry.\u201d",
      "Dietary supplements cover a vast array of products, including vitamins, herbal extracts and products derived from foods, including produce, fish and meat. They\u2019ve grown increasingly popular among consumers, making up a $69 billion market in the United States last year, according to one industry estimate.",
      "Some of the most prominent influencers supporting Kennedy and President Donald Trump are among the many celebrities who hawk dietary supplements. Podcaster Joe Rogan has promoted capsules meant to promote cognition \u2014 \u201cit helps your ability to form sentences\u201d \u2014 to a mushroom-derived supplement meant to improve athletic performance.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, came under fire during his confirmation hearing for promoting supplements that he called a \u201cmagic weight loss cure\u201d and \u201cthe No. 1 miracle in a bottle.\u201d",
      "Kennedy also did raw milk shots at the White House with Dr. Paul Saladino, a wellness influencer who sells capsules of freeze-dried organ meats.",
      "At the same time, supplement companies \u2014 along with the influencers and celebrities who promote the products \u2014 have come under criticism for making inflated, sometimes misleading claims that overstate the health benefits of their products.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of supplements,\u201d said Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. \u201cBut most of supplement use is not supported by strong evidence \u2014 it\u2019s supported by advertising.\u201d",
      "Though companies are subject to federal oversight and enforcement action, dietary supplements aren\u2019t approved by the Food and Drug Administration for safety and effectiveness, and their labels aren\u2019t approved before they\u2019re sold to the public. Some can be dangerous, and a growing number of states are taking up bills that would ban the sale of weight loss and muscle-building supplements to minors.",
      "Supplement makers say they go out of their way to ensure their products are safe, arguing it\u2019s a myth that their industry is unregulated \u2014 and they argue some of the federal rules go too far. Laws prohibit labeling or marketing dietary supplements as being able to cure, treat or prevent any disease; those products are considered drugs. Supplement companies can make health claims about their products only through a strict federal approval process.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, said in a statement that people should \u201cconsult a healthcare provider when choosing a dietary supplement.\u201d",
      "On a podcast in 2023, after he had launched his presidential bid, Kennedy mentioned the many vitamins he takes. \u201cI can\u2019t even list them to you here, \u2019cause I couldn\u2019t even remember them all,\u201d he said.",
      "\u00c9lan Sudberg saw an opportunity. Sudberg, the CEO of a botanical plant testing company and a board member of the American Herbal Products Association, which represents supplement makers, was heartened by Kennedy\u2019s emphasis on alternative medicine and criticism of Big Pharma. In November 2023, he met Kennedy at a private event in Ojai, California, and told him that the supplement industry needed his support.",
      "\u201cWe need a champion. And I understand you\u2019re a big fan,\u201d Sudberg recalled telling him.",
      "Kennedy put both of his hands on Sudberg\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMy people are going to be talking to your people,\u201d he told him, Sudberg said.",
      "Kennedy has already faced criticism from some of his other early MAHA supporters for failing to deliver some of the sweeping changes they were hoping to see, on everything from expanding access to raw milk to eliminating harmful pesticides from the food supply. Similarly, some in the supplement industry are frustrated that \u2014 despite the positive rhetoric \u2014 the administration hasn\u2019t been more proactive.",
      "\u201cWhere there are gaps in nutrition, and how do you fill those gaps, the agency does not seem to be focused on that,\u201d said Mister, head of the Council for Responsible Nutrition. \u201cIt really seems to be much more reductionist in terms of we have to get rid of colorings, we have to get rid of dyes, we have to get rid of ultra-processed food.\u201d",
      "Shortly after he became secretary, Kennedy targeted an FDA process that lets companies introduce new chemicals or ingredients into food products without FDA approval, if they are \u201cgenerally recognized to be safe.\u201d Vowing to eliminate the process, Kennedy said food companies had \u201cexploited a loophole\u201d that put consumer food safety at risk.",
      "Major supplements groups quickly registered their concerns in meetings with the FDA, which has yet to announce next steps. \u201cOur members really depend on the ability to be innovative,\u201d said Duffy MacKay, who leads policy initiatives on dietary supplements for the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, an industry trade group.",
      "Supplement makers were thrown for a loop when the Trump administration imposed tariffs on imported goods, as many key ingredients for their products are sourced overseas. While industry groups successfully lobbied the White House for tariff exemptions for major vitamins, minerals and fish oils, other popular ingredients have still been affected.",
      "The tariffs scrambled business plans for Herbalist & Alchemist, which sources herbs from China, India and Europe, some of which can\u2019t be grown easily in the United States. The company this year bought two years\u2019 worth of Rhodiola \u2014 an herb that grows in Arctic regions, used to combat fatigue and stress \u2014 because of looming Canadian tariffs.",
      "While CEO Beth Lambert has been encouraged by the MAHA campaign Kennedy has led, \u201cthe biggest thing that has happened\u201d so far has been the new tariffs, she said. \u201cHaving that uncertainty is just disruptive for an industry. It\u2019s rough for business. It\u2019s rough for the growers.\u201d",
      "Still, makers see an opportunity and believe it\u2019s worth making the extra push while Kennedy and his team are in office. In late July, Calley Means \u2014 a Kennedy aide who founded a startup allowing consumers to get tax breaks on supplements and other health products \u2014 was the keynote speaker at a gathering for supplement industry executives. \u201cIt was an olive branch to working with the industry,\u201d said Graham Rigby, CEO and president of the American Herbal Products Association.",
      "Among the industry\u2019s biggest priorities is to allow supplements to be covered by federal programs like Medicare, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and tax-advantaged health savings accounts. \u201cVitamin C is pretty much now an undisputed, necessary nutrient for healthy lifestyles \u2014 pirates figured that out with scurvy hundreds of years ago,\u201d Sudberg said. \u201cStill, you can\u2019t use your health savings account to buy vitamin C.\u201d",
      "Industry groups tried to make their case this year when Congress debated Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d but lawmakers resisted the change, in part because of the cost. Five trade groups for the supplement industry recently called for the Trump administration to make the change through an updated tax code.",
      "Separately, advocates are pushing the FDA to make it easier for supplement companies to make claims about the health benefits of their products.",
      "The FDA has an approval process for claims that the food component of a supplement may \u201creduce the risk of a disease\u201d or a health condition. But the approval process is strict and time-consuming, requiring not only evidence but also \u201csignificant scientific agreement\u201d about such health claims. To date, the FDA has approved only about a dozen claims.",
      "The Alliance for Natural Health, an advocacy group, believes the FDA has unfairly muzzled companies. It is asking the FDA to allow it to make vastly more health claims \u2014 more than 150 total \u2014 through a formal petition to the agency, scheduled to be submitted this week.",
      "\u201cThere is a huge amount of information at the moment that\u2019s not even finding its way to the public,\u201d said Robert Verkerk, the group\u2019s scientific director, citing research that shows links between B vitamins and the reduction of cognitive decline and between folate and the risk of depression, among other examples.",
      "Some outside experts and consumer advocates warn that supplement companies could end up manipulating consumers if the FDA heeds such calls, allowing manufacturers to make health claims that have only tenuous links to the products they are selling.",
      "Industry groups insist that they are committed to weeding out dishonest companies that make false claims or sell dangerous products. Some have been openly critical of the broad staff cuts the Trump administration has made across federal health agencies \u2014 warning of the impact on FDA enforcement and federal research on supplements, among other areas \u2014 and applauded the FDA\u2019s recent call to categorize 7-OH, a substance found in tablets and drink mixes sold in gas stations and convenience stores that has opioid-like properties, as an illicit substance.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re tolerating bad actors around us, then we\u2019re contributing to the problem,\u201d said Jim Emme, CEO of NOW Health Group, a supplement manufacturer and retailer that has called for the FDA to crack down on products sold on Amazon that have failed potency and quality tests.",
      "Emme, who leads the board of directors of the Natural Products Association, said he has been encouraged by his recent conversations with FDA officials, who have asked whether supplements could be covered by Medicare and what mothers are looking for in supplements for children.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a window of an opportunity for an industry that we need to take advantage of,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all election cycles, right? Who knows how long these administrators are going to be in there?\u201d"

      "A woman crashing a golf cart in an Ohio lake alongside three of her teenage children led authorities to uncover the bodies of her husband and 4-year-old son.",
      "Marcus J. Miller, 45, and Vincen Miller, 4, were found dead over the weekend in Atwood Lake. Tuscarawas County Sheriff Orvis Campbell said he believes Marcus Miller accidentally drowned trying to swim to a sandbar.",
      "The child's mother allegedly told authorities that she had thrown Vincen in the water \"to give that child to God,\" Campbell said at a Monday news conference.",
      "Campbell said that \"spiritual delusion\" was a factor in the deaths.",
      "\"We\u2019re aware of some issues, especially the mother, but also the father. But there were never any discussions of harming anyone. They had some religious beliefs. What we recognize is this: she was clearly in a mental crisis,\" he said. \"And it just simply manifested itself in what we call a spiritual delusion.\"",
      "As of Monday night, the mother remained hospitalized for a mental health evaluation. Authorities intend to charge her with aggravated murder in connection with the 4-year-old's death.",
      "The mother's identity was not released because she has not been formally charged.",
      "The bodies were discovered after deputies received a 911 call Saturday about a woman who crashed a golf cart near Atwood Marina West, the sheriff's office said in a news release.",
      "Campbell said that witnesses were chasing the golf cart through the grass and yelling for the woman to hit the brakes because they thought \"it was careening out of control.\"",
      "The golf cart then flipped over the edge of a stone wall and landed in the lake, he said. Three teenage children, a 15-year-old girl and twin 18-year-old boys, were riding in the golf cart with the woman. The children were able to get out of the water safely, the sheriff said.",
      "Witnesses helped the woman get out of the lake, Campbell said.",
      "\"The first witness that arrives to help is asking the woman does she need help up, and he tries to help, and she suggests to him not to help her, to just pray for her,\" the sheriff said. \"That was the first statement to suggest that this was more than just an accident at that lake.\"",
      "Responding rangers also heard concerning statements from the woman who told them that \"she had given her son to the Lord,\" Campbell said. He said the woman \"was not rational\" and attempted to flee and hide from rangers.",
      "The sheriff's office said that it became evident that the golf cart crash was intentional. Investigators also learned that the woman's husband and 4-year-old son were missing.",
      "The woman allegedly told deputies that she jumped into the lake with her husband early Saturday morning \"because God was speaking to them and telling them to do things, things to prove their worthiness to God.\"",
      "The woman said she and her husband got out of the water and went back to the family\u2019s RV. The woman told investigators that her husband was \"disappointed in himself because he didn\u2019t do very good in his task,\" so he went back to the lake to swim to a sandbar, according to the sheriff.",
      "The father never returned to the RV, the sheriff said.",
      "Just after 8 a.m. Saturday, witnesses said they saw the mother putting the 4-year-old in the golf cart, \"and taking off very erratically,\" the sheriff said. When she came back to the RV, she was alone.",
      "Campbell said the mother told deputies that she \"went to the dock and that she threw the 4-year-old in because that\u2019s what she needed to do as an offering to God.\"",
      "\"She believed that she and her husband had to pass these tests to show their faith, and when they didn\u2019t, then Vincen became the price to pay for that,\" he said.",
      "The tasks the mother said she was directed to do included walking on water and swimming challenges, the sheriff said.",
      "Vincen Miller was found Saturday night near a boat dock in the lake, authorities said. Marcus Miller was found on Sunday morning in the same area.",
      "The sheriff said the mother made her teenage children do tasks in the water and told them to pray for Marcus and Vincen Miller because they \"had gone to Heaven.\"",
      "Witnesses told deputies that before the golf cart crash, they saw the woman and teenage children huddled together and praying next to the water, Campbell told reporters.",
      "\"It actually scared some witnesses,\" he said. \"They thought they were crying they were emotional, and they didn't know what was going on.\"",
      "According to the sheriff, the mother said that the teenage children had passed their tests, but she heard a voice telling her to put them all in the golf cart and drive into the lake.",
      "The teenage children are now in the care of their families.",
      "Authorities said the Miller family, who are Amish and live in Holmes County, was at the lake for a weekend trip. They are members of the Old Order Amish Church.",

And so, that effervescence has come through on this record, and like, as you said, bangers.\"",

But they fell short of winning driver\u2019s championships, running headlong into two all-time greats in Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen as teammates.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Tuesday that three Democrat-led states must enforce English language proficiency requirements for commercial drivers or face federal funding cuts.",
      "Duffy singled out California, Washington and New Mexico, saying they had 30 days to comply before seeing their funds from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program cut off. That money aims to help state and local law enforcement agencies improve commercial vehicle safety.",
      "The administration's move comes on the heels of a deadly Florida crash that conservatives have pointed to in their criticism of policies that they say allowed migrants to enter the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"States don\u2019t get to pick and choose which federal safety rules to follow,\" Duffy said in a press release detailing the announcement. \"As we saw with the horrific Florida crash that killed three, when states fail to enforce the law, they put the driving public in danger.\"",
      "NBC News has reached out to the offices of the governors of California, Washington and New Mexico for comment.",
      "Duffy's statement referred to a fatal crash that authorities say was caused by a migrant who was in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The U.S. Marshals Service announced earlier this month the arrest of Harjinder Singh, who was allegedly driving a semi-truck pulling a trailer that crashed into a vehicle, killing three people.",

      "Singh had obtained his commercial driver's license in California, according to the U.S. Marshals Service.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Tuesday, Duffy laid blame on all three states for the deadly crash, which took place in Florida, criticizing Singh's receiving a license, pointing to him allegedly being pulled over in July for speeding, and criticizing New Mexico law enforcement for not taking \"his rig out of service.\"",

    "story": [
      "It has become an all-too-familiar scene: first responders, medics and journalists rushing to the site of an Israeli attack. But this time, as they rallied to a shattered stairwell at Nasser Hospital bearing stretchers and cameras, Israel struck again \u2014 compounding the scene of carnage and enveloping those attempting to aid and document.",
      "Global outcry mounted Tuesday over this \u201cdouble tap\u201d strike on Gaza\u2019s largest remaining medical center, which was caught on video by the Arabic language channel Al Ghad TV and others who were filming rescue efforts from the first missile when the second struck.",
      "At least 20 people were killed, including five journalists who had worked for various outlets, including The Associated Press, Reuters and Al Jazeera.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said that the strikes Monday were a \u201ctragic mishap\u201d and that the military was investigating. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres  demanded an independent inquiry into the Israeli strike,  while President Donald Trump said he was \u201cnot happy about it.\u201d",
      "Israel has barred Western news organizations from entering Gaza, save for occasional tours chaperoned by the Israel Defense Forces, leaving them to rely on Palestinian journalists inside the enclave. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based nonprofit press freedom group, says that 192 journalists have been killed during the war, and another 90 detained in what it describes as \u201cthe most horrific attacks the press has ever faced in recent history.\u201d",
      "What is a double tap strike?",
      "This is not the first time Israel has conducted a \u201cdouble tap\u201d strike, hitting the same target twice in quick succession.",
      "Double-taps have been deployed deliberately in the past by terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and Nigeria\u2019s Boko Haram, which would send a second suicide bomber to kill those attempting to help  victims of the first.",
      "The phrase \u201cdouble tap\u201d is not an official legal term and does not appear in the Geneva Convention, but intentionally striking people known to be \u201cprotected persons,\u201d such as medics, \u201cimplies the allegation of a war crime,\u201d according to Janina Dill, a professor at the University of Oxford, in England, and co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict.",
      "\u201cThe tactic of double-tap strikes is irreconcilable with the conduct of a professional, legally advised and trained military force,\u201d Dill told NBC News, and no such \u201cfighting force should be reasonably accusable of double-tap strikes.\u201d",
      "The \u201clarger moral issue,\u201d she said in an email, was that it was \u201cparticularly pernicious to exploit individuals\u2019 willingness of discharging their moral duties of rescue (helping those affected by the first strike) in order to kill them.\u201d She added that \u201cdouble-tap strikes therefore do not only imply that a war crime is committed, but the tactic should also be reviled and morally condemned.\u201d",
      "Few if any militaries admit to using double-tap strikes as an overt tactic, and Israel is not the only country alleged to have done so. In 2012, the Bureau for Investigative Journalism found that from 2009 to 2012, CIA drone strikes in Pakistan killed at least 50 civilians \u201cin follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims.\u201d",
      "Last month, the left-leaning Israeli publication +972 Magazine published an investigation, including interviews with Israeli security sources, that found double-tap strikes had become \u201cstandard procedure in Gaza\u201d during the war.",
      "In a statement on X, the IDF said that an initial inquiry found that troops had identified a camera at the the hospital \"that was being used to observe the activity of IDF troops, in order to direct terrorist activities against them.\" It added that \"troops operated to remove the threat by striking and dismantling the camera.\"",
      "The statement did not address the second strike on the facility.",
      "\u2018Clouded with dust\u2019",
      "Israel\u2019s Haaretz Newspaper reported that in the attack on Monday, an IDF tank fired at what troops suspected was a Hamas surveillance camera on the roof of the hospital and followed with another to ensure it was hit.",
      "The first strike, just after 10 a.m. local time (3 a.m. ET), hit the upper floors of Nasser Hospital, where doctors, patients and trainees were in the operating department, according to the hospital\u2019s director, Mohammed Zakout.",
      "At the time, a number of journalists were climbing the stairs, as they often did, to get a signal to file their reports and contact their families, according to witnesses. Killed in that initial strike was Reuters cameraman Hussam Al-Masri, who the news agency said was operating a live TV shot on the hospital\u2019s upper floors at the time.",
      "Hatem Omar, 42, was one of the journalists who then rushed to the scene. \u201cI climbed the staircase; a large number of journalists and medics were with me on the stairs,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThen the second strike happened.\u201d",
      "According to Ibrahim al Qanan, who was live on Al Ghad TV when it recorded the second strike, timestamps on the video showed that there was 7 minutes between explosions. Responders waited a few minutes after the first hit before racing up the stairs, he said, only to be caught in the second blast.",
      "The video showed eight men on an external stairwell, three wearing orange high-visibility vests, one  a yellow helmet and one carrying a camera. A few of them were gesturing to someone off-camera when the image filled with smoke and debris accompanied by a loud bang and screams. Dozens of people then began running from the scene, now bathed in smoke.",

      "It\u2019s that time of year again. For many it\u2019s not the crisp air, colorful foliage or even the autumnal equinox itself that signals the change of seasons. Instead, it\u2019s the warm, spiced comfort that comes with that first sip of a pumpkin spice latte.",
      "Starbucks created its iconic version of the drink in 2003, sparking a global cultural phenomenon. And now Starbucks and coffee chains like Dunkin\u2019 and Peet\u2019s are rolling out their full fall menus, some with pumpkin spice lattes at the top of the list. Others are offering new flavors expected to generate buzz.",
      "But with that excitement brewing, this year feels different. Festive drinks are arriving as the cost of coffee climbs higher, with climate change and President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs expected to take a real toll.",
      "Americans are watching prices closely after the U.S. slapped a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods this month. Brazil, the largest U.S. supplier of green coffee beans, accounts for about a third of the country\u2019s total supply, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Coffee prices surged 14.5% in July year over year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average retail price for a pound of ground coffee hit $8.41. The most active contract for Arabica coffee on the Intercontinental Exchange reached $3.84 per pound, the highest it\u2019s been since May when it hit $3.90 per pound.",
      "Starbucks\u2019 pumpkin spice latte hit menus on Tuesday. The price of the company\u2019s fall beverages have not gone up since last year, according to a spokesperson. However, it\u2019s no secret that fans can easily rack up a hefty bill by leaning into this autumn trend. A grande pumpkin spice latte could cost $5.75 to $7.25, depending on the Starbucks location.",
      "Other Starbucks offerings this season include the pumpkin cream cold brew, iced pumpkin cream chai, pecan crunch oatmilk latte, the new pecan oatmilk cortado and pecan cold foam. Cold foam has become one of the coffee giant\u2019s most popular modifiers, which grew 23% year over year, according to Starbucks.",
      "Dunkin\u2019 is also tapping into nostalgia this time of year, introducing a cereal n\u2019 milk latte along with the return of its popular pumpkin spice signature latte. Grammy award-winning singer Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s Daydream Refresher lineup also expands with more flavors this fall.",
      "In addition to Peet\u2019s Coffee\u2019s pumpkin latte, the coffee chain has an extensive fall menu including an iced vanilla latte with popping pearls, cardamom citrus cold brew oat latte and a pumpkin chai latte. Prices for these drinks for a small range from roughly $5.75 to $6.75. (Peet\u2019s parent company on Monday said it agreed to be purchased by Keurig Dr Pepper.)",
      "With uncertainty in the economy, \u201ctreatonomics,\u201d or \u201clittle treat culture\u201d trend, has taken off with consumers buying themselves a small treat that\u2019s easier to afford, rather than a large purchase such as a home or couch. Studies show these pick-me-ups can cause our brains to release \u201chappy hormones\u201d such as dopamine, serotonin and endorphins.",

      "The good news \u2014 there are certainly tips and tricks to get your fall pumpkin spice fix without breaking the bank. Here\u2019s how:",
      "Budget. How much do you want to spend on your seasonal obsession? Make a decision and stick to it. Limit yourself to a couple of splurges a month.",
      "Buy premade. Go to your grocery store and buy your fall favorite ready-to-go. The suggested retail price for a 40-ounce bottle of Starbucks\u2019 iced espresso pumpkin spice latte is $6.99. That\u2019s roughly three grande lattes. A 32-ounce bottle of the pumpkin spice cold brew concentrate is suggested at $11.99 to $13.99, and $4.19 for a 13.7-ounce pumpkin spice Frappuccino.",
      "Make it at home. Starbucks\u2019 pumpkin spice ground coffee\u2019s suggested retail price is $11.99 to $13.99 for 10 ounces. A box of 10 K-Cup pods is $10.49 to $12.49, and an eight-count of coffee capsules for Nespresso Vertuo machines costs $11.98. Starbucks\u2019 pumpkin spice latte-inspired creamer and the maple pecan latte-inspired creamer are all suggested to cost $5.99. At Dunkin\u2019 the suggested retail price for 11 ounces of pumpkin spice ground coffee is $7.90 and for K-Cups $9.14. Pumpkin Munchkin creamer is $5.69, pumpkin spice cold brew coffee concentrate is $8.69, and a four pack of the spiked pumpkin spice latte, which contains alcohol, is $4.99.",
      "Create your own version. Still a little high for your budget? Buy the ingredients behind the pumpkin spice latte to whip up your own version. Each has its own flavor but some suggestions include espresso, milk or creamer, pumpkin puree, vanilla extract, a sweetener (sugar or maple syrup) and spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger. If you\u2019re really feeling fancy, top it off with whipped cream and a dusting of pumpkin pie spice.",
      "Rewards. When you are treating yourself and heading into coffee shops, make sure you\u2019re getting the most bang for your buck. Sign up for loyalty programs to get discounts, offers and other rewards such as birthday gifts. It also might be a good idea to sign up for notifications for sales and discounts so you don\u2019t let a good deal pass you by.",

      "A federal-state partnership that monitors for foodborne illnesses quietly scaled back its operations nearly two months ago.",
      "As of July 1, the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) program has reduced surveillance to just two pathogens: salmonella and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told NBC News.",
      "Before July, the program had been tracking infections caused by six additional pathogens: campylobacter, cyclospora, listeria, shigella, vibrio and Yersinia. Some of them can lead to severe or life-threatening illnesses, particularly for newborns and people who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems.",
      "Monitoring for the six pathogens is no longer required for the 10 states that participate in the program, though those states aren\u2019t precluded from conducting surveillance on their own.",
      "Food safety experts worry that the move, which hasn\u2019t previously been made public, could make it harder for public health officials to notice whether certain foodborne illnesses are rising and then slow response time to outbreaks.",
      "FoodNet is a collaboration among the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the Agriculture Department and 10 state health departments. Its surveillance area covers roughly 54 million people, or 16% of the U.S. population. The network includes Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee and select counties in California and New York.",
      "\u201cAlthough FoodNet will narrow its focus to Salmonella and STEC, it will maintain both its infrastructure and the quality it has come to represent,\u201d the CDC spokesperson wrote. \u201cNarrowing FoodNet\u2019s reporting requirements and associated activities will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities.\u201d",
      "A list of talking points the CDC provided to the Connecticut Public Health Department, viewed by NBC News, cites a reason for the change: \u201cFunding has not kept pace with the resources required to maintain the continuation of FoodNet surveillance for all eight pathogens.\u201d",
      "The CDC spokesperson said Monday that other systems conduct national surveillance for the six pathogens that were removed from FoodNet. For instance, state health departments are still able to report cases through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. And the CDC\u2019s Listeria Initiative collects reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis \u2014 serious infections from eating food contaminated with listeria.",
      "But FoodNet is the only surveillance system that actively looks for multiple foodborne diseases at the federal level, according to food safety experts. Other federal surveillance systems are passive, meaning the CDC relies on state health departments to notify it of cases.",
      "Experts worry that without active surveillance of all eight pathogens, public health officials won\u2019t be able to adequately compare trends over time or notice whether cases of a particular illness start rising. Experts also worry that scaling back FoodNet\u2019s operations could make it harder to quickly identify and respond to outbreaks.",
      "Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University, called the decision to reduce FoodNet surveillance \u201cvery disappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of the work that I and many, many, many, many other people have put into improving food safety over the past 20 or 30 years is just going away,\u201d she said. Kowalcyk\u2019s son died in 2001 of complications from a foodborne E. coli infection, and since then she has advocated for improvements to U.S. food safety policy.",
      "Kowalcyk said that the federal budget for food safety hasn\u2019t kept up with the cost of inflation and that cuts to federal funding for state health departments have most likely made it harder to maintain FoodNet surveillance. The CDC requested a $72 million budget for food safety for the 2026 fiscal year, about the same as it has requested in years past.",
      "It\u2019s not entirely clear how the changes to FoodNet are affecting surveillance on the state level so far.",
      "The Oregon and Connecticut health departments said they were aware of the changes as of Monday. Meanwhile, the Georgia Public Health Department said Friday that it hadn\u2019t received any official notice from the CDC. And the New Mexico Health Department said it was awaiting notification from the CDC to determine the scope of its future surveillance.",
      "The Maryland Health Department said the state\u2019s health care providers and clinical laboratories are required to report cases of all eight pathogens monitored by FoodNet, so the reporting will continue \u201cregardless of changes to the FoodNet network.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said it will need to scale back active surveillance activities for some pathogens if funding is decreased in 2026."

      "\"KPop Demon Hunters,\" an animated Netflix movie about a girl group who slays audiences onstage and demons offstage, is packed with songs so infectious that even dads are powerless to resist.",
      "\u201cThis movie is the perfect combo of nostalgia, earworms and never-ending streaming. So we\u2019re screwed,\u201d father, singer and comedian Chris Mann jokes with TODAY.com.",
      "On Aug. 4, Mann posted a TikTok illustrating his growing obsession with the movie. Featuring the song \u201cGolden,\u201d the video has been viewed about 10 million times. It shows Mann going from mild interest on first watch to dramatically singing into a sword on his 10th watch.",
      "\"This is the pop culture moment of the year,\" he says. \"It has broken the internet.\"",
      "The movie has even infiltrated TODAY host Craig Melvin\u2019s household.",
      "\u201cWe watched it this weekend,\u201d joked Craig on Aug. 25. \u201cThe singalong version? They\u2019re not even giving us a chance now.\u201d",
      "The movie may have been initially available only on Netflix, but over the weekend it transferred to physical movie theaters, where it made about $20 million. Six songs from the movie\u2019s soundtrack have taken over Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart, with two rising into the top 10 slots, according to Billboard\u2019s website. On Aug. 25, Netflix released a special sing-along edition on its streaming platform.",
      "The fervor doesn't seem to be slowing down.",
      "Mann had been watching the movie on repeat at home with his kids, but he still forked over the money to watch it in the theater with them this weekend.",
      "\"Everybody went. The whole school went,\" he explains. \"It's almost like the school version of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, where you don't want to miss out.\"",
      "The movie has similarly been \u201cblowing up\u201d teacher Rob D\u2019Urbano\u2019s parent group chat. \u201cHonestly, none of us mind that it\u2019s on repeat in our houses,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. \u201cI feel like all the dads are enjoying it.\u201d",
      "Alongside a TikTok video of himself watching the movie even after his three young daughters went to bed, he wrote, \u201cI can\u2019t be the only parent that bops to this movie.\u201d",
      "No, sir. You certainly are not.",
      "Influencer Josh Jones made a TikTok video similar to Mann's showing his evolution from skeptic to believer. He added costumes, wigs and a dance routine to really show his dedication to the film.",
      "For Jones, it's the \"message behind the movie\" that really resonates.",
      "\"There's this really positive message here, where it perfectly portrays the battle between good and evil,\" he says. In fact, he allows the kids to watch the movie on Sunday, a day that he and his wife normally reserve for \"religious\" movies. He says, \"It's complimented our spiritual journey as a family very nicely.\"",
      "As the father of one son and five daughters \u2014 with another daughter on the way \u2014 Jones also appreciates the \"girl power\" theme of the movie. \"Having all of these daughters, that's something that I just really want to support,\" he shares.",
      "The phenomenon isn\u2019t limited to girl dads.",
      "Mann's two sons also love the movie. His 4-year-old sings \"Soda Pop\" and his 8-year-old is trying to teach himself to play the song on the piano by ear. Mann, an actor who played the title role in the the Broadway tour of \"Phantom of the Opera\" for 700 performances, does a mean version of \"Golden.\"",
      "\u201cSomething about these competing boy and girl groups is super nostalgic for millennial parents,\" Mann says. \"We get to relive this fandom all over again through our kids. It\u2019s like our boy band DNA meeting parenting reality.\u201d",
      "Mann adds, \"This Halloween, it's going to be only 'KPop Demon Hunters.' I wish I had stock in this movie.\""

      "\u201cGoing back to my Alberta roots with 15 of my besties was exactly what my soul needed,\u201d Harris wrote in her caption.",
      "\u201cWe made so many unforgettable memories,\" she added. \"From the yummiest food, to morning pilates and canoeing on the lake, dancing to country music, singing, belly laughing, and stories we\u2019ll be telling for years.\u201d"

      "\u201cI\u2019m also a bad actress and a bad liar \u2014 I think people would be able to catch on quickly,\u201d Amaya chimed in. \u201cI\u2019m like, I need Botox after this, he makes me smile this much.\u201d",

      "The rumors began swirling when Bryan was allegedly spotted  with another woman at a nightclub just days after the couple left the villa together.",
      "At the time, the pair seemed to shut down the chatter with a romantic TikTok posted to Bryan\u2019s account. \u201cWhen everyone thinks you\u2019re over meanwhile this is us,\u201d read the caption, accompanying footage of the couple gazing into each other\u2019s eyes before Amaya leaped into Bryan\u2019s arms.",
      "Based on the reunion trailer, Bryan will address the rumors. Here's what to know.",
      "What happened between Amaya and Bryan on \u2018Love Island USA\u2019?",
      "Amaya\u2019s journey to find love in Fiji was far from straightforward.",
      "Entering the villa as a bombshell on Episode 4 alongside Hannah Fields, Amaya originally coupled up with Ace Greene.",
      "While there seemed to be a spark between the pair at first, Ace quickly switched up on Amaya, citing her usage of nicknames (particularly \u201cbabe\u201d) and physical touch as too much, too soon.",
      "From there, Amaya found more connections and obstacles. She coupled up with Austin Shepard on Episode 14, but he, like Ace, began to distance himself from Amaya.",
      "The couple split up when Casa Amor happened on Episode 19, leaving them both single and open to exploring new connections.",
      "Bryan came into the show as a bombshell in Casa Amor, the biggest relationship test of every \u201cLove Island\u201d season. This is where either the men or the women from the main villa are secretly whisked away to a second villa nearby, where they get to meet a group of other singles hoping to find love in Fiji.",
      "In Casa Amor, Bryan quickly hit it off with Andreina. Amaya, meanwhile, was striking up a connection with Zak Srakaew, who also came into the show during Casa Amor. They ultimately coupled up and remained a couple as they went back to the main villa.",
      "However, Zak blindsided Amaya during the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge and gang up on her alongside Austin and Ace, which led to Amaya exploring new connections and hitting it off with Bryan.",
      "Wait, what happened during the \u2018Stand on Business\u2019 challenge?",
      "During the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge in Episode 26, Amaya was confronted by all three men she had previously been coupled up with: Ace, Austin and Zak.",
      "As Amaya stood in front of her peers, she read cards that had been written about her \u2014 specifically about her emotions and how she expressed herself in her relationships.",
      "\u201cYou cry more than needed. You try to move to fast for everyone,\u201d Austin wrote on a card that Amaya had to read in front of the entire villa.",
      "\u201cGod forbid I\u2019m a sensitive gangsta,\u201d Amaya replied (a phrase that became one of her signature one-liners).",
      "\u201cI would just have to say that many people could view this as a weakness, but to me personally, after everything I\u2019ve been through in my life, I view it as a strength,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo if you guys view it like that, then guess what. I\u2019m just not your cup of tea to be drinking, so don\u2019t f------ drink it.\u201d",
      "Austin admitted to writing the card, explaining that after they initially coupled up, \u201cthe intensity of your emotions and feelings and wants just felt like they built way up.\u201d",
      "Ace and Zak decided to join Austin and gang up on Amaya in front of everyone. But what could have been Amaya\u2019s lowest point in the villa actually became a silver lining, as this is where her and Bryan\u2019s story began.",
      "\u201cOne thing I got to add though,\u201d Bryan interjected that night. \u201cComing from a Hispanic household, calling someone \u2018Babe,\u2019 \u2018Mi amor,\u2019 \u2018Mi vida,\u2019 that\u2019s just how we talk. You\u2019re telling her meet you halfway, you got to meet her halfway, too.\u201d",

      "The pair coupled up on Episode 30, and America eventually voted to send them to the Season 7 finale. Viewers got to see their final date and declarations of love, the loving speeches all the final couples give to one another right before the winners are announced.",
      "During their first and final date, Amaya expressed her appreciation for Bryan, especially for how he spoke on her behalf during the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge.",
      "\u201cBabe, you don\u2019t understand how much it meant, that moment, like of you standing up for me in the Stand on Business,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou know, like, if my light is too bright for somebody, wear sunglasses or something.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut with you, you looked right into the sun, you know?\u201d she continued.",

I definitely wanted to leave here letting you know that I want to make stuff exclusive with us and prioritize us. I want to continue taking the right steps with you and attacking the outside world with you.\u201d",
      "Are Amaya and Bryan still together now?",

      "But their decision to unfollow each other on Instagram signals serious trouble in paradise.",
      "Adding to the breakup speculation, Amaya reposted a cryptic TikTok video the same day fans noticed the social media snub.",
      "The video says, \"How it feels when you know you have to leave him alone,\" over pictures of  girls crying, alone, or looking forlornly. The caption features a few hashtags, including \"#ex,\" \"#sad,\" and \"#imissyou.\""

    "link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/love-island-mental-health-effects-psychologist-rcna220785",
    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 13:58:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Expert reveals how Love Island's isolated environment affects contestants' mental health, decision-making, and relationships through psychological manipulation.",
    "story": [
      "Joining \"Love Island\" may seem like the ultimate dream gig \u2014 a trip to Fiji where you bask in the sun all day surrounded by attractive singles, playing what amounts to glorified frat party games with no real-world distractions. Just you, your best bathing suits, and endless tropical sunshine.",
      "But behind this Instagram-perfect facade is a intense psychological experiment.",
      "The hit reality dating show strips participants of modern life's most basic comforts \u2014 no personal phones, no clocks, little privacy \u2014 creating conditions that could fundamentally alter how they think, feel and form relationships.",
      "TODAY.com spoke with Beverley Andre, a licensed psychologist, about how the villa's unique environment could affect contestants' minds and decision-making processes, and why the show has mental health care professionals on set.",
      "Her insights reveal why \"Love Island USA\" relationships can appear and feel so intense in the moment, yet may struggle to survive in the real world.",
      "When Time Stands Still",
      "Perhaps the most disorienting aspect of villa life is the complete absence of time cues. Without clocks or calendars, contestants lose all sense of how long they've actually known each other.",
      "\"When time is distorted, your day can feel like a week,\" Andre says. \"So you're thinking that you have this really deep bond with this person, but it's only been like one day or two days.\"",
      "This temporal confusion accelerates emotional investment in ways that can seem almost comical to viewers. Remember when contestants declare they\u2019re \u201cready to be locked in\u201d after just 48 hours? That\u2019s not just reality TV drama \u2014 it\u2019s psychology in action.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no indication, no cues for you to remember, \u2018You guys just got here. This is brand new,\u2019\u201d Andre says.",
      "The result? Some decisions can be driven more by proximity rather than compatibility.",
      "While \"Love Island's\" relatively tech-free environment might sound like a wellness retreat, it brings both benefits and challenges for contestants.",
      "On the positive side, the absence of digital transactions allows for unprecedented focus.",
      "\"When you aren't surrounded by so much noise, you're able to center in and really focus on your own thoughts,\" Andre says.",
      "Forced introspection can lead to genuine self-discovery and deeper connections.",
      "However, the isolation comes with a major downside: Contestants lose access to established neutral parties. Without the outside perspectives people in the real world often engage with when dating, contestants can become trapped in their own biases and misconceptions.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have neutral sounding boards because technically, the other people there are your competitors,\u201d Andre explains.",
      "When Romance Meets Competition",
      "The villa's unique blend of romantic pursuit and competition creates what Andre calls a \"pressure pot effect.\" Contestants aren't just looking for love, they're fighting for public votes and a cash prize, which fundamentally changes relationship dynamics.",
      "\u201c'How can you gain the fastest connection possible?' becomes the driving question, rather than, 'Is this person right for me?'\u201d Andre says.",
      "The format of the show \u2014\u00a0and the $100,000 cash prize at the end \u2014 can lead people to pursue a relationship for the sake of appearing to be in a strong connection, as opposed to laying the groundwork for a relationship.",
      "(The show aims to \"test\" these motives at the end by forcing one member of the winning couple to decide whether they split the prize money or keep it for themselves, with the goal of proving whether or not they were in the villa for love.)",
      "The constant questioning of motives adds another layer of complexity. As Andre points out, both contestants and viewers, may wonder: \u201cAre you really digging me, or do you just want us to win and look cute?\u201d",
      "Living Under Surveillance",
      "Sharing one bedroom and one bathroom with a house full of strangers, all while being filmed 24/7, would create unprecedented challenges for emotional regulation, Andre says.",
      "\"When you have a hard day at work, sometimes you just need space and time to process without having witnesses,\u201d Andre says. \u201cBut then you can\u2019t, because you have eyes all around you.\u201d",
      "The lack of privacy doesn't just affect comfort. It can actively shape behavior. Contestants must constantly consider how their actions will be perceived by both their fellow Islanders and the viewing public. The result can be emotional shutdown rather than emotional regulation.",
      "For contestants from marginalized groups, this scrutiny carries additional weight. Black women on the show face particular pressure around public perception, which can affect everything from their romantic choices to their physical expressions of affection, Andre says.",
      "\u201cBlack women can\u2019t go on this show and sleep with any of these people or any of these men, because of the public perception around Black women and being overly sexualized,\u201d Andre says.",
      "She cites contestants Olandria Carthen and Chelley Bissainthe, who appeared on Keke Palmer's podcast, \"Baby, This is Keke Palmer,\" on July 22 and spoke to this perception.",
      "During the episode, Palmer asked the former Islanders how often they feel they had to \"tone down\" their emotions and reactions to events in the villa as Black women.",
      "\"It's taken out of context, and I'm a bad guy and I'm a mean girl,\" Olandria responded. \"It\u2019s very exhausting to say the least. I truly feel like initially I had to tone down a lot to not cross over that boundary because a person that looks the opposite of us, as soon as they get emotional it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to cater to this person.\u2019 It\u2019s like bro, what about us? I don\u2019t understand.\"",
      "The 'Challenges'",
      "While \"Love Island\" occasionally includes what Andre calls \"wholesome activities\" that can mirror real relationship milestones, such as family day, some viewers are here for prime reality TV drama. Enter: the challenges.",
      "While many feature elaborate props, costumes and kissing, some can expose interpersonal rifts. For example, the \"Stand on Business\" challenge encouraged contestants to anonymously call out other Islanders, while \u201cHate to Burst Your Bubble\" involved Islanders sorting each other in categories like \"most genuine,\" before revealing how viewers at home ranked them.",
      "Andre says while these challenges are entertaining for the viewer, they can cause emotional harm to the islanders participating in them. She uses Season 7's infamous Heart Rate challenge, which involves Islanders dressing in costume and acting out to try and raise their fellow contestants' heart rates the most, as an example.",
      "\"These situations \u2014 do they really have the time to process?\" Andre says. \"Granted, they\u2019re with each other 24 hours a day, but do they have the capacity and the space to process?\"",
      "The Heart Rate challenge led to a feud between Huda Mustafa and Chelley, after several people in the villa thought Huda went too far while dancing with Ace, the other half of Chelley's couple.",
      "\"'Wow, we just had this experience, and I\u2019m in this relationship, but there are some things that happened in that challenge that made me feel, you know, really jealous, or I felt very humiliated,'\" Andre explains of how Islanders may process these situations. \"'You\u2019re saying that you\u2019re really feeling me, or you love me, but then someone else was kissing up on you, and I don\u2019t know how to react to that, right?'\"",
      "Reality Check: Transitioning Back to the Real World",
      "Perhaps the most significant psychological challenge may come after the cameras stop rolling, when contestants must process an intense, highly controlled experience while navigating new relationships under public scrutiny.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re still processing the whole experience,\u201d Andre says.",
      "The villa\u2019s emotional intensity, combined with challenges that may have triggered feelings of jealousy or humiliation, would require serious psychological work to unpack.",
      "Add in the pressures of newfound fame, social media attention and public investment in their relationships, and it\u2019s no wonder \"Love Island\" couples can struggle post-villa.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re really down for the cause and down for the relationship, I would imagine they\u2019re in therapy,\u201d Andre says."

    "story": [
      "\"The Hunting Wives\" is now a Netflix phenomenon, a star-studded series about southern housewives behaving badly \u2014\u00a0and they're packing more than booze and gossip.",
      "But it all began with a story author May Cobb's mother told her once, while they were driving down the blacktop roads of Longview, her Texas hometown. Cobb's eventual 2021 novel, \"The Hunting Wives,\" went on to inspire the series, first produced for Starz.",
      "\"My mom is such a good storyteller. She started telling me how in high school some of the rich boys would invite her to something called 'the hunting party,'\" Cobb says, speaking to TODAY.com. \"Basically, they would go out to the roofs of their giant cars and try to shoot small game.\"",
      "Cobb, hearing the story, immediately thought of everything that could go wrong with the scenario, and there was a lot. Then it clicked: She wanted to write a novel about it.",
      "\"But I want to swap out the rich boys for women. I want to subvert to 'Texas boys club' and let the women behave badly for a change,\" she remembers thinking.",
      "It's the story of Sophie (Brittany Snow in the series), a Texas transplant who becomes enmeshed in a dynamic friend group in her new town. When a teenage girl winds up dead, they're implicated, although the ending in Cobb's novel is different.",
      "Cobb set the story in a town like the one she grew up in, two hours east of Dallas, in a part of Texas close to the Louisiana border. She describes it as \"eerily beautiful noir,\" a place where Spanish moss hangs from trees and everyone knows everyone's name and history.",
      "She calls the character of Margo, portrayed by Malin \u00c5kerman in the show, a risk-taking and boundary-pushing woman whom Sophie befriends, an \"archetypal east Texas woman\" in the book, but also in the show.",
      "\"It's a party town. The people from my town are high-spirited and fun. I remember one of my editor's notes was, 'Do people drink this much?' And I said, 'I actually toned it down,'\" she says, laughing.",
      "She wanted the book to feel like a \"train wreck\" and a \"downward spiral.\" She was writing when her son was a little kid, and since she was no longer going out for ladies' nights, put the feeling of nights out in the book.",
      "\"I think I went a little too far, but it was so much fun to, like, skew that moral compass and not have to worry about it at all,\" she says.",

      "But Drake has had a longstanding history with the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, receiving five Grammys and 55 nominations over the years. He also served as both performer and presenter prior to his critiques.",
      "The \u201cFamily Matters\u201d rapper\u2019s criticism of the Grammys began in 2017, when his hit \u201cHotline Bling\u201d won best rap song and best rap/sung performance. Drake slammed the Grammys for categorizing the song as rap, as opposed to pop.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a Black artist, I\u2019m apparently a rapper, even though \u2018Hotline Bling\u2019 is not a rap song,\u201d Drake said during in an interview with U.K. DJ Semtex. \u201cThe only category that they can manage to fit me in is in a rap category, maybe because I\u2019ve rapped in the past or because I\u2019m black. I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d",
      "In 2019, the last time Drake attended the Grammys, he accepted the award for best rap song for \u201cGod\u2019s Plan\u201d and gave a pointed acceptance speech about how he and the other artists there that night \u201cplay in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport.\u201d",
      "After his album \u201cCertified Lover Boy\u201d was nominated in 2022 for best rap album and his single \u201cWay 2 Sexy\u201d was nominated for best rap performance, Drake asked the Recording Academy to remove his work from the nominations. The Academy honored Drake\u2019s request and the rapper didn\u2019t attend the awards show.",
      "In 2023, although Drake refused to submit his 2022 album, \u201cHonestly, Nevermind,\u201d or any of its songs for consideration by the Grammys, he received four nominations. Once again, however, Drake boycotted the awards show.",
      "In 2024, Drake received four Grammy nominations for his joint 2022 album with 21 Savage, \u201cHer Loss.\u201d Per the Grammys, Drake \u201csubmitted material for nomination for the 2024 GRAMMYs,\u201d but the rapper, who did not attend that year, ultimately did not take home an award.",

      "After his his \u201cBlinding Lights\u201d and \u201cAfter Hours\u201d were snubbed from nominations at the 2021 ceremony, The Weeknd announced he would not submit his work to Recording Academy.",
      "He told The New York Times at the time that he will \u201cno longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys\u201d due to \u201csecret committees\u201d involved in the nomination process.",
      "From 2022 to 2024, the singer boycotted the award show, until an unexpected return this past year, when the Weeknd sang \u201cCry For Me\u201d and \u201cTimeless\u201d with Playboi Carti from his new album, \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Irish singer-songwriter and activist Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor first performed at the Grammys in 1989, just two years before writing an open letter to the Recording Academy, criticizing \u201cfalse and destructive materialistic values.\u201d",

      "Directing her message to both the Academy and the industry at large, O'Connor wrote, per the Los Angeles Times, \u201cThey acknowledge mostly the commercial side of art. They respect mostly material gain, since that is the main reason for their existence. And they have created a great respect among artists for material gain--by honoring us and exalting us when we achieve it, ignoring for the most part those of us who have not.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Connor won the best alternative music performance Grammy in 1991 for her album, \u201cI Do Not Want What I Haven\u2019t Got,\u201d but refused to accept the award, marking the first time in Grammys history that an artist rejected a win.",
      "O\u2019Connor's letter led to waves of artists refusing to attend the awards show.",
      "When best rap performance by a duo or group was not televised at the 1991 Grammys \u2014 following the award show's history of not televising wins in the rap category \u2014 nominee Public Enemy decided to boycott the show and released their own statement, via their label head Russell Simmons, that year.",
      "When Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid accepted the 1991 win for Best Hard Rock Performance, he donned a T-shirt displaying a giant photo of O\u2019Connor.",
      "In 2022, Bruno Mars told Rolling Stone that he and Anderson .Paak, who together make up R&B duo Silk Sonic, withdrew their album, \u201cAn Evening with Silk Sonic\u201d from Grammys consideration.",
      "\u201cWe truly put our all on this record, but Silk Sonic would like to gracefully, humbly and most importantly, sexually, bow out of submitting our album this year,\u201d Mars told the outlet. \u201cWe hope we can celebrate with everyone on a great year of music and partake in the party. Thank you for letting Silk Sonic thrive.\u201d",
      "The two artists did not attend the 2023 ceremony.",
      "Mars has received 33 Grammy nominations and 16 wins. His last win was at this past year\u2019s ceremony in best pop duo/group performance for \u201cDie With a Smile,\u201d his duet with Lady Gaga.",
      "Why Are Artists Removing Themselves From Grammy Consideration?",
      "While some artist have removed their work from future considerations after past snubs, others have took a stronger stance against the Recording Academy.",
      "While Drake has been vocal about his message that a Grammy win \u201cdoesn\u2019t dictate s---- in our world\u201d as an artist, he has also made reference to his frustration with the Grammys in his music. In his 2023 collaboration with J. Cole, \u201cFirst Person Shooter,\u201d Drake boasts, \u201cI told Jimmy Jam I use a Grammy as a door stop.\u201d",
      "When The Weeknd refused to submit his work for Grammys consideration in 2021, he referred to \u201csecret committees\u201d involved in the nomination process when talking to The New York Times.",
      "In O'Connor's 1991 open letter to the Recording Academy, she wrote that they \u201cacknowledge mostly the commercial side of art. They respect mostly material gain, since that is the main reason for their existence.\u201d She added that the industry has \u201ccreated a great respect among artists for material gain--by honoring us and exalting us when we achieve it, ignoring for the most part those of us who have not.\u201d",
      "In response, per the LA Times, former president of the Academy Michael Greene, said they \u201capplaud that Sinead feels so strongly about these issues and believe that her convictions only add to the seriousness of her work,\u201d while suggesting she \u201cmay be misguided.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid that Sinead may not be properly informed about the difference between the overtly commercial aspects of popularity contests as opposed to the Grammys, which are voted on by the creative community.\u201d",
      "In a later interview with LA Times, however, O\u2019Connor said, despite directing the letter to the Academy, she was \u201cnot criticizing the Grammys in particular,\u201d clarifying, \u201cI am criticizing the music industry. I am criticizing my peers . . . artists who are not doing their job.\u201d"

      "In an Aug. 18 Instagram post, the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region in Colorado Springs shared several photos of adoptable cats along with which \u201cSex and the City\u201d character they were most like, and why.",
      "The post was accompanied by a hilarious caption to mark the end of the show\u2019s sequel series, \u201cAnd Just Like That,\u201d which concluded Aug. 14.",
      "\u201cAnd Just Like That has finally come to an end, which means we\u2019ll never again witness Carrie Bradshaw chain-smoking in a tutu while making life-ruining decisions in $500 shoes,\u201d the caption read in part. \u201cTragic. But dry your martini glass tears, because the three orange cats who run this account have graciously taken it upon themselves to entertain you by categorizing our shelter cats as Carries, Mirandas, Charlottes, and Samanthas.\u201d",
      "The Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region boasted that the selections were \u201cscientifically accurate results,\u201d adding, \u201cWe will not be taking questions. You are what you are (and let\u2019s be real, you\u2019re probably a Miranda).\u201d",
      "Despite that, Carrie Bradshaw took home the win with four cats meeting the criteria of New York City\u2019s resident dating columnist-turned novelist.",
      "For orange cat Stevie, it's due to a complete disregard for understanding \u2014 and learning anything about \u2014 money, being the \u201chot party girl despite being deeply weird\u201d and calling her boyfriend at three in the morning to \u201cyell at him about nothing.\u201d",
      "Pop Tart brings \u201cpure unhinged chaos\u201d to the party, while Ashlynn has uncontainable \u201ctruly bizarre energy\u201d and makes \u201cderanged\u201d statements she thinks are \u201cprofound\u201d thoughts. As for Astrid, well, the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region said \u201cno further explanation\u201d was needed.",
      "Penelope, Kitty and Bubba were all deemed Mirandas for their more pragmatic nature.",
      "Case in point, much like Miranda Hobbes, Penelope is \u201cjudgmental, but usually right\u201d and needs a \u201cchill, patient person to balance\u201d her out. Kitty has low tolerance for \u201cstupid people\u201d and may seem like a \u201cgirlboss on the surface\u201d though all she wants is to \u201ccuddle on the couch with takeout,\u201d while Bubba is seeking a partner who is \u201cextremely non-clingy.\u201d",
      "Charlotte York is embodied by Chyna, Midnight and Jericko.",
      "Chyna is the type who \u201cwould dump someone instantly over the wrong china pattern\u201d and doesn\u2019t have a problem \u201cacting helpless\u201d to get more attention. Midnight is a \u201chopeless romantic\u201d (derogatory) who \u201cdesperately need a nice, stable bald man\u201d to keep him grounded. Jericko holds a secret disco obsession and binge-watches Elizabeth Taylor documentaries to get her out of a slump.",
      "Only two cats embodied the elusive essence of Samantha Jones: Fairweather Fred and Purrpuss. Fairweather Fred emanates \u201cmagnetic energy,\u201d can ruin a mimosa at brunch with a shocking statement but is \u201csecretly the kindest and most stable friend.\u201d",
      "Purrpuss has a similar vibe, including the ability to throw a martini at someone and carry on as if nothing happened, lie about his age (but get away with it) and is \u201ctoo cool for most people\u201d while letting them know it.",
      "In the comments section, Instagram users reveled in the silly post, with another rescue writing, \u201chow do you even come up with these ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cBig, big (no, not *that* \u201cBig\u201d) kudos to the copywriter\u2026 who is SLAYING,\u201d another Instagram user wrote.",
      "Another user wrote, \u201cHeavy on the JUDGEMENTAL BUT USUALLY RIGHT.\u201d",
      "And when one user commented, \u201cHot take: all cats are Mirandas \u2014 always providing side-eye,\u201d the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region had the perfect comeback.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know about that,\u201d the response read. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of Carries that are not aware enough of their surroundings to give side eye.\u201d"

      "By the time Ryder starred alongside Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo and Ethan Hawke in the 1994 cult movie \"Reality Bites,\" her edgy looks \u2014 a vintage thrift store dress with chunky shoes one day, an Armani men's suit the next \u2014\u00a0had turned her into a style icon.",
      "The \"Stranger Things\" star, 53, opened up about her style influences in a video interview with Elle UK. Her love of men's suits, she told the publication, was inspired by the kooky 1976 kids' gangster flick \"Bugsy Malone.\"",
      "\"Even when I didn't have any money and was in school, we would always shop at the Salvation Army, and I was always picking out, like, the boys' three-piece suits because I wanted to be like the kids in 'Bugsy Malone,'\" recalled Ryder.",
      "Many of Ryder's iconic looks were achieved by accident, she said. That choppy layered \u201cReality Bites\u201d haircut that all the Gen X girls flipped for? Turns out, it was a DIY cut Ryder gave herself.",
      "\"All during the \u201890s I cut my own hair,\u201d said Ryder. \"And I remember being incredibly surprised and flattered that my 'Reality Bites' haircut became (popular), or, you know, girls would go to the (hair salon) and bring that picture in, and I thought that was kind of cool.\u201d",
      "Though the haircut was a hit, Ryder is the first to admit she has no clue how to cut hair properly.",
      "\u201cI mean, I literally just put my head upside down and went like that with the scissors. And I did that for any of my short hair,\u201d she explained.",
      "Despite being singled out for her hip style in the '90s, Ryder said her \"relationship to fashion\" during the era was \"probably not what a lot of people think it was.\"",
      "\"If I went to an event, I would wear a designer. Often I wore a lot of vintage,\" she said. \"I was working really quite a lot in the '90s so I was often just on sets and wearing jeans and a T-shirt.\"",

      "\"I have a T-shirt from every show I've been to, which started very young,\" she shared. \"My dad took me to a lot of the early, like, late '70s, early '80s punk rock (concerts).\"",
      "Ryder said she still has the first concert T-shirt she ever owned, from The Clash's short 1980 tour of the United States. The shirt is so old that it's unwearable, she said, so she keeps it framed.",
      "Looking back, Ryder says her fashion choices in the '90s were all about being true to herself.",
      "\"You know when you're in your 20s, you try to, I don't know, you almost try to do what wasn't trendy. Because a lot of the trends were, I'm sorry, they were awful,\" she said. \"I just wanted to be my own self, and I was also very into recycling and showing people that you can look good and not spend a ton of money.",
      "\"Things are not meant to be worn only once,\" added Ryder. \"That was what always drove me nuts about the events. I remember re-wearing things a lot and apparently that was looked down upon sometimes. I thought it was a great thing.\""

    "summary": "Israel has approved a settlement in the occupied West Bank that would cut the territory in two, and could destroy hopes for a future Palestinian state.",
    "story": [
      "MAALE ADUMIM, West Bank \u2014 The sun-starched strip of sand and brush doesn\u2019t look like much, but if you squint, you can almost glimpse the dreamscape of a future Palestinian capital.",
      "\u201cThese spare lands mean that we can build our parliament, we can build our future institutions,\u201d Khalil Toufakji, a Palestinian expert on geography and settlement expansion, told NBC News earlier this month as he gestured across the controversial \u201cEast 1,\u201d or E1, section of the occupied West Bank.",
      "\u201cIf Israel builds here, it means that everything is finished at the same time,\u201d the 76-year-old expert on Israeli settlements said at an overlook in the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim. \u201cThis means that Jerusalem is surrounded from everywhere. \u2026 It means that there is no Palestinian geographic continuity between the north and south.\u201d",
      "The almost 5 square miles of land may seem undesirable and the conflict around it theoretical, but both Israel and the Palestinians regard the area\u2019s fate with the same sense of urgency.",
      "So when Israeli authorities approved the development of 3,400 homes last week, ultranationalist lawmakers celebrated what they saw as the death knell for a nascent Palestinian state and an acceleration of plans for Israel to annex the whole of the West Bank.",
      "The development \u201cpractically erases the two-state delusion and consolidates the Jewish people\u2019s hold on the heart of the Land of Israel,\u201d Bezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, told a news conference when he announced his approval of the plans.",
      "\u201cNow they declare it clearly and they don\u2019t need to hide it,\u201d said Shawan Jabarin, the general director of Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organization based in the West Bank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need philosophers and intellectuals to analyze. They speak about it themselves: \u2018This is to kill any possibility of a Palestinian state.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since the plan was tabled in the early 1990s, Israeli authorities and Jewish settlers like Smotrich have expounded upon the practical needs for new development as Jerusalem has become too crowded and environmental regulations have forbidden new building in the west of the city, which mostly belongs to Israel.",
      "But Palestinians say the area, which straddles the enormous Maale Adumim Jewish settlement and the Palestinian-majority east Jerusalem, is the only undeveloped land that might host government buildings for a new state.",
      "The construction would also split the West Bank in two, again fracturing an incipient Palestinian state already divided between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where almost 63,000 people have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the enclave\u2019s health ministry. Israel launched its military campaign after the Hamas-led terror attacks that day, which killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage.",
      "After almost 23 months of war, the country has faced mounting criticism about its conduct from traditional Western allies like the U.K., France and Canada, which have recently made conditional offers to recognize a Palestinian state, unless Israel revives talks to achieve that and agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Those countries were among 21 that criticized the E1 development plans as a \u201cviolation of international law\u201d in a statement Friday. \u201cWe condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms,\u201d it read. British Foreign Minister David Lammy also called Tzipi Hotovely, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.K., to raise his objections.",
      "But the recognition of a Palestinian state is seen by some Israeli politicians as rewarding Hamas, leading them to view the E1 proposals as a deliberate broadside against longtime allies whose statements are increasingly drifting away from their country.",
      "\u201cIn the eyes of the right wing of Israeli politics, this is diplomatic pushback,\u201d said David Weinberg, a fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy. \u201cBut it\u2019s diplomatic pushback that\u2019s already on top of what have long been salient reasons, good reasons, for Israel wanting to build on E1.\u201d",
      "But for the Israeli right, the resounding triumph of President Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has drowned out such protests.",
      "\u201cThe E1 plan was initiated three decades ago and it was always blocked due to American pressure,\u201d said Lior Amihai, the executive director of Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy organization. \u201cNow under Trump, they\u2019re approving it. So certainly the lack of American resistance \u2026 enabled the Israeli government to approve it.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment from NBC News about the E1 development.",
      "Upon retaking office, Trump lifted Biden-era sanctions on Israeli settlers who had been implicated in repeated violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "In his first term, he moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognized all of the city as Israel\u2019s capital. Most countries consider east Jerusalem to be occupied territory and do not recognize Israeli sovereignty. Israel, which captured east Jerusalem, including the Old City, from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, deems it as its eternal, indivisible capital.",
      "So far this year, Israel has approved 25,000 settlement housing units in the West Bank, Amihai said, far surpassing the record of 12,000 units during the whole of 2020 \u2014 a massive increase Amihai credited in part to Trump because his administration had created \u201can environment where it\u2019s easier for this government,\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t have to hide anything, they can say it vocally out loud.\u201d",
      "The additional units will accommodate the burgeoning growth of the 700,000 settlers the United Nations estimates already live in the West Bank in settlements widely considered illegal under international law.",
      "Even as the E1 plan slogged through decades of bureaucratic and diplomatic obstacles, Israeli officials prepared the land some of their countrymen refer to as Judea and Samaria, using the biblical term, with a clear intention to develop it.",
      "The Samaria and Judea Police District headquarters relocated there in 2008. Highways and other roadworks connecting Jerusalem and Maale Adumim\u2019s infrastructure to the same largely uninhabited land have also been installed.",
      "Once housing there is finished, Palestinian observers say the area will become closed to their community. Even those simply driving through from the Palestinian provisional capital of Ramallah to the southern West Bank town of Bethlehem will probably have to seek longer routes, they say.",
      "Such detours shouldn\u2019t preclude further agreements between Palestinians and Israelis, Weinberg said, even as he dismissed the notion of a Palestinian state under current circumstances.",
      "\u201cInstead of battering Israel, the West should be advancing realistic space-saving arrangements for Judea and Sumeria,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s need to build on E1 does not need to be a bar to an agreement with a serious Palestinian government.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Faced with a stalling peace push, Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that Russia had made \"significant concessions\" in ending its war in Ukraine.",
      "There is little public evidence, however, that Russian President Vladimir Putin has moved his ambitions an inch since launching his full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "Vance told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that the Kremlin had been \u201cflexible on some of their core demands\u201d \u2014 namely recognizing \u201cthat they are not going to be able to install a puppet regime\u201d in Kyiv, and \u201cthat there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d",
      "That appears at odds with Russian officials, who have spent the days since the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska pushing back on both of these points.",
      "Also on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d was Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who \u2014 while not advocating the installation of a Russian puppet \u2014 made no secret of Moscow\u2019s belief that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is illegitimate.",
      "Russia was open to Ukraine having security guarantees, Lavrov said last week \u2014 but only if the Kremlin can play a role in them, arguably rendering them useless.",
      "\"We cannot agree\" to \"resolve collective security issues without the Russian Federation. This will not work,\" he said at a news conference. \"I am sure that in the West and above all in the United States they understand perfectly well that seriously discussing security issues without the Russian Federation is a utopia, a road to nowhere.\"",
      "Far from being a new and significant concession, Lavrov made clear that the security guarantees should be based on talks held in Istanbul, in 2022.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Russia has made compromises.",
      "Despite Lavrov's trenchant remarks, there may be subtle hints that Putin is ready to do a deal \u2014 and that's without knowing what has gone on behind closed doors.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what was said at Alaska, that\u2019s the problem,\" Mark Galeotti, the British-based director of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence, told NBC News. \"It may well be that what Vance is saying reflects what Putin said there.\u201d",
      "Though Russian officials remain steadfast, Russia\u2019s tightly controlled media have been noticeably less critical of the usually vilified Zelenskyy, he said. And academics close to the Kremlin have suggested there may be some wiggle-room to the Kremlin\u2019s demands."

But this time, as they rallied to a shattered stairwell at Nasser Hospital bearing stretchers and cameras, Israel struck again \u2014 compounding the scene of carnage and enveloping those attempting to aid and document.",
      "Global outcry mounted Tuesday over this \u201cdouble tap\u201d strike on Gaza\u2019s largest remaining medical center, which was caught on video by the Arabic language channel Al Ghad TV and others who were filming rescue efforts from the first missile when the second struck.",
      "At least 20 people were killed, including five journalists who had worked for various outlets, including The Associated Press, Reuters and Al Jazeera.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said that the strikes Monday were a \u201ctragic mishap\u201d and that the military was investigating. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres  demanded an independent inquiry into the Israeli strike,  while President Donald Trump said he was \u201cnot happy about it.\u201d",
      "Israel has barred Western news organizations from entering Gaza, save for occasional tours chaperoned by the Israel Defense Forces, leaving them to rely on Palestinian journalists inside the enclave. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based nonprofit press freedom group, says that 192 journalists have been killed during the war, and another 90 detained in what it describes as \u201cthe most horrific attacks the press has ever faced in recent history.\u201d",
      "What is a double tap strike?",
      "This is not the first time Israel has conducted a \u201cdouble tap\u201d strike, hitting the same target twice in quick succession.",
      "Double-taps have been deployed deliberately in the past by terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and Nigeria\u2019s Boko Haram, which would send a second suicide bomber to kill those attempting to help  victims of the first.",
      "The phrase \u201cdouble tap\u201d is not an official legal term and does not appear in the Geneva Convention, but intentionally striking people known to be \u201cprotected persons,\u201d such as medics, \u201cimplies the allegation of a war crime,\u201d according to Janina Dill, a professor at the University of Oxford, in England, and co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict.",
      "\u201cThe tactic of double-tap strikes is irreconcilable with the conduct of a professional, legally advised and trained military force,\u201d Dill told NBC News, and no such \u201cfighting force should be reasonably accusable of double-tap strikes.\u201d",
      "The \u201clarger moral issue,\u201d she said in an email, was that it was \u201cparticularly pernicious to exploit individuals\u2019 willingness of discharging their moral duties of rescue (helping those affected by the first strike) in order to kill them.\u201d She added that \u201cdouble-tap strikes therefore do not only imply that a war crime is committed, but the tactic should also be reviled and morally condemned.\u201d",
      "Few if any militaries admit to using double-tap strikes as an overt tactic, and Israel is not the only country alleged to have done so. In 2012, the Bureau for Investigative Journalism found that from 2009 to 2012, CIA drone strikes in Pakistan killed at least 50 civilians \u201cin follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims.\u201d",
      "Last month, the left-leaning Israeli publication +972 Magazine published an investigation, including interviews with Israeli security sources, that found double-tap strikes had become \u201cstandard procedure in Gaza\u201d during the war.",
      "In a statement on X, the IDF said that an initial inquiry found that troops had identified a camera at the the hospital \"that was being used to observe the activity of IDF troops, in order to direct terrorist activities against them.\" It added that \"troops operated to remove the threat by striking and dismantling the camera.\"",
      "The statement did not address the second strike on the facility.",
      "\u2018Clouded with dust\u2019",
      "Israel\u2019s Haaretz Newspaper reported that in the attack on Monday, an IDF tank fired at what troops suspected was a Hamas surveillance camera on the roof of the hospital and followed with another to ensure it was hit.",
      "The first strike, just after 10 a.m. local time (3 a.m. ET), hit the upper floors of Nasser Hospital, where doctors, patients and trainees were in the operating department, according to the hospital\u2019s director, Mohammed Zakout.",
      "At the time, a number of journalists were climbing the stairs, as they often did, to get a signal to file their reports and contact their families, according to witnesses. Killed in that initial strike was Reuters cameraman Hussam Al-Masri, who the news agency said was operating a live TV shot on the hospital\u2019s upper floors at the time.",
      "Hatem Omar, 42, was one of the journalists who then rushed to the scene. \u201cI climbed the staircase; a large number of journalists and medics were with me on the stairs,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThen the second strike happened.\u201d",
      "According to Ibrahim al Qanan, who was live on Al Ghad TV when it recorded the second strike, timestamps on the video showed that there was 7 minutes between explosions. Responders waited a few minutes after the first hit before racing up the stairs, he said, only to be caught in the second blast.",
      "The video showed eight men on an external stairwell, three wearing orange high-visibility vests, one  a yellow helmet and one carrying a camera. A few of them were gesturing to someone off-camera when the image filled with smoke and debris accompanied by a loud bang and screams. Dozens of people then began running from the scene, now bathed in smoke.",
      "\u201cI witnessed blood everywhere at the site,\u201d Omar said. \u201cThe staircase outside the hospital was filled with medics, filled with civilians, filled with people rushing to help, and the place was clouded with dust.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe second blast turned the area into a silent, frozen scene, as if the chests of everyone there had been crushed.\u201d",
      "Outside, the fallen journalists \u2014 Hussam Al-Masri, Mariam Dagga, Mohammad Salama, Ahmed Abu Aziz and Moaz Abu Taha \u2014 were laid side-by-side, still adorned with their cameras and blood-spattered vests bearing the word \u201cPRESS.\u201d"

      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia\u2019s domestic spy agency had \u201ccredible intelligence\u201d that Iran was behind two attacks on Jewish sites in Melbourne and Sydney last year, part of a series of what Albanese called \u201cappalling\u201d acts of antisemitism in the country since the Israel-Hamas war began almost two years ago.",
      "\u201cThese were extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil,\u201d Albanese told reporters, adding that it was considered likely that Iran had directed other attacks as well.",

      "The parasite \u2014 the larva of the New World screwworm fly \u2014 can devastate cattle herds and is rife in parts of Central America and Mexico. It can destroy wildlife and even kill household pets.",
      "There were serious outbreaks in the 1980s and the 1990s in Central America, and it was eradicated at great expense, only to return in the last two years.",

      "The sterilized male flies mate with females, but the eggs don't hatch. Eventually, the population reduces and dies out. The technique worked in the 1960s when the United States suffered its last screwworm outbreak.",
      "And the federal government may face calls to accelerate its work: When it was  first announced in June, the sterilization plan wasn't due to be operational for \"two to three years.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbot, commenting on the federal government scheme, said the state agriculture industry, with its 2 million jobs, was worth $867 billion. \"All of this is at risk because of the New World screwworm,\" he said.",

      "The little parasitic flies \u2014 also known as Cochliomyia hominivorax \u2014 have an effect that's vast and devastating but in isolation quite disgusting. The females can lay eggs in any warm-blooded animal, which then hatch, unleashing hundreds of screwworm larvae, so-called because of their sharp mouths and their burrowing being compared to the motion of a screw.",
      "Human infections can be fatal but are rare, and most cases can be treated.",
      "The Agriculture Department has said screwworms have been making their way north into Mexico from other parts of Central America. The fly is endemic in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and some South American nations, it said.",
      "Mexico reported a case in Ixhuatl\u00e1n de Madero, Veracruz, last month, 370 miles from the Texas border, prompting Health and Human Services to immediately shut down cross-border cattle trade, following similar stops in November and May."

      "Trump himself injected a note of uncertainty into the day\u2019s meeting Monday by posting on Truth Social: \u201cWHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can\u2019t have that and do business there.\u201d",
      "It was not clear what Trump was referring to. Later, speaking to reporters at the White House during their meeting, Trump explained that he had \u201cheard from Intel that there was a raid on churches. We\u2019re going to talk about that later.\u201d",
      "After decades of industry decline, the United States now accounts for less than 1% of the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Rand national security think tank, compared with 50% for China, 30% for South Korea and 10% for Japan. South Korean equipment, designs and knowledge could help put the United States back on the map.",
      "On Tuesday, Lee and possibly Trump will visit a Philadelphia shipyard acquired last year by the South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group.",
      "The shipbuilding initiative is \u201ca strategic and symbolic win\u201d for South Korea as well as the United States, said Eun A Jo, an assistant professor of government at William & Mary and director of its Asia Policy Lab.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a smart move to try and secure influence in a critical American sector while at the same time countering Chinese expansion in global maritime infrastructure,\u201d she said in a phone interview Sunday.",
      "No 'bromance' expected",
      "The White House summit is an important opportunity for Lee to advocate South Korea\u2019s interests with Trump after months of political instability created by former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Though Lee comes from a liberal party, he and Trump have much in common \u2014 both have been the subjects of assassination attempts, and both are more open to diplomacy with nuclear-armed North Korea than their predecessors.",
      "But they have very different outlooks on political, economic and foreign policy, which could make the summit challenging, said Bae Jong-chan, president of Insight K, a private think tank in Seoul.",
      "\u201cOne will not be able to expect bromance between President Lee and President Trump,\u201d he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The relationship has already been strained by Trump\u2019s tariffs on South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, which has a large trade surplus with the United States.",
      "Trump said last month that the U.S. tariff on South Korean imports would be 15%, down from the 25% he had threatened earlier. He said South Korea, which does not impose any tariffs on U.S. goods, managed to \u201cbuy down\u201d the U.S. tariff by promising $450 billion in U.S. investment and energy purchases, including the $150 billion shipbuilding fund.",
      "Jo said Lee is seeking to lock in the terms favorable to South Korea in the trade deal, which remains unwritten and largely unclear.",
      "\u201cI think he wants that to be firm and solid, to have at least some sense of predictability and stability in their economic relations,\u201d she said.",
      "Trickier are questions about South Korea\u2019s long-standing security alliance with the United States and its position on China.",
      "Trump wants South Korea to take more responsibility for its own defense, freeing up the almost 30,000 U.S. service members stationed there to focus more on containing China, Washington\u2019s biggest strategic rival.",
      "South Korea worries that such a shift could expose it more to threats from North Korea, as well as increase the chances it could be drawn into a potential U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Though Lee strongly supports the decades-old U.S.-South Korea alliance, he also has to balance relations with China, South Korea\u2019s main trading partner.",
      "On Sunday, a special envoy told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that South Korea hopes to normalize relations with China after years of tension.",
      "Lee has long been vocal about his reluctance to take sides between the United States and China, and his pragmatic approach to South Korea-China relations \u201cis unlikely to sit comfortably with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",
      "Lee makes U.S. his second stop",
      "Before he headed to Washington, Lee stopped in Tokyo for a summit with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in his first foreign visit since he was elected president in June.",
      "\u201cThat was a very deliberate and strategic move,\u201d Jo said, as the two U.S. allies seek leverage to protect themselves from Trump\u2019s vicissitudes.",
      "On his flight from Tokyo to Washington on Sunday, Lee told reporters that he had asked Ishiba for details about Japan\u2019s negotiations with the United States and that Ishiba had given \u201ca lot of very friendly advice.\u201d",
      "Lee and Ishiba, whose countries have historically been at odds, agreed at their summit to improve bilateral ties so they can better coordinate with the United States against China and North Korea.",
      "Despite interest from Washington and Seoul, North Korea has dismissed the idea of further denuclearization talks, saying Trump must accept it as a nuclear power. The United States and South Korean militaries are holding annual joint exercises that North Korea condemns as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "Bae said Lee is \u201clikely to walk away from the summit with detailed homework\u201d on North Korea, tariffs, military cost-sharing and the role of U.S. troops in South Korea, among other issues.",
      "If he \u201cfails to deliver as President Trump sees fit,\u201d Trump may protest by skipping the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting South Korea is hosting this fall.",
      "\u201cMASGA cannot cover everything for President Lee in dealing with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",

      "LONDON \u2014 France has summoned the American ambassador to Paris after he wrote a letter to President Emmanuel Macron alleging that the country had not taken \u201csufficient action\u201d to combat antisemitism.",
      "France\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that it had summoned Charles Kushner to appear Monday over his criticism, which it said was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "It said that \u201cFrance firmly rejects these allegations\u201d and that French authorities have \u201cfully mobilized\u201d to combat the \"intolerable\" rise in antisemitic acts over the past two years.",
      "The French ministry said Kushner\u2019s allegations violated international law and the obligation not to interfere with the internal affairs of another country. \u201cThey also fall short of the quality of the transatlantic partnership between France and the United States and of the trust that must prevail between allies,\" it said.",
      "The episode is the latest sign of a growing divide between the United States and its longtime partners in Europe. It comes as Washington's close ally, Israel, increasingly clashes with Western countries amid fallout from its military assault on Gaza.",
      "\u201cAntisemitism has long scarred French life, but it has exploded since Hamas\u2019s barbaric assault on Oct. 7, 2023,\u201d Kushner wrote in an open letter in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday.",
      "\u201cPublic statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\u201d added Kushner, who is Jewish.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Sunday evening that the State Department stood by Kushner\u2019s comments, according to The Associated Press. \u201cAmbassador Kushner is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role,\u201d he said.",
      "France said last month that it plans to recognize a Palestinian state in September, while other traditional allies of Israel, such as Australia and Canada, have said they will do the same.",
      "Last week, Macron denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's accusations that the move was fueling antisemitism, calling the suggestion \"abject\" and \"erroneous.\"",
      "France is home to the largest Jewish population in Europe, with an estimated 500,000 Jews, the third-largest Jewish population in the world after Israel and the United States. That is about 1% of the national population.",
      "In his letter, Kushner said that French Jews are living in fear and that Macron should act decisively to protect them, adding that he stands ready to work with French leaders across the country to \u201cforge a serious plan that addresses the roots of antisemitism and defeats it.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, many French Jews fear that history will repeat itself in Europe,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cMr. President, I urge you to act decisively: enforce hate-crime laws without exception; ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, prosecute offenders to the fullest extent; and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\u201d",
      "Kushner, a real estate developer, is the father of President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. He said during his confirmation hearing in May this year that he was \u201cdedicated to building an even stronger relationship\u201d between the United States and France.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term in the Oval Office, he pardoned Kushner, who pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations."

      "Vice President JD Vance remains confident the U.S. can broker an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine despite potential hang-ups that have emerged since President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve already seen some significant concessions from both sides, just in the last few weeks,\u201d Vance said in an exclusive interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Vance also weighed in on a Russian missile strike in western Ukraine overnight Thursday that hit an electronics factory owned by a U.S.-based company. Asked by moderator Kristen Welker if he was \u201cenraged\u201d by the strike, which the company said injured  several workers, Vance pivoted to a criticism of former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Vance said of the assault. \u201cBut this is a war, and this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don\u2019t like. A lot of civilians have died. We\u2019ve condemned that stuff from the get-go and, frankly, President Trump has done more to apply pressure and to apply economic leverage to the Russians, certainly, than Joe Biden did for 3 \u00bd years, when he did nothing but talk, did nothing to bring the killing to a stop. So you asked me what I\u2019m enraged by? What I\u2019m enraged by is the continuation of the war.\u201d",
      "Trump told reporters Friday that he was not happy about the strikes on western Ukraine and indicated that any peace deal between the countries could be weeks away.",
      "\u201cI think over the next two weeks, we\u2019re going to find out which way it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Trump said.",
      "During his interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Vance did not characterize the strike, and a number of other issues, as long-term hindrances to peace, saying there was still plenty of room for negotiation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we\u2019re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,\u201d Vance added. \u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close.\u201d",
      "Welker then asked Vance what the pressure is on Russia if the U.S. is not \u201cimposing new sanctions.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow do you get them to a place of getting to the table with Zelenskyy and stopping to drop bombs?\u201d she asked.",
      "Vance replied by saying Trump has applied \u201caggressive economic leverage,\u201d such as \u201csecondary tariffs on India, to try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d",
      "Asked by Welker if he could guarantee that the U.S. would not send troops to help enforce any peace deal, Vance reaffirmed Trump\u2019s opposition to such a deployment.",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThere are not going to be boots on the ground in Ukraine. But we are going to continue to play an active role in trying to ensure that the Ukrainians have the security guarantees and the confidence they need to stop the war on their end and the Russians feel like they can bring the war to a conclusion on their end.\u201d",
      "The interview, which aired Sunday, comes amid new, heightened tensions in the effort to end the war.",
      "On Friday, Russia\u2019s top diplomat told NBC News that no meetings between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been scheduled, raising further doubts about Trump\u2019s ability to mediate the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, details about security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and Russia\u2019s role in shaping them \u2014 remain unresolved.",
      "In the interview, Vance said he doesn\u2019t believe the Russians are stringing Trump along.",
      "\u201cI think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in 3 \u00bd years of this conflict,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands. They\u2019ve talked about what would be necessary to end the war.\u201d",
      "Trump, Vance added, stepped up efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution \u201cbecause this war is not in anyone\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not in Europe or the United States\u2019 interest.\u201d",
      "While acknowledging some of the hurdles that have popped up since Trump\u2019s Aug. 15 meeting with Putin in Alaska, Vance expressed optimism that persistence would deliver results.",
      "\u201cThere are hills and valleys to the negotiations,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe sometimes feel like we\u2019ve made great progress with the Russians, and sometimes, as the president has said, he\u2019s been very frustrated with the Russians. We\u2019re going to keep on doing what we have to do to bring this thing to a close. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen overnight. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress. But, ultimately, whether the killing stops, that determination is going to belong to whether the Russians and Ukrainians can actually find some middle ground here.\u201d",
      "Putin has rejected calls \u2014 including from Trump before their recent meeting \u2014 for a ceasefire.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say they conceded on everything,\u201d Vance said in the interview, referring to Russia. \u201cBut what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They\u2019ve recognized that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. \u2026 Have they made every concession? Of course they haven\u2019t. Should they have started the war? Of course they [shouldn\u2019t have], but we\u2019re making progress.\u201d",
      "Asked about disagreements surrounding how involved Russia will be in establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Vance asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of talking past each other here.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re not talking about security guarantees until after the war has come to a close,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd, of course, the Russians are going to be a part of the conversation about bringing that war to a close. So, of course, they\u2019re going to have some stake in this.\u201d",
      "The interview with Vance also touched on several domestic issues, including new congressional maps passed by the Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives that could pad the GOP\u2019s majority by as many as five seats. The issue has become a political flashpoint, with California Democrats preparing retaliatory moves and other states aiming to redraw maps, too.",
      "\u201cAll we\u2019re doing, frankly, is trying to make the situation a little bit more fair on a national scale,\u201d Vance said of GOP efforts. \u201cThe Democrats have gerrymandered their states really aggressively. We think there are opportunities to push back against that, and that\u2019s really all we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "On the subject of his own political ambitions, Vance again sidestepped questions about whether he sees himself as Trump\u2019s heir apparent in 2028, when the president is term-limited.",
      "\u201cI see myself as a vice president who\u2019s trying to do a good job for the American people ... and if I do a good job, and if the president continues to be successful, as I know that he will be, the politics will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe can cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d",
      "Welker asked if Vance has discussed the possibility with Trump.",
      "\u201cAs you know, the president talks about everything, and if it\u2019s in the news, the president and I have certainly discussed it,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cBut I think the president is just focused on doing a good job for the American people. He wants me to be focused on doing a good job for the American people. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep on doing.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month abolishing the trade loophole known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d which since 2016 had allowed goods worth up to $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "The end of the exemption is being extended worldwide after the loophole was closed in May for packages from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "Under the new rules, personal gifts worth less than $100 will still be duty-free, but all other packages will face the same tariffs as standard imports from their country of origin.",
      "The planned policy shift, which operators say lacks clear procedures, has raised concerns about backlogs as services are put on hold.",
      "Postal providers in Belgium, Denmark and New Zealand are among several operators that have already suspended shipments of packages to the U.S. until they can retool their systems to comply with the new rules. Letters and documents are generally unaffected.",
      "Services in Germany, France, Britain and India have announced they will follow suit in the coming days.",
      "France\u2019s national postal service, La Poste, said in a statement that the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time to prepare for new customs procedures. New Zealand\u2019s postal service said parcel deliveries to all U.S. states and territories would be \u201ctemporarily unavailable until further notice\u201d while systems are updated to meet new U.S. customs requirements.",
      "DHL, one of the world\u2019s largest courier companies, said Friday that it will stop accepting parcels containing goods from business customers destined for the U.S. beginning Monday.",
      "The company cited unresolved \u201ckey questions\u201d about the process, including \u201chow and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.\u201d",
      "DHL will, however, continue to deliver private parcels labeled as gifts valued under $100, in line with White House assurances.",
      "The White House said ending the duty-free exemption would help combat \u201cescalating deceptive shipping practices, illegal material, and duty circumvention,\u201d claiming some shippers had \u201cabused\u201d the exemption to send illicit drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "It said the number of de minimis parcels jumped from 134 million in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024 as shippers \u201cdeceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties,  inspection, and U.S. law.\u201d",
      "Most of those packages came from mainland China and Hong Kong, which the Trump administration initially targeted as part of efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value goods from China-linked retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "The White House briefly closed the loophole for mainland China and Hong Kong in February, but quickly extended the deadline to May 2 amid confusion over how the new duties would be collected."

      "The film, inspired by Chinese mythology, opened in more than 2,500 American theaters on Friday. It is the latest in a wave of successful animations featuring Asian culture, such as Netflix\u2019s recent hit \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "The sequel to a hit movie released in 2019, \u201cNe Zha II\u201d tells the story of a child demigod named Ne Zha who rebels against his innate devilry and chooses to use his magical powers and martial arts skills to defend humanity from dragons and other foes.",
      "Yeoh, a Malaysian actor and fluent Mandarin speaker, said she found it hard to follow the English subtitles during some of its more spectacular scenes when she first watched the movie in Hong Kong. She left the theater thinking it needed to be dubbed in English.",
      "She later received a call asking if she wanted to voice Lady Yin, Ne Zha\u2019s mother, for an English-dubbed version being distributed by A24. The New York-based independent film company is known for productions including \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the 2022 film that made Yeoh the first Asian to win the Academy Award for best actress.",
      "\u201cHell yes,\u201d Yeoh said in response, calling the movie \u201ca beautiful way\u201d to cross the cultural bridge between East and West.",

      "Since its release in mainland China in January, \u201cNe Zha II\u201d has become the world\u2019s fifth-highest-grossing movie of all time, just behind James Cameron\u2019s \u201cTitanic.\u201d In February, it surpassed Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d as the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film.",
      "It is also the first non-Hollywood film to exceed $2 billion in global earnings, most of which came from the Chinese box office.",
      "The movie \u2014 which is directed by Sichuan-born Yang Yu, also known as Jiaozi \u2014 has stoked national pride in China, with the state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily praising its commercial success as the \u201cfruits of a confident nation.\u201d",
      "Many schools, state-owned companies and government entities across China have actively organized group viewings of \u201cNe Zha II\u201d in celebration of what they see as a milestone in Chinese animation.",

      "Although the English-dubbed version may do better in the U.S. than the earlier Chinese-only release with English subtitles, which earned about $20 million, Zeng said that if \u201cNe Zha II\u201d succeeds with international viewers it is likely to stem more from its domestic acclaim and novelty than from genuine interest in Chinese mythology.",
      "Zeng said while she expects some reviews in the U.S. will criticize the film as Chinese propaganda, other viewers may just watch it out of curiosity.",
      "Kevin Ma, a veteran observer of the film industry who is based in Hong Kong, said another challenge \u201cNe Zha II\u201d faces in its latest release is the tight theatrical window in today\u2019s streaming-dominated market.",
      "New films may capture public attention for only one or two months before moving to streaming platforms, said Ma, who is also a film festival consultant.",
      "Even though \u201cNe Zha II\u201d came out only at the beginning of this year, it almost seems \u201clike a distant memory now\u201d because of consumers\u2019 \u201cshorter attention span\u201d in the streaming age, he said."

    "story": [
      "Famine was officially declared on Friday in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world's leading authority on hunger as Israel vowed to raze the area if Hamas doesn't agree to its terms.",
      "The declaration of famine by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, comes as deaths from starvation rise across the Palestinian enclave in a spiraling crisis under Israel's military assault and aid restrictions.",
      "Israel's military is preparing to push ahead with a new operation to seize Gaza City that could displace hundreds of thousands of people and worsen the dire situation there. It has launched intense strikes on the city this week after announcing it had begun the first stage of its planned assault.",
      "Famine declared",
      "The IPC, an internationally recognized system for classifying food insecurity and malnutrition, said in its report that famine had been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate \u2014 and that it was projected to expand to the Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates farther south by the end of September if the humanitarian situation does not change.",
      "The number of people now experiencing famine in Gaza was nearly 514,000, the IPC said \u2014 around a quarter of the enclave's population. That was projected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.",
      "\"Famine is a race against time,\" the IPC said. \"An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to enabling an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response to save lives.\"",
      "The United Nations-backed body had up until now only declared famine on four other occasions since it was first established in 2004, most recently in Sudan last year.",
      "The report's findings were met with little surprise by global health authorities and humanitarian groups.",
      "\u201cFamine warnings have been clear for months,\u201d said Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,\u201d said World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cThe world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forcefully rejected the report's findings, calling them a \"lie,\" and repeated that \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation.\"",
      "The IPC's 59-page report does not state that Israel has a policy of starvation in Gaza.",
      "Earlier, Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC had published a \u201cfabricated report to fit Hamas\u2019s fake campaign.\u201d It hit out at the IPC\u2019s methods, accusing it of having \u201ctwisted its own rules and ignored its own criteria.\u201d",
      "The IPC rejected Israel\u2019s accusation.",
      "Mike Huckabee, the United States' ambassador to Israel, attacked the famine declaration before it was officially announced.",
      "\"You know who IS starving? The hostages kidnapped and tortured by uncivilized Hamas savages,\" he said in a post on X early Friday.",
      "Famine, the highest phase of the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale, is classified when an area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition and at least two people or four children out of every 10,000 people are dying each day from starvation.",
      "But the bar can also be met if 15% of children are considered to be suffering from acute malnutrition based on mid-upper arm circumference with evidence of rapidly worsening underlying drivers, according to the IPC, which cited the latter practice in its report.",
      "The IPC said that this did not mean it had altered its threshold for famine, saying it used this method in line with established standards where a lack of other data is available, as it had also done in South Sudan.",
      "This \"does not represent a 'lowered threshold' in IPC methodology. Instead, it demonstrates the continued application of established IPC standards,\" it said.",
      "Israel has repeatedly denied reports of growing starvation in Gaza, while seeking to blame any hunger in the enclave on humanitarian groups and Hamas.",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza intensified after Israel launched a blockade on March 2, in the middle of its ceasefire with Hamas, barring the entry of food and other vital supplies for more than two months. It lifted the blockade in May, but only allowed a basic amount of aid in for weeks after that.",
      "Data published by COGAT states that in the weeks since Israel lifted its blockade on May 19 to August 17, when the database was last updated, 9,165 trucks carrying aid entered the enclave, with food making up just over 95% of the supplies.",
      "That boils down to an average of around 100 trucks carrying aid per day during that time period. Prior to Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, around 500 trucks per day were entering the enclave, according to humanitarian groups.",
      "Israel threatens 'gates of hell'",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed Friday to open the \u201cgates of hell\u201d on Gaza City until Hamas agreed to Israel\u2019s conditions for ending the war, including the release of all hostages and the militant group's complete disarmament.",
      "If not, he said, the city would \u201cbecome like Rafah and Beit Hanoun,\u201d areas that have been largely reduced to ruins under Israel\u2019s 22-month offensive.",
      "Netanyahu said a day earlier that he had authorized the operation to take over Gaza City, while also revealing he had instructed \u201cimmediate negotiations\u201d to begin for a deal to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages who remain held in the enclave.",
      "The video statement followed days of silence after Hamas announced it had accepted a ceasefire proposal put forward by Arab mediators.",
      "The IPC\u2019s declaration comes just over three weeks after it warned that the \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d was already unfolding in the Palestinian enclave under Israel\u2019s offensive and crippling aid restrictions \u2014 but it had emphasized the alert was not a formal famine classification.",
      "Aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks there is still not enough food entering Gaza to stave off famine.",
      "The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said on Monday it had recorded three new adult deaths \u201cdue to famine and malnutrition\u201d within a 24-hour period, bringing the total death toll from starvation to 266 people, including 112 children.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decades-long conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local Palestinian health ministry, with much of the territory destroyed.",
      "Among the dead are hundreds of people who have been killed while trying to seek aid following the introduction of a new distribution system led by Israel and the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation."

      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hailed his country\u2019s fallen soldiers in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine as \u201cheroes\u201d at an emotional award ceremony, state media said Friday, in a rare public admission of the losses Pyongyang has suffered in the conflict.",
      "The North Korean leader \u201cextended deep gratitude and warmest militant respect\u201d to those who had returned home \u201cdespite the hail of bullets and bombs of the life-and-death war in the foreign country,\u201d state news agency KCNA reported.",
      "\u201cThe victory won by the brave soldiers who participated in the war is a great feat that firmly defended the great honor of the KPA,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying, referring to his military, the Korean People\u2019s Army.",
      "Photos released by state media showed Kim pinning commendation badges on soldiers\u2019 uniforms as well as on photo frames of deceased soldiers hung on a wall. They also showed him meeting with and embracing tearful family members of deceased soldiers.",
      "KCNA said Kim laid a flower on a memorial wall and paid a silent tribute at the ceremony, during which the national anthem was also played.",
      "The ceremony on Thursday came a week after Kim received a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin that also described the North Korean troops as \u201cheroic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bonds of militant friendship, goodwill and mutual aid which were consolidated in the days of the war long ago remain solid and reliable even today,\u201d Putin said in the letter published by North Korean state media Voice of Korea.",
      "Pyongyang and Moscow have forged increasingly close ties after the Kremlin found itself diplomatically isolated following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defense pact last year, and experts say North Korea may have sent Russia troops in exchange for advanced military technology that would aid its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "Neither Russia nor North Korea confirmed the deployments until months after Pyongyang sent its first soldiers last fall. Though the two countries have not revealed the exact number of troops involved, it could be as high as 15,000, according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Of those, about 600 are believed to have been killed, South Korea\u2019s spy agency said, and thousands more injured.",
      "Though North Korea has one of the largest militaries in the world, its troops have had little real-world combat experience since the end of the Korean War in 1953. But they are strongly loyal to Kim and are trained to take their own lives rather than surrender, former North Korean soldiers who defected have told NBC News.",
      "According to South Korean intelligence, there was at least one incident in which a North Korean soldier seeking to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces was killed while trying to detonate a grenade and shouting Kim\u2019s name.",
      "It is unclear how many North Korean troops remain on the frontlines. South Korean lawmakers said after an intelligence briefing in June that North Korea could deploy additional troops to Russia in July or August and that it was continuing to supply Moscow with arms."

      "Explosions rocked neighborhoods in the city Thursday after Israel said its military had entered the first stages of a planned assault that includes calling up 60,000 reservists. The operation has sent civilians fleeing once again, intensifying fears about the starvation crisis unfolding in the territory.",
      "Israel also carried out strikes on Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, and Deir al-Balah, in the center of the territory, on Thursday. Video from Deir al-Balah showed people running away from a large plume of smoke.",
      "The expanded campaign also throws ceasefire talks into question after Hamas said it had accepted a new proposal. Israel's defiance of global pressure has led to growing tensions with its allies, and it enters the Gaza City campaign while clashing publicly with major Western powers.",
      "\"I have come to approve the IDF\u2019s plans to take over Gaza City and defeat Hamas,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement Thursday. \"At the same time, I have instructed to begin immediate negotiations on the release of all our hostages and an end to the war on terms acceptable to Israel.\"",

      "After Russia launched one of its biggest aerial attacks of the year overnight, Zelenskyy said Thursday that there was \"still no signal from Moscow that they truly intend to engage in substantive negotiations and end this war.\u201d",
      "Later, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated his government's longstanding demands that Ukraine be demilitarized and stop trying to be allied with the West.",
      "\"Ukraine would remain neutral, non-nuclear and non-aligned,\" Lavrov said at a news conference.

      "Where those talks might place has emerged as a possible stumbling block.",

The Hungarian capital, Budapest, and the Swiss city of Geneva were among the sites being discussed, a senior administration official told NBC News, as Washington sought to secure a location and date.",
