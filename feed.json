      "Meghan Trainor will release her seventh studio album in April",
      "NEW YORK -- In the decade following her debut album, Meghan Trainor has lived myriad lives \u2014 but the message of her bright, cheery pop music has remained the same: Stay true to who you are and ignore the haters. That spirit endures on her lead single, the jovial \u201cStill Don't Care,\u201d the first tease of her forthcoming seventh full-length album, \u201cToy with Me,\u201d out April 24.",
      "And in true Trainor fashion, \u201cStill Don't Care\u201d was inspired by real life situations. \u201cI was seeing a lot of hate all over the world, but I was getting a lot of hate when I started posting more pictures of ... my fitness journey and my health journey. And I didn\u2019t really expect that,\u201d Trainor told The Associated Press. \u201cI would get really upset at comments and I was like, \u2018I wish I didn\u2019t feel like this. I wish I didn\u2019t give them so much power.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd so, when I write songs, I always write in the perspective of how I wish I thought, like \u2018All About That Bass.\u2019 I didn\u2019t feel like that when I wrote it,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd all my self-love anthems. But when I perform them and I see how it affects other people, I start believing them.\u201d",
      "\u201cStill Don't Care\u201d is yet another example, with its maximalist, \u201880s pop production and choir courtesy of Pentatonix\u2019s Scott Hoying. Her mom, brother and sister-in-law contribute background vocals on it as well \u2014 perhaps softening the song's gloves-up approach to combating online hate. \u201cYou could tear me apart,\u201d Trainor sings. \u201cBut I sleep well at night.\u201d",
      "It's the first taste of \u201cToy with Me,\u201d which Trainor teases will have a few self-love bops, songs to excise her anger through and lots of familial love. \u201cThe only features I have right now in this moment are my kids, Riley and Barry, because I wrote them a beautiful song, the only, like, slower song. It\u2019s called \u2018Little One' and it's about how I wish they could stay little forever,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWhen I play it, Riley goes, \u2018Oh, this is my song. Play my song!' It\u2019s literally my lullaby for them. And at the end of the song they say, \u2018I love you, Mama,\u2019 and it\u2019s just the cutest thing ever. And that\u2019s when everyone\u2019s crying.\u201d",
      "Trainor said she worked on the album for eight months. \u201cI exhausted myself, and I went a little too hard. I got excited to be home with the kids and work on my songs, but then I definitely, I overdid it, and my body started doing weird things, giving me signals. Like, my tongue started burning one day. And I was like, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 And it wouldn\u2019t go away forever. And the dentist was like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re stressed,\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Songwriting, too, was a challenge. \u201cI usually write a song in one day and I\u2019m done with it, but each song on this album took, like, months to finish,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that was the only difference from this album than any other album I\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe took the want-to approach, keeping in mind that, while thoroughly studying jidaigeki, we were going to do what we want to make, and make something that looked absolutely cool,\u201d Okada told The Associated Press.",

      "Billed as \u201cThe Great Melbourne Bagpipe Bash,\u201d the eclectic performance took place in Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square, on Swanston Street, which was the scene of the Australian hard rock band\u2019s 1976 film clip in which they played the hit on the back of a flatbed truck traveling slowly through downtown traffic with music blaring from speakers.",
      "Federation Square is also a short stroll from the Melbourne Cricket Ground where AC/DC is scheduled to play their first Australian gig in a decade on Wednesday. Guitarist Angus Young, 70, is the only band member who played on the truck and is performing on the latest Australian tour.",
      "Thousands of spectators crammed the square for the world record attempt. Many of the 374 pipers had to squeeze through the crowd to the stage area. The oldest piper was 98-years-old, organisers said.",
      "Among the bagpipers was Les Kenfield and Kevin Conlon, two of the three members of Rats of Tobruk Memorial Pipes and Drums who played with AC/DC on the truck 49 years ago.",

      "The Australian Book of Records, which has been certifying records since 2012, confirmed that 374 pipers had together broken a record set by 333 pipers in Bulgaria in 2012. The U.K.'s better known Guinness World Records, which confirmed the Bulgarian record, told The Associated Press that it hadn\u2019t been approached to assess the Melbourne record attempt.",
      "Many of the enthusiastic spectators wore AC/DC T-shirts. Asked from the stage who among them were going to the concert afterwards, many hands went up.",
      "One AC/DC fan who didn\u2019t see the record set was Keegan Kohler, 23, a self-employed electrician from Columbus, Ohio. He had been waiting outside the concert stadium since 4:50 a.m. to ensure he\u2019d be first in when the gates opened at 5 p.m. The bagpipes record was set nearby at 5:15 p.m.",
      "Kohler had seen AC/DC perform their \u201cPower Up Tour\u201d this year in Cleveland, Washington, D.C., Detroit and Pittsburgh, but expects the experience will be better in the band\u2019s home country. He will see two shows in Melbourne and one in the band's hometown of Sydney.",

      "The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster",
      "LONDON -- The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning.",
      "The century-old, publicly funded BBC faced criticism after its flagship TV news program spliced together sections of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, so that it appeared he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "The BBC chairman apologized Monday for an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d A letter from Trump\u2019s attorney threatened legal action, demanding that the broadcaster \u201cretract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements\u201d and compensate the president for the harm caused.",
      "Critics say the episode is just the latest example of bias at the BBC, but supporters maintain that it is one of the most trusted sources of news in the U.K. and around the world, and that the departure of its most senior executives casts a chill on public-service broadcasting.",
      "\u201cThis is an existential crisis for the BBC,\u201d said Julie Posetti, a journalism professor at City St. George\u2019s University of London. \u201cIn capitulating so quickly, it has sent a signal that it\u2019s relatively easy to cow the BBC.\u201d",
      "That is \u201cincredibly dangerous\u201d in an increasingly polarized environment \u201cwhere the information ecosystem is incredibly polluted,\u201d she warned.",
      "A look at the scandal, past criticism of the BBC and uncertainty about its future:",
      "The furor unfolded days after the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper last week published details from an internal memo compiled by a former external editorial standards adviser to the BBC.",
      "The memo raised concerns over how the BBC\u2019s \u201cPanorama\u201d documentary program edited a speech by Trump.",
      "The program, which was broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. election, as Trump ran for a second term, spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "Among the parts that were cut was a segment where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.",
      "The BBC\u2019s director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned Sunday.",
      "The broadcaster\u2019s chair, Samir Shah, acknowledged that the editing gave \u201cthe impression of a direct call for violent action.\u201d Turness said Monday that mistakes were made, but she insisted \"there\u2019s no institutional bias\u201d at the BBC \u2014 a position supported by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "The memo also criticized BBC coverage of transgender issues, alleging that the broadcaster\u2019s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda, and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service.",
      "Reacting to the resignations Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a screen grab of an article headlined \u201cTrump goes to war with \u2018fake news\u2019 BBC.\u201d Trump himself wrote on social media that BBC journalists were \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201ctried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.\u201d",
      "Critics have long charged that the broadcaster leans left, though some have also accused it of being too cautious to challenge successive Conservative Party governments. On Monday, the hard-right leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage, told a news conference that the BBC \u201chas been institutionally biased for decades\u201d to loud applause from supporters.",

      "La Fenice opera house in Venice faces a dispute over the appointment of Beatrice Venezi as musical director",
      "VENICE, Italy -- The storied Venetian opera house La Fenice is embroiled in a dispute with its orchestra and chorus over the appointment of a young and telegenic musical director with ties to Premier Giorgia Meloni but none with the musicians she has been hired to conduct.",
      "La Fenice\u2019s general manager, Nicola Colabianchi, who joined the theater in March, has defended his choice of 35-year-old Beatrice Venezi, saying her youthful energy will bring a new audience to the theater where Giuseppe Verdi premiered \u2018\u2019Rigoletto\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019La Traviata\u2019\u2019 more than 170 years ago.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s young and dynamic, she\u2019s already written several books and she\u2019s conducted many orchestras. She\u2019s a person who attracts a great deal of media attention. So all of this will only bring attention to the theater and the theater\u2019s future,'' Colabianchi said in an interview. \u201dWe can\u2019t think the theater can survive with 80-year-old season ticket holders.\u2019\u2019",
      "In the six weeks since Venezi\u2019s appointment, effective next October, was announced by La Fenice on social media, striking workers forced the cancellation of an opera premiere and unions have called for Colabianchi\u2019s resignation.",
      "Another protest was planned for Monday, backed by other Italian opera houses in solidarity.",
      "Critics say Venezi doesn\u2019t have the requisite experience for a theater of La Fenice\u2019s profile, where famed conductors Arturo Toscanini, Claudio Abbado and Riccardo Muti have lifted their batons. They also suggest the choice was influenced by Venezi\u2019s ties to Meloni and her far-right Brothers of Italy.",
      "Venezi has not publicly commented on the La Fenice dispute, and canceled a public appearance to avoid polemics.",
      "She is the daughter of a prominent member of Forza Nuova, another hard-right party, and has identified with the right\u2019s conservative values. However, she told the daily La Stampa in 2023 that she was \u201coffended when they call me a little fascist.\u2019\u2019",
      "La Fenice\u2019s unions say they are not contesting Venezi\u2019s youth, gender or political leanings, but the lack of consultations with the musicians whom she must lead. They note that Colabianchi had pledged an open process just days before Venezi\u2019s appointment was announced.",

      "La Fenice\u2019s unions have asked Colabianchi to revoke Venezi\u2019s appointment, and relaunch the selection process, allowing the musicians time to work with and become familiar with any candidates, Venezi included. They also have demanded Colabianchi's resignation.",
      "Colabianchi, for his part, has apologized for hiring Venezi without more consultations, but he remains firm in his choice.",
      "\u2018\u2019I chose Beatrice Venezi because I had invited her, while I was the general manager in Caglieri, for three separate operas, and she was a huge success,'' Colabianchi said, adding she has a broad repertoire of more than 50 operas. \"She is young, and we need to promote the young; she is a woman, and we need to promote women.\u2019\u2019",
      "He said there was no question of his resigning and that he would bring Venezi to the theater as soon as the protests against her appointment cease. Her first appointment to conduct with the full orchestra would be in July, for a concert in St. Mark\u2019s Square, though others could be added earlier, Colabianchi said.",

      "The prizes honor both literary merit and the writers' promotion of peace through their work, with separate awards annually for fiction, nonfiction and lifetime achievement. The Ohio city was the site of negotiations that led to the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995, ending a war in the Balkans marked by ethnic cleansing that killed more than 300,000 people, as well as the displacement of 1 million residents.",
      "The 78-year-old Rushdie is best known for his 1988 novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which includes a dream sequence about the Prophet Muhammad that prompted allegations of blasphemy and a 1989 call from Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for the Indian-born writer's death, driving him into hiding. He was blinded in one eye from the 2022 attack before a stunned audience, and his assailant \u2014 who wasn't born when \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d was published \u2014 was sentenced to 25 years in prison.",
      "In accepting his award, Rushdie said it can be difficult to write about peace while living in a time of \u201cinexcusable violence,\u201d including the conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan.",
      "\u201cA book cannot stop a bullet. A poem cannot intercept a bomb,\" he said.",

Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award, is named for the American diplomat who was an architect of the Dayton Peace Accords.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lea Michele was just a kid actor backstage at the Imperial Theatre on Broadway when she first heard a song from the musical \u201cChess\u201d on a stereo. Some three decades later, she finds herself singing that same tune in the same theater.",
      "The \u201cGlee\u201d and Broadway veteran, who got her professional start in \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d at age 8, has returned, now a mother and a bankable star, to her old stomping grounds, which coincidentally is the very theater where \u201cChess\u201d made its debut in 1988.",
      "\u201cThe Imperial Theatre really has a soul. Every show that\u2019s ever been in it is absorbed in the walls. It\u2019s a little eerie, but very powerful. Other theaters can feel a little sterile, but this does not feel that way,\u201d she says.",
      "She remembers exactly where she sat the first time she saw \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d \u2014 orchestra left, six rows in \u2014 hearing Paige O\u2019Hara as Fantine sing \u201cI Dreamed a Dream\u201d in the musical that she would soon join, playing Young Cosette and Young Eponine.",
      "\u201cI was in the show and I told my parents, I said \u2018I love this. I want to do this for the rest of my life.\u2019 And it\u2019s really very emotional to be here 30 years later still working, thank God, back at this theater,\u201d she says. The icing on the cake? An electrician on her return simply said: \u201cWelcome home.\u201d",
      "\u201cChess,\u201d which opens Nov. 16 and is set primarily in Bangkok and Budapest during the Cold War, tells the fictional story about two chess grandmasters \u2014 an American played by Aaron Tveit and a Soviet, portrayed by Nicholas Christopher \u2014 facing off to win for their respective nations, a task complicated by the appearance of a woman they both love, played by Michele.",
      "\u201cThis is the hardest character in a lot of ways that I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d Michele says. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman. She\u2019s strong. I don\u2019t have comedy to lean on as a crutch or as a kind of like a protective cloak.\u201d",
      "The show reunites Michele with Tony Award-winning director Michael Mayer, who directed her both in her breakout \u201c Spring Awakening \u201d in 2006 and also in \u201cFunny Girl\u201d in 2022.",
      "Mayer also has great memories of the Imperial Theatre. It was the place where he saw his first Broadway show \u2014 \u201cPippin\u201d in 1976 with Ben Vereen. He was in the back row of the mezzanine, eight seats in from the right aisle. \u201cI sat there and everything came back,\u201d he says.",
      "The show, with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA, originated as a concept album in 1984 and includes the goosebump-raising \u201cAnthem,\u201d the pop-pulsing \u201cOne Night in Bangkok\u201d\u2014 which reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 and the lilting \u201cI Know Him So Well.\u201d",
      "The musical, first staged in London in 1986 and heavily revised for a Broadway production in 1988, has a cult fan base, but the Broadway production was a flop, lasting less than 90 performances. Attempts have been made to resuscitate it over the years with concerts and new stagings. A new story has been written for the latest iteration by screenwriter Danny Strong.",

      "The relationship between Michele and Mayer has evolved and deepened over the 25 or so years they've known each other. He says he's watched her grow up and no longer feels like a father figure. Now they're peers.",
      "\u201cI feel like we\u2019re not just colleagues, but we\u2019re dear friends. I would almost say we\u2019re family at this point,\u201d he says. \u201cI met her when she was 14 years old.

      "\u201cThere is obviously no excuse for theft,\u201d said Emiline C.H. Smith, a criminologist at the University of Glasgow who studies heritage crime. \u201cBut many of these objects are entangled with violent, exploitative, colonial histories.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s no credible evidence these specific gems were stolen \u2014 experts say that doesn\u2019t end the argument: What was legal in the imperial age could still mean plunder in today\u2019s lights. In other words, the paperwork of empire doesn\u2019t settle the ethics.",
      "Meanwhile, the heist investigation grinds on. Police have charged suspects, but investigators fear the jewels could be broken up or melted down. They are too symbolic to fence, but easy to monetize for metal and stones.",
      "The Louvre provides scant information about how the gems in the French crown jewels \u2013 showcased in the Apollo Gallery until the theft \u2014 were originally extracted.",
      "For example, the Louvre\u2019s own catalog describes the stolen diadem of Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie as set with \u201cCeylon sapphires\u201d in their natural, unheated state, bordered with diamonds in gold. It says nothing about who mined them, how they moved, or under what terms they were taken.",
      "Provenance isn\u2019t always a neutral ledger in Western museums. They sometimes \u201cavoid spotlighting uncomfortable acquisition histories,\u201d Smith said, adding that the lack of clarity about the gems\u2019 origins is likely no accident.",
      "The museum did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The stolen tiaras, necklaces and brooches were crafted in Paris by elite ateliers, and once belonged to 19th-century figures such as Marie-Am\u00e9lie, Queen Hortense, and the wives of two Napoleons, Empress Marie-Louise of Austria and Empress Eug\u00e9nie. Their raw materials, however, moved through imperial networks that converted global labor, resources \u2014 and even slavery \u2014 into European prestige, experts say.",
      "Pascal Blanchard, a historian of France\u2019s colonial past, draws a line between craftsmanship and supply. The jewels \u201cwere made in France by French artisans,\u201d he said, but many stones came via colonial circuits and were \u201cproducts of colonial production.\u201d They were traded \u201cunder the legal conditions \u2026 of the time,\u201d ones shaped by empires that siphoned wealth from Africa, Asia and South America.",
      "Some French critics press the point further. They argue that national outcry over loss should sit beside the history of how imperial France acquired the stones that court jewelers later set in gold.",

It likely originated in India's Golconda diamond belt \u2014 much like the Louvre's dazzling Regent diamond, one that was also legally acquired in imperial times and spared by the Oct. 19 robbers.",
      "The Koh-i-Noor passed from court to court before landing in British hands, where it is hailed in London as a \u201clawful\u201d imperial gift and denounced in India as a prize taken under the shadow of conquest. A 2017 petition to India\u2019s Supreme Court seeking its return was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, but the political and moral dispute endures.",
      "France is not Britain, and the Koh-i-Noor is not the Louvre's story. But it frames the questions increasingly applied to 19th-century acquisitions: not only \u201cwas it bought?\u201d but \u201cwho had the power to sell?\u201d On that measure, experts say, even jewels made in France can be considered products of colonial extraction.",
      "The Louvre case lands in a world already primed by other fights. Greece presses Britain to reunite the Parthenon Marbles. Egypt campaigns for the Rosetta Stone in London and the Nefertiti bust in Berlin.",
      "France has moved \u2014 narrowly. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pledge to return parts of Africa\u2019s heritage produced a law enabling the return of 26 royal treasures to Benin and items to Senegal. Madagascar recovered the crown of Queen Ranavalona III through a specific process.",
      "Critics say restitution is structurally blocked: French law forbids removing state-held objects unless Parliament makes a special exception, and risk-averse museums keep the rest behind glass.",
      "They also say that under former Louvre chief Jean-Luc Martinez, the museum's narrow definition of what counts as \u201clooted\u201d \u2014 and its demand for near-legal levels of proof \u2014 created a chilling effect on restitution claims, even as the museum publicly praised transparency. (The Louvre says it follows the law and academic standards.)",
      "Asking museum visitors to marvel at artifacts like the French crown jewels without understanding their social history is dishonest, says Erin L. Thompson, an art-crime scholar in New York. A decolonized approach, she and others argue, would name where such stones came from, how the trade worked, who profited and who paid \u2014 and share authorship with origin communities.",
      "Egyptian archaeologist Monica Hanna calls the contradiction glaring.",
      "\u201cYes, the irony is profound,\u201d she said of the outcry over last month's Louvre theft, \u201cand it\u2019s central to the conversation about restitution.\u201d She expects the heist will trigger action on restitutions across Western museums and fuel debate about transparency.",
      "At a minimum, Hanna and other experts say, what's needed from museums are stronger words: plain-spoken labels and wall texts that acknowledge where objects came from, how they moved, and at whose expense. It would mean publishing what is known, admitting what isn\u2019t, and inviting contested histories into the gallery \u2014 even when they cloud the shine.",
      "Some offer a practical path.",
      "\u201cTell the honest and complete story,\u201d said Dutch restitution specialist Jos van Beurden. \u201cOpen the windows, not for thieves, but for fresh air.\u201d",

      "Canada is no longer measles-free because of ongoing outbreaks, international health experts said Monday, as childhood vaccination rates fall and the highly contagious virus spreads across North and South America.",
      "The loss of the country\u2019s measles elimination status comes more than a year after the highly contagious virus started spreading.",
      "Canada has logged 5,138 measles cases this year and two deaths. Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.",
      "Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.",
      "Measles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it\u2019s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World Health Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.",
      "It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.",
      "\u201cIt's a deeply disheartening development. It's a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it's an embarrassing development,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. \u201cNo country with the amount of resources of Canada \u2014 or other countries in North America even \u2014 should lose their measles elimination status.\u201d",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.",
      "But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada\u2019s loss.",
      "Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada\u2019s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.",
      "It has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cAs a region, we have eliminated measles twice,\u201d Barbosa said. \u201cWe can do it a third time.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance.",
      "The virus is one of the most contagious known to medicine. One infected person can spread it to up to 9 out of 10 unprotected people they come into close contact with. Health experts say, by far, the best prevention against measles is the vaccine, which provides 97% protection after two doses.",
      "Barbosa's organization has confirmed nearly 12,600 cases this year across 10 countries, a 30-fold increase from 2024. The vast majority are in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, but Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have active outbreaks.",
      "In 2024, the region had a 79% vaccination rate, an increase from years past but still too low, he said.",

      "A major question now is if either are linked to the Texas outbreak. To lose elimination status, health data must show a continuous chain of measles spread for one year.",
      "International health officials have recommended the U.S. \u201cenhance case investigation protocols,\u201d because closing data gaps is key to stopping the virus from taking hold again, said Dr. Daniel Salas, who leads immunization efforts at the Pan American Health Organization.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 1,681 cases and 44 outbreaks this year, making it the worst year for measles in the U.S. in more than three decades. Only nine states haven\u2019t confirmed cases, according to the CDC.",

      "The Trump administration is again asking the Supreme Court to keep full food aid payments on hold",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration returned to the Supreme Court on Monday in a push to keep full payments in the SNAP federal food aid program frozen while the government is shut down, even as some families struggled to put food on the table.",
      "The request is the latest in a flurry of legal activity over how the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries should proceed during the historic U.S. government shutdown. Lower courts have ruled that the government must keep full payments flowing, but the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to keep them frozen for now.",
      "The high court is expected to rule Tuesday.",
      "The seesawing rulings so far have created a situation where beneficiaries in some states, including Hawaii and New Jersey, have received their full monthly allocations and those in others, such as Nebraska and West Virginia, have seen nothing.",
      "Brandi Johnson, 48, of St. Louis, said she\u2019s struggling to make the $20 she has left in her SNAP account stretch. Johnson said she has been skipping meals the past two weeks to make sure her three teenage children have something to eat. She is also helping care for her infant granddaughter, who has food allergies, and her 80-year-old mother.",
      "She said food pantries have offered little help in recent days. Many require patrons to live in a certain ZIP code or are dedicated to helping the elderly first.",
      "\u201cI think about it 24 hours a day, seven days a week, literally,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve got to figure out how you\u2019re going to eat.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration argued that lower court orders requiring the full funding of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program wrongly affect ongoing negotiations in Congress about ending the shutdown. Supreme Court Solicitor General D. John Sauer called the funding lapse tragic, but said judges shouldn't be deciding how to handle it.",
      "The Senate Monday passed a compromise funding package that would end the government shutdown and refill SNAP funds. It now goes to the House for consideration.",
      "Trump\u2019s administration initially said SNAP benefits would not be available in November because of the shutdown. After some states and nonprofit groups sued, judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled the administration could not skip November\u2019s benefits entirely.",
      "The administration then said it would use an emergency reserve fund to provide 65% of the maximum monthly benefit. On Thursday, Rhode Island-based U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell said that wasn\u2019t good enough, and ordered full funding for SNAP benefits by Friday.",
      "Some states acted quickly to direct their EBT vendors to disburse full monthly benefits to SNAP recipients. Millions of people in at least a dozen states \u2014 all with Democratic governors \u2014 received the full amount to buy groceries before Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put McConnell\u2019s order on hold Friday night, pending further deliberation by an appeals court.",
      "Millions more people still have not received SNAP payments for November, because their states were waiting on guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP. Several states have made partial payments, including Texas, where officials said money was going on cards for some beneficiaries Monday.",
      "\u201cContinued delays deepen suffering for children, seniors, and working families, and force nonprofits to shoulder an even heavier burden,\u201d Diane Yentel, President and CEO, National Council of Nonprofits, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in a statement Monday. \u201cIf basic decency and humanity don\u2019t compel the administration to assure food security for all Americans, then multiple federal court judges finding its actions unlawful must.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s administration has argued that the judicial order to provide full benefits violates the Constitution by infringing on the spending power of the legislative and executive branches.",
      "Wisconsin, which was among the first to load full benefits after McConnell\u2019s order, had its federal reimbursement frozen. The state\u2019s SNAP account could be depleted as soon as Monday, leaving no money to reimburse stores that sell food to SNAP recipients, according to a court filing.",

Dozens of clinical trials are testing ways to reprogram an immune system-gone-rogue, with some promising early successes against lupus, myositis and certain other illnesses. Other researchers are hunting ways to at least delay brewing autoimmune diseases, spurred by a drug that can buy some time before people show symptoms of Type 1 diabetes.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the most exciting time that we\u2019ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,\u201d said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.",

Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis attack joints. Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease is known for dry eyes and mouth. Myositis and myasthenia gravis weaken muscles in different ways, the latter by attacking how nerves signal them. Lupus has widely varied symptoms including a butterfly-shaped facial rash, joint and muscle pain, fevers and damage to the kidneys, lungs and heart.",

      "Many start with vague symptoms that come and go or mimic other illnesses. Many also have overlapping symptoms \u2013 rheumatoid arthritis and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s also can harm major organs, for example.",
      "Diagnosis can take multiple tests, including some blood tests to detect antibodies that mistakenly latch onto healthy tissue. It usually centers on symptoms and involves ruling out other causes. Depending on the disease it can take years and seeing multiple doctors before one puts the clues together. There are efforts to improve: The National MS Society is educating doctors about newly updated guidelines to streamline diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.",
      "The human immune system is a complex army with sentinels to detect threats like germs or cancer cells, a variety of soldiers to attack them, and peacemakers to calm things down once the danger is over. Key is that it can distinguish what\u2019s foreign from what\u2019s \u201cyou,\u201d what scientists call tolerance.",

For example, the Epstein-Barr virus is linked to MS.",

      "But men do suffer from autoimmune diseases. One especially severe one named VEXAS syndrome wasn\u2019t discovered until 2020. It mainly affects men over 50 and in addition to typical autoimmune symptoms it can cause blood clots, shortness of breath and night sweats.",

      "The list goes on: A new count from the National Institutes of Health tallied 140 autoimmune conditions, many rare but altogether a leading cause of chronic disease that\u2019s often invisible.",
      "\u201cYou look normal. People see you and they don\u2019t think you have this horrible disease,\u201d said Wilson, 43, who balances her illness with volunteering to help educate the public and even doctors about life with lupus.",
      "While there\u2019s still an enormous amount to learn, recent steps have some specialists daring to wonder if just maybe, ways to cure or prevent at least some of these diseases are getting closer.",
      "In dozens of clinical trials, scientists are harnessing some of patients' own immune cells to wipe out wayward ones that fuel lupus and a growing list of other diseases. It's called CAR-T therapy and early results with these \u201cliving drugs\u201d are promising. The first lupus patient was treated in Germany in March 2021 and remains in drug-free remission, the researchers said last month.",
      "And a drug named teplizumab can delay the start of Type 1 diabetes symptoms in people destined to get sick, buying some time before they\u2019ll need insulin. Citing that \u201ctantalizing evidence,\u201d the NIH\u2019s new five-year plan for autoimmune research \u2014 if it gets funded \u2014 urges pursuing similar windows to intervene in other simmering diseases.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the most exciting time that we\u2019ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,\u201d said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.",
      "Your immune system has multiple overlapping ways to detect and attack bacteria, viruses or other bad actors. That includes teaching key soldiers -- T cells and antibody-producing B cells \u2014 how to distinguish what\u2019s foreign from what\u2019s \u201cyou.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a delicate balancing act, especially considering germs sometimes adapt features similar to human molecules so they can confuse and sneak past immune defenses. And while the immune system has built-in safeguards to curtail any misbehaving cells, autoimmune diseases set in when the system gets off-kilter.",
      "Numerous genes involved in different immune functions can make people susceptible to common autoimmune diseases. That means if one family member is sick, others may be at increased risk. Such genes can include variants that once protected our ancestors from long-ago threats including the Black Death but that today can translate into a hyperactive immune system.",
      "But \u201cgenes are not everything,\u201d said Dr. Mariana Kaplan of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.",
      "Studies show if one identical twin develops an autoimmune disease, the other isn't guaranteed to get sick. Non-genetic factors that trigger an immune response play a big role, such as infections, certain medicines, smoking, pollutants. In lupus, even a bad sunburn is suspect.",
      "\u201cAt some point there is a second or third hit and the immune system says, \u2018That\u2019s it, I can\u2019t handle any more of these insults,\u2019\u201d said Kaplan, who directs systemic autoimmunity research.",
      "And women are more likely to get autoimmune diseases than men, maybe because of estrogen or their extra X chromosome. That's especially evident in lupus; women account for 90% of cases, often young ones like Wilson.",
      "Fainting spells and body-wide rashes began in her 20s and intensified with two pregnancies. Youngsters in tow, she saw a variety of doctors for fevers, swelling, joint and back pain until that fateful ER visit when she requested a urine test.",
      "Months of grueling treatment saved her kidneys. But over a decade later, the Littleton, Massachusetts, woman still lives with daily pain from lupus. Deep fatigue and brain fog \u2014 difficulty with concentrating, short-term recall, multitasking \u2014 wax and wane.",
      "Therapies have improved in recent years, from high-dose steroids and drugs that broadly suppress the immune system to include additional options that focus on specific molecules. Wilson gets a monthly lupus-targeted IV treatment and takes about six daily medicines to calm her overactive immune system and related symptoms.",
      "Worse are what are called flares, when symptoms abruptly and markedly worsen. For Wilson, they bring sudden high fevers, legs too swollen to walk, more intense pain, lasting days to a week. They impact her job at a medical lab and time with her husband, teen son and college-age daughter.",

      "Kaplan, the NIH scientist, has a biological explanation for the daily slog: The same inflammatory proteins that cause aches and fatigue during a cold or flu continually course through the bodies of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases like lupus.",
      "\u201cThese are my babies,\u201d said Dr. Justin Kwong, a research fellow in Kaplan\u2019s lab at NIH, as he carefully examines cells in an incubator.",
      "Kwong is performing something so tricky it's not done in many laboratories: He's growing batches of neutrophils, the body\u2019s most common white blood cells.",
      "They are first responders that race to the site of an injury or infection, and Kaplan suspects they\u2019re among the earliest immune cells to run amok and trigger certain autoimmune diseases.",
      "How? Some types of neutrophils spew out their insides to form sticky spider-web like structures that trap and kill germs. The neutrophils die in the process.",
      "But patients with lupus and some other diseases harbor abnormal neutrophils that form too many webs, Kaplan said. Her team is investigating if other immune defenses mistakenly sense the resulting debris as foreign, sparking a chain reaction.",
      "\u201cWe think that\u2019s a fundamental initial process,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find why it happens, why it happens more often in women, and can we come up with strategies to stop this without harming the way we defend ourselves from infections.\u201d",
      "Another common feature: Patients with a number of autoimmune diseases, especially women, often suffer heart attacks and strokes at unusually young ages. Kaplan\u2019s research suggests those aptly named NETS, or neutrophil extracellular traps, may be key \u2014 by damaging blood vessels and spurring hardened arteries typically seen in older people.",
      "But neutrophils don\u2019t live long outside the body and testing mature ones from lupus patients\u2019 blood won\u2019t show how they went awry \u2014 something Kwong\u2019s baby neutrophils may aid.",
      "Whatever triggers it, lupus has bafflingly varied symptoms and treatments that can keep some patients symptom-free but not others.",
      "That suggests \u201clupus is not a single disease,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWhat we call lupus probably represents many different conditions that have some common factors.\"",
      "How to subtype lupus isn't clear. But another disease, rheumatoid arthritis, may offer clues. Perhaps best recognized by painfully disfigured fingers, RA can attack any joint and even some organs, sometimes scarring lungs.",
      "Like with lupus, RA treatment is trial-and-error and scientists are exploring different underlying factors to explain why. In one study, an international team used tiny samples of patients' joint tissue to identify six inflammatory subtypes of RA based on patterns of cells, how they clustered and their activity.",
      "It \u201cchanged how we think about the disease,\u201d said Northwestern University rheumatology chief Harris Perlman, one of the coauthors. Now researchers are comparing cells in joint tissue before and after patients start a new drug to see if they could help guide treatment choices, he said.",
      "Wilson learned to wear sunscreen and a big hat outdoors and how to ration her energy in hopes of avoiding flares. When her kids were old enough for school, she returned, too, getting degrees that led to laboratory research and data science jobs \u2014 and a better understanding of her own disease and its treatments.",
      "One day her then-rheumatologist asked if she'd answer some medical students' questions. Wilson remembers many knew \u201cwhat lupus looks like in a textbook\u201d but not the patient perspective.",
      "\u201cI realized, my god, I need to start talking about this.\u201d",
      "What that looks like now: One evening last February, Wilson bubbled with nerves and excitement at finally meeting some members of her online lupus support group. At UMass Chan Medical School, Wilson greeted the two women and two men with hugs. They shared symptoms and treatments \u2014 and rueful stories of well-meaning relatives urging them to just get more sleep to combat the lupus fatigue that rest can't conquer.",
      "A month later, Wilson traveled to Washington for a meeting organized by the Lupus Research Alliance, where she urged scientists and drug company researchers to heed patient reports of changes in their everyday lives, such as whether a new therapy helps brain fog.",
      "Drug studies that measure physical symptoms and blood markers are \u201conly capturing half the story,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a treatment allows me to think clearly, to engage in my life, to be the person I know I am beneath all of this, then that is just as important as reducing inflammation.\u201d",
      "While her doctor isn't recommending experimental treatments yet, Wilson recently joined the Lupus Landmark Study that will track biological samples from 3,500 patients to better understand disease variations. Whenever a flare strikes Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample to share.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to also be a voice for patients because I think of myself and how lonely I was at the very beginning,\u201d Wilson said. For a long time, \u201cI never wanted to talk about it. Especially my kids, I wanted them to know that I was going to be OK. And so you put on your makeup and your lipstick and your three shades of eye corrector and you go on.\u201d",

      "Founded in 1945, Balmain helped shape postwar French couture with the so-called New French Style \u2014 sculpted lines, rich embroidery and Parisian polish. Today it is one of France\u2019s storied maisons, spanning women\u2019s and men\u2019s ready-to-wear, accessories, beauty and eyewear.",
      "Rachid Mohamed Rachid, who chairs Balmain, said Tron\u2019s craft-driven approach makes him \u201can exciting talent\u201d and that he\u2019ll work with CEO Matteo Sgarbossa to steer the house\u2019s next phase \u201cdefined by creativity, modernity and elegance.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe 10th anniversary is here and emotions and tension are everywhere for us survivors,\u201d said 39-year-old Arthur Denouveaux, president of victims\u2019 association Life for Paris. \u201cThat kind of shields us from the world in a way, because we\u2019re so focused on the grief and on remembering those who lost their lives.\u201d",
      "On Nov. 13, 2015, nine Islamic State group gunmen and suicide bombers struck within minutes of one another at several locations in the deadliest violence to strike France since World War II.",
      "They targeted fans at the Stade de France stadium and cafe-goers and ending with a bloodbath in the Bataclan, killing 130 people. Two survivors who later took their own life as consequence of the physical and mental trauma also have been recognized as victims.",
      "Denouveaux was at the concert of the Californian rock band Eagles of Death Metal at the Bataclan. Since then, he has made a point of telling his story, talking to the media and writing books to keep what happened from being forgotten.",
      "\u201cThe hardest part is Nov. 14 when you have to get back to normal life somehow and the grief is still here, but the bond is a little more distant,\u201d Denouveaux told The Associated Press.",
      "At 9:47 p.m., three gunmen burst into the Bataclan, firing indiscriminately and killing 90 people.",
      "Denouveaux escaped when he heard the first gun shots by crawling toward the nearest emergency exit door.",
      "\u201cI remember crawling on top of bodies. I believe most of the people were pretending to be dead and were not dead, but still. And I remember a few faces or at least a few facial expressions of people who were necessarily dead because of the angle of the neck, because of color of the skin,\u201d he said.",
      "Out in the street, he helped bewildered Eagles of Death Metal's members get in a taxi.",
      "A father of three girls, aged 2, 4 and 6, Denouveaux says it took him a year and a lot of medicines to overcome the most critical phases of post-traumatic stress disorder.",

      "A monthslong trial in 2021-2022 led to the conviction of the lone surviving member of the team that carried out the attacks, Salah Abdeslam, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole. The special terrorism court also convicted 19 other men involved.",

Can I talk to him about it? How do we do that?\u2019 And that, of course, puts you out of phase.\u201d",

      "At least five people were detained for questioning in a series of raids overnight in the Kashmir's southern Pulwama district, police officials said Wednesday.",
      "Monday\u2019s blast came hours after police in Indian-controlled Kashmir said they had dismantled a suspected militant cell operating from the disputed region to the outskirts of New Delhi. At least seven people, including two doctors, were arrested, and police seized weapons and a large quantity of bomb-making material in Faridabad, a city in Haryana state, which is near New Delhi.",
      "Indian news outlets report the explosion could be linked to the same cell. Police have not commented, citing their ongoing investigation.",
      "Four police officers in Kashmir familiar with the case said the investigation that led them to the cell began with a routine probe into anti-India posters that appeared in a neighborhood in the Kashmir city of Srinagar on Oct. 19.

      "Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, is retiring at the end of his current term in February, opening up a new seat on the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee at a time that President Donald Trump is seeking to exert more ...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, will retire at the end of his current term in February, opening up a new seat on the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee at a time that President Donald Trump is seeking to exert more control over the central bank.",
      "As president of one of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional banks, Bostic, 59, serves on the 19-member committee that meets eight times a year to decide whether to change a key short-term interest rate that influences borrowing costs throughout the economy. Only 12 of the 19 participants vote on rates at each meeting. The regional Fed presidents rotate as voters, and the Atlanta Fed\u2019s president will next vote in 2027.",
      "Bostic\u2019s replacement will be selected by the Atlanta Fed\u2019s board of directors, which are made up of local business and community leaders, not the Trump administration. The terms of all the regional Fed presidents end in 2026.",
      "Bostic is the first Black and openly gay president of a regional Fed bank in the Fed's 112-year history and was first appointed in June 2017. He has recently expressed concerns that inflation is still too high for the Fed to deeply cut its key rate, and suggested he supported just one rate cut this year, while the Fed has cut twice.",
      "Bostic did not provide a reason for stepping down, but is speaking later Wednesday and could provide more details.",
      "In 2022, Bostic acknowledged that many of his financial investments and trades in previous years had violated Fed ethics rules and revised all his financial statements dating back to 2017. At the time, he said the trades were made by investment managers that he did not directly oversee and that he was unaware of the transactions.",
      "The Fed\u2019s Washington, D.C.-based board of governors will vote on whether to approve Bostic\u2019s replacement. Trump has sought to gain more control over the Fed's board, which would potentially give the administration more sway over the approval of the regional Fed presidents. Three of the current seven members of the board were appointed by Trump.",

      "Visa and Mastercard have proposed a settlement in their long-running legal dispute with merchants over interchange fees",
      "NEW YORK -- Visa and Mastercard have proposed a settlement in their long-running legal dispute with merchants and retailers over how much they charge merchants to accept their cards.",
      "The most important part of the settlement could directly impact how customers use their Visa- and Mastercard-issued credit cards, and may result in some consumers getting denied at the point-of-sale for purchases",
      "Visa and Mastercard have been in litigation with a class-action group of merchants for nearly 20 years over the costs they impose on merchants to use their payment networks, known as interchange. A previous settlement was rejected by the judge overseeing the case last this year, requiring Visa and Mastercard\u2019s lawyers to go back to the drawing board on the scope and size of the settlement.",
      "The new part of the settlement announced Monday addresses the \u201chonor all cards\u201d rule, a cornerstone of how credit and debit cards work in the U.S.",
      "The \u201chonor all cards\u201d rule states that if a merchant accepts Visa or Mastercard as a form of payment, they are required to accept all iterations of Visa and Mastercard products, regardless of who issues it and the cost to the merchant.",
      "That has led to consternation among merchants over the years because rewards-heavy credit cards, like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Citi Strata Elite, use a premium version of a Visa or Mastercard. For the Sapphire Reserve, Chase uses the Visa Infinite card, and for a card like Strata Elite, it\u2019s issued as a World Elite Mastercard. These cards have gotten far more popular in the last decade.",
      "Both a Visa Infinite and World Elite Mastercard cost more for a merchant to accept. The amount of additional interchange a merchant will pay varies on size and industry, but one example is the Visa Infinite, which can be 15 basis points (0.15%) more expensive than a Visa Signature (a mid-tier credit card) for a merchant to accept.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, merchants could discriminate between the different tiers of Visa and Mastercard products, meaning high-reward credit card users may be declined at checkout if the merchant has opted out of accepting the higher-tier card. A merchant may also be able to pass along the higher cost to accept the rewards cards to the customer in the form of a surcharge on their bill, under the proposed settlement.",
      "This will place merchants in the position of making a choice: accept all cards with the higher fees or reject some of the higher-fee cards and likely upset wealthier consumers who typically enjoy earning points on routine purchases.",

In this settlement it would be a 10 basis point reduction in swipe fees for five years, and standard credit card transactions would be processed at 1.25% of the purchase price for eight years.",
      "When the settlement was announced on Monday, the major merchant and retail lobby groups came out in opposition, so it\u2019s not certain whether this settlement will ultimately be the one that is finalized. Merchants and lobbyists have been pushing for years to get Congress to regulate interchange fees, as they do with debit cards. The merchant groups say this settlement does not go far enough.",
      "\u201cOnce again, this proposal is all window dressing and no substance. The reduction in swipe fees doesn\u2019t begin to go far enough, and the change in the honor-all-cards rule would accomplish nothing. If the courts can\u2019t fix this, it\u2019s time for Congress to take action,\u201d said Stephanie Martz, chief administrative officer and general counsel for the National Retail Federation, in a statement.",
      "The payment networks, who are ready to put the matter behind them after two decades of litigation, say this may be the best solution for the merchants to potentially avoid a drawn out trial-and-appeal process.",
      "\u201cWe believe that this is the best resolution for all parties, delivering the clarity, flexibility and consumer protections that were sought in this effort,\u201d a Mastercard company spokesperson said.",
      "The settlement involves Visa and Mastercard only. American Express, which uses a closed-loop system where it's both the issuing bank and payment network for their cards, is not involved in this ongoing litigation. The settlement also does not impact debit cards.",

      "Using a price cap of $25,000, Edmunds\u2019 team has compiled five used hybrid-powered SUVs that are practical and kind to a car shopping budget.",
      "The Escape Hybrid is the fuel-sipping cousin of Ford\u2019s popular compact SUV. Getting it down the road is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired to an electric motor. Front-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is optional. In terms of fuel economy, both the front-wheel-drive and all-wheel drive models delivers an EPA-estimated 39 mpg combined. Edmunds has complimented the Escape\u2019s comfortable ride, easy-to-use controls and everyday practicality.",
      "Look for:Arriving for the 2020 model year, the fourth-generation Escape Hybrid is a well-rounded driving companion. For 2023, Ford updated the infotainment system and exterior design. For added peace of mind, it\u2019s worth knowing the hybrid has always come standard with Ford\u2019s Co-Pilot360 bundle of driver assist features.",
      "The Honda CR-V has long been a top choice for SUV shoppers looking for reliable transportation at an affordable price. During testing, Edmunds complimented the driving refinement of the CR-V with the available hybrid powertrain. Braking and handling are equally polished, though Edmunds noted accelerating from 0 to 60 mph took 8.5 seconds \u2014 1 second longer than the non-hybrid model. Fuel economy is strong at an EPA-estimated 38 mpg combined city/highway for 2020-2022 models. The spacious interior has good outward visibility and generous cargo space.",
      "Look for:The hybrid version of the previous generation CR-V ran from 2020 through 2022. Standard equipment included all-wheel drive, a 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the Honda Sensing suite of driver assist features. Honda dropped the entry-level LX trim for the 2021 model year, so used prices tick upward from that point.",
      "Making a styling statement isn\u2019t always high on car shoppers\u2019 priority list. Hyundai didn\u2019t get that memo because the Tucson Hybrid\u2019s eye-catching design is highlighted by a sculpted exterior and headlights hidden within the pattern of the grille. Under the hood is a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder and electric motor coupled to standard all-wheel drive. Fuel economy is up to 38 mpg combined depending on the trim and model year. Better still, Edmunds notes this peppier drivetrain addresses the non-hybrid Tucson\u2019s sluggish acceleration.",
      "Look for:The redesigned Tucson created a splash when it arrived for the 2022 model year. Its upscale interior matched the bold exterior; the cabin was filled with high-quality materials, and standard features included an 8-inch touchscreen with wireless smartphone connectivity. The Tucson also has an outstanding warranty, including 10 years/100,000 miles of powertrain coverage.",

      "The Niro makes a strong case for itself based on its lower price point and excellent economy. Along with the Niro hybrid, there are plug-in and fully electrified versions. Given its small size, the Niro delivers a surprising amount of passenger space and cargo room. The ride is generally smooth, though Edmunds noted it can get unsettled on bumpy roads. A class-leading warranty and up to an EPA-estimated 53 mpg combined, depending on the trim and model year, are two additional standout qualities.",
      "Look for:A redesign for the 2023 model year gave the Niro a futuristic shape and improved cabin quality. Edmunds complimented the interior design but found some audio and climate controls overly finicky. The Niro is also front-wheel-drive, with no option to add all-wheel drive. Yet its budget-friendly prices mean used versions readily come in below $25,000.",
      "The RAV4 Hybrid uses the strong foundation of Toyota\u2019s best-selling SUV and adds greater fuel economy and speedier acceleration. Edmunds found the all-wheel-drive RAV4 Hybrid needed 7.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph \u2014 a second faster than the non-hybrid version. Fuel economy is excellent thanks to EPA-estimated combined average of up to 40 mpg depending on trim and model year. The RAV4 also has near class-leading cargo space, plus a low load floor that\u2019s appreciated when loading heavy items.",
      "Look for:The fifth generation of the RAV4 and RAV4 Hybrid was available from 2019 to 2025. Outside of some upgraded tech touches \u2014 such as a larger touchscreen and improved smartphone connectivity \u2014 changes were minimal. The RAV4 holds onto its resale value, so older used models will more easily fall under $25,000.",
      "A well-maintained used hybrid SUV is a savvy way to save money when sealing the deal and in terms of keeping fuel bills reasonable.",

The report noted that many natural gas projects were approved in 2025, due to changes in U.S. policy, indicating worldwide supply will rise even as questions remain about how it will be used.

      "\u201cWhen we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once,\u201d Birol said. \u201cWith energy security front and (center) for many governments, their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that can arise with other policy goals \u2013 on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change.\u201d",
      "In a conference call Wednesday, Birol said: \u201cWe will still use oil, we will still use gas. But the growth of electricity demand is spectacular.\u201d",
      "He noted the role transportation plays in accounting for 45% of global oil consumption, for example. \u201cHow the electrification of the transportation takes place, especially in countries beyond China and Europe, will determine the shape of the oil demand and growth.\u201d",
      "Wednesday's edition of the yearly report is the first released since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second term. Trump's administration has for a second time opted out of the Paris agreement, rolled back dozens of climate regulations, slashed federal support for renewable energies such as wind and solar power and is reversing the \u201cendangerment finding\u201d that sits at the core of U.S. climate policy.",
      "Trump has pledged his support instead to the fossil fuel industry, investing in coal and loosening restrictions on pollution.",
      "But energy analysts said the shift to clean power is happening regardless of climate policy around the world.",
      "\u201cThe evidence on the ground is overwhelming. EV sales are taking off in many emerging countries, solar is permeating even through the Middle East,\u201d said Dave Jones, chief analyst at global energy think tank Ember. \"Renewables and electrification will dominate the future.\u201d",

      "A little more than a year ago, Ryan Sprankle welcomed President Donald Trump to one of the three grocery stores his family owns near Pittsburgh. Trump was on the campaign trail; they talked about high grocery prices, and the Republican nominee picked up a bag of popcorn.",
      "But these days, Sprankle would have a different message if Trump or any lawmakers visited his store. He wants them to know that delayed SNAP benefits during the government shutdown hurt his customers and his small, independent chain.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t take away from the most needy people in the country. It\u2019s inhumane,\u201d Sprankle said. \u201cIt's a lack of empathy and it's on all their hands.",
      "The Trump administration froze funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at the end of October, impacting food access for some 42 million Americans. On Monday, the U.S. Senate passed legislation that would reopen the federal government and replenish SNAP funds, but the U.S. House of Representatives still must consider the bill. It's unclear when SNAP payments might resume if the government reopens.",
      "In 2024, SNAP recipients redeemed a little more than $96 billion in benefits, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the program. The majority \u2013 74% -- was spent at superstores and supermarkets, a category that includes big chains like Walmart and Kroger but also some independent stores like Sprankle's.",
      "Around 14% was spent at smaller grocery and convenience stores, businesses often tucked into neighborhoods and more easily accessible to SNAP beneficiaries.",
      "Etharin Cousin, a former director of the United Nations World Food Program and founder of the nonprofit Food Systems for the Future, said the cutoff of SNAP benefits had immediate impacts on grocers and convenience stores of all sizes, most of which operate on slim profit margins of 1% to 2%.",
      "\u201cSNAP isn\u2019t just a social safety net for families. It\u2019s also a local economic engine,\u201d Cousin said. \u201cSNAP benefits flow directly into neighborhoods, stores, regional distributors and community jobs.\u201d",
      "Walmart declined to comment on the impact of the SNAP funding lapse but noted that it has been lowering prices and donating to local food banks. Kroger also declined to comment.",
      "Shoppers not receiving their food benefits affects all retailers but becomes \u201ca big problem more quickly\u201d at small chains, Sprankle said. His Kittanning, Pennsylvania, store gets 25% of its revenue from SNAP, but customers who don't get government assistance also are worried about the shutdown, according to Sprankle. They're spending less, trading down to cheaper goods or heading to food banks, he said.",
      "Sprankle said lower sales cut into the overtime he can offer to the chain's 140 employees. Many are worried about losing their jobs, he said.",

      "Air travelers could face more frustration as U.S. airports need to meet a higher FAA target for reducing flights",
      "Air travelers could face more frustration as busy U.S. airports need to meet a higher Federal Aviation Administration target for reducing flights Tuesday after already canceling thousands to scale back demands on the nation\u2019s aviation system during the government shutdown.",
      "The FAA ordered domestic airlines last week to drop 4% of their flights at 40 major U.S. airports, saying absences and signs of stress among traffic controllers made it imperative to act in the name of public safety. After already canceling more than 7,900 since Friday, the goal for cutting flights is set to rise to 6% on Tuesday and again to 10% on Friday.",
      "But it was unclear exactly how many additional flights would need to be canceled Tuesday. The average cancellation rate over the last few days already exceeded the FAA\u2019s requirement, according to aviation analytics company Cirium. The FAA also expanded its flight restrictions Monday, barring business jets and many private flights from using a dozen airports already under commercial flight limits.",
      "However, controller shortages continued to lead to flight delays, including one of about five hours for arriving flights Monday evening at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport, where wintry weather added to staffing-related disruptions earlier in the day. The FAA warned that staffing at over a dozen towers and control centers could delay planes departing for Phoenix, San Diego, the New York area and Houston, among other cities.",
      "Freezing weather in parts of the country on Tuesday could cause further delays and cancellations.",
      "The Senate passed legislation Monday to reopen the government, but the bill still needs to clear the House and final passage could be days away. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy made clear last week that flight cuts will remain until the FAA sees staffing levels stabilize at its air traffic control facilities.",
      "Many planes also aren\u2019t where they\u2019re supposed to be, which could slow the airlines\u2019 return to normal operations even after the FAA lifts the order, said Mike Taylor, who leads research on airports and airlines at J.D. Power.",
      "Todd Walker said he missed his mom\u2019s 80th birthday when his flight was canceled over the weekend.",

      "That's typical, analysts say, of the trend for the extended discount campaign that is China's equivalent to Black Friday sales, initiated by China\u2019s Alibaba in 2009 as a 1-day event on Nov. 11 -- Double 11 in Chinese parlance, and considered a symbol of unattached singles.",

      "Chinese retail data provider Syntun said that as of Oct. 31, the combined gross value for this year\u2019s Singles\u2019 Day had topped 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion). In 2024, it estimated sales rose about 26% year-on-year to 1.44 trillion yuan.",

      "\u201cConfidence remains quite downbeat among households,\u201d said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history appears to be nearing an end, but not without leaving a mark on an already-struggling economy.",
      "About 1.25 million federal workers haven't been paid since Oct. 1. Thousands of flights have been canceled, a trend that is expected to continue this week even as Congress moves toward reopening the government. Government contract awards have slowed and some food aid recipients have seen their benefits interrupted.",
      "Most of the lost economic activity will be recovered when the government reopens, as federal workers will receive back pay. But some canceled flights won't be retaken, missed restaurant meals won't be made up, and some postponed purchases will end up not happening at all.",
      "\u201cShort-lived shutdowns are usually invisible in the data, but this one will leave a lasting mark,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at accounting giant EY said, \"both because of its record length and the growing disruptions to welfare programs and travel.\u201d",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a six-week shutdown will reduce growth in this year's fourth quarter by about 1.5 percentage points. That would cut growth by half from the third quarter. The reopening should boost first-quarter growth next year by 2.2 percentage points, the CBO projected, but about $11 billion in economic activity will be permanently lost.",
      "The previous longest government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days but only partially shut the government because many agencies had been fully funded. It only nicked the economy by about 0.02% of GDP, the CBO said then.",
      "The current shutdown is adding to the economy's existing challenges, which include sluggish hiring, stubbornly elevated inflation, and President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have caused uncertainty for many businesses. Still, few economists foresee a recession.",
      "About 650,000 federal workers didn't work during the shutdown, which will likely boost the unemployment rate by about 0.4 percentage points in October, or to 4.7% from 4.3% in August, when the last report was released. Those workers would all then be counted as employed once the government reopens.",
      "Here are the ways the government closure is weighing on the economy:",
      "All told, federal workers will have missed about $16 billion in wages by mid-November, the CBO estimates. That has meant less spending at stores, restaurants, and likely reduced holiday travel. Large purchases will probably be postponed, slowing the broader economy.",
      "Trump had threatened during the shutdown to not provide back pay but the deal struck in Congress would replace those lost wages once the government reopens.",
      "The shutdown has added to the Washington, D.C. area's economic woes, where the unemployment rate was already 6% before the shutdown, after Trump's cuts to the federal workforce this spring caused job losses. While the Washington, D.C. area \u2014 including the nearby suburbs in Virginia and Maryland \u2014 has the highest concentration of federal workers, most live and work outside of the nation's capital.",
      "Federal workers make up about 5.5% of Maryland's workforce, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. But they also comprise 2.9% of New Mexico's workers, 2.6% of Oklahoma's, and 3.8% of Alaska's.",
      "Then there are the federal contractors. Bernard Yaros, an economist at Oxford Economics, estimates they could total as many as 5.2 million, and they are not guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends.",
      "Airlines scrapped more than 2,000 flights by Monday evening after canceling 5,500 since Friday on orders from the Federal Aviation Administration, which is seeking to reduce the burden on overworked air traffic controllers, who have now missed two paychecks.",
      "Even before the flight cancellations, Tourism Economics, an economic consulting firm, estimated that the shutdown would reduce travel spending by $63 million a day, which means a six-week standoff would cost the travel industry $2.6 billion.",

      "Consumer sentiment dropped to a three-year low and close to the lowest point ever recorded in a survey by the University of Michigan, reported Friday, with pessimism over personal finances and anticipated business conditions weighing on Americans.",
      "The November survey showed the index of consumer sentiment at 50.4, down a startling 6.2% from last month and a plunge of nearly 30% from a year ago.",

      "Yaros estimates that about $800 million in new contracts were at risk of not being awarded each day of the shutdown.",
      "\u201cThe federal award spigot has all but turned off at the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d Yaros wrote.",
      "The shutdown delayed the payment of $8 billion in monthly SNAP food aid to 42 million recipients in November, creating a significant financial disruption for many households that likely reduced spending. Some states have managed to pay full benefits for this month, though the Trump administration is still fighting over the issue in court.",
      "The deal currently under consideration in Congress to reopen the government includes full funding of SNAP benefits.",
      "The government shutdown cut off the flow of economic data on unemployment, inflation, and retail spending that the Federal Reserve depends on to monitor the economy's health. Even as the government reopens, some of that data will still be delayed. As a result, the Fed may not deliver a third interest rate cut at its December meeting, which was widely expected before the shutdown.",
      "\u201cWhat do you do if you're driving in the fog? You slow down,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference late last month.",
      "Powell said the Fed's interest-rate setting committee is deeply divided over whether to reduce its key rate, partly because the economy's health is unusually cloudy right now. The government has missed two monthly jobs reports and the October inflation data, scheduled to be published Thursday, will likely never be issued.",
      "Powell said a rate cut in December was not a \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d and added that the lack of data could contribute to a decision by the Fed to skip a rate cut at its next meeting December 9-10. Fewer rate cuts could discourage borrowing and spending and weigh on the economy in the coming months.",

      "Retirement saving requires key decisions: when to start, how much to save, and where to invest. The investing decision has drawn more attention as government regulators work to open 401(k) plans to alternative assets such as private market investments.",
      "Below, we compare the paths of two hypothetical retirement savers and their outcomes.",
      "Laura and JR are two 25-year-olds newly employed at the same company, in the same role.",
      "On her first day at work, Laura committed 10% of her $75,000 salary to her 401(k). That earned her company\u2019s 3% annual match (it matches 50% up to 6%), and 13% in total savings. She still had room in her budget for weekends filled with activities.",
      "JR was more worried about now. Rather than putting money into a 401(k) he wouldn\u2019t touch for decades, he enjoyed his $75,000 salary. Five years later, JR began to build his nest egg. He opted for the minimum contribution rate to qualify for the company match, contributing 6% with a 3% match.",
      "Laura and JR\u2019s employer offered many investment vehicles, including target-date funds. One invested only in public stocks and bonds; the other kept a 15% allocation to private equity and private credit across the glide path.",
      "Laura preferred the public-only target-date fund for its simplicity and transparency. JR was also drawn to the target-date options and their ease of use. However, he went with the private market option since it promised higher returns, and to make up for his late start. He figured he could quickly recover five years of missed contributions, given that he had 35 years until retirement.",
      "Laura and JR both rose steadily to senior management positions. Their career progression, and their salaries, stayed in tandem. By the time they were turning 65 and approaching retirement, each was earning $178,620 a year. There had been no changes to their 401(k) contribution rates or their company\u2019s matching formula. As Laura and JR prepared to retire, they reviewed their 401(k)s.",
      "For JR, the target-date fund with private markets had paid off. Over 35 years of investing, the fund delivered an annualized return of 8.9%, compared with 8.4% for the public-only option. This left him with a balance of about $2 million. Combined with Social Security, JR felt that he could enjoy retirement without the risk of outliving his savings.",
      "The public-only TDF underperformed compared with the private markets TDF, but Laura didn\u2019t mind. Over 40 years of investing, her 401(k) account balance grew to more than $3 million. By starting earlier and contributing more she harnessed the power of compounding returns to a much greater extent than JR had.",
      "JR\u2019s private markets sleeve gave him a small edge, but Laura\u2019s decision to start saving earlier and save more made the real difference. Compounding did the rest, turning her steady contributions into a balance far larger than JR\u2019s.",

      "In illustrating the importance of saving early and saving more, we had to make several assumptions. We assumed that Laura and JR earn the same salary and stay at the same employer for their entire careers, with no breaks in employment. We assumed stocks, bonds, and private markets all delivered the long-term return expectations set by Morningstar Investment Management. It\u2019s not a given that a target-date fund with a 15% allocation to private markets would outperform a similar strategy focused solely on public stocks and bonds, especially after fees.",
      "There is debate about whether private equity funds outperform their public counterparts. A Morningstar analysis concluded that private equity funds are best thought of as another form of active management, where a handful of funds may significantly outperform their peers, but median returns are similar (or worse) to public market funds.",

      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- With Jaxson Dart in concussion protocol, Jameis Winston is taking over as the New York Giants\u2019 starting quarterback for their game Sunday against Green Bay.",
      "It is interim coach Mike Kafka\u2019s first big decision since taking over following the firing of Brian Daboll and auditioning for the full-time job by showing what he can do in the final games of this lost season. Kafka announced the move prior to practice Wednesday, his first in charge, saying it was his call.",
      "\u201cJameis has done a great job since he\u2019s been here,\u201d Kafka said. \"I got good feel for those guys, and I think Jameis will do a heck of a job. He\u2019s a great leader, he has a lot of production in this league and I think he\u2019s going to do a great job leading that group.\u201d",
      "Kafka opted for Winston over former starter Russell Wilson, who had served as Dart\u2019s backup since getting benched for the rookie after an 0-3 start.",
      "\u201cRuss understands the direction we\u2019re going moving forward,\u201d Kafka said. \u201cRuss is a true pro, and I know he\u2019s been through a couple tough things. Listen, the way he responds is unbelievable, and I have a ton of respect for Russ. He\u2019s going to be the backup this week. He\u2019s one play away just like he was last week, and so we need him and he\u2019s a crucial part of our offense.\"",
      "Wilson, who turns 37 later this month and is not signed beyond this season, was 3 of 7 for 45 yards in relief of Dart last weekend at Chicago when the Giants blew another late lead, losing 24-20 and falling to 2-8.",
      "That defeat led ownership to fire Daboll and promote Kafka, the 38-year-old offensive coordinator who had interviewed for several NFL head-coaching vacancies but had not run a team at any level until now. Kafka could be one of the candidates considered following the season, along with other QB gurus with an eye on developing Dart at football's most important position.",
      "Kafka, 38, said his focus is solely on players and coming up with a game plan, rather than thinking about his future and showing off for ownership and general manager Joe Schoen. Kafka promoted tight ends coach Tim Kelly to be offensive coordinator but will still call plays.",
      "\u201cReally smart coach. He\u2019ll help us tie in the run game and the pass game,\u201d Kafka said. \"He does a great job with a lot of experiences to bank on.\"",

      "Jacksonville Jaguars coach Liam Coen says it's too early to discuss whether Travis Hunter will play on both sides of the ball in 2026",
      "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- It\u2019s too early to determine whether Travis Hunter will continue to play on both sides of the ball, Jacksonville Jaguars coach Liam Coen said Wednesday.",
      "Hunter had season-ending surgery Tuesday to repair a ligament in his right knee and is expected to return to the football field within six months. He injured his knee during a noncontract drill in practice last month.",
      "\u201cAll of that is very premature,\u201d Coen said about whether Hunter could play both receiver and cornerback in 2026. \u201cAt the end of the day, like every player on this roster, he\u2019ll be evaluated at the end of the season, and we\u2019ll be able to give him his three better, three best and the things that we need to continue to improve upon and the things we need to build on.\u201d",
      "Hunter was coming off a career performance in London before his injury. The 2024 Heisman Trophy winner from Colorado caught eight passes for 101 yards and a touchdown against the Los Angeles Rams, and the Jaguars (5-4) were planning to use him as their No. 1 receiver moving forward in hopes of minimizing drops.",
      "The injury, though, surely will stunt his NFL growth. Hunter never really looked like the guy first-time general manager James Gladstone said could \"alter the sport itself.\u201d Hunter was neither the rebuilding team's best cornerback nor its best receiver.",
      "And Jacksonville traded two premium draft picks to move up three spots and select him second overall in April. The Jaguars dealt a second-rounder in 2025 and a first-rounder in 2026 to swap first-round spots with Cleveland.",

      "He finished with 28 receptions for 298 yards and a score. He also had 15 tackles and three pass defenses.",
      "\u201cAlso looking at, \u2018OK, where do we need him most, in more ways than others,\u2019\u201d Coen said. \u201cThe thing has been a learning experiment. But getting to know the person has obviously been the most important thing and the type of competitor, the way that he learns, the way that he competes, the way that he practices, that\u2019s stuff that we\u2019ve been able to gain valuable information on and be able to use moving forward and actually put in a continued practice.\u201d",

      "There is growing concern among college football coaches about spots in the Power Four conference title games coming down to tiebreakers instead of play on the field",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Just the thought of it makes Pat Narduzzi cringe.",
      "There the Pitt football coach is, standing in front of his players after a largely successful season, explaining to the Panthers why they aren't going to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game. It might not have anything to do with what they did or didn't do on the field, but because of a spreadsheet that explains the league's byzantine tiebreaker policy says.",
      "\u201cI think there's nothing worse than walking in a team room saying, \u2018Sorry guys, we\u2019re not going because we didn't play that team or they didn't play that team,'\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201cBut it's not my job, it's what (the ACC) did.\u201d",
      "The recent expansion to super-sized versions of the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12 and SEC \u2014 all of which have at least 16 teams, all of which have done away with the idea of separate divisions \u2014 means the days of \u201ceverybody pretty much playing everybody\u201d and having it largely sorted out between the lines are long gone in the chase to reach the College Football Playoff.",
      "Welcome to the superconference era of, as Duke coach Manny Diaz put it, \u201cunintended consequences.\u201d And it's especially messy in the ACC.",
      "There\u2019s a real chance that at least one of the two spots in the ACC championship will be determined by criteria other than head-to-head. The list of tiebreakers that follows includes record against common opponents and the combined winning percentage of conference opponents.",
      "That one is particularly problematic for Narduzzi, whose 23rd-ranked Panthers (7-2, 5-1) are among five one-loss teams while No. 16 Miami and No. 19 Louisville lurk close behind in the league race. Conference schedules are set years in advance. The second-winningest coach in Pitt history wonders why a team should be penalized for having a lackluster schedule during a given year, when that schedule is out of his hands.",
      "Asked if it\u2019s fair for teams to be at the mercy of the schedule makers, he shook his head.",
      "\u201cNot fair at all,\u201d he said.",
      "Narduzzi preferred the old ACC model featuring two divisions. Teams played each of their division peers, with a limited number of games against the other division.",
      "Pitt won its only ACC championship in 2021 by winning the Coastal Division, then topping Wake Forest in the title game. The Panthers went 7-1 to finish a game clear of the Coastal field, beating all but Miami that season. It all kind of made sense.",
      "Now?",
      "\u201cIt will make you dizzy,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't even look at the standings. I don't care.\u201d",
      "Pitt closes with a trip to No. 14 Georgia Tech and a home finale against Miami, while Diaz and Duke (5-4, 4-1) will try to make things even murkier on Saturday when the Blue Devils face No. 20 Virginia (8-2, 5-1).",
      "It makes Diaz long for a simpler time. During his high school career at Miami Country Day, there was once a five-team tie for a playoff spot. So all five teams met at the same stadium and played a series of Kansas tiebreakers (meaning possession starts at the opponent's 10-yard line) until a winner emerged.",
      "\u201cI'm all for it if five teams want to show up in Charlotte or whatever, just put the ball down at the 10 and figure out the ACC championship,\u201d he said with a laugh.",

      "As for Virginia, the surprising Cavaliers have had their own quirky slate.",
      "The team picked to finish 14th in the ACC in the preseason lost only once in the first two months. That came at N.C. State in a nonconference matchup between longtime league members, which didn't count in the league race because it came outside the league's scheduling model. That game wouldn't factor into any league tiebrakers, though the Cavaliers' wiggle room vanished in last weekend's home upset loss to Wake Forest that included quarterback Chandler Morris being knocked from the game.",
      "Still, coach Tony Elliott \u2014 who happens to have a degree in industrial engineering and is a self-proclaimed \u201cmath guy\u201d \u2014 knows there's at least one simple route.",
      "\u201cI think if you win all your ACC games, you know you have an opportunity to be in Charlotte,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, that stuff is too complicated. Even though I\u2019m a math guy. It hurts my brain. So I've got to focus on getting the team ready to play, not what the tiebreaker scenarios are.\u201d",
      "The tiebreakers could have a major say in the other power conferences, too.",
      "The Big 12 has six teams with no more than two league losses, and the only remaining head-to-head matchup between those teams is No. 12 BYU (8-1, 5-1) at No. 22 Cincinnati (7-2, 5-1) on Nov. 22. The only teams with total control of their destiny to get to the Big 12 title game in Arlington, Texas, are No. 8 Texas Tech (9-1, 6-1) and the winner of that BYU-Cincinnati game.",
      "In the Southeastern Conference, No. 3 Texas A&M and No. 4 Alabama are undefeated in league play. The Crimson Tide can secure a spot in the Atlanta title game by beating No. 11 Oklahoma in Tuscaloosa on Saturday and by winning the Iron Bowl at Auburn two weeks later. The Aggies can punch their ticket by topping South Carolina in College Station this weekend and then winning at No. 10 Texas two weeks later.",
      "If either stumbles, league tiebreakers would come into play and open the door for one-loss teams like No. 5 Georgia, No. 6 Mississippi and No. 10 Texas.",
      "And in the Big Ten, No. 1 Ohio State and No. 2 Indiana are the only unbeaten teams. They don't play each other in the regular season and are on a collision course to meet in Indianapolis for the league title. No. 18 Michigan \u2014 which hosts the Buckeyes on Nov. 29 in Ann Arbor \u2014 No. 7 Oregon and No. 17 Southern California still have paths if the Buckeyes or Hoosiers slip up.",

      "MADRID -- Forget about Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid. For some sports fans in the Spanish capital, the team to follow is the Madrid Bravos.",
      "The recently created American football franchise has begun to attract more fans in a country where soccer rules.",
      "After recently completing its second season in the European League of Football, the Bravos are hoping to ride the wave of extra attention the sport is getting as Spain hosts its first regular-season NFL game this weekend.",

      "\u201cA quick shoutout to the Madrid Bravos,\u201d he said before taking questions.",
      "There are an estimated 11 million NFL followers in Spain, according to the league, and a growing number of these fans have been turning their attention to the local teams.",
      "The Bravos averaged 3,000 fans at the Vallehermoso stadium this season, up from about 1,000 per game in its first year. With the focus on a family-oriented experience that includes tailgate parties, mascots, cheerleaders and halftime attractions, the club has become attractive to both hardcore fans and those new to the game.",

There\u2019s a connection between the players and the fans, and that adds another dimension to it. That\u2019s something you don\u2019t get in professional soccer.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe NFL helps give more visibility to the sport,\u201d Bravos owner and general manager Jaime Mart\u00edn told The Associated Press. \u201cWith Spain in the NFL map, more people are going to be talking about American football, and when people talk about American football in Spain, they will also talk about the Bravos and the local teams.\u201d",
      "The Bravos franchise \u2014 a semi-professional operation \u2014 was created in 2023, taking advantage of the increasing interest in the sport created by the NFL's international expansion and the early success of the European League of Football. The team made the playoffs of the ELF in its first two seasons, losing in the first round both times to the eventual league champion.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to build our fan base in these first few years,\u201d Mart\u00edn said. \u201cThe goal for next season is to start having 5,000 people in the matches.

      "\u201cIt was a really cool experience,\u201d Sinnett told the AP on Tuesday before heading to Madrid, where he will participate in activities promoted by both the Bravos and the Dolphins.",

      "Sinnett said American football in Europe remains on a \u201ctotally different level\u201d from the NFL, but it gave him the opportunity to travel and \"experience new cultures and make new friends.\"",
      "The Bravos\u2019 squad also included wide receiver Aron Cruickshank, who spent time on the practice squads for the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Chicago Bears.",
      "The Bravos were coached by Andrew Weidinger, a former assistant coach with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The team\u2019s coach next season will be Dave Warner, whose past experience includes time at Michigan State and working with quarterbacks such as Kirk Cousins, Brian Hoyer and Nick Foles. His offensive line coach will be Terry Malone, who was a tight ends coach when the New Orleans Saints won the Super Bowl in 2010.",
      "Contrary to what the NFL Europe did in the late 1990s and 2000s, the ELF is focused on homegrown talent, with only 10 foreign players allowed on each squad, including only four Americans. The goal is to help develop local talent and have them learn from more experienced players.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to have the opportunity to play at a professional level in your own country,\u201d Bravos defensive lineman Victor dos Santos said. \"It\u2019s pretty cool to be able to play with some of these players who were in the NFL or played in college in the U.S. They help everyone grow with the experience and the know-how that they bring.\u201d",
      "Like most players on the squad, Dos Santos has a temporary contract during the season and needs to have a regular job, which in his case is working at technology company Lenovo.",
      "With the sport growing, though, there is hope for a different future.",
      "\u201cAs the league continues to grow, there will be more opportunities and hopefully people will be able to fully dedicate themselves to it,\u201d he said.",

It's a change the men will not have to deal with, but that a women's field that could include the last two world champions, Sha'Carri Richardson and Melissa Jefferson-Wooden, and Olympic champ Julien Alfred are being given nearly three years to prepare for.",

Let me know early, and I\u2019ll start training to run three 100s in one day.\u201d",
      "Swimming has traditionally kicked off the Summer Games, but because the opening ceremony is taking place at SoFi Stadium, same as the swim meet, organizers decided to make the swap. It was not feasible to set up the pool in the stadium so quickly after the ceremony.",
      "Evans, who won four Olympic gold medals in 1988 and 1992, said the prospect of swimming in what is largely considered LA's best new stadium in front of 38,000 fans is an opportunity her sport embraced. Also, swimmers are often forced to miss the opening because they compete the very next day.",

      "McLaughlin-Levrone is the world-record holder and two-time defending champion in the hurdles. She took a year off from that to run in the 400 sprint this year, where at the world championships she became the first runner since 1985 to run the lap in less than 48 seconds (47.78).

      "Global leaders have descended upon Brazil for COP30, and with the conference often comes a lot of negative news that evokes climate anxiety and dread",
      "Every autumn, news feeds get flooded with stories about climate change. That's because around this time each year, global leaders gather to discuss collective efforts to limit our emissions of planet-warming gases, released primarily from oil, gas and coal.",
      "Some of the information coming out of the COP30 conference is bleak. But it's not just COP. Climate stories can be difficult to consume year-round, whether it's about natural disasters, victims of heat waves or sea level rise or new studies about global warming impacts.",
      "\u201cWhen you throw a ton of scary facts and information at people, their nervous system shuts down. It\u2019s a coping mechanism,\u201d said Sarah Newman, founder and executive director of the Climate Mental Health Network.",
      "That sense of dread, doom, fear or hopelessness gets lumped into a single term: climate anxiety. Surveys from the American Psychiatric Association have repeatedly shown that a significant amount of Americans experience climate anxiety.",
      "Dealing with it, just like dealing with climate change, is an ongoing process. Here's how to get started.",
      "Imagine you leave the house in the morning, and realize you left the stove on. There's a fire hazard at home, and you're feeling anxious about it. So you turn around and switch it off. The problem is solved, and so is your anxiety.",
      "Climate change doesn't work that way.",
      "It activates different parts of the brain, according to a study published by the National Institutes of Health. While Generalized Anxiety Disorder often involves the part of the brain that handles fear, threat and emotion, climate anxiety activates parts of the brain that help with high cognition, willpower and tenacity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing larger problem that I need to attend to over time and that is largely out of my control,\u201d climate psychologist Thomas Doherty said. \u201dI can\u2019t just flip a switch around climate change.\u201d",
      "The anxiety is more complex than a stove left on, because climate change is a more complex problem. The threat is indefinite, it\u2019s largely out of each person\u2019s control and addressing it requires repeated and variable action.",
      "Doherty, who wrote a book about coping with climate anxiety, said that it isn't inherently negative. It's a natural reaction to a threat, and it's the first step in a cyclical relationship with climate change.",
      "\u201cThe rest of the cycle is ultimately taking some action to resolve the threat as best that we can,\u201d he said.",
      "Newman said that one of the most effective ways to combat climate anxiety is to find other people who are experiencing it too, and to talk about it.",
      "Every year, New York City hosts something called Climate Week. Folks from all over descend upon Manhattan for hundreds of events and panels on energy, the environment and climate change.",
      "Between 15 and 20 people showed up to one event about finding connection and hope in the face of climate change. It was intimate, but so is confiding feelings of dread and isolation with a room full of strangers.",

Another one is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, where you identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste.",

      "A power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, is impacting global auto production",
      "A battle for control of a little-known chipmaker has threatened global auto production by choking off the semiconductor supply chain, though there are signs the crisis is inching toward a resolution.",
      "The power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, highlights how technology supply chain vulnerabilities are squeezing auto makers, most notably forcing Honda to halt production at a Mexican factory making its popular HR-V crossover for North American markets. It also exposes how Europe is caught in the middle of the wider geopolitical showdown between Washington and Beijing.",
      "Here's a look at the dispute:",
      "The turmoil erupted into public view in mid-October, when the Dutch government announced it had invoked a rarely used World War II-era law to take effective control of Nexperia weeks earlier.",
      "The Dutch ministry of economic affairs said it took action because of national security concerns. Officials said they intervened because of \u201cserious governance shortcomings\u201d at Nexperia, asserting control to prevent the loss of crucial tech know-how that could threaten Europe's economic security.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s Chinese owner Wingtech Technology, a partially state-owned company, is at the heart of the dispute. Amid the boardroom battle, a Dutch court granted the ministry's request to oust Nexperia's Chinese CEO Zhang Xuezheng. American officials told the Dutch government he would have to be replaced to avoid trade restrictions, according to a court filing.",
      "Nexperia makes simple semiconductors such as switches and logic chips. The auto industry \u2014 one of Nexperia's biggest markets \u2014 uses its chips for numerous functions, such as adaptive LED headlight controllers, electric vehicle battery management systems and anti-lock brakes.",
      "Headquartered in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, Nexperia was spun off from Philips Semiconductors two decades ago. It was eventually purchased by China's Wingtech Technology in 2018 for $3.6 billion.",
      "Nexperia has wafer fabrication plants in Britain and Germany. It operates an assembly and testing center in China's southern manufacturing heartland of Guangdong \u2014 which accounts for around 70% of its end-product capacity \u2014 and similar centers in the Philippines and Malaysia.",
      "The dispute is part of the broader struggle between the U.S. and China over tech supremacy, which has left Europe caught in the middle.",
      "It stems from Washington\u2019s decision late last year to place Wingtech on its \u201centity list,\" which subjects companies to export controls because of national security risks. In late September, the U.S. expanded that list to Wingtech\u2019s subsidiaries, including Nexperia, pressuring allies to follow suit.",
      "After the Dutch government asserted control of Nexperia, Beijing responded soon after, blocking the export of Nexperia chips from its assembly plant in the Chinese city of Dongguan. It blamed the Netherlands for \u201cturmoil and chaos\u201d in the chip supply chain.",
      "There were signs of hope following last month's high-profile meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, when the White House said Beijing would ease the export ban as part of a U.S.-China trade truce.",
      "Despite Beijing also confirming exports would be allowed to resume, Nexperia\u2019s Chinese unit said headquarters suspended shipments of wafers used to make chips to its Chinese factory, potentially crimping its ability to deliver finished products.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s head office hit back in a statement Wednesday, saying the Chinese unit refused to pay for the wafers and accused it of \u201cignoring the lawful instructions\" from its global management team. The company said it can\u2019t guarantee the quality of any chips delivered from its China plant since Oct. 13.",
      "Modern automobiles rely on so-called discrete chips made by companies like Nexperia, which, unlike more advanced microprocessors, perform a single function. Leaders at big carmakers spelled out their worries in the latest round of earnings calls, saying that finding a replacement for Nexperia at scale in the short term will be difficult.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Don\u2019t lose sleep over headlines linking melatonin to heart failure.",
      "That\u2019s the message after some scary-sounding reports about a preliminary study involving the sleep-related supplement. It raised questions about the safety of long term use of melatonin for insomnia.",
      "Doctors have long known that too little or interrupted sleep raises the risk of heart disease. But heart experts say this kind of so-called observational study can't prove that melatonin use plays any role \u2014 instead of the insomnia patients were trying to treat.",
      "\u201cWe should not raise the alarm and tell patients to stop taking all their melatonin,\u201d said Dr. Pratik Sandesara, an interventional cardiologist at Emory Healthcare who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Our bodies naturally produce melatonin, a hormone that regulates our sleep cycles. Levels normally increase as it gets darker in the evening, triggering drowsiness.",
      "People may take lab-produced melatonin to help them fall asleep or to adjust for jet lag or time changes.",
      "The new study used international electronic health records, tracking adults diagnosed with insomnia who had a melatonin prescription that suggested they used the supplement for at least a year.",
      "Over five years, 4.6% of the chronic melatonin users developed heart failure compared to 2.7% of insomnia patients whose charts showed no melatonin use, the researchers found. The study is being presented at an American Heart Association meeting but hasn\u2019t undergone peer review.",
      "But only certain countries require a melatonin prescription. It\u2019s over-the-counter in the U.S., meaning Americans in the study might have used the supplements without it being recorded, said Northwestern University cardiology chief Dr. Clyde Yancy, who wasn't involved in the study.

      "Also, U.S. supplements don\u2019t require government approval, meaning brands can vary in their ingredients. The researchers, from SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, characterized the findings as a call for more research.",

      "James Watson, the scientist who co-discovered the structure of DNA, died on Nov. 6, 2025, at the age of 97",
      "On a foggy Saturday morning in 1953, a tall, skinny 24-year-old man fiddled with shapes he had cut out of cardboard. They represented fragments of a DNA molecule, and young James Watson was trying to figure how they fit together in a way that let DNA do its job as the stuff of genes.",
      "Suddenly, he realized that they joined together to form the \u201crungs\u201d of a long, twisted ladder, a shape better known nowadays as a double helix.",
      "His first reaction: \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d",
      "But it was more than that. Discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was a breakthrough that would help open the way to a revolution in medicine, biology and other fields as diverse as crime-fighting, genealogy and ethics.",
      "Watson died Thursday, according to his former research lab. The Chicago-born scientist was 97 years old. His career was marked by significant achievements, including his role in mapping the human genome. However, his legacy is complicated by controversial remarks on race, which led to his condemnation and loss of honorary titles.",
      "Figuring out the double helix \u201cgoes down as one of the three most important discoveries in the history of biology,\u201d alongside Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution through natural selection and Gregor Mendel\u2019s fundamental laws of genetics, said Bruce Stillman, president of the Cold Spring Harbor lab, on Friday.",
      "Watson shared the Nobel Prize with collaborator Francis Crick and scientist Maurice Wilkins. They were aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in his book \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked.",
      "Both of his Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004. Franklin died in 1958.",
      "Their discovery instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how a cell duplicates its DNA before dividing so that each resulting cell inherits a copy. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.",
      "\u201cFrancis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\u201d Watson once said. He also wrote: \u201cThere was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\u201d",
      "Among non-scientists, the double helix has become an instantly recognized symbol of science. And for researchers, it helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees.",
      "That in turn has raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering a person\u2019s genome in a way that is transmitted to one\u2019s offspring.",
      "Watson\u2019s initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease, maybe in time to help his son.",
      "Watson never made another lab finding as big as the double helix. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",

      "He apologized, but after an international furor he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. He retired a week later. He had served in various leadership jobs there for nearly 40 years.",

      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab revoked several honorary titles it had given Watson, saying his statements were \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cunsupported by science.\u201d",
      "Watson\u2019s combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \u201ca regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\u201d Dr. Francis Collins, then-director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \u201cHis outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim\u2019s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\u201d",
      "Long before that, Watson scorned political correctness.",
      "\u201cA goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid,\u201d he wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery.",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \u201cYou have to avoid dumb people. ... Never do anything that bores you. ... If you can\u2019t stand to be with your real peers (including scientific competitors) get out of science. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\u201d",
      "It was in the fall of 1951 that the tall, skinny Watson \u2014 already the holder of a Ph.D. at 23 \u2014 arrived at Britain\u2019s Cambridge University, where he met Crick. As a Watson biographer later said, \u201cIt was intellectual love at first sight.\u201d",
      "Crick himself wrote that the partnership thrived in part because the two men shared \u201ca certain youthful arrogance, a ruthlessness, and an impatience with sloppy thinking.\u201d",
      "Together they sought to tackle the structure of DNA, aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked. (She died in 1958.)",
      "Watson and Crick built Tinker Toy-like models to work out the molecule\u2019s structure. One Saturday morning in 1953, after fiddling with bits of cardboard he had carefully cut to represent fragments of the DNA molecule, Watson suddenly realized how these pieces could form the \u201crungs\u201d of a double helix ladder.",

      "Figuring out the double helix \u201cgoes down as one of the three most important discoveries in the history of biology,\u201d alongside Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution through natural selection and Gregor Mendel\u2019s fundamental laws of genetics, said Cold Spring Harbor lab's president, Bruce Stillman.",
      "Following the discovery, Watson spent two years at the California Institute of Technology, then joined the faculty at Harvard in 1955. Before leaving Harvard in 1976, he essentially created the university\u2019s program for molecular biology, scientist Mark Ptashne recalled in a 1999 interview.",
      "Watson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor lab in 1968, its president in 1994 and its chancellor 10 years later. He made the lab on Long Island an educational center for scientists and non-scientists, focused research on cancer, instilled a sense of excitement and raised huge amounts of money.",
      "He transformed the lab into a \u201cvibrant, incredibly important center,\u201d Ptashne said. It was \u201cone of the miracles of Jim: a more disheveled, less smooth, less typically ingratiating person you could hardly imagine.\u201d",
      "From 1988 to 1992, Watson directed the federal effort to identify the detailed makeup of human DNA. He created the project\u2019s huge investment in ethics research by simply announcing it at a news conference. He later said it was \u201cprobably the wisest thing I\u2019ve done over the past decade.\u201d",
      "Watson was on hand at the White House in 2000 for the announcement that the federal project had completed an important goal: a \u201cworking draft\u201d of the human genome, basically a road map to an estimated 90 percent of human genes.",
      "Researchers presented Watson with the detailed description of his own genome in 2007. It was one of the first genomes of an individual to be deciphered.",
      "Watson knew that genetic research could produce findings that make some people uncomfortable. In 2007, he wrote that when scientists identify genetic variants that predispose people to crime or significantly affect intelligence, the findings should be publicized rather than squelched out of political correctness.",
      "James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, into \u201ca family that believed in books, birds and the Democratic Party,\u201d as he put it. From his birdwatcher father he inherited an interest in ornithology and a distaste for explanations that didn\u2019t rely on reason or science.",
      "Watson was a precocious child who loved to read, studying books like \u201cThe World Telegraph Almanac of Facts.\u201d He entered the University of Chicago on a scholarship at 15, graduated at 19 and earned his doctorate in zoology at Indiana University three years later.",
      "He got interested in genetics at age 17 when he read a book that said genes were the essence of life.",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, if the gene is the essence of life, I want to know more about it,\u2019\u201d he later recalled. \u201cAnd that was fateful because, otherwise, I would have spent my life studying birds and no one would have heard of me.\u201d",
      "At the time, it wasn\u2019t clear that genes were made of DNA, at least for any life form other than bacteria. But Watson went to Europe to study the biochemistry of nucleic acids like DNA. At a conference in Italy, Watson saw an X-ray image that indicated DNA could form crystals.",
      "\u201cSuddenly I was excited about chemistry,\u201d Watson wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d If genes could crystallize, \u201cthey must have a regular structure that could be solved in a straightforward fashion.\u201d",
      "\u201cA potential key to the secret of life was impossible to push out of my mind,\u201d he recalled.",
      "In the decades after his discovery, Watson\u2019s fame persisted. Apple Computer used his picture in an ad campaign. At conferences, graduate students who weren\u2019t even born when he worked at Cambridge nudged each other and whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s Watson. There\u2019s Watson.\u201d They got him to autograph napkins or copies of \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d",
      "A reporter asked him 2018 if any building at the Cold Spring Harbor lab was named after him. No, Watson replied, \u201cI don\u2019t need a building named after me. I have the double helix.\u201d",
      "His 2007 remarks on race were not the first time Watson struck a nerve with his comments. In a speech in 2000, he suggested that sex drive is related to skin color. And earlier he told a newspaper that if a gene governing sexuality were found and could be detected in the womb, a woman who didn\u2019t want to have a gay child should be allowed to have an abortion.",
      "More than a half-century after winning the Nobel, Watson put the gold medal up for auction in 2014. The winning bid, $4.7 million, set a record for a Nobel. The medal was eventually returned to Watson.",
      "Both of Watson\u2019s Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004.",

In her review, Jocelyn Noveck writes, \u201cThe chief weakness of \u2018Freakier Friday\u2019 \u2014 an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante.

      "Lisa Emery, a respiratory therapist, is deeply concerned about West Virginia coal miners suffering from black lung disease",
      "OAK HILL, W.Va. -- Lisa Emery loves to talk about her \u201cboys.\u201d With each word, the respiratory therapist\u2019s face softens and shines with pride. But keep her talking, and it doesn\u2019t take long for that passion to switch to hurt. She knows the names, ages, families and the intimate stories of each one\u2019s scarred lungs. She worries about a whole community of West Virginia coal miners \u2014 including a growing number in their 30s and 40s \u2014 who come to her for help while getting sicker and sicker from what used to be considered an old-timer\u2019s disease: black lung.",
      "\u201cI love these guys,\u201d she said, wiping tears. \u201cI tell them \u2026 \u2018Every single one of y\u2019all that sits down in that chair is why I feel like I was put on this earth.\u2019\u201d",
      "As director of the New River Health Association Black Lung Clinic, Emery\u2019s seen guys as young as 45 getting double lung transplants as disease rates soar among miners forced to dig through more rock filled with deadly silica to reach the remaining coal \u2014 far worse than the dust their grandfathers inhaled. A rule approved last year by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration would cut the federal limit for allowable respirable crystalline silica dust exposure by half to help protect miners of all types nationwide from the current driving force of black lung and other illnesses.",
      "But, now, it\u2019s in jeopardy amid other Trump administration cutbacks and proposals targeting workers\u2019 health and safety guardrails: Stuck in a politically charged environment that promotes industry, with lawmakers arguing to change it and the federal agency that wrote the rule not pushing to enforce it. Some angry retired miners with black lung are fighting back, demanding that President Donald Trump honor promises he made to the people who voted him in.",
      "The opposition comes months after Trump signed executive orders to allow coal-fired plants to pollute more and to streamline the permitting process and open up new areas for mineral production, including oil and natural gas drilling and mining of \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201d He was celebrated at the White House by smiling miners in hard hats, including some with West Virginia stickers, as he promised to put more people to work underground.",
      "\u201cOne thing I learned about the coal miners: That\u2019s what they want to do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou could give them a penthouse on Fifth Avenue in a different kind of a job, and they\u2019d be unhappy. They want to mine coal.\u201d",
      "But since his inauguration in January, a volley of firings, department eliminations and proposed regulation rollbacks have targeted hard-won health and safety protections fought for over decades to safeguard coal miners and other working-class folks.",
      "The silica rule was delayed in April after industry groups suing the government filed an emergency request in court to block it from taking effect, citing costs and difficulties implementing it. Around the same time, the Trump administration told nearly all employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health that their jobs were being cut. That included those running a congressionally mandated surveillance program that certifies black lung cases.",
      "Loud public uproar and bipartisan criticism followed, and a fraction of the agency\u2019s positions were reinstated. That came only after a West Virginia coal miner diagnosed with black lung sued. A federal judge in that case issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to bring back respiratory health division workers at NIOSH.",
      "But some jobs, including those focused on mine safety and research, have not been restored. And even employees who have been recalled say a lack of funding and loss of expertise in specialized positions, from chemists to engineers, have made it impossible for them to operate at the same level as before.",
      "In addition, the Labor Department has proposed altering some mining regulations to weaken the authority of district mine health and safety managers that could impact ventilation, roof prevention and training programs.",
      "The result of all these changes is that many blue-collar workers and first responders nationwide \u2014 from commercial fishermen and miners to firefighters and construction workers \u2014 will have fewer people working to help keep them safe and healthy while doing some of the country\u2019s most dangerous jobs, many of them deep in Trump country.",
      "In fact, the two reddest states in America \u2014 Wyoming and West Virginia \u2014 had the highest overall worker death rates in 2023, according to the latest government figures. Together they experienced more than a dozen fatalities in the mining, quarrying and oil and gas sector that year.",
      "As a United Steelworkers union leader representing about 700 trona miners in Wyoming, Marshal Cummings worries the little-known white powdery rock he digs \u2014 used in everything from glass and detergents to paper \u2014 could be making workers sick. He helped push for the silica rule to cover miners like him, offering them the same free health screenings as coal miners, and was forced to wait for researchers from NIOSH to investigate air quality at his site after a request he filed was initially killed by the layoffs.",
      "\u201cWe got promised that we were going to make America great again, make America healthy again,\u201d Cummings said at the time.",
      "\u201cYou should be making these cuts with the scalpel,\u201d he added. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be using a chainsaw and chunking out all these things because you\u2019re impacting workers.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the country, Emery sits in her office off a busy highway nestled amid West Virginia\u2019s breathtaking mountains and whitewater rivers that attract tourists from across the world. Data collected from her clinic along with more than two dozen others nationwide, spell out what she sees in real time every day: Of the 11,500 coal miners from central Appalachia with X-rays analyzed by NIOSH-certified readers from mid-2020 through mid-2025, 55% had some form of black lung with the highest annual rate \u2014 62% \u2014 recorded among miners seen in the past year, according to researcher Kirsten Almberg at the University of Illinois Chicago. That compares to 41% elsewhere in the U.S. over the same five-year period.",
      "Experts say that\u2019s because much of the easy-to-reach coal has already been extracted in West Virginia and neighboring Virginia and Kentucky, forcing miners to use massive equipment to eat through walls of quartz-filled sandstone to reach the remaining thin coal seams. This creates excess dust laced with shards of silica, which also cause lung cancer and kidney disease. It\u2019s 20 times more toxic than coal dust, the major culprit of the past that often sickened older workers. The silica crystals embed in miners\u2019 lungs, causing chronic inflammation and eventually irreversible scarring that peppers X-rays with chalky spots. It leaves proud, once-strong men skinny and weak. They choke on their food and gasp after just a few steps, cradling shiny cylinders that provide a lifeline of oxygen through tubes snaking into their nostrils.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever about drowned \u2014 or anybody\u2019s about drowned \u2014 they know what I\u2019m talking about because I go through that every morning,\u201d said Mark F. Powell, a fourth-generation miner from southern West Virginia who\u2019s upset with Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cBy the end of the day, I\u2019m so tired. Sometimes I don\u2019t even eat supper. I\u2019ll come home and sometimes I\u2019m not even able to take a shower. I\u2019m not ashamed to tell it. I\u2019ll lay on the floor and go to sleep.\u201d",
      "He said he wore his protective respirator throughout his nearly 30-year career, but was still diagnosed with a progressive form of complicated black lung and silicosis when he was 45. NIOSH certified his X-ray, allowing him to move to a job on the surface with no pay cut. Now, just four years later, he said he doesn\u2019t have the wind to mow his lawn.",
      "He said he worries about younger miners. Some, no longer protected by unions, were afraid to speak to The Associated Press or question bosses who may be skirting health and safety regulations.",
      "From 1970 to 2016, more than 75,000 miners\u2019 deaths were connected to black lung, according to NIOSH. Disease rates dropped after Congress put the agency\u2019s Coal Workers\u2019 Health Surveillance Program in place, but have surged since the late 1990s. NIOSH and unions have highlighted the need for the silica rule for decades, which cuts permissible silica dust levels inside mines from 100 to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over an eight-hour shift \u2014 the same levels already enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in other industries such as construction. In 2018, NIOSH published a report showing around one in five coal miners with at least 25 years\u2019 experience in central Appalachia had black lung. Those findings were based largely off of working miners who may not have been sick when X-rayed. Researchers say the newer numbers collected from black lung clinics like Emery\u2019s show a bleaker picture because they capture miners who are disabled or retired, many of whom were never screened by NIOSH.",
      "In July, seven House Republicans, led by Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, who chairs the House Education and Workforce committee, wrote a letter to the Mine Safety and Health Administration opposing parts of the silica rule, saying it ignored commonsense controls such as job rotation and personal protective equipment. The letter did not mention black lung or other diseases caused by silica dust, but said the rule was an example of Biden administration red tape and \u201cimposed hundreds of millions of dollars in costs\u201d on the mining industry.",
      "Walberg did not respond to questions from AP, but a committee spokesperson said in a statement that while the Republicans support ensuring miner safety, the current silica rule does not provide mine operators enough flexibility to apply the standards in an economically feasible way.",
      "The White House and the Labor Department insisted the administration can maintain miners\u2019 health and safety while rolling back regulations.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump cares about our miners more than any other president in modern history \u2013 which is why he has implemented his energy dominance agenda to protect their jobs and revive the mining industry,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.",
      "But sick miners say the cost, for them, is their lives. Even after removing all exposure to silica and coal dust, symptoms continue to worsen, typically resulting in only two options: A risky, expensive lung transplant or death.",
      "\u201cI feel like in our part of the country \u2026 we\u2019re kinda forgotten about,\u201d said John Robinson, a former miner from Nickelsville, Virginia, who uses a walking stick and oxygen after being diagnosed with the disease 12 years ago at age 47. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "Emery said her youngest patient with the most complicated form of black lung, called progressive massive fibrosis, was just 31 when he was diagnosed after only 10 years underground. And he\u2019s not alone: Rates in the region have jumped in recent years \u2014 hitting an all-time high for long-tenured miners in the mid-2000s, according to NIOSH data.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing at the black lung clinics is just really alarming,\u201d she said. \u201cSo truly, if the rule got put in place today, cutting the silica exposure level in half, you already have sick miners. It\u2019s going to take a solid 15 to 20 years for us to start to see this taper off.\u201d",
      "The history of disease and sacrifice is everywhere in these mountains. Just a few miles from Emery\u2019s office, silica created one of the worst occupational disasters in U.S. history when more than 750 miners \u2014 most of them Black \u2014 died from breathing the toxic dust while drilling the Hawks Nest tunnel in the early 1930s to divert water to power a metal plant. A small cemetery with rows of sunken, unmarked graves memorializes the tragedy in an area where rumbling coal trains and steep mining tipples remain the backdrop in tired rural towns blighted by unemployment and decaying houses.",

      "\u201cI said, \u2018This is your last shift, don\u2019t go to work, we\u2019ll go trout fishing,\u2019\u201d Megna said, recalling his dad\u2019s dutiful response to the company. \u201cHe said: \u2018I owe them that much.\u2019\u201d",
      "Megna said his father then told him he loved him \u2014 for the first time \u2014 and drove off.",
      "\u201cThis was the last time we talked,\u201d he said.",
      "Early the next morning, the ground shook so hard, it was felt miles away. Roaring plumes of smoke billowed more than 100 feet into the sky from a raging fire. Megna\u2019s dad was among 78 miners who did not escape the explosion. His body remains entombed there along with 18 other men who were sealed inside.",
      "It was the first mining disaster broadcast on national television, shocking the public and enraging workers. A few months later, roughly 40,000 West Virginia coal miners walked off the job in an unauthorized wildcat strike, demanding better black lung protections and benefits when the state was a Democratic stronghold. Congress responded by passing the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which required government oversight and enforcement at coal mines and established breathable dust standards \u2014 the same ones the 2024 silica rule would cut in half \u2014 and compensation for miners disabled by black lung.",
      "The federal black lung surveillance program was created as part of that act, which also helped lay the framework for broader workplace safety legislation a year later that formed OSHA and NIOSH as agencies. While OSHA is charged with enforcing worker health and safety standards under the Department of Labor, including citing employers for violations, NIOSH is the quiet research and development arm. It focuses on making recommendations to avoid work-related illness and injury and is overseen by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "NIOSH investigates and studies firefighter deaths, including cancers. It certifies N95 masks and reviews and verifies illnesses involving 9/11 first responders who could be eligible for benefits under the federal World Trade Center Health Program. Scientists in its Spokane, Washington, laboratory \u2014 which remains gutted \u2014 work to keep wildland firefighters, oil and gas workers and commercial fishermen safe. Some were also helping to develop real-time monitors to alert miners of silica dust overexposure.",
      "The chaotic layoffs in April and May were made in the name of redundancy when Elon Musk was at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, but no other agency does what NIOSH does. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., admitted during a congressional budget hearing in May that \u201cwe made a couple of mistakes\u201d while saying he restored 328 jobs at NIOSH, mostly in Cincinnati and Morgantown, West Virginia.",
      "\u201cUnder Secretary Kennedy\u2019s leadership, the nation\u2019s critical public health functions remain intact and effective,\u201d a Health and Human Services Department spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to protecting essential services like those that support coal miners through NIOSH.\u201d",
      "Unions estimate around 500 employees remain on administrative leave while their future is hashed out in court after lawsuits were filed to have the jobs reinstated. Others took buyouts or have accepted positions elsewhere. The Trump administration has attacked federal employee unions, including those representing the agency, attempting to strip collective bargaining rights. That too has prompted lawsuits.",
      "NIOSH was slated to become part of the newly planned Administration for a Healthy America, and Kennedy proposed its budget for fiscal year 2026 be slashed to $73 million \u2014 an 80% decrease from the previous year. Meanwhile, in September, the Trump administration provided $625 million in funding to expand and improve coal-powered plants.",
      "Prior to the government shutdown, the House and Senate appropriations committees recommended the agency\u2019s funding either be slightly reduced or maintained near pre-Trump levels. Experts have argued NIOSH is a bargain, costing about $2.20 per working American annually. In 2023, the nonprofit National Safety Council found workplace injuries alone amount to about $177 billion each year.",
      "\u201cWe like to say that NIOSH is the little agency that no one\u2019s heard of that\u2019s probably helped save your life,\u201d said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, an industrial hygienist at the agency\u2019s Cincinnati offices, who spoke as vice president of the AFGE Local 3840 union. \u201cEvery single workplace safety and health regulation is written in blood.\u201d",
      "The fight has not died for some aging former West Virginia coal miners with black lung who meet regularly in a building adjacent to Emery\u2019s clinic in Oak Hill. Last month, dozens of them drove hours along with counterparts from elsewhere in Appalachia to protest on the steps of the shuttered Labor Department, some pushing walkers and stopping to catch their breath every few steps. They held up photographs of dead friends and loved ones with signs reading \u201cCoal Miners Lives Matter.\u201d",
      "On the opposite side of the building, an enormous banner with Trump\u2019s face read: \u201cAmerican Workers First.\u201d",
      "Former miner and coal truck driver Randy Lawrence said both Trump and Kennedy should do an eight-hour shift underground to see why NIOSH and the silica rule are essential. He said he hopes to send a loud message to the president he voted for, but no longer supports.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re doing everything they can to hurt the working man,\u201d he said, lugging his oxygen tank. \u201cThey ain\u2019t worried about the miners or people in West Virginia or coal miners anywhere. All they\u2019re worried about is the almighty dollar in D.C. They don\u2019t care about the little people that put them there.\u201d",
      "Outgoing United Mine Workers of America union president Cecil Roberts went a step further, accusing those delaying the silica rule of holding a pillow over miners\u2019 faces, suffocating workers. The UMWA has tried to intervene in the silica rule lawsuit to help push for its enforcement, but government lawyers have opposed it.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s stop the killing in Appalachia!\u201d he yelled into the crowd. \u201cThis country owes coal miners so much. \u2026 We allowed those fat-ass people up on Wall Street to be millionaires and billionaires. It\u2019s our turn!\u201d",
      "The silica rule lawsuit is backed by a number of industry groups that represent different types of mining nationwide.",
      "\u201cWe are absolutely supportive of the new lower levels,\u201d said Ashley Burke, a spokeswoman at the National Mining Association, which is part of the lawsuit. She said the problem is instead with how the new rule is regulated.",
      "Industry wants it to match more closely with OSHA\u2019s methods of compliance, including allowing personal protective equipment to be used more to help meet the standards. But the mining rule calls for company ventilation systems and dust suppression devices to be used as part of the primary means of control.",
      "Miners say respirators clog up frequently, making it hard to breathe, and they often slip or don\u2019t seal properly due to beards, sweat or coal dust. They can also make it difficult for them to hear, see or talk in the noisy environment underground.",
      "Retired miners who attended the rally say they also are pushing to make sure the Mine Safety and Health Administration isn\u2019t weakened. Wayne Palmer was recently confirmed to lead the agency, which has seen a dwindling number of inspectors. Palmer previously worked as an executive for an industrial minerals trade association that filed a legal brief opposing the silica rule. Protest organizers say they asked to meet with Palmer, but never got a reply. The Labor Department did not respond to specific questions about the silica rule or whether Palmer planned to address the group.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like having a fox in a chicken house,\u201d said Gary Hairston, 71, president of the National Black Lung Association, who came out of the mines in southern West Virginia sick at 48 years old. He said coal companies cannot be trusted to police themselves, adding he used to put tape over his air monitor to make sure he didn\u2019t get bad samples because he feared being fired. He said the company also alerted miners when inspectors arrived to make sure all the safety violations were hidden. \u201cYou ain\u2019t got nobody to go to.\u201d",
      "The Mine Safety and Health Administration houses inspectors who would be responsible for enforcing the silica rule, which the agency agreed to pause in April, citing restructuring at NIOSH and technical issues. This administration did not push back against the industry lawsuit in federal appeals court and was granted another delay in October, due to the government shutdown. The Labor Department has also proposed changes that would limit district managers\u2019 authority to force mines to comply with ventilation, roofing and training regulations to carry out Trump\u2019s directive to eliminate bureaucracy.",
      "But at Emery\u2019s black lung clinic in southern West Virginia, far from the lawsuits and the policy changes, all she can think about is one gasping miner arriving after another. Many are still working with limited lung capacity just to keep their health insurance, and they come to her with questions, hoping she can help delay the inevitable. She sees the young ones struggling to throw a football in the yard or make it to school sporting events.",
      "\u201cThese families, you know, they\u2019re my families,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s miners whose kids go to school with my kids.\u201d",
      "The worst ones have the number to her cellphone, which is never turned off. Sometimes they call in a panic, desperate for help.",

      "The small government office, with some 275 employees, provides objective, impartial analysis to support lawmakers during the budget process. It is required to produce a cost estimate for nearly every bill approved by a House or Senate committee and will weigh in earlier when asked to do so by lawmakers.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Typhoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 114 people in the Philippines with even more missing and then hit Vietnam Friday. A second typhoon, Fong-Wong, is forecast to hit the Philippines around Sunday and strengthen to a major storm by that time.",
      "Some facts about typhoons:",
      "They\u2019re all the same \u2014 officially, tropical cyclones. But they get different names in different parts of the world. Hurricane is used in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, central and northeast Pacific. They are typhoons in the northwest Pacific. In the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, they are called cyclones.",
      "Tropical cyclone is used in the southwest India Ocean; in the southwestern Pacific and southeastern India Ocean, they are severe tropical cyclones.",
      "A storm gets a name and is considered a tropical storm at 39 mph (63 kph). It becomes a hurricane, typhoon, tropical cyclone, or cyclone at 74 mph (119 kph). There are five strength categories, depending on wind speed. The highest category is 5 and that\u2019s above 155 mph (249 kph). Australia has a different system for categorizing storm strength.",
      "Kalmaegi is on the stronger side of typhoons, experts said. Its maximum winds in the Philippines reached 132 mph (213 kph), including sustained winds on the ground of 93 mph (150 kph).",
      "The highest tropical cyclone winds recorded were in 2015's Hurricane Patricia in the eastern Pacific, while Typhoon Tip in 1979 had the lowest barometric pressure, which is a key measurement that meteorologists use.",
      "If they are north of the equator they rotate counterclockwise. If they are south, they rotate clockwise.",
      "The Atlantic and central Pacific hurricane seasons are June 1 through Nov. 30. Eastern Pacific is May 15 to Nov. 30; northwestern Pacific season is nearly all year, with the most from May to November. The cyclone season in the south Pacific and Australia runs from November to April. The Bay of Bengal has two seasons, April to June and September to November.",
      "Vietnam tends to get landfalling typhoons around this time of year.",
      "The northwestern Pacific where Typhoon Kalmaegi hit is the busiest place on Earth because of the year-round warm water, weak upper-level crosswinds and frequent thunderstorm activity that can provide the seeds for storms to form, said Kristen Corbosiero, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany.",

      "By this time of year, the Northwest Pacific averages 23 named storms, 14 of which become typhoons, according to Colorado State University's storm database. A normal year there involves 27 named storms. Kalmaegi and Fung-Wong are the 26th and 27th named storms, with Kalmaegi the 15th typhoon. While there are slightly more storms than normal, Corbosiero said this has been generally a weaker season. The measurement that meteorologists use, which combines storm strength, frequency and duration, shows this season is only 62% of average so far. Kalmaegi is the fourth-strongest typhoon this season.",
      "By comparison the Atlantic averages 14 named storms a year and this year there have been 13, with the last one, Hurricane Melissa, causing major destruction in Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "Because the Northwest Pacific has warm enough water to fuel storms practically year-round, the key often is storminess in the atmosphere to start something going, Corbosiero said. In this case \u2014 and many others \u2014 it's an atmospheric disturbance called the Madden-Julian Oscillation, often called the MJO. This is a natural system in the tropics that starts around the Indian Ocean and moves eastward, increasing rainfall and storminess ahead of it and suppressing thunderstorm activity behind it. It can circle the globe in 30 to 60 days.",
      "A strong MJO can trigger tropical cyclone activity. It did that this summer in the Northwest Pacific but then sort of shut down as the oscillation moved east, Corbosiero said. But a strong one just moved through, helping with these storms' formation, she said.",
      "That MJO is now around the international dateline about a week-and-a-half to two weeks away from the Atlantic, where it could help spawn late season tropical storms, she said.",
      "The lists are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization; the names are ones that are familiar in each region. Names are taken off the list and replaced to avoid confusion if a hurricane causes a lot of damage or deaths. For example, Katrina was retired after it devastated New Orleans in 2005. The Philippines has its own naming system, so Typhoon Kalmaegi is also being called Tino.",

The potential severe geomagnetic storms could disrupt radio and GPS communications, according to forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "How bright the auroras are and how far south they are visible will depend on when the solar bursts get here and how they interact with Earth's atmosphere. The vibrant displays could be visible across much of the northern U.S., and as far south as Alabama and Northern California.",
      "The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come.",
      "Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
      "Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major face-lift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.",
      "Last year, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And soon afterward, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.",
      "The sun\u2019s active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won\u2019t be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and NOAA.",
      "Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth.",
      "When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit. Severe storms are capable of scrambling other radio and GPS communications.",
      "In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and set telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam.",

      "Over five years, a team of archaeologists combed through historical records, ancient journals, locations of milestones and other archival data. Scientists then looked for clues in satellite imagery and aerial photography, including recently digitized photos taken from planes during World War II.",
      "When ancient accounts hinted at lost roads in a certain area, researchers analyzed the terrain from above to spot subtle traces \u2014 things like faint differences in vegetation, soil variations or shifts in elevation, as well as traces of ancient engineering like raised mounds or cut hillsides \u2014 that revealed where Roman lanes once ran.",
      "\u201cIt becomes a massive game of connecting the dots on a continental scale,\u201d said Tom Brughmans, an archaeologist and co-author of the study published in Scientific Data.",

      "The American Merops system, which is small enough to fit in the back of a midsized pickup truck, can identify drones and close in on them, using artificial intelligence to navigate when satellite and electronic communications are jammed.",
      "As well as being deployed in Poland and Romania, Merops will also be used by Denmark, NATO military officials told The Associated Press, part of a move to boost defenses on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank.",
      "The aim is to make the border with Russia so well-armed that Moscow's forces will be deterred from ever contemplating crossing, from Norway in the north to Turkey in the south, the officials said.",
      "The need for such technology became acute after around 20 Russian drones flew into Polish airspace in early September. Multimillion-dollar jets were scrambled to respond to drones which cost tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "Romania later faced a drone incursion, while drones temporarily closed airports in Copenhagen, Munich, Berlin and Brussels. There were also sightings near military bases in Belgium and Denmark.",
      "While the origin of the drones could not always be traced to Russia or linked to its war in Ukraine, the urgent need to bolster defenses is clear. A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of missiles.",
      "\u201cWhat this system does is give us very accurate detection,\u201d said Col. Mark McLellan, assistant chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command. \u201cIt\u2019s able to target the drones and take them down and at a low cost as well \u2026 It\u2019s a lot cheaper than flying an F-35 into the air to take them down with a missile.\u201d",
      "Drones fly low and slow, making them hard to pinpoint on radar systems calibrated for spotting high-speed missiles. They can also be mistaken for birds or planes. The Merops system, NATO officials said, helps plug those gaps.",
      "Merops \u201cbasically flies drones against drones,\u201d said McLellan, either by firing directly at the hostile drone or information from the system can be passed to ground or air forces so that they can shoot it down.",
      "Merops gives commanders \u201ca certain amount of time to be able to assess the threat and decide \u2014 to shoot or not shoot,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Thomas Lowin, deputy chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command.",
      "It can be used to protect both critical infrastructure, such as airports, and armed forces maneuvering in a combat zone, he added.",
      "NATO is now deploying the first systems along the borders of Poland and Romania, while Denmark has also decided to acquire the Merops technology, Lowin said.",
      "Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has invested in Merops, but both he and the company are keeping a low public profile, declining requests for interviews. Defense officials from Poland and Romania also refused to comment publicly.",
      "The Russian incursions have concentrated minds in Europe, highlighting the need for new defenses against a rapidly developing form of warfare. The Merops system is one of many that European militaries would need to tip the scales of a drone war in NATO\u2019s favor.",
      "A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war, as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of expensive missiles.",

      "Russia has conscription and a large military, which means it has more forces immediately deployable than NATO along its borders. The alliance needs to build defenses which offset that manpower advantage by using its technological capabilities, Donahue said.",
      "Merops is the first phase of building those defenses, said Lowin, a process which is forecast to take two to five years.",
      "The drone incursions and the instability on NATO\u2019s eastern flank stem from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, now approaching the end of its fourth year. The conflict has become a crucible for drone development, transforming the battlefield into a testing zone for new technology which now has applications elsewhere in Europe.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 12:27:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Jeffrey Epstein told Ghislaine Maxwell that an alleged victim had \"spent hours at my house\" with Donald Trump, according to emails released by Democrats on Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "One of the emails is a 2011 message between Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "Sex offender Jeffrey Epstein referred to Donald Trump as the \"dog that hasn't barked\" and told his former companion Ghislaine Maxwell that an alleged victim had \"spent hours at my house\" with Trump, according to email correspondence released Wednesday by Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.",
      "\"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump,\" Epstein wrote in a typo-riddled message to Maxwell in April 2011. \"[Victim] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "\"I have been thinking about that ... \" Maxwell replied.",
      "That email exchange -- which came just weeks after a British newspaper published a series of stories about Epstein, Maxwell and their powerful associates -- was one of three released by the Democrats from a batch of more than 23,000 documents the committee recently received from the Epstein Estate in response to a subpoena.",
      "The names of alleged victims and other personally identifying information were redacted from the messages.",
      "The other newly released email exchanges are between Epstein and author Michael Wolff, who has written four books chronicling the Trump presidency.\u00a0 Wolff has said he spoke to Epstein at length about Trump during his reporting for the books.",
      "\"I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you--either on air or in scrum afterwards,\" Wolff wrote to Epstein in December 2015, six months after Trump had officially entered the race for the White House.",
      "\"If we were to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\" Epstein replied.",
      "\"I think you should let him hang himself,\" Wolff replied the next day. \"If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"",
      "The third message -- exchanged between Epstein and Wolff while Trump was well into his first presidential term in January 2019 -- appears to touch on the topic of whether Trump had banned Epstein from membership at Mar-a-Lago years earlier.",
      "\"Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever,\" Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop\"",
      "The full context of these email exchanges is not clear from the portions released by the committee Democrats.",
      "Wolff in a phone interview on Wednesday said of the 2015 exchange that he couldn't remember \"the specific emails or the context, but I was in an in-depth conversation with Epstein at that time about his relationship with Donald Trump. So I think this reflects that.\"",
      "\"I was trying at that time to get Epstein to talk about his relationship with Trump, and actually, he proved to be an enormously valuable source to me,\" Wolff said. \"Part of the context of this is that I was pushing Epstein at that point to go public with what he knew about Trump.\"",
      "None of\u00a0the documents\u00a0previously made public as part of civil lawsuits or Maxwell's trial contain allegations of wrongdoing by Trump.",
      "Trump in July posted a lengthy social media post that in part blamed Democrats for creating a controversy about files related to Epstein, which he called a \"scam\" and \"hoax.\"",
      "\"Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'b--------,' hook, line, and sinker,\" he wrote at the time.",
      "Republicans on Wednesday claimed Democrats were selectively choosing documents to \"generate click-bait\" and that they\u2019re withholding other documents that name Democrat officials. Republicans said they\u2019re still reviewing the documents related to Epstein to protect potential victims. They called on Democrats to stop politicizing the investigation.",

The Committee is actively reviewing the documents and will release them publicly once all victim-identifying information has been appropriately redacted. Democrats should stop politicizing this investigation and focus on delivering transparency, accountability, and justice for the survivors.\"",
      "Republicans on the Oversight Committee accused their Democratic counterparts of \u201ctrying to create a fake narrative to slander President Trump.\u201d",
      "In a\u00a0social media post, the Republicans claim that in the 2011 email between Epstein and Maxwell, the Democrats redacted the name \"Virginia,\" a likely reference to prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, who had made extensive public comments about her exploitation by Epstein, but had never accused Trump of any wrongdoing.\u00a0 The Republicans said that the Epstein Estate had not redacted Virginia's name when providing the records to the committee.",
      "\"Why did Democrats cover up the name when the Estate didn't redact it in the redacted documents provided to the committee?\" the Republicans' posted on X. \"It's because this victim, Virginia Giuffre, publicly said that she never witnessed wrongdoing by President Trump. Democrats are trying to create a fake narrative to slander President Trump. Shame on them.\"",
      "Giuffre died by apparent suicide earlier this year. Her memoir, \"Nobody's Girl,\" was published posthumously last month.",

      "\"These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump\u2019s historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again,\" Leavitt adds in her statement.",
      "The publication of the emails comes on the same day that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is scheduled to swear in Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat who won a special election last month.",
      "Once sworn in, Grijalva is expected to provide the final signature on a discharge petition to force a vote on a House bill that would compel the Department of Justice to release the government's full investigative files on Epstein.",
      "The earliest that vote could happen is the first week of December, after the Thanksgiving recess.",
      "\"The Department of Justice must fully release the Epstein files to the public immediately,\" said Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the Oversight committee, which is conducting an investigation into the federal government's handling of investigations into Epstein.",
      "\"The more Donald Trump tries to cover-up the Epstein files, the more we uncover. These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President,\" Garcia said.",
      "The Trump administration has been dogged by controversy over the Epstein files since the DOJ -- in an unsigned statement earlier this year -- announced that the department would not be making its files public, despite earlier promises by members of the Trump administration for transparency.",
      "The statement said that the government had not turned up evidence of a \"client list\" or credible evidence that \"Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.\"",
      "The Oversight committee issued a bipartisan subpoena to the DOJ in August for all records related to Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "The DOJ has so far produced only a small fraction of the documents and other evidence gathered by federal investigators over the course of multiple investigations into Epstein's alleged international sex-trafficking operation.",
      "It's not clear if the email messages the estate provided to the committee are also in the possession of the DOJ.",
      "After Epstein's arrest in 2019, President Trump said he hadn't spoken to him in 15 years.\u00a0Earlier this year, Trump claimed he ended his association with Epstein in the early 2000s after discovering that Epstein and Maxwell were allegedly poaching employees from Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of trafficking young girls and women.",

      "\"It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility on auto loans. Those are substantial deductions that are being financed in the tax bill,\" Bessent added.",

      "The message did not specify who would qualify for the payout or how the policy would operate. Two pandemic-era stimulus checks authorized by Trump were made available to individuals bringing in as much as $75,000 per year and couples earning up to $150,000. Beyond those benchmarks, higher earners were eligible for smaller payments.",
      "If Trump were to make the dividend payments available to anyone earning $100,000 or less, the policy would reach about 150 million Americans, amounting to roughly $300 billion in dividends, Erica York, a policy expert at the Tax Foundation, said in a post on X.",
      "As of Sept. 30, the federal government had generated $195 billion in tariff-related revenue, according to the Treasury Department.",

      "A former Connecticut police officer has pleaded guilty to mistreating prisoner Richard \u201cRandy\u201d Cox after he was paralyzed in a police van",
      "A former Connecticut police officer accused of mistreating prisoner Richard \u201cRandy\u201d Cox after he was paralyzed in the back of a police van pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor Wednesday and received no jail time, while three other officers chose to take their cases to trial.",
      "Betsy Segui, a former New Haven sergeant who supervised the city police station lockup, pleaded guilty to second-degree reckless endangerment in exchange for a 60-day suspended jail term. Another former officer, Ronald Pressley, took the same plea deal and received an identical sentence last week.",
      "Cox, 39, who did not attend the New Haven Superior Court hearing, was left paralyzed from the chest down on June 19, 2022, when the police van he was riding in without a seat belt braked hard, sending him head-first into a metal partition while his hands were cuffed behind his back. He had been arrested on charges of threatening a woman with a gun, which were later dismissed.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t move. I\u2019m going to die like this. Please, please, please help me,\u201d Cox said in the van minutes after the crash, according to police video. He later was found to have broken his neck.",
      "Once at the police station, officers mocked Cox and accused him of being drunk and faking his injuries, according to surveillance and body-worn camera footage. Officers dragged Cox out of the van and around the police station before placing him in a holding cell before his eventual transfer to a hospital.",
      "When Cox told the officers that he thought he had cracked his neck, Segui responded, \u201cYou ain\u2019t crack nothing. You just drank too much,\u201d according to an internal affairs investigation report.",
      "Segui did not speak about Cox's treatment during the court hearing. She only answered standard questions from the judge about her guilty plea.",
      "Her lawyer, Gregory Cerritelli, said Segui wanted to put the criminal case behind her.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s no longer working in law enforcement and has no desire to, so I think from her perspective this just gives her closure and lets her move on with her life and focus on her new career,\u201d he said in an interview after the hearing. He declined to say what Segui's new career is.",
      "Three other officers involved in Cox's transport, Oscar Diaz, Jocelyn Lavandier and Luis Rivera, rejected plea deals proposed by prosecutors and chose to take their cases to trial. All three are charged with cruelty to persons and reckless endangerment.",
      "Prosecutors said Cox was informed about Segui's plea deal beforehand and gave his consent. In 2023, the city of New Haven agreed to settle a lawsuit by Cox for $45 million.",

      "Rubano said Cox has bought a home and is living there with his mother, who is caring for him with the help of medical professionals.",
      "The case drew outrage from civil rights advocates including the NAACP, along with comparisons to the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore. Cox is Black, while all five officers who were arrested are Black or Hispanic. Gray, who also was Black, died in 2015 after he suffered a spinal injury while handcuffed and shackled in a Baltimore police van.",
      "The case also led to reforms at the New Haven police department as well as a statewide seat belt requirement for prisoners.",
      "New Haven police fired Segui, Diaz, Lavandier and Rivera for violating police conduct policies, while Pressley retired. Diaz appealed his firing and got his job back. Diaz, who was driving the van when Cox got injured, said he had to brake hard to avoid an accident with another vehicle.",

      "West Virginia's governor says the search for a trapped worker inside a flooded coal mine remains a rescue operation",
      "Crews desperately continued removing massive amounts of water in an effort to locate a trapped worker inside a flooded coal mine in West Virginia as the work entered a fifth day Wednesday.",
      "Gov. Patrick Morrisey said the efforts by crews about three-fourths of a mile into the Rolling Thunder Mine remained a rescue operation. Machines were pumping out water at a rate of 6,000 gallons (22,712 liters) per minute, he said. That's enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in under two hours.",
      "\u201cI think people are doing everything imaginable,\u201d Morrisey said. \"There\u2019s no quit in anyone here.\u201d",
      "A mining crew hit an unknown pocket of water Saturday about three-quarters of a mile into the mine near Belva, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of the state capital of Charleston. The mine flooded after an old mine wall \u201cwas compromised,\u201d and multiple state agencies were involved in the response, Morrisey said.",
      "Other miners were accounted for after the accident was reported. Morrisey said he had no estimate on the number of crews working on the rescue effort inside the mine, but \u201cobviously there are a lot of machines pulling the water out.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of water that\u2019s been drained, but there\u2019s also a massive amount in there that still needs to be drained,\" he said.",
      "In addition, holes have been drilled in the mine, and dive teams were on site, the governor said. The National Cave Rescue Commission has provided surplus Army phones attached to wires that can travel great distances to enable for better underground communication.",
      "Rolling Thunder is one of 11 underground mines operated in West Virginia by Tennessee-based Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc. The company also operates four surface mines in the state, as well as three underground and one surface mine in Virginia.",
      "Morrisey said the abandoned mine next to Rolling Thunder had been worked on in the 1930s and 1940s.",
      "A report prepared in February for Alpha by an engineering consulting firm, Marshall Miller & Associates, said the area had been \u201cextensively explored\u201d by previous mine owners, generating \u201ca significant amount of historical data\u201d that Alpha examined in assessing its potential for producing coal.",
      "The same report says that the Rolling Thunder coal seam runs along and below the drainage of TwentyMile Creek, but said there were \u201cno significant hydrologic concerns\u201d about digging for more coal in the extensively mined property.",

      "The nearest business to the mine in the rural, sparsely populated area is a convenience store about 15 minutes from the winding road leading to the mine. Two businesses about 30 minutes away have supplied food to the rescue crews, and Nicholas County Commissioner Garrett Cole said the mine company also brought in a food truck.",
      "\u201cMiners are part of the family,\" Morrisey said. \u201cThey\u2019ve contributed so much to West Virginia. This is part of the fabric of our state. When times are tough, people step up and deliver. I think that's what's happening here.\u201d",
      "Cole reminded worried residents of a 1968 accident in the same county in which miners working for Gauley Coal and Coke at Hominy Falls accidentally tunneled into an unmapped abandoned mine nearby, flooding their operation. Four men died, but 15 miners were brought to the surface after five days and six others further into the mine were rescued after 10 days.",
      "In 2002 in southwestern Pennsylvania, nine miners were rescued after spending more than three days trapped in the flooded Quecreek Mine.",
      "\u201cMiracles CAN Happen - Have Faith!\u201d Cole wrote on Facebook.",
      "Four of the six reported deaths at U.S. coal mines this year have occurred in West Virginia. One was at Alpha Metallurgical\u2019s Black Eagle operation in nearby Raleigh County in February. A contractor was killed when a piece of a coal seam fell on him, according to the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration.",

      "Across Chicago\u2019s Latino neighborhoods, fear of a federal immigration crackdown has emptied the streets",
      "CHICAGO -- The cyclists arrive at sunrise, rolling through Chicago\u2019s Latino neighborhoods and stopping at tamale carts, elote stands and candy stalls. They buy out every last item \u2014 every tamale, every corn cob, every bundle of sweets. Then they load up the food and deliver it to shelters and families in need.",
      "Since the start of a federal immigration crackdown that has led to more than 3,200 arrests in the Chicago metropolitan area, streets and storefronts in the city\u2019s Latino neighborhoods have emptied out. Street vendors, fearing arrest, have been afraid to leave their homes to work. Local restaurants have struggled as customers stay home.",
      "But as fear spread, so did something else \u2014 neighbors stepping up for one another and finding creative ways to show up for vendors and restaurant owners. This includes a grassroots effort to organize so-called \u201cbuy out\u201d events meant to allow vendors who fear being detained by immigration agents to go home early. Some Chicagoans have pooled money in their neighborhoods or through local organizations while others have simply bought out taco stands while on their way to work or tamale vendors outside their local bars.",
      "In Little Village, Rick Rosales, community organizer with Cycling x Solidarity, helps organize two of these \u201cbuy out\u201d rides per week that typically support five street vendors each.",
      "\u201cThe vendors are often speechless,\u201d Rosales said. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018I have a lot of tamales. You want all of them?\u2019\u201d",
      "Once, after the group bought out a tamale vendor\u2019s cart, that man found them days later to say immigration agents were spotted on his block just hours after. \u201cYou saved my life,\u201d Rosales said the man told them.",
      "\u201cThis is about food and joy and bike rides,\u201d Rosales said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also so incredibly high stakes because of the fear in our communities right now.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to say how many street vendors have been targeted by federal immigration agents, said Maria Orozco, outreach organizer for the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, adding she knows of at least 10 who have been detained.",
      "In September, a tamale vendor was detained while selling outside a Home Depot, according to local advocates. Soon after, federal agents arrested a flower seller in the southwest neighborhood of Archer Heights. Then they came for a cotton candy vendor in the predominantly Mexican American Little Village. Immigration agents descended on the Swap-O-Rama flea market in October and detained more than a dozen people. And last week, over 100 residents in the Brighton Park neighborhood rallied to demand the release of their local tamalero.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Orozco said losing these vendors is as much a cultural loss as an economic one, calling them part of the \u201cfabric of our city.\u201d She said they bring life, color and flavor to the city's streets, preserving culinary traditions and building a sense of community \u2014 and they are beloved by neighbors.",
      "Street vendors who are afraid to work or are seeing drops in sales can apply to get financial support through the Street Vendors Association of Chicago. The group launched a GoFundMe with the goal of raising $300,000 to support street vendors.",
      "Orozco said local businesses have also hosted pop-up events where a certain percentage of proceeds go to street vendors. The organization has also helped connect vendors to people hoping to \u201cbuy them out,\u201d Orozco said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been emotional to see,\u201d she said. \u201cThe vendors themselves didn\u2019t realize how much Chicagoans love and support them. None of us expected this.\u201d",
      "As Alonso Zaragoza, executive administrator of his neighborhood advocacy group, drove through his predominantly Latino community of Belmont Cragin, he noticed restaurants were mostly empty and dark. Restaurants in majority-Latino communities have reported significant drops in sales since federal agents descended on the city in September.",
      "So Zaragoza began organizing restaurant crawls, drawing hundreds to struggling Latino-owned eateries. His previous event began at a taco and tamales restaurant and ended with a Mexican ice cream shop. Along the way, street cart vendors hawked elote, cotton candy and balloons as a local musical group played folk and bluegrass music.",

Martinez also handed him an envelope with $1,500 gathered from neighbors hoping to help support him when he feels unsafe selling his baked goods on the street.",
      "The man\u2019s hand flew up to cover his mouth. He kicked his legs and began to cry.",

      "Pennsylvania lawmakers are advancing a $50 billion spending package to end a four-month budget stalemate that has held up billions for public schools and social services",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Billions of dollars for Pennsylvania\u2019s public schools and social services could soon start flowing after months of delay, as lawmakers on Wednesday took up a roughly $50 billion spending plan to break the state\u2019s budget impasse.",
      "Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was expected to sign key budget bills by the end of the day.",
      "A concession to help seal a deal meant Democrats agreeing to Republican demands to undo a regulation aimed at making Pennsylvania the only major fossil fuel-producing state to force power plant owners to pay for their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Democrats won't get the amount of money that Shapiro originally sought in his initial budget proposal, but the deal \u2014 after weeks of closed-door negotiations \u2014 is expected to deliver substantial new sums to public schools, as Democrats had sought, and an earned income tax credit for lower earners.",
      "It will also bring relief that the stalemate is over.",
      "\u201cThe win is that we\u2019re going to, hopefully before the end of the day, have a funding plan for the commonwealth and that\u2019s a win for everybody who\u2019s been waiting on state resources,\" House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jordan Harris, D-Philadelphia, told reporters in a Capitol hallway Wednesday morning.",
      "The advancing votes in the politically divided Legislature arrive weeks after counties, school districts and social service agencies warned of mounting layoffs, borrowing costs and growing damage to the state\u2019s safety net.",
      "School districts, rape crisis agencies and county-run social services have gone without state aid since July 1, when the state lost some of its spending authority without a signed state budget in force.",
      "The agreement to back off the carbon dioxide cap-and-trade regulation on power plants comes six years after then-Gov. Tom Wolf made joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative the centerpiece of his plan to fight climate change.",
      "Wolf's regulatory plan went around resistant Republican lawmakers in a bid to make Pennsylvania \u2014 the nation's second-largest natural gas producer \u2014 the only major fossil fuel-producing state to undertake a carbon cap-and-trade program.",
      "It has yet to take effect while the state's highest court considers a legal challenge that questions whether the carbon-pricing plan amounts to a tax, and is thus unconstitutional without legislative approval.",

      "Shapiro had also expressed misgivings about it, and an alternative plan that he proposed has yet to receive traction in the Legislature.",
      "Under the $50.1 billion budget deal, new authorized spending would rise by about $2.4 billion, or 5%, including some cash going onto last year's books.",
      "Almost all of the overall spending increase would go toward Medicaid and public schools.",
      "Billions in surplus cash will be required for the plan to balance, the second straight year that Pennsylvania is running a multibillion-dollar budget deficit.",
      "The agreement also includes the state\u2019s first refundable earned income tax credit, which reduces or wipes out the state income tax for people who make less than a certain amount of money, depending on how many children they have. It\u2019s something most other states have on their books.",
      "Pennsylvania\u2019s plan is projected to cost roughly $200 million a year. Had it been in effect this year, the average eligible family would have gotten a $650 break, lawmakers say.",

      "The U.S. Mint has ended production of the penny, a change made to save money and in recognition of the growing irrelevance of the 1-cent coin",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- The U.S. Mint on Wednesday ended production of the penny, a change made to save money and because the 1-cent coin that could once buy a snack or a piece of candy had become increasingly irrelevant.",
      "The last pennies were struck at the mint in Philadelphia, where the country\u2019s smallest denomination coins have been produced since 1793, a year after Congress passed the Coinage Act. Officials said the final few pennies would be auctioned off.",
      "\u201cGod bless America, and we\u2019re going to save the taxpayers $56 million,\u201d U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach said just before hitting a button to strike the final penny.",
      "Pennies remain legal tender, but new ones will no longer be made.",
      "The last coin to be discontinued was the half-cent in 1857, Beach said.",
      "President Donald Trump ordered the penny's demise as costs climbed to nearly 4 cents per penny and the 1-cent valuation became somewhat obsolete. Billions of pennies remain in circulation, but they are rarely essential for financial transactions in the 21st century economy.",
      "\u201cFor far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents,\" Trump wrote in an online post in February. \"This is so wasteful!\u201d",
      "Still, many people have a nostalgia for them, seeing them as lucky or fun to collect. And some retailers voiced concerns in recent weeks as supplies ran low and the end of production drew near. They said the phase-out was abrupt and came with no government guidance on how to handle transactions.",
      "Some rounded prices down to avoid shortchanging shoppers. Others pleaded with customers to bring exact change. The more creative among them gave out prizes, such as a free drink, in exchange for a pile of pennies.",

      "Some banks, meanwhile, began rationing supplies, a somewhat paradoxical result of the effort to address what many see as a glut of the coins. Over the last century, about half of the coins made at mints in Philadelphia and Denver have been pennies.",
      "But they still have a better production cost-to-value ratio than the nickel, which costs nearly 14 cents to make. The diminutive dime, by comparison, costs less than 6 cents to produce, and the quarter nearly 15 cents.",
      "Back in 1793, a penny could get you a biscuit, a candle or a piece of candy. These days, many sit in drawers or glass jars and are basically cast aside or collected.",
      "No matter their face value, collectors and historians consider them an important historical record that can be traced back for more than 200 years. Frank Holt, an emeritus professor at the University of Houston who has studied the history of coins, laments the loss.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A Virginia Democrat who helped investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol is making a comeback bid after last week\u2019s sweeping election wins as her party looks to break President Donald Trump\u2019s grip on federal power in the 2026 midterms.",
      "Former U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, a military veteran who co-presented the Jan. 6 Select Committee\u2019s findings after Trump\u2019s first term, told The Associated Press she will seek the Democratic nomination in Virginia\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Her bid sets up a potential rematch with Republican Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, another military veteran who ousted her in 2022.",
      "The Hampton Roads district, racially diverse and with a notable military population, is among the several dozen nationally that will determine House control. Luria\u2019s candidacy, in particular, highlights what\u2019s at stake for Democrats\u2019 overall identity and for Trump in the final years of his second term in the White House.",
      "The country, Luria said in an interview, is \u201cin very tenuous times\u201d with \u201ca leader who I think ... really is not much of a leader at all and very untrustworthy.\u201d",
      "The 50-year-old Naval Academy graduate pledged to improve economic opportunities and work with anyone on Capitol Hill. But she offered no apology for her desire to hold Trump accountable. That includes her role investigating Trump and his supporters, who ransacked the Capitol and tried to help the Republican president overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cPeople said to me at the time, \u2018You might not get reelected,\u2019\u201d said Luria, who twice voted to impeach Trump and publicly detailed the 187 minutes Trump made no public statement to stop the riots. \u201cYou know, I said, \u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019 essentially. \u2018I\u2019m doing the right thing. The American people need to know what happened that day.\u2019\u201d",
      "Trump has said the sentences handed down to his supporters for their actions on Jan . 6, 2021, were \u201cridiculous and excessive\u201d and has defended his decision to grant clemency to people convicted of assaulting police officers during the attack.",
      "As Luria's first congressional campaign did in 2018, her announcement boosts Democrats who want center-left candidates to run in competitive districts \u2014 figures like her House freshman classmates, Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, who just won gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively.",
      "The Democratic Party's sweep in Virginia, Luria told the AP, \u201cdefinitely showed enthusiasm and support for the policies and the values that I represent.\u201d",
      "She stopped short of taking sides in the intraparty tussle between center-left moderates and progressives like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist.",
      "\u201cThe right kind of profile for Democrats is someone who can speak to and match the interests of their district,\u201d Luria said, later adding, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less who the mayor of New York City is.\u201d",

      "Beyond domestic policy differences, Luria\u2019s bid serves as a reminder of how a Democratic House majority could use congressional subpoena and investigatory power with Trump still in office.

      "A little more than a year ago, Ryan Sprankle welcomed President Donald Trump to one of the three grocery stores his family owns near Pittsburgh. Trump was on the campaign trail; they talked about high grocery prices, and the Republican nominee picked up a bag of popcorn.",
      "But these days, Sprankle would have a different message if Trump or any lawmakers visited his store. He wants them to know that delayed SNAP benefits during the government shutdown hurt his customers and his small, independent chain.",

      "The Trump administration froze funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at the end of October, impacting food access for some 42 million Americans. On Monday, the U.S. Senate passed legislation that would reopen the federal government and replenish SNAP funds, but the U.S. House of Representatives still must consider the bill. It's unclear when SNAP payments might resume if the government reopens.",
      "In 2024, SNAP recipients redeemed a little more than $96 billion in benefits, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the program. The majority \u2013 74% -- was spent at superstores and supermarkets, a category that includes big chains like Walmart and Kroger but also some independent stores like Sprankle's.",
      "Around 14% was spent at smaller grocery and convenience stores, businesses often tucked into neighborhoods and more easily accessible to SNAP beneficiaries.",
      "Etharin Cousin, a former director of the United Nations World Food Program and founder of the nonprofit Food Systems for the Future, said the cutoff of SNAP benefits had immediate impacts on grocers and convenience stores of all sizes, most of which operate on slim profit margins of 1% to 2%.",
      "\u201cSNAP isn\u2019t just a social safety net for families. It\u2019s also a local economic engine,\u201d Cousin said. \u201cSNAP benefits flow directly into neighborhoods, stores, regional distributors and community jobs.\u201d",
      "Walmart declined to comment on the impact of the SNAP funding lapse but noted that it has been lowering prices and donating to local food banks. Kroger also declined to comment.",
      "Shoppers not receiving their food benefits affects all retailers but becomes \u201ca big problem more quickly\u201d at small chains, Sprankle said. His Kittanning, Pennsylvania, store gets 25% of its revenue from SNAP, but customers who don't get government assistance also are worried about the shutdown, according to Sprankle. They're spending less, trading down to cheaper goods or heading to food banks, he said.",

      "NEW YORK -- A former aide to two New York governors is set to go on trial Wednesday on charges she sold her influence to the Chinese government and illegally profited from the state\u2019s bulk purchase of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Linda Sun and her husband, Chris Hu, were arrested last year during a U.S. crackdown on alleged secret agents working for the Chinese government. They were charged again in June as part of the government\u2019s efforts to root out pandemic fraud.",
      "Sun, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in China, held numerous state government posts in New York over a roughly 15-year career, including as deputy chief of staff to Gov. Kathy Hochul and deputy diversity officer under former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats.",
      "Sun has pleaded not guilty to charges alleging she violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act, conspired with her husband to commit money laundering and helped people commit visa fraud to enter the U.S. illegally. Hu has pleaded not guilty to charges including money laundering, tax evasion, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and misuse of identification. Neither has been charged with espionage.",
      "They both pleaded not guilty to bribery and other charges in the alleged mask scheme.",
      "\u201cMs. Sun maintains that she did not commit any of the offenses with which she is charged and expects that a jury would reject the government\u2019s most recent accusations at trial,\u201d Sun's lawyer, Jarrod L. Schaeffer, wrote in a court filing that unsuccessfully sought to dismiss the case.",
      "Schaeffer contends the government charged Sun not because she was acting as a foreign agent, but because she and her family \u201chad too much money.\u201d The case, he wrote, is filled with \u201cglaring inconsistencies\" and some charges either fail to meet legal thresholds or are barred by the statute of limitations.",
      "Opening statements are set for Wednesday morning in Brooklyn federal court. A jury was picked on Monday. Judge Brian Cogan has said he expects the trial to take several weeks.",
      "Federal prosecutors allege Sun acted at the request of Chinese officials to block representatives of the Taiwanese government from having access to the governor\u2019s office and shaped New York governmental messaging to align with the priorities of the Chinese government, among other things.",
      "In return, Hu got help for his business activities in China \u2014 a financial boost that prosecutors said allowed the couple to buy their multimillion-dollar property on Long Island, a condominium in Hawaii for $1.9 million, and luxury cars including a 2024 Ferrari, prosecutors said.",
      "Sun also received smaller gifts, the indictment said, including tickets to performances by a visiting Chinese orchestra and ballet groups and \u201cNanjing-style salted ducks\u201d that were prepared by the personal chef of a Chinese government official and delivered to Sun\u2019s parents\u2019 home in New York.",

      "Sun used her ties to China to help New York wrangle PPE, connecting the state with vendors the Chinese government recommended. But, according to the indictment, she also forged documents to falsely claim that Chinese contacts had suggested two additional companies. One was run by Sun\u2019s second cousin, and the other by Hu's business associate, the indictment said.",
      "Sun didn\u2019t disclose those relationships to New York\u2019s government, which signed contracts with the companies in March 2020 and went on to pay them over $44 million, according to the indictment. The cousin funneled about $2.3 million back to Hu, the indictment said.",
      "Asked about Sun while testifying before a congressional subcommittee in September 2024, Cuomo said: \u201cShe was a junior member in my team. I wouldn\u2019t recognize her if she was in this room today.\u201d",

      "In 2010, the Department of Mental Health had its budget cut by $40 million in the wake of the recession. At least 10 state-run psychiatric facilities have closed over the past three decades, leaving only three inpatient facilities with 504 total beds, and just one where men facing criminal charges can receive treatment to restore them to competency.",
      "The lawsuit that led to the consent decree was filed in 2016, alleging delays at every point in the process that violated constitutional due process.",
      "First, there was a wait for psychiatric evaluations. Then if deemed unfit for trial, there was a wait for a spot at the lone secure facility that serves men: Taylor Hardin Secure Medical Facility. Finally, anyone deemed unable to be restored to competency for trial had to wait for longer-term treatment at community based facilities.",

      "An artist is auctioning off his archive for a sculpture at CIA headquarters that has transfixed code breakers for decades",
      "BOSTON -- When Jim Sanborn was commissioned to create a sculpture at CIA headquarters, he wanted to do something that spoke to its world of spies and secret codes.",
      "The result was a 10-foot-tall, S-shaped copper screen called \u201cKryptos\u201d that resembles a piece of paper coming out of a fax machine. One side features a series of staggered alphabets that are key to decoding the four encrypted messages on the other side.",
      "\u201cAt the time, codes and encoding was an esoteric subject,\u201d Sanborn said. \u201cI wanted it to be less so, and I wanted it to be fun. ... Any artist\u2019s goal when they make an artwork is to have the viewer\u2019s attention for as long as possible.\u201d",
      "Sanborn figured the first three messages on the sculpture, dedicated in 1990 and known as K1, K2 and K3, would be cracked relatively quickly, and they were.",
      "But 35 years later, the fourth, K4, remains a mystery and a source of obsessive fascination among thousands of \u201cKryptos\u201d fans. One person has contacted Sanborn every week for the past 20 years, trying to solve K4, and the artist received so many inquiries that he began charging $50 per submission to make it more manageable.",
      "Now, Sanborn, who at age 79 has had a series of health scares in recent years, is auctioning off the solution to K4, anointing a new \u201cKryptos\u201d keeper whom he hopes will keep its secrets and continue interacting with followers.",
      "Boston-based RR Auction launched the auction last month. It runs through Nov. 20, with the top bid currently at $201,841 for the \u201cKryptos\u201d archive.",
      "\u201cSince its installation in 1990, \u2018Kryptos\u2019 has become a worldwide phenomenon,\u201d said Bobby Livingston, executive vice president at RR Auction. \u201cK4 has stumped professional cryptologists and code breakers as well as amateurs who have tried to solve it and read the message.

      "The archive includes everything needed to solve K4, along with an alternate paragraph that the artist is calling K5. The original coding charts for K1, K2 and K3 will also be up for bid, along with the original scrambled texts, which Sanborn said he showed to the CIA's Department of Historical Intelligence to ensure the agency understood there was nothing \u201cuntoward\u201d on the sculpture.",
      "Sanborn has created about 50 public sculptures, including a memorial for a 2019 mass shooting in Odessa, Texas, but he is best known for \u201cKryptos.\u201d Over the years, snippets from the cryptic sculpture appeared on the dust jacket of the Dan Brown bestseller \u201cThe Da Vinci Code\u201d and were mentioned in a chapter of Brown's book \u201cThe Lost Symbol.\u201d",
      "In September, Sanborn got a phone call from two \u201cKryptos\u201d sleuths. Tipped off by the auction listing, writer and researcher Jarett Kobek asked playwright and journalist Richard Byrne to take photos of Sanborn\u2019s papers at the Smithsonian\u2019s Archives of American Art. Among the papers were Sanborn\u2019s original scrambled texts.",

      "Kobek said he had hoped to discover \u201ca document that had some vague hint of about how K4 was encoded,\u201d but was astonished to realize they had stumbled upon the text itself instead.",
      "Sanborn was initially \u201cshocked\u201d by the call, and he and his wife, Jae Ko, \u201cjust sort of put our heads in our hands.\u201d He was mostly upset at himself for putting the texts into the archive \u2014 he has since sealed his papers so they can\u2019t be accessed for the next 50 years.

      "\u201cIt was miserable, and it\u2019s still miserable,\u201d Sanborn said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult. There\u2019s a lot of regret and anguish.\u201d",
      "Sanborn initially figured that the discovery meant the auction could not proceed. But he decided to proceed anyway, while changing it from just offering the secrets to K4 to offering the entire archive. RR Auction also acknowledged the pair's discovery on the auction description, though Kobek said that came weeks afterward.",
      "\u201cThe important distinction is that they discovered it. They did not decipher it,\u201d Sanborn said. \u201cThey do not have the key. They don\u2019t have the method with which it\u2019s deciphered. To the entire cryptographic community, that method is the real deal, and nobody has the method but me.\u201d",
      "Elonka Dunin, co-moderator of the largest group of \u201cKryptos\u201d enthusiasts, said most people she has talked with want K4 kept secret. \u201cThere is a very strong desire that we would like to know whether K4 is even solvable,\u201d she said.",
      "Sanborn came up with the texts, and a retired CIA cryptographer showed him several systems for encoding them. The paragraphs, he said, were \u201cdesigned to unravel like a ball of string\u201d or \u201cnesting Russian dolls\u201d and get increasingly difficult.",
      "Still, Sanborn and RR Auction aren't taking any chances. Sanborn unsuccessfully asked Kobek and Byrne to sign a nondisclosure agreement that included giving them a portion of the auction proceeds. RR Auction also sent the pair scores of emails threatening legal action for everything from trade secret violations to defamation.",

Still, he wants the auction house and others to respect their discovery, noting that allies during World War II used weather reports to help solve encrypted messages.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the first person to say that it was not a mathematically cryptographic solve. One hundred percent. There\u2019s no way that it was,\u201d Kobek said. \u201cBut to pretend that this has no connection to the history of cryptography is little more than advertising for an auction.\u201d",

      "British political commentator Sami Hamdi plans to leave the U.S. after spending over two weeks in immigration detention",
      "WASHINGTON -- British political commentator Sami Hamdi is going to voluntarily leave the U.S. after spending more than two weeks in immigration detention over what his supporters say was his criticism of Israel. The Trump administration has accused him of cheering on Hamas.",
      "Hamdi, who is Muslim, was on a speaking tour in the U.S. when he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Oct. 26. He had just addressed the annual gala for the Sacramento, California, chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, the day before his arrest.",
      "In a statement late Monday, the organization said Hamdi had \u201cchosen to accept an offer to leave the United States voluntarily.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell. His only real \u2018offense\u2019 was speaking clearly about Israel\u2019s genocidal war crimes against Palestinians,\u201d said the CEO of CAIR\u2019s California chapter, Hussam Ayloush, in a statement.",
      "Hamdi\u2019s detention was part of broader efforts by the Trump administration to identify and potentially expel thousands of foreigners in the United States who it says have either fomented or participated in unrest or publicly supported protests against Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza.",
      "Those enforcement actions have been criticized by civil rights groups as violations of constitutional protections for freedom of speech, which apply to anyone in the United States and not just to American citizens.",
      "Zahra Billoo, Executive Director of CAIR's San Francisco office, said Tuesday that the logistics of Hamdi\u2019s departure were still being worked out but that it might happen later this week. Billoo said there were \u201cno conditions to the voluntary departure\u201d and that he\u2019s not barred from seeking another U.S. visa in the future.",
      "CAIR said Hamdi\u2019s charging document in immigration court did not accuse him of criminal conduct or security concerns but only listed a visa overstay, which they blamed on the government revoking his visa.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in a statement Tuesday that Hamdi had requested voluntary departure and \u201cICE is happily arranging his removal from this country.\u201d",

      "The Department of Homeland Security said at the time of Hamdi\u2019s arrest that the State Department had revoked his visa and that ICE had put him in immigration proceedings. Homeland Security later accused him of supporting Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel.",
      "In a statement at the time, McLaughlin cited remarks he made in a video posted online shortly after the Hamas attacks in which he asked: \u201cHow many of you felt it in your hearts when you got the news that it happened? How many of you felt the euphoria? Allah Akbar.\u201d",
      "Hamdi said later his intent was not to praise the attacks but to suggest that the violence was \u201ca natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians.\u201d",
      "The State Department has not said specifically what Hamdi said or did that initiated the revocation but in a post on X the department said: \u201cThe United States has no obligation to host foreigners\u201d who the administration deems to \u201csupport terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans. We continue to revoke the visas of persons engaged in such activity.\u201d",

      "A rural Kansas county has agreed to pay more than $3 million and apologize over a law enforcement raid on a small-town weekly newspaper in August 2023",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- A rural Kansas county has agreed to pay a little more than $3 million and apologize over a law enforcement raid on a small-town weekly newspaper in August 2023 that sparked an outcry over press freedom.",
      "Marion County was among multiple defendants in five federal lawsuits filed by the Marion County Record's parent company, the paper's publisher, newspaper employees, a former Marion City Council member whose home also was raided, and the estate of the publisher's 98-year-old mother, the paper's co-owner, who died the day after the raid. An attorney for the newspaper, Bernie Rhodes, released a copy of the five-page signed agreement Tuesday.",
      "Eric Meyer, the paper's editor and publisher, told The Associated Press he is hoping the size of the payment is large enough to discourage similar actions against news organizations in the future. Legal claims against the city and city officials have not been settled, and Meyer said he believes they will face a larger judgment though he doesn't expect those claims to be resolved for some time.",
      "\u201cThe goal isn\u2019t to get the money. The money is symbolic,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cThe press has basically been under assault.\u201d",
      "The raid triggered a national debate about press freedom focused on Marion, a town of about 1,900 people set among rolling prairie hills about 150 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of Kansas City, Missouri. Meyer\u2019s 98-year-old mother, Joan, lived with him and died of a heart attack that he blamed on the stress of the raid.",
      "Three days after the raid, the local prosecutor said there wasn't enough evidence to justify it. Experts said Marion's police chief at the time, Gideon Cody, was on legally shaky ground when he ordered the raid, and a former top federal prosecutor for Kansas suggested that it might have been a criminal violation of civil rights, saying: \u201cI\u2019d probably have the FBI starting to look.\u201d",
      "Two special prosecutors who reviewed the raid and its aftermath said nearly a year later that the Record had committed no crimes before Cody led the raid, that the warrants signed by a judge contained inaccurate information from an \u201cinadequate investigation\u201d and the searches were not legally justified. Cody resigned as police chief in October 2023.",
      "Cody is scheduled to go to trial in February in Marion County on a felony charge of interfering with a judicial process, accused by the two special prosecutors of persuading a potential witness to withhold information from authorities when they later investigated his conduct. He had pleaded not guilty and did not respond to a text message Tuesday seeking comment about the county's agreement.",

      "Stephen Bryant, 44, is scheduled to die at 6 p.m. Friday by firing squad at a Columbia prison.",
      "Lawyers for Bryant made a last ditch appeal arguing the judge who sentenced him to die never got to consider how badly his brain was damaged from his mother\u2019s alcohol and drug use while pregnant.",
      "But the South Carolina Supreme Court rejected that appeal late Monday writing that even if Bryant's defense had done more investigation into whether he had Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, it simply would have given a different reason for his problems while not changing the outcome of a death sentence.",
      "\u201cBy any stretch, (Bryant) demonstrated a high level of planning, decision making, and calculation,\u201d the justices wrote in Monday's unanimous decision.",

Bryant\u2019s lawyers said while his original defense team said he was unnerved in the months before the killings because he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about being sexually abused by relatives as a child, they didn\u2019t detail how that abuse had affected his ability to conform to the law.",

      "They also included what they said was newly uncovered evidence including a 2024 interview with a clinical psychologist where Bryant described abuse he suffered from male relatives, his mother, a preacher\u2019s wife and several strippers in his neighborhood before he became a teenager.",
      "The justices sided with prosecutors who said the three killings, along with another shooting and two burglaries mostly along dirt roads in the rural Sumter County east of Columbia weren\u2019t impulsive crimes from a damaged brain but were methodical and cunning.",

      "Bryant will be the third man executed by firing squad in South Carolina this year.",

      "The United States\u2019 Catholic bishops are set to elect their next president and vice president in Baltimore",
      "The United States\u2019 Catholic bishops will elect their next president and vice president on Tuesday in Baltimore. The vote acts as a barometer for the bishops\u2019 priorities, hinging on whether they choose an outspoken culture warrior as their next leader.",
      "The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops as a whole was often at odds with the approach of Pope Francis. His successor, Pope Leo XIV, is continuing a similar pastoral emphasis on marginalized people, poverty and the environment.",
      "Half the 10 candidates on the ballot come from the conservative wing of the conference. The difference is more in style than substance. Most U.S. Catholic bishops are reliably conservative on social issues, but some place more emphasis on opposing abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "\u201cThe slate of 10 candidates perfectly reflects the dynamics of the American hierarchy in that it\u2019s split down the middle,\u201d said David Gibson, director of Fordham University\u2019s Center on Religion and Culture.",
      "There is no clear front-runner. The candidates were nominated by their fellow bishops, and the winner will succeed outgoing leader, Military Services Archbishop Timothy Broglio, for a three-year term. The current vice president, Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore, is too close to the mandatory retirement age of 75 to assume the top post.",
      "Among conservatives up for leadership, Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul Coakley is seen as a strong contender, having already been elected in 2022 to serve as secretary, the No. 3 conference official.",
      "Coakley serves as adviser to the Napa Institute, an association for conservative Catholic powerbrokers. In 2018, he publicly supported an ardent critic of Pope Francis, Italian Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who was later excommunicated for schism.",
      "A well-known name on the ballot is Bishop Robert Barron of Minnesota\u2019s Winona-Rochester diocese, whose popular Word on Fire ministry has made him a Catholic media star. He serves on President Donald Trump\u2019s Religious Liberty Commission, along with another candidate, Bishop Kevin Rhoades of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Indiana.",
      "Some Catholic insiders are hoping for a leader who could help unify U.S. bishops and work well with the Vatican. They point to contenders like Archbishop Charles Thompson of Indianapolis and Bishop Daniel Flores of Brownsville, Texas.",
      "As Latinos, Flores and another candidate, Archbishop Nelson Perez of Philadelphia, represent a growing segment of the U.S. Catholic Church. Flores has also been the U.S. bishops\u2019 leader in the Vatican\u2019s synod process to modernize the church.",
      "\u201cCertainly, the two names that get talked about the most are Flores and Coakley,\u201d said Steven Millies, a professor of public theology at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago.",

      "A coalition of retired military nurses and others is pushing to award the Congressional Gold Medal to World War II nurses",
      "DANVILLE, Calif. -- At age 106, Alice Darrow can clearly recall her days as a nurse during World War II, part of a pioneering group that dodged bullets as they hauled packs full of medical supplies and treated the burns and gunshot wounds of troops.",
      "Some nurses were killed by enemy fire. Others spent years as prisoners of war. Most returned home to quiet lives, receiving little recognition.",
      "Darrow sat with patients, even after-hours. One of them had arrived at her hospital on California's Mare Island with a bullet lodged in his heart. He was not expected to survive surgery, yet he would change her life.",
      "\u201cTo them, you\u2019re everything because you\u2019re taking care of them,\u201d she said, sitting at her home in the San Francisco Bay Area town of Danville.",
      "Eighty years after the war ended, a coalition of retired military nurses and others is campaigning to award one of the nation\u2019s highest civilian honors, the Congressional Gold Medal, to all nurses who served in WWII. Other groups, such as the Women Airforce Service Pilots of WWII and the real-life Rosie the Riveters, have already received the honor.",
      "\u201cThe general public doesn\u2019t often recognize, I think, the contribution that the nurses have made in pretty much every war,\u201d said Patricia Upah, a retired colonel who served as an Army nurse in conflicts abroad, and whose late mother was also a Army nurse in the South Pacific in World War II.",
      "Only a handful, like Darrow, are still alive. The coalition knows of five World War II nurses who are still living \u2014 including Elsie Chin Yuen Seetoo, 107, who became the first Chinese American nurse to join the Army Nurse Corps. They fear time is running out to honor the trailblazers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high time we honor the nurses who stepped up and did their part to defend our freedom,\u201d U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said in a statement.",
      "Baldwin and U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, have sponsored legislation to award the medal, but it faces steep odds. It needs two-thirds of each chamber \u2014 67 cosponsors in the Senate and 290 in the House \u2014 and so far, the bills have eight and six cosponsors, respectively.",
      "Before the war, there were fewer than 600 nurses with the U.S. Army and 1,700 with the U.S. Navy. By the end of the war, those numbers had ballooned to 59,000 in the Army and 14,000 in the Navy.",
      "The Congressional bills cite harrowing examples of bravery. Some nurses served on Navy hospital ships treating patients as the vessels came under fire. Sixty nurses landed off the coast of North Africa on Nov. 8, 1942, to set up shop and care for invading troops.",
      "\u201cWithout weapons, they waded ashore amid enemy sniper fire and ultimately took shelter in an abandoned civilian hospital,\" the legislation states.",
      "The nurses saved lives. Fewer than 4% of U.S. soldiers in WWII who received medical care in the field or underwent evacuation died from wounds or disease, the legislation states.",
      "\u201cThey probably saw more infections. They probably saw more chemical casualties. Remember, they didn\u2019t have disposable products, so they had to sterilize everything,\u201d says Edward Yackel, a retired colonel and president of the Army Nurse Corps Association, of World War II nurses.",
      "\u201cWithout them,\u201d he says, \u201cwe would not have the knowledge base we need now to fight the wars of today.\u201d",
      "Some nurses endured harsh captivity. In 1942, nearly 80 military nurses were captured when the U.S. surrendered the Philippines to Japan. Held as prisoners of war, the women endured starvation rations and disease but continued to work until their liberation three years later.",

      "Conservation groups are suing over a program that authorizes killing brown and black bears as a way to help grow the size of a southwest Alaska caribou herd",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Conservation groups sued Monday over a state program in Alaska that authorizes killing brown bears and black bears as a way to increase the size of a once-significant caribou herd in the southwest part of the state. The groups allege the program lacks a scientific basis and is unconstitutional.",
      "The lawsuit filed in state court says the program adopted by the Alaska Board of Game in July doesn\u2019t require the Department of Fish and Game to monitor bear populations to ensure their numbers remain sustainable. It also says the program \u2014 carried out by department employees and allowing them to shoot from helicopters \u2014 sets no limits on how many bears can be killed in an area that's roughly the size of Indiana.",
      "Filed by Trustees for Alaska on behalf of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance and the Center for Biological Diversity, the lawsuit lists as defendants the state, the board, the Department of Fish and Game and the department's commissioner. A message seeking comment was sent to the Alaska Department of Law, which typically represents state agencies in litigation.",
      "Monday's lawsuit is the latest in an ongoing legal fight over what Fish and Game has cast as an effort to restore the Mulchatna caribou herd. The herd, named for its traditional calving ground, peaked in number at around 190,000 in the late 1990s and had provided an important source of food for subsistence hunters from dozens of communities. But the herd's numbers began falling, down to about 13,000 caribou by 2019, and hunting has not been allowed since 2021, according to the department.",
      "The department has said that factors such as disease, hunting, food availability and quality, and predation can affect caribou survival, and in this case, the board determined it could address predation. It said it's responding to requests to help rebuild the herd and restore the caribou as a food source for the region.",
      "In a fall newsletter, the department said bears and wolves \u201chave been identified as significant calf predators.\u201d It said an aerial survey last fall indicated the ratio of calves to cows in the herd's western subgroup was the highest recorded since 1999. It said this suggested a \u201cpositive response\u201d to its 2023 and 2024 predator control program targeting bears and wolves on calving grounds.",
      "According to the lawsuit, in May 2023 the agency killed \u201cevery single brown and black bear it found within the 1,200-square-mile (3,108-square-kilometer) focus area encompassing the western Mulchatna caribou herd calving grounds.\" Altogether, in 2023 and 2024, 180 bears, most brown bears, were killed, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Alaska Wildlife Alliance previously sued to end the program. In that case, a judge in March found fault with the process in which it was adopted and concluded the state lacked data on bear sustainability in the region before implementing the program.",
      "But the board and department pushed ahead, implementing emergency regulations under which 11 bears were killed before those were struck down by another judge.",

      "\"Ninety-seven percent could not distinguish between music entirely generated by AI and human-created music,\" said Deezer in a statement.",
      "The survey was conducted between October 6 and 10 in eight countries: Brazil, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and the United States.",
      "Deezer said more than half of the respondents felt uncomfortable at not being able to tell the difference.",
      "Pollsters also asked broader questions about the impact of AI, with 51 percent saying the technology would lead to more low-quality music on streaming platforms and almost two-thirds believing it will lead to a loss of creativity.",

      "Cleto Escobedo III, longtime bandleader of the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" show, has died, Jimmy Kimmel announced on Tuesday. He was 59 years old.",
      "The late-night talk show host\u00a0mourned the death of one of his oldest friends \u2014 whom he met when he was 9 years old \u2014 writing on Instagram that \"[t]o say that we are heartbroken is an understatement.\"",
      "\"The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto's wife, children and parents in your prayers,\" Kimmel wrote.",
      "Escobedo and Kimmel met as children in Las Vegas, where they grew up across the street from each other. Kimmel wrote on Tuesday that they were \"inseparable.\"",
      "\"We just met one day on the street, and there were a few kids on the street, and him and I just became really close friends, and we kind of had the same sense of humor. We just became pals, and we've been pals ever since,\" Escobedo said in a 2022 interview for Texas Tech University's Southwest Collection oral history archive, disclosing that he and Kimmel were huge fans of David Letterman as kids.",
      "Escobedo would grow up to become a professional musician, specializing in the saxophone, and touring with Earth, Wind and Fire's Phillip Bailey and Paula Abdul. He recorded with Marc Anthony, Tom Scott and Take Six. When Kimmel got his own ABC late-night talk show in 2003, he lobbied for Escobedo to lead the house band on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"Of course I wanted great musicians, but I wanted somebody I had chemistry with,\" Kimmel told WABC in 2015. \"And there's nobody in my life I have better chemistry with than him.\"",
      "In 2016, on Escobedo's 50th birthday, Kimmel dedicated a segment to his friend, recalling pranks with a BB gun or mooning people from the back of his mom's car.",
      "\"Cleto had a bicycle with a sidecar attached to it. We called it the side hack. I would get in the sidecar and then Cleto would drive me directly into garbage cans and bushes,\" Kimmel recalled.",
      "News of Escobedo's death comes after Thursday's episode of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" was abruptly canceled. David Duchovny, Joe Keery and Madison Beer were set as the show's guests. The date and cause of Escobedo's death weren't immediately known.",
      "Escobedo's father is also a member of the Kimmel house band and plays tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, the father-son duo celebrated nearly two decades of performing on-screen together.",
      "\"Jimmy asked me, 'Who are we going to get in the band?' I said, 'Well, my normal guys,' and he knew my guys because he had been coming to see us and stuff before he was famous, just to come support me and whatever. I'd invite him to gigs, and if he didn't have anything to do he'd come check it out, so he knew my guys,\" Escobedo recounted in the 2022 interview. \"Then he just said, 'Hey, man, what about your dad? Wouldn't that be kind of cool?' I was like, 'That would be way cool.'\"",
      "In the 2022 interview, Escobedo said the bandleader job had one major benefit: family time.",
      "\"Touring and all that stuff is fun, but it's more of a young man's game. Touring, also, too, is not really conducive for family life. I've learned over the years, being on the road and watching how hard it is, leaving your kids for so long. Sometimes they're babies; you come back and then they're talking, it's like, 'What?'\" he said.",

      "Friends established a\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0account this fall for her medical care. They said she had fractured four bones in her neck, right wrist and left hip. While recovering, she also developed infections, requiring hospitalization and rehab.",
      "Kirkland acted in such films as \"The Way We Were\" with Barbra Streisand, \"Revenge\" with Kevin Costner, \"Cold Feet\" with Keith Carradine and Tom Waits, Ron Howard's \"EDtv,\" Oliver Stone's \"JFK,\" \"Heatwave\" with Cicely Tyson, \"High Stakes\" with Kathy Bates, \"Bruce Almighty\" with Jim Carrey and the 1991 TV movie \"The Haunted,\" about a family dealing with paranormal activity. She had a cameo in Mel Brooks' \"Blazing Saddles.\"",
      "Her biggest role was in 1987's \"Anna\" as a fading Czech movie star remaking her life in the United States and mentoring a younger actor, Paulina Porizkova. Kirkland won a Golden Globe and earned an Oscar nomination along with Cher in \"Moonstruck,\" Glenn Close in \"Fatal Attraction,\" Holly Hunter in \"Broadcast News\" and Meryl Streep in \"Ironweed.\" (The Oscar went to Cher.)",
      "\"Kirkland is one of those performers whose talent has been an open secret to her fellow actors but something of a mystery to the general public,\" a Los Angeles Times critic wrote in\u00a0her review for \"Anna.\" \"There should be no confusion about her identity after this blazing comet of a performance.\"",
      "Kirkland's small-screen acting credits include stints on \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Head Case\" and she was a series regular on the TV shows \"Valley of the Dolls\" and \"Charlie's Angels.\"",
      "Born in New York City, Kirkland's mother was a fashion editor at Vogue and Life magazine who encouraged her daughter to start modeling at age 5. Kirkland graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and studied with Philip Burton, Richard Burton's mentor, and Lee Strasberg, the master of the Method school of acting. An early breakout was appearing in Andy Warhol's \"13 Most Beautiful Women\" in 1964. She appeared naked as a kidnapped rape victim in Terrence McNally's off-Broadway \"Sweet Eros.\"",
      "Some of her early roles were Shakespeare, including the lovesick Helena in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" for New York Shakespeare Festival producer Joseph Papp and Miranda in an off-Broadway production of \"The Tempest.\"",
      "\"I don't think any actor can really call him or herself an actor unless he or she puts in time with Shakespeare,\" she told\u00a0the Los Angeles Times in 1991. \"It shows up, it always shows up in the work, at some point, whether it's just not being able to have breath control, or not being able to appreciate language as poetry and music, or not having the power that Shakespeare automatically instills you with when you take on one of his characters.\"",
      "Kirkland was a member of several New Age groups, taught Insight Transformational Seminars and was a longtime member of the affiliated Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, whose followers believe in soul transcendence.",
      "She reached a career nadir while riding nude on a pig in the 1969 film \"Futz,\" which\u00a0a Guardian reviewer\u00a0dubbed the worst film he had ever seen. \"It was about a man who fell in love with a pig, and even by the dismal standards of the era, it was dismal,\" he wrote.",
      "Kirkland was also known for disrobing for so many other roles and social causes that Time magazine dubbed her\u00a0\"the latter-day Isadora Duncan of nudothespianism.\"",
      "Kirkland volunteered for people who had AIDS, cancer and heart disease, fed homeless people via the American Red Cross, participated in telethons for hospices and was an advocate for inmates, especially young people.",

      "\"It really is an absolute rewiring of how you move through your life,\" LaRue told \"CBS Mornings\" on Tuesday. \"There's no way to ever go back to innocence.\"",
      "In 2007 LaRue, who starred in \"CSI: Miami,\" and her young daughter, Kaya, first started getting threatening phone calls and letters from an anonymous person. Her story is told in a new two-part documentary called \"My Nightmare Stalker: The Eva LaRue Story.\"",
      "\"What is crazy is we, on 'CSI: Miami,' we were solving cases in 43 minutes, not including commercials. In real life we did not have the technology we were pretending to have on the show,\" LaRue said.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning actress said she and her daughter had to move twice. At one point, her stalker found her daughter's high school and pretended to be her father, \"and told her to stand out in front of the school and he was going to pick her up.\"",
      "The stalking went on for more than a decade and affected her physically, causing hair loss and hives.",
      "\"There was no place to hide because you don't know where he could be, so you are really in a prison of your own making because you are trying to be four steps ahead of what he could do and those possibilities are endless,\" she said.",
      "\"Take my life back\"",
      "LaRue described a moment of an epiphany when a friend invited her and her daughter to Italy while \"CSI: Miami\" wasn't filming.",
      "\"We weren't there 36 hours, in the middle of the night, it's like 3 in the morning and I have jet lag and I'm kind of awake and rolling around. The bedroom door opens up and it is lit from the back,\" she said, explaining she couldn't see the individual's face at the door, but thought it was her friend.",
      "The next morning, she found out it was a break-in \u2014 but not her stalker.",
      "\"All I had done was pray all day and all night for months at that point for some sort of guidance. I really felt like it was my answer that God literally said in that moment, 'If I wanted you dead, I'll follow you to Italy,'\" she said.",
      "\"So I felt in that moment, oddly enough, this weird sense of peace. That was the first time I could kind of take my life back.\"",
      "Stalker arrest and moving forward",
      "LaRue's stalker was caught in 2019 through DNA, 12 years after the threats began.",
      "James David Rogers of Ohio was sentenced to 40 months in prison in 2022 \u2014 but is now out.",
      "Asked if she feels safe, LaRue said, \"I don't think we'll ever feel safe.\"",
      "\"Your brain never goes back to not being hyper vigilant,\" she said about moving forward.",
      "She said she almost didn't do the documentary and understands why some celebrities don't.",

    "story": [
      "As a public figure with a massive social media following, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy is no stranger to threats and abuse online. But recently, the entrepreneur says he's become \"far more aware\" of how he could face these threats in everyday life.",
      "\"You know, you start getting into these yahoos on social media, and there's, like, yahoos,\" Portnoy told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil in an interview airing on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" this weekend. \"I don't even know what they're saying. But they start talking about me, trying to get my name probably used because they're just in this endless cycle of needing to stay in the news.\"",
      "Conversations about him can quickly spiral online and \"open the floodgates on just lunatics,\" Portnoy said. In response, the businessman and social media personality said he has installed round-the-clock security at his house. \"It only takes one,\" Portnoy added.",
      "Recently, a man was overheard on video shouting an antisemitic comment and throwing coins toward Portnoy while he was recording his famous \"One Bite\" pizza review outside of a Mississippi restaurant. Starkville Police on Monday arrested the alleged heckler, identified as 20-year-old Patrick McClintock, on a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace.",
      "\"Every person has the right to feel safe and respected in our community. Offensive words alone are protected, but when behavior disrupts a public event or risks violence, the Starkville Police Department will take steps to help maintain safety and security,\" the police said in a statement to CBS News, adding that the state could impose enhanced penalties if a violation meets the criteria for bias-motivated or discriminatory reason. The incident remains under investigation.",
      "\"Imagine hating somebody just because of their religion in this f---ing country,\" Portnoy said in a social media video posted after the incident.",
      "Antisemitic incidents have increased almost 900% in the past 10 years, according to the Anti-Defamation League, in many cases involving violence.",
      "Even before that recent incident, there had been a \"definitive shift\" toward antisemitism, Portnoy told Dokoupil, adding that it was a form of hate that he experiences on a daily basis.",
      "\"For me, being a Jewish person, like, you got to step up,\" he said. \"You're kind of someone people look up to in the Jewish community. You have to be, like, 'All right, this is not normal ha-ha with the guys. People are coming up with real hate.'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Nov 2025 10:07:29 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor, writer and musician has been an unconventional and unforgettable presence, from his Oscar-winning \"Sling Blade,\" to his rock band, The Boxmasters. He's now back in Season 2 of the Paramount+ series \"Landman,\" set in the oil fields of West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "Billy Bob Thornton's irreverence mixes with his Southern charm like a good ol' whiskey sour. After all, he can deliver lines with a sincerity that is almost mocking. He even, with a wink and a nod, played a not-so-saintly St. Nick. Some saw that as a brave choice. He doesn't. \"A brave choice is to see someone being attacked in a park and go intervene; that's a brave choice,\" he said. \"It's not a brave choice to do some weird thing in the middle of a scene, you know what I mean?\"",
      "For his current role, he's making choices, too, mostly just to be himself. \"Well, I mean I pretty much am playing myself if I were a landman.\"",
      "In the Paramount+ show \"Landman,\" viewers get a peek behind the curtain of a world we really usually see. \"I mean, the movie 'Giant,' one of my favorites, I mean, that took place in the oil business of West Texas,\" he said. \"I always tell people that this is kind of like 'Giant,' with cursing!\"",
      "Fans have been waiting a long time for \"Landman\"'s second season. It debuts next Sunday.",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 2 of \"Landman\" click on the video player below:",
      "According to his co-star Ali Larter, Thornton doesn't like to rehearse. \"You have to be ready to go,\" she told us. \"Fresh. Like, whatever happens is going to happen.\"",
      "Thornton's hillbilly vibe isn't a put-on \u2013 he proudly calls himself a Tex-Arkansan, the product of a lot of rural places that even the railroads passed by.",
      "But he wouldn't trade growing up in a small town for anything: \"You know, I keep my upbringing in my back pocket all the time,\" he said. \"You never forget it.\"",
      "While he never worked on an oil rig, he did have his fair share of jobs where dangerous machinery decided if you came home at night or not. \"Machine shops and sawmills are both not exactly the safest places to work, especially when you're a dumb little skinny hippie kid with hair to your waist,\" he said. \"We always had a joke about sawmill workers, which was, do you know what this is? [He holds up three fingers.] It's a sawmill worker ordering five beers.\"",
      "He went from sawdust to Hollywood fairy dust in a pretty unconventional way. \"I only took drama 'cause I thought I gotta get a C in something, you know, because I was not good in school,\" he said.",
      "His idols were Robert Duvall, Bruce Dern, and Sam Elliott. But in Los Angeles, at a cocktail party where Thornton was working as a bus boy, famed screenwriter and director Billy Wilder told him acting wasn't for him.",
      "\"He said, 'Forget about it. You're too ugly to be a leading man,'\" Thornton recalled. \"And he said, 'You're too pretty to be a character actor.' I said, 'What do I do?' He said, 'Can you write?' I said, 'Yeah, I do write.' He goes, 'Write your own stories, create your own characters, don't stand in line with everybody else.'\"",
      "He did write his own story, and create his own character. \"Sling Blade\" (1996), which he wrote and directed, earned him an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay, and an Oscar nomination for best actor to boot.",
      "Asked if he thinks he'll go back to writing and directing, he replied, \"You know, I don't know that anybody wants to see what I have to say as a director or writer, 'cause all my stuff is based on Southern literature. And I don't think that those stories would really be relevant to anyone right now. So, I doubt I ever do it again.\"",
      "Letting go of things he loves isn't easy. We were stunned to find out he hasn't felt truly care-free since the short-lived TV show \"The Outsiders\" \u2013 more than 30 years ago. \u00a0\"I had no responsibility,\" he said. \"I was making $2,500 an episode. Never thought I'd see that kind of money. Then, my brother Jimmy died, and changed my life. He was my best friend.\"",
      "\"So, that's when you talk about carrying it around in your back pocket?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\"",
      "They both grew up playing in bands. To this day, Billy Bob still idolizes his brother's musical talent. \"He played every instrument, except drums,\" Thornton said. \"He looked like he had a disorder when he tried to play drums.\"",
      "Thornton never gave up his love of music. His band, The Boxmasters, has recorded 19 albums, and this past Summer they opened for The Who. \"We're just there to waste 45 minutes while they're getting ready, ya' know?\" he said. \"So hopefully the fans will be with us.\"",
      "He doesn't act his age, and in hindsight we probably shouldn't have asked about it.",
      "\"Any thoughts on turning 70?\" I said.",
      "\"What did you say\" Thornton replied, raising an eyebrow. \"But uh, no, You know what, it's so funny you're scared of every milestone. But this one actually did affect me in a way that I had to, you know, have a few meetings with myself late at night.\"",
      "In the end, what Billy Bob Thornton has found is that he and so many of his older contemporaries, including his friend Sam Elliott (who is still acting with him at 81), are still defined by their good work.",
      "\"We've all seen each other get older,\" Thornton said. \"And when I see that wisdom and see the respect that people have for them, it just kind of makes everything melt away somehow. I mean, I'm in a successful band and I'm in a successful show. Every day when I wake up, I just say I'm blessed. That's really it.\"",

    "summary": "She's been called \"the acting world's best-kept secret.\" But Oscar-nominee Jessie Buckley's latest role, playing the wife of William Shakespeare in \"Hamnet,\" may change that.",
    "story": [
      "She's been called \"the acting world's best-kept secret.\" But Jessie Buckley's latest role, in the film \"Hamnet,\" may change that. As Rolling Stone put it, people \"will be talking about Jessie Buckley's performance for years.\"",
      "Buckley plays the wife of William Shakespeare (portrayed by fellow Irish actor Paul Mescal). Adapted from Maggie O'Farrell's novel, it's a fictionalized tale about the death of Shakespeare's son, Hamnet. It imagines the tragedy inspired him to write \"Hamlet.\"",
      "\"I just knew I had to go somewhere mentally, emotionally,\" Buckley said of her work.",
      "I said, \"You have this fire inside you \u2013 that's what we see on film.\"",
      "\"I don't know, do you?\" she replied.",
      "\"I'd say so, in what I've seen, you see it!\"",
      "\"I have fire, but I tell you what 'Hamnet' gave me, which I also was looking for, was tenderness. And sometimes it's just as strong as fire.\"",
      "She said when she started shooting the more difficult scenes, like the death of her child, she told her husband she needed to go away for two weeks. So, Buckley came to Hampstead Heath, a vast green space in London, where she'd go swimming each morning. \"I just need to be in nature and start my day and wake up that way, and then go to the set and see what came out,\" she said.",
      "She says \"Hamnet\" director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (an Oscar-winner for \"Nomadland\") reminded her cinema is not just escapism. \"Our jobs as actors and the storytellers are to touch the most heightened expressions that are too hard to hold on our own,\" Buckley said. \"I get to incubate the bits of us, myself, the shadow bits.\"",
      "\"What are the shadow bits of you that came out for this role?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm not telling you!\" she laughed. \"You have to watch it and make up your own mind.\"",
      "\"The sacred flame of star quality\"",
      "Her breakthrough role was playing a single mom just out of prison in 2018's \"Wild Rose.\" Then, in 2022, Buckley got an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress in \"The Lost Daughter.\" Her other credits included \"I'm Thinking of Ending Things,\" \"Beast\" and \"Women Talking,\" and the TV series \"Fargo.\"",
      "She said, \"I never in a million years thought I'd make a film.\"",
      "Because? \"I didn't have a TV 'til I was 15,\" she said. \"And it was exotic, like, it was in Hollywood. It wasn't in Kerry.\"",
      "In rugged County Kerry, in Ireland's southeast, Buckley grew up in an artistic family, playing harp, clarinet and piano. She sang and did school productions. But it was the British talent show, \"I'd Do Anything,\" that put her on a bigger stage \u2013 and in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber. He praised her, saying, \"Jessie has the sacred flame of star quality.\"",
      "She lost that competition, but quickly landed theater roles. Her first Shakespeare performance was near the spot in London where Shakespeare's early plays were first performed, at the original Rose Playhouse, built in 1587.",
      "Shakespeare changed everything for her: \"I think before, I felt like music was the only way to contain what was kind of wanting to come out, and then Shakespeare's words and his worlds were so titanic that it just made me realize how powerful words could be,\" she said.",
      "Of acting opposite Mescal in \"Hamnet,\" Buckley said, \"I absolutely adore that man. And from our very first chemistry read \u2026\"",
      "\"Chemistry read is to make sure you have chemistry?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" she laughed. \"I mean, it would be really depressing if I didn't, wouldn't it? I'd be like the only woman in the world who failed to find chemistry with Paul Mescal!\"",
      "The 35-year-old actor says she also found chemistry with Christian Bale for her next film, in which she plays the bride of Frankenstein's monster. Directed by Maggie Gyllenhall, it's genre- and expectation-bending.\u00a0 \"It's punk, it is proper punk,\" Buckley said. \"I remember when I read it first, it was like being plugged into an electrical socket.\"",
      "I said, \"Maggie Gyllenhaal referred to you as kind of a wild animal.\"",
      "\"Hmm. Good,\" Buckley said.",
      "\"Do you think there's a truth to that?\"",
      "\"I have a lot of life in me!\"",
      "That life and vitality that we now see on film is the journey that brought Buckley to London as a teenager. At the time, she says, she was in a dark place. \"I had depression and I wasn't very well,\" she said. \"And I wanted a lot from life. I was really hungry for it.

    "summary": "Actress Sydney Sweeney stars in a new film based on the life of Christy Martin, the former prizefighter whose biggest battle took place outside of the ring.",
    "story": [
      "People often discuss which Hollywood star might play them in a movie about their life. For legendary boxer Christy Martin, the actor turned out to be Sydney Sweeney. Sweeney transformed into \"Christy,\" which hits theaters on Nov. 7.",
      "Before Martin's story was told on the big screen, she sat down with \"48 Hours\" in 2020 to share her story.\u00a0An encore of \"Christy Martin \u2013 the Fight of her Life\"\u00a0airs Saturday, Nov. 8, at 9/8c on CBS and streams on Paramount+.",
      "Raised as a coal miner's daughter in a small town in West Virginia, to becoming a world championship boxer, Martin made headlines as a pioneer in women's boxing. But few knew of the personal battles she was facing outside the ring.",
      "In the episode, \"48 Hours\" details the story of Martin's struggles with identity, acceptance, drug addiction, and domestic violence at the hands of her former husband and trainer, Jim Martin. \"The same story that you guys got, Sydney puts out there for the people to see and to gain inspiration from,\" Martin recently told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Sweeney spent months preparing for the role, including intense boxing training to recreate Martin's actual fights. In addition to physical preparations, Sweeney told \"48 Hours\" about the research she did to play Christy. \"I mean, I had a lot to be able to pull from and go off of. She had her book, there was the '48 Hours' special \u2026 There were interviews and fight footage. So there was a lot I could prepare with before I met Christy, and then I had Christy in my corner, so I was able to ask her questions and have her by my side and be able to watch her.\"",
      "Martin requested the writers not to \"Hollywoodize\" her life as they scripted her story. Martin said writer Mirrah Foulkes responded, \"There's enough crazy s*** that's happened in your life, we don't have to.\"",
      "As her survival story continues to reach more people, Martin hopes it can help inspire others. \"We're showing a pathway to get out of a domestic violence situation. We're showing how important it is for parents, relatives, friends to be accepting of someone who's a little different ... But I'm the ultimate underdog \u2026 If you can believe it, you can achieve it. Dream big. My Dad used to tell me to dream big, and I think I did.\"",

      "\"The industry still doesn't want to play fair, Salt-N-Pepa have never been afraid of a fight,\" James said.",
      "They took the stage for a medley of their hits. They opened with \"Shoop\" then slid into \"Let's Talk About Sex\" before En Vogue joined them for their joint hit \"What a Man.\" \"Push It\" pushed the energy up another notch.",
      "Spinderella became the first female DJ to enter the hall.",

      "Outkast don't perform, but appear together",
      "Outkast didn't perform together for the first time since 2016 as some had hoped, but the duo stood together on stage, surrounded by a crew of friends and cohorts as they gave grateful speeches after doing rock-paper-scissors to decide who would go first.",
      "Andre 3000 gave a long, rambling funny speech \u2014 \"I'm freestylin' y'all!\" \u2014 that ended in tears when he talked about their very beginnings in a basement \"dungeon\" in Atlanta in the early 1990s.",
      "He choked out the words, \"Great things start in little rooms.\"",

      "\"When you looked into his eyes, it's like eternity was staring back,\" Carrey said. \"For all time, his voice will continue to light up the ether like a Tesla coil.\"",
      "Each of his bandmates, all major godfathers of the Seattle grunge scene, paid their own tearful tributes.",

      "Taylor Momsen, who co-starred as a child with Carrey in \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\" and Brandi Carlile showed serious vocal power with their versions of Cornell's mighty wail, backed by his bandmates on \"Rusty Cage\" and \"Black Hole Sun.\"",
      "Bassist Hiro Yamamoto was among the few who brought up the politics of the moment from the stage.",
      "\"Thanks to my parents, whose story is American citizens who are rounded up and placed into prison camps just for being Japanese during World War II,\" Yamamoto said to some of the biggest cheers of the night. \"Well that affected my life greatly, and it really echoes strongly today.

      "Meg White not in attendance for induction of The White Stripes",
      "The White Stripes reunion that some fans had hoped for didn't happen. Their induction was among the highlights of the night anyway. Twenty One Pilots brought the house down with a version of the duo's stadium-shaking anthem \"Seven Nation Army\" and Olivia Rodrigo and Feist doing a mid-audience acoustic version of \"We're Gonna Be Friends.\"",
      "Their fellow Detroit rock legend Iggy Pop began his induction speech by leading the crowd in a chorus of \"Seven Nation Army\" then remembered his thoughts on meeting them.",
      "\"Cute kids, they're gonna go places,\" Pop said. \"And they did.\"",
      "Drummer Meg White, who has led an almost entirely private life since the band broke up in 2011, did not show up for the ceremony, but Jack White said Meg, his ex-wife, helped him write the speech he delivered while wearing the band's signature red and white.",
      "Jack White shouted out several great duos from across culture and said that kind of one-on-one collaboration is \"the most beautiful thing you can have as an artist and musician.\"",

      "Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac began the ceremony proper by inducting Bad Company. He called the British group founded by Paul Rodgers and Mick Ralphs in 1973 \"classic rock legends\" and \"one of the first super groups,\" but said that, more importantly, \"they were four great musicians who came together for the love of music.\"",
      "Rodgers had to skip the ceremony because of health issues and Ralphs died earlier this year, so drummer Simon Kirke was the only member who took the stage.",
      "He was joined by an ad hoc super group that blasted through a few of the super group's biggest hits.",
      "Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson took lead vocals on their hit \"Feel Like Makin' Love,\" with Nancy Wilson of Heart and Joe Perry of Aerosmith on guitars. Bryan Adams took the stage to sing \"Can't Get Enough.\"",

      "A clip was shown from Zevon's final appearance on the show in 2002, when he was dying of cancer. \"Enjoy every sandwich,\" Zevon said when Letterman asked what he'd learned about mortality.",
      "Letterman was tearful as he showed the crowd a guitar that Zevon gave him later that night.",
      "\"He's never going away,\" Bruce Springsteen said in a recorded tribute. \"He's got a body of work that's as good as anybody's.\"",
      "Letterman outlined several categories of Zevon's cleverly emotional tunes, the final one being \"songs about werewolves\" to a big laugh from the crowd. 1978's \"Werewolves of London\" was Zevon's biggest, and most unlikely, hit.",
      "The Killers then played Zevon's second-biggest hit, \"Lawyers, Guns and Money.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "\"If you're going to do science, why not discover something important?\" That, James Watson (April 6, 1928-Nov. 6, 2025) told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2003, was his motivation when, at age 23, he arrived at Cambridge University eager to take on the mysteries of DNA.",
      "A zoologist who'd just earned his Ph.D. in Chicago, Watson teamed up with the brilliant physicist Francis Crick, who was 12 years his senior. As Crick theorized, Watson built models, burning through idea after idea. \"You're obsessed,\" Watson explained. \"It's like being obsessed with a girl or something. You know, she's there, and you can't get her out of your mind.\"",
      "The team had competition, from researchers at King's College in London, and from Linus Pauling in America. When Maurice Wilkins at King's College showed him an X-ray of a DNA molecule, taken by colleague Rosalind Franklin, Watson saw the direction he had to go: a double helix.",
      "On Feb. 28, 1953, Watson and Crick walked into a pub off the Cambridge campus and announced that they'd discovered the secret to life. Their theory about the double-helix structure of DNA appeared in the British science journal Nature that April. In 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize for divining the structure of DNA \u2014 key to understanding how genetic material works. Their discovery opened the door to genetic engineering, gene therapy, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples, tracing family trees via DNA, and monoclonal antibodies.",
      "Beyond years spent at the California Institute of Technology and Harvard University (where he helped create their program for molecular biology), Watson later helped lead the human genome project, which accelerated genetic research. But while the birth of Dolly the sheep in 1996 suggested that the concept of cloning wasn't mere science fiction, Watson himself wasn't comfortable with the possibilities. \"You can just imagine 200 Meg Ryans in New York City. You know, it would be a mess,\" he said.",
      "In 2007 he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York after he was widely condemned for making racist remarks. He retired shortly after. His inflammatory tendencies were evident years before. In his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery, \"The Double Helix,\" Watson wrote, \"A goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.\"",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \"You have to avoid dumb people. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\""

      "New Delhi - Authorities in India's capital have urged elementary schools to hold classes online, banned construction and urged people to work from home as the annual plague of air pollution hit the \"severe\" category in a health warning system for the first time this season. For the first time, the toxic air has drawn protests against the government, and a warning for people with health issues to simply leave Delhi if they can.",
      "The severe designation indicates potentially serious health impacts for people with impaired immune systems, and negative affects even for healthy people, according to India's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).",
      "The emergency measures were announced after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) sharply rose to 425. An AQI between 400 and 450 is categorized as \"severe\" and, as a norm, requires authorities to implement emergency measures under the government's graded pollution response plan.",
      "Air quality in India's capital deteriorates sharply every year around this time due to a number of factors, including farm waste being burned off and seasonal climatic conditions \u2013 but activists say authorities have not done enough to contain the air pollution.",
      "In a first, hundreds of people protested against the bad air quality at Delhi's India Gate over the weekend.",
      "Several protesters wore gas masks as a symbolic act of protest and held up banners, including one that read: \"I miss breathing.\"",
      "Earlier this month, one of the city's top pulmonologists, Dr. Gopi Chand Khilnani, urged people with health problems who can afford to temporarily leave Delhi to do so.",
      "\"Everybody cannot afford to leave Delhi, because it is not simple, Khilnani told The Indian Express. \"But those who have chronic lung disease or chronic heart disease, those who are on oxygen, and those who have the opportunity and ability to go abroad or to less polluted places, I very safely advise them to leave Delhi for 6-8 weeks from now, so as to protect themselves from the distress of breathlessness, the requirement of oxygen, and so on and so forth.\"",
      "The toxic air is affecting the health of people of the city regardless of underlying health problems, with many Delhi residents complaining of breathing problems and eye irritation this week.",
      "\"Every breath in Delhi NCR [National Capital Region] today comes with a major health cost \u2014 we're seeing more patients struggling with breathlessness, asthma, and heart problems, especially among children, the elderly, and those with chronic diseases,\" Dr. Harshal Ramesh Salve, at the Centre for Community Medicine at the prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told a group of journalists on Monday.",
      "A recent report by the Lancet medical journal - Countdown on Health and Climate Change 2025 \u2013 carried a grim warning for India: The country recorded around 1.72 million deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2022, a staggering 38 percent rise since 2010.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-hormone-therapy-marty-makary-interview/",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 08:48:09 -0500",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary explains what went into the decision to drop the most serious warnings on hormone therapy for menopause.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will remove the \"black box\" warning labels on many hormone therapy drugs used for menopause and perimenopause symptoms \u2014 a major turnaround that's likely to encourage more women to seek treatment. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in an exclusive CBS News interview that the change ends a decades-long \"fear machine,\" and he called the demonization of menopause hormone therapy, also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), \"an American tragedy.\"",
      "\"With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there's no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,\" Makary told senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, explaining that studies show that menopause hormone therapy can reduce the risk of heart attacks, the leading cause of death in women.",
      "The products affected by this change include medicines containing both estrogen and progesterone, systemic estrogen and topical estrogen.",
      "The \"black box\" warning labels were based on what many experts now consider flawed research on HRT from more than 20 years ago. Part of the criticism is that back in 2002, researchers on the Women's Health Initiative study overstated the risks of breast cancer because the data focused on older women.",
      "More recent studies have shown the benefits outweigh the risk for many women if hormone therapy is used in the early years of menopause, before the age of 60.",
      "\"We now have a more nuanced understanding, and we want to put that fear machine in its proper context and let people know that there are tremendous long-term health benefits,\" Makary said.",
      "In addition to heart health, those benefits include lowering the risk of cognitive decline or Alzheimer's and preventing osteoporosis, a major factor in hip fractures.",
      "Hormone therapy can help ease menopause symptoms, which can be debilitating, taking both a mental and physical toll. There are a wide range of symptoms, including hot flashes, insomnia, night sweats, mood swings, joint pain, weight gain and more \u2014 with some experiencing more intense effects than others.",
      "Menopause typically occurs in a woman's late 40s or early 50s, when the ovaries produce less estrogen and menstruation stops. Perimenopause refers to the transitional years leading up to it.",
      "What studies say now",
      "Over the past two decades, fears about breast cancer led doctors to steer millions of women away from hormone therapy.",
      "\"It's an American tragedy. I do think it's one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine,\" Makary said, denouncing the \"groupthink\" among doctors in the wake of the 2002 study.",
      "As a result, he told CBS News, \"50 to 70 million women over the last 23 years have been denied the incredible, life-changing, life-saving benefits of hormone replacement therapy because of the dogma.\"",
      "Those millions, he said, included his own mother.",
      "\"She had gone through perimenopause right around that time, but [was] never offered this therapy,\" even though she was a good candidate for it. \"Well, she went on to have two different falls recently where she had bone fractures. \u2026 And I can't help but think if her bones had been stronger from hormone replacement therapy, she wouldn't have gone through that.\"",
      "Menopause significantly speeds bone loss and increases the risk of osteoporosis, according to the Endocrine Society, an international medical organization. The group says 1 in 2 postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a bone fracture during their lifetime, which can lead to a cascade of other health problems.",
      "Markary added he knows breast cancer is a sensitive topic that needs to be treated very carefully, but said no clinical trial has ever shown that hormone therapy increases a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer.",
      "One of the things scientists have learned, he said, is that hormone therapy is best started soon after a woman's body stops producing estrogen.",
      "\"Hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women needs to be started within 10 years of the onset of menopause or perimenopause, and generally, the rule of thumb is not to start it after age 60,\" Makary said. After around 60, aging and lack of estrogen mean blood vessels have begun to harden and narrow, raising the risk of stroke and heart attack; taking estrogen earlier can help prevent that.",
      "Women should discuss the best options with their doctor.",
      "\"Look, I'm a regulator. I don't want to tell people what to take. And I'm not prescribing anything,\" Makary said. \"But we want people to have the right information. And part of that is addressing this fear machine that has been going on for 23 years, that has been magnified by the FDA's 'black box' warning on estrogen products for perimenopausal women.\"",
      "Non-hormonal therapy treatments",
      "While hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, it is not suitable for everyone, especially women with a history of breast cancer.",
      "Earlier this month, the FDA approved a new, non-hormonal option called Lynkuet, known generically as elinzanetant. The drug is the second medication to directly target the brain pathways involved in body temperature control. The first, called Veozah, was approved in 2023.",
      "Despite how common menopause is, research funding to study it has historically been limited.",
      "Even medical education on the topic has been limited, Markary said.",
      "\"The general philosophy was, why are we teaching about this, about menopause? Because there's nothing we can do for it,\" he said. \"Well, that dogma, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of omission of menopause in medical education.\"",
      "But, with more women in the field, that's starting to change.",
      "\"It's been a male-dominated culture in the medical establishment, historically. Now, roughly half of our medical students at Johns Hopkins were women, and that's a trend nationwide,\" Markary said. \"And they're starting to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, this is something where women are coming to their doctors and they're not getting the right answer.'\"",

      "Excerpt from an advocacy speech given in 2015 by Carrie Salter-Richardson",
      "My father was diagnosed at the age of 36 with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. He had already lost his mother and two of his brothers. He and his younger brother were diagnosed about the same time, and for seven years, I watched my dad and my uncle slowly wither away. On August 22, 1996, my father turned 43. A friend drove me to the nursing home to take him balloons and wish him happy birthday. I struggled with my faith as a young teenager but on that day, I prayed to God for my father's death. I knew when I left there, it would be the last time I would see him alive, if that's what you want to call it. My dad died the next day.",
      "We didn't really speak about Alzheimer's again until 2009 when I got a call from a long-lost relative letting me know that my oldest cousin had been diagnosed and was already in a nursing home. He died two months later at the age of 37. After his death, we began to do some research and discovered DIAN or the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network. They helped us determine that our family carries the PSEN1 gene, and we enrolled in an observational study at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "As part of the study, we were offered genetic testing to determine if we carried the same gene mutation. My brother Bryan was the first to have the genetic test done. Bryan and I are 18 months apart. We've always been best friends. He was always the best at everything. He excelled at sports and performing arts. He was popular and outgoing and the funniest person I know. When I got the phone call that he had tested positive for the gene, a piece of me died.",
      "On December 4, 2012, I drove to UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) to hear my results. I remember sitting in a little room for what seemed like hours waiting for the doctor and genetic counselor. When the door finally opened, I knew my answer. It was written all over their faces. But to hear the words, \"It's not good news,\" took the wind out of me. I showed little emotion while the doctor was talking. I just nodded my head and thought about sitting in that nursing home with my dad. I thought about how I would tell my children. Would they too pray for my death? I knew there were many people waiting for my phone call and hoping for good news. I dreaded making those phone calls.",
      "For a few weeks, I let it consume me, felt sorry for myself, and spent a lot of time crying. But I knew there were three people who depended on me, so I decided to make a lifetime of heartache into a quest for hope. I joined a clinical trial through DIAN. I became a volunteer for the Walk to End Alzheimer's, which led me to become a congressional ambassador for the Alzheimer's Association. I've traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with representatives and senators, advocating for more federal funding for Alzheimer's. I've been to the Montgomery statehouse. I'm now the chair of the walk. I don't ever want my children to see me give up. I don't want them to feel hopeless.",
      "It is my hope that my story and the stories of others just like me will start a conversation and end the stigma that comes along with this disease. Just maybe I can bring a new face to Alzheimer's so people know that it can happen to anybody, not just the elderly. I don't know where my story will end. But I do know that I will never give up hope for a world without Alzheimer's.",
      "* * * * *",
      "In the spring of 2021, I spoke with Carrie and planned a trip to Montgomery, Alabama, to photograph her and her brother Bryan.",
      "Carrie told me, \"I was 15 when my dad died, but when he was diagnosed, I was only seven. I didn't understand. Nobody ever really tried to educate us about it. My dad was the last one to die of the kids that got it. After that, we didn't even think about it anymore. We just kind of went on with our lives as far as Alzheimer's was concerned.",
      "\"Growing up with my dad's illness \u2014 him and my youngest uncle are like Bryan and I, the same distance apart in age \u2014 they went through it together. Because we didn't understand the symptoms of the disease, we were really embarrassed by our dad. We didn't want our friends to be around him. We laughed at everything he did and said. It was silly. It's hard to look back and think the last years I had with my dad were me just being embarrassed by him. He played baseball in college. He played minor league baseball for the Phillies. He did a lot of great stuff, but all that we remember now is how his life ended in a nursing home. He weighed 70 pounds on a feeding tube in a nursing home.\"",
      "I asked Carrie how that experience informed her decision to become a vocal advocate and she replied, \"I didn't know how the reactions would be, putting it all out there. Trying to break that stigma. It really helped me heal from the devastation of the news. I think that it showed my kids that I'm not going to just lie down and cry and do nothing. I'm going to try to educate people. Of course, I'm not an expert on the disease at all, but I think the best thing I ever did was to sit down and talk with my kids, because it inspired my daughter Hannah to want to do something about it.",
      "\"My oldest daughter is a student at WashU. She's a sophomore. She is working as an undergrad in an Alzheimer's research lab right now. It's really awesome. She's actually my best friend. She's at school now, so it's hard.\"",
      "I asked, \"Does she give back to you with messages of encouragement or hope? What does she say back to you now that she's an adult?\"",
      "\"She just tells me that she's proud of me, and she'll tell me if I'm slipping up on stuff. She's kind of like a mama bear, but she's a nine-hour drive away. We FaceTime a lot. She calls me every day just to make sure I'm good.\"",
      "I asked Carrie, \"Do you talk to your brother (Bryan) about how you're feeling and how he's feeling?\"",
      "\"We just make jokes about it to each other, because I feel like we're the only ones that can joke about it. He's very witty. He comes up with some really funny stuff. We don't sit there and have deep discussions about it, because he doesn't think that he is symptomatic, and everybody else knows that he is, and I'm not going to tell him otherwise. We just kind of interact the same way we always have, which is by goofing off, joking around.\"",
      "\"Does Bryan have kids too?\"",
      "\"No. He's gay. He never had kids. I'm the only one that had children, which makes me feel very guilty. I do carry a lot of guilt for that, because now they all have a 50 percent chance of developing it as well.",
      "\"My mom would have you think I'm about halfway in my grave. She's a hard one to deal with. I give her a hard time, but Bryan does need the help, and she does help me with a lot of stuff too. If I get stressed, she'll do my healthcare and all the things that really frustrate me. For some reason, I get stressed out so easily. She'll do it. She'll fill it out for me. She's helpful, but then she's also overbearing. Maybe that's how all moms are. I don't know.",
      "\"I know the differences that are happening with me, and my kids definitely know. They mention it. I do get flustered a lot easier than I used to. I used to be able to manage a lot more things on my plate than I can manage now. Just little things. I try to write everything down in a planner, but then I forget to look at my planner. I do have bouts of crying spells, which is weird for me, because I've not done that before. I won't even know why I'm crying. I'm just crying.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "A few weeks later, I was able to photograph Bryan and Carrie together in the backyard of their mother Mary's house in Montgomery. A few years ago, Bryan was struggling to live on his own and had to move back home from Atlanta. Mary is now Bryan's primary care partner. She helps Bryan with life's daily tasks and helped secure him a job at a local nursery where he can still enjoy work but in a safe and caring environment. Carrie had told me ahead of time that, despite only being eighteen months older than her, Bryan's Alzheimer's is much more advanced, and he has trouble communicating.",
      "I asked Bryan and Carrie what they would tell someone who was newly diagnosed.",
      "Bryan looked at Carrie and blurted, \"You go first!\" Carrie laughed and responded, \"When you're first diagnosed, at that moment you think it's the end of the world and your whole life is crashing down. But it's the complete opposite. It's given me so much more courage and brought me to meet so many wonderful people.\"",
      "Bryan paused with a sigh and said, \"I'm bad at speaking. Sometimes I struggle at work. But I get through it. Pennies and nickels and stuff ... the register ... it drives me nuts! You know what I mean? If someone is trying to use a check I have to ask for help. I struggle every day at work. But I still like it. I'm not very good at the computer. I can't type really fast. Sometimes I lose my train of thought. I used to be the wittiest person in the room, but I feel like it's kind of dimming for me. But I can still pull some jokes out.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "Hannah Richardson was a sophomore in college when we met on the Washington University campus in St. Louis. I had previously interviewed and photographed her uncle Bryan (forty-one) and her mother Carrie (thirty-nine).",
      "I asked Hannah about her family and her journey as a young Alzheimer's advocate and now college student. Because Hannah was so young when her mom Carrie was first diagnosed, she had to face the stigma and stereotypes of people living with Alzheimer's very early.",
      "She told me, \"I've had multiple people in my life tell me that my mom is lying. I've had people, friends and classmates tell me that since my mom is so young, there's no way she could have Alzheimer's. To my face people have told me that, and it's so hard to deal with that. When that first happened, I was fourteen and my mom was already doing some advocacy work.",
      "\"I was just shocked that someone would even think that or say that to me. That pushed",
      "me to follow my mom and try to be more active in the advocacy realm and to educate people my age, I started volunteering with my mom, and I eventually started my own chapter of the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's at my high school. It was really empowering and it kind of pushed me to want to do more advocacy- and education-type work.",
      "\"It was such a surprise to see how little people actually knew about it, even into college.\" I asked Hannah to tell me about her mother and how she copes, and she told me, \"There have been moments where I feel so devastated and defeated by it that it literally breaks me down.",
      "\"My therapist said, 'It's like grief, like you've lost someone, but you haven't lost them yet, but you know it's coming.' To me, I feel that's even harder, because you're waiting, and also my mom has been asymptomatic.",
      "\"I don't think she's asymptomatic now. She still does. But in the last few years, I've started to see those little signs, and those little, subtle changes slowly happen. It was reality hitting me in the face.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are the little signs that you've been noticing, because your mother and your uncle Bryan present very differently?\"",
      "Hannah said, \"They definitely do. My mom was asymptomatic until probably about two years ago. She still tells people she's asymptomatic, because no doctor's told her she's neurologically symptomatic. She's not forgetting things. She's not having the same things my uncle is experiencing, but I still think she is, because behaviorally she's not the same person she was. When I was growing up, my mom loved to be very social. She was always around her friends. She played tennis. She had all these different friend groups that she spent time with. She cared a lot about her friends, and now she has no friends. She does not see anybody.",
      "\"Going to the store stresses her out. Me FaceTiming her on the phone gives her so much stress, and she gets overwhelmed by it. Any type of social interaction, if it's more than just someone talking to her in the kitchen, it's overwhelming to her, and she gets agitated and frustrated and just lashes out.",
      "\"Three or four years ago, that was not the case. If you try to bring that up to her, she's in full denial of it. It's really hard, because she's definitely interacting with other people very differently than she used to.",
      "\"When I go home and when I talk to her on the phone and I see these things, it's definitely really hard, because it's like my mom isn't who my mom used to be, and she doesn't even realize it or acknowledge it. I think that makes it even harder, because if you try to bring it up to her, she denies it and thinks that I'm just pulling it out of thin air, but I'm not, and other people see it too. It makes it a lot harder to acknowledge and deal with it. I think her way of coping is not acknowledging it and not grieving it or being upset about it and just not even trying to think about it happening.",
      "\"That's been hard, because I think that was part of why I didn't face reality for so long, because she just tried to help others and didn't act like it affected her. But it does. And it affects her and my siblings. I think it made it a harder journey in that sense, and I wish that she would acknowledge it more. I don't know how to change that, but it definitely makes it harder. I get sad about it and I get anxious about it. I worry for my future because I know that I have a 50 percent chance of having Alzheimer's. I don't want to lose her and lose my siblings. I don't want to die!",
      "\"I get anxious and sad, and I've never heard her talk about that. I've had to kind of cope with those emotions and go through that in my own way, because she wasn't there. I didn't see how she did it, and I didn't see how she was doing as something to relate to.\"",
      "I asked Hannah, \"How did your family's history with Alzheimer's influence your decision to study medicine?\"",
      "\"I saw how in the beginning my mom didn't just shut down when she got her diagnosis but",
      "tried to be active in the community and try to educate others. That was really inspiring to me, because she didn't just sit down and take it. I want to do that as well, because my mom's always been someone I've looked up to my entire life, and I just admire her strength.",
      "\"When I was in high school, I started going with my mom to her yearly visits at WashU and",
      "seeing what the doctors do. I told them I was really interested in science, and they'd let me go in during some of her scans. They'd tell me about the brain and stuff. It was really cool, and I really enjoyed it. These people are doing work that actually impacts people's lives, and that's something that I really want to do. I got really inspired and thought 'I want to go to WashU. I want to go into research. I want to do what these doctors are doing and help people.' I just focused on that a lot. It's also a way to cope with what my family is going through. I can do this, and it will help, and that will be something I can be doing that's proactive to help my family and other families and everyone in the Alzheimer's and dementia community.",
      "\"I think my wish is like everybody else's \u2014 I want there to be a cure or treatment, because it terrifies me to think that I could have this. It's the scariest thing I can think of, and I don't want it. All I can hope is that there's something that someone somewhere can figure out to stop this and stop people from dying from it. Stop people from having to go through it, and watching their loved ones go through it. Because I sure as hell don't want to watch my mom go through it, or my uncle, and I don't want to watch me go through it or my siblings. Knowing there's nothing right now, you just feel so hopeless and helpless. I think that's part of the reason why I want to go into research, because I don't want to feel helpless and hopeless. That is what scares me most in the entire world.\"",

      "The veterans who fought and defeated fascism during World War II, and those who supported the war effort on the home front, have been called \"The Greatest Generation.\" But David Nasaw, professor of history at the City University of New York, says that description may be misleading. His new book, titled \"The Wounded Generation\" (Penguin Press), examines the invisible psychic wounds experienced by service members that went undiagnosed or ill-treated, as they returned to a nation that had also changed following years of war.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Lesley Stahl's interview with David Nasaw on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 9!",
      "\"The Wounded Generation\" by David Nasaw",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "In its duration, geographical reach, and ferocity, World War II was unprecedented, and the effects on those who fought it and their loved ones at home, immeasurable. The veterans who returned home were not the ones who had left for war. \"They are very different now,\" wrote the GI cartoonist Bill Mauldin in Up Front, published in June 1945. \"Don't let anybody tell you they aren't. ... Some say the American soldier is the same clean-cut young man who left his home. \u2026 They are wrong.\"",
      "Most returning veterans found it difficult, if not impossible, to get a full night's sleep. Many were troubled by recurring nightmares and flashbacks. They were irritable, angry, plagued by uncontrollable rages, feelings of social isolation, and fears of places and events that evoked memories of the war, their proximity to death, and the dead left behind. Large numbers sought relief by drinking to excess, as they had during the war and while awaiting repatriation. Those who sought professional help were told that they suffered from nothing more than battle fatigue that time would cure. It did not. The true cause of their distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), would go undiagnosed and untreated for decades to come.",
      "Nearly 16.4 million Americans, 12 percent of the total population, 32 percent of males between eighteen and forty-five, served in the armed forces of the United States in World War II. They left behind four million spouses, two million children, and tens of millions of parents, siblings, lovers, friends, and neighbors. The book that follows is an account of the aftereffects that lived on in the bodies, hearts, and minds of those who fought, those who awaited their return, and the nation that had won the war but had now to readjust to peace.",
      "The war itself lasted nearly four years. The men and women who fought it on two oceans, in the air, and on the landmasses of Africa, Alaska, Asia, Europe, and the islands of the Pacific served an average of thirty-three months, three-quarters of them overseas for sixteen months on average, three times as long as their counterparts in World War I. Never before or since have so many been called away to war \u2014 and for so long.",
      "The brutality and carnage of a global war were brought home in graphic reports and visual images in the daily press, the weeklies, Hollywood films, and newsreels. The human costs were made manifest with the arrival stateside of troopships bearing cargoes of servicemen of no further use to the military. In 1943 alone, more than one million were sent home, half of them with disability discharges. The overall numbers were alarming, but more so the percentage of those disabled and discharged \u2014 40 percent for the army \u2014 with \"neuropsychiatric defects.\"",
      "Why had so many hale and hearty young men broken down? In 1948, three years after the cessation of hostilities, Dr. William Menninger, chief consultant in neuropsychiatry to the army surgeon general, explained that the higher incidence of psychological breakdowns in World War II as compared with World War I was due in large part to the fact that the second world war was \"a 'tougher' one as nearly three times as long; it was fought on a rapidly moving and shifting basis instead of on fixed lines; it required many amphibious landings; it was fought in every extreme of climate; the lethal devices were far more devastating and nerve-racking than ever before; and more men were kept away from home for longer periods.\"",
      "There was a great deal of truth in Menninger's analysis, but his explanation brought neither solace nor relief to those who returned home with PTSD symptoms that could not be treated because they were not understood \u2014 by the veterans, their families, and the doctors and psychiatrists from whom they sought help.",
      "The nation to which the veterans returned was not the one they had left behind. There were shortages of every conceivable consumer item: white shirts and men's suits; meat and maple syrup; beef, bread, and barley; cars, used and new; and, most critically, affordable housing. What was most troubling was the lingering, inescapable fear that a return to economic depression was just around the corner, that the layoff of millions of war workers and the discharge of millions more servicemen would lead to massive unemployment.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Nov 2025 09:22:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Washington University Medicine in St. Louis is conducting important research into treating early-onset Alzheimer's before symptoms arise.",
    "story": [
      "\"I just know that my brain's not right,\" said Carrie Richardson, 44. \"And so, I hate it. I just want it to be normal.\"",
      "At 41, Carrie developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The condition is caused by rare genetic mutations that essentially guarantee a person will develop the disease. Her mother, Mary Salter, of Montgomery, Alabama, knows the toll of the disease all too well. \"I've lost seven family members from the ages of 37 to 44,\" she said \u2026 including her son, Bryan, who died last year.",
      "Mary, Carrie, and Carrie's daughter Hannah have been coming to the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis to participate in some of the world's first clinical trials in Alzheimer's prevention. \"It's the least I can do to help,\" said Hannah. \"I feel like I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do it.\"",
      "Dr. Randy Bateman, who leads international clinical trials at WashU Medicine, said, \"Now we have a chance to change the course of the disease in a way we've never been able to do before.\"",
      "One reason for Bateman's optimism: For the first time, there's finally success treating mild Alzheimer's with medication that removes amyloid plaques \u2013 the protein deposits that build up on the outside of nerve cells in the brain, interfering with memory and thinking. These drugs have been shown to slow cognitive decline.",
      "\"People who had the plaques removed are 30 percent better than the people who didn't have the plaques removed,\" Bateman said. \"It doesn't stop the dementia. Dementia still continues, but at a slower rate.\"",
      "The point of the trials, Bateman said, is to study what happens when treatment is started even before Alzheimer's symptoms are evident: \"If you look at the people who are treated in these trials, the people who are at the earlier stages, the earlier stage you go, the better off they do. Some of them actually have been stable. And so, what this suggests is that timing is critically important.\"",
      "Within a particular family with early-onset Alzheimer's, symptoms usually start at about the same age, so researchers can figure out when to start treatment to try to prevent the disease. \"In these people, we have near-100-percent certainty they will get Alzheimer's disease dementia,\" Bateman said. \"And we know about when they're going to get it.\"",
      "Though these rare mutations account for less than one percent of Alzheimer's patients, the lessons learned about when to start treatment may apply to everyone.",
      "\"A death sentence\"",
      "Jake Heinrichs is a Broadway theater electrician from Brooklyn who carries one of the early-onset genes. The disease claimed his grandmother, uncle, father and brother, all within the same age range. \"Symptoms in the 40s and, and dying in 50s,\" he said.",
      "For Heinrichs growing up, the word Alzheimer's was \"a death sentence.\"",
      "He started getting treatment in Bateman's study in 2013. Though he's definitely getting an antibody called lecanemab now, for the first seven years, he did not know if he was receiving an antibody or placebo. \"I was at an age where I should have been showing signs,\" Heinrichs said, \"and I am now at an age that I should probably not even be alive.\"",
      "His wife is Broadway director Rachel Chavkin. She says over the past three years, he will occasionally repeat a question, but otherwise has shown no cognitive decline since she fell in love with him twenty years ago. \"Jake is now 51, which is the age that his father was when he died,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration's budget cuts have stopped or delayed millions of dollars in Alzheimer's research. The situation has already had an impact on Bateman's trials. \"It's a precarious time,\" he said. \"Research is not like building a building or painting a wall where you can start and then stop for a few years and then go back and resume what you were doing. It's much more like feeding a baby \u2026 if you stop doing that for a few weeks, it's irrecoverable.\"",
      "\"Let's double-down on this disease\"",
      "With federal research money threatened, philanthropist Bill Gates says the effect of decreasing investment delays any breakthrough. \"The data these young researchers have to consider different ideas is so much better than even five years ago,\" he said. \"So, this is the time where you think, wow, let's double-down on this disease.\"",
      "That's exactly what Gates is doing. The billionaire Microsoft co-founder is using his wealth and influence to bring together industry and government to tackle Alzheimer's. He's already personally invested more than $300 million. \"I'm going to stay very involved in this,\" he said.",
      "At a time of such possibility, uncertainty about funding is threatening momentum. \"It's quite up in the air,\" Gates said. \"If you talk to researchers, they're dealing with the uncertainty of, should they hire young people, or buy new equipment? And so, hopefully in the next several months, this gets resolved and, you know, that we can go full speed ahead.\"",
      "Gates has spent a considerable amount of his fortune to improve public health. And for him, it so happens Alzheimer's is personal. Bill Gates Sr., an attorney and philanthropist who died five years ago at the age of 94, also had Alzheimer's. \"He was lucky enough to have 24-hour care,\" said Gates. \"But there was no medicine, no, nothing that could bring his cognition back.\"",
      "Gates is supporting research to improve early diagnosis, treatment, and patient enrollment in trials. And \u2013 surprise \u2013 he sees a huge role for artificial intelligence. \"AI is going to impact everything we do,\" he said. \"The biology of the brain is so complex that AI's ability to take large amounts of data and find meaning in that data means that this research is going to go a lot faster.\"",
      "The early-onset clinical trials are expected to continue for at least another five years involving hundreds of people at 40 sites around the world. If successful, it could usher in routine screening for Alzheimer's with a simple blood test, just as we do now for high cholesterol and diabetes.",
      "Could people be tested now? Bateman said, \"Right now in medicine, we don't test people without symptoms, because the treatments aren't yet proven to work in people without symptoms.\"",
      "Finding effective treatments is a hot area of research, and may include giving cocktails of medications that target not only amyloid but other possible culprits, such as brain inflammation and a damaging nerve cell protein called tau.",
      "Bateman said, \"If this trial holds up and we can continue to demonstrate benefit year-after-year that these people are protected, then I actually think that will predict what's gonna happen in the near future in ongoing prevention trials: That they will be positive, they will work, they will give people years of dementia-free life.\"",
      "So, Jake Heinrichs undergoes regular MRIs, physicals, memory testing, spinal taps, and PET scans to monitor his brain function, and see if he can prevent an almost-certain genetic destiny.",
      "Four-year-old Sam Heinrichs is living proof of what can come from a belief in science \u2013 and a leap of faith.",
      "I asked Jake, \"What made you finally say, you know what, even though there's a 50-percent chance he might get the gene, we're going to go ahead and try to have a baby?\"",
      "\"Because I've been part of this study, and it seems to be effective,\" Jake replied. \"It gave me hope that the scourge of Alzheimer's is something that we're not going to fear in the future. Anything could happen. But right now, I have hope.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-2000-tariff-rebate-check-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:05:28 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Sunday floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote Sunday in a\u00a0Truth Social post. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that the rebates would likely be given to families making \"less than, say, $100,000.\"",
      "That threshold is still in discussion, though, Bessent added.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how the administration would disburse the checks.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "Bessent on Sunday told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending ew tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

    "summary": "The president is hosting some of the nation's top financiers for a White House dinner Wednesday as part of his effort to bring manufacturing back home.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is hosting a private White House dinner Wednesday with some of Wall Street's biggest names, as part of his effort to forge stronger ties with America's business leaders and convince them to invest in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, whose relationship with the president has had its ups and downs, will be attending, as well as Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick, BlackRock's Larry Fink and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, sources familiar with the event planning said.",
      "Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the NYSE, helped organize the dinner, according to the sources. Lynn Martin, the president of the NYSE, will also be attending.",
      "Others who plan to attend the 7:30 p.m. dinner include Citadel founder Ken Griffin, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts co-founder Henry Kravis, Apollo Global Management's Marc Rowan and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, sources said. NYSE President Lynn Martin will also be in attendance.",
      "Many of those attending have been longtime donors to Mr. Trump, and some, like Son, have announced their companies would make significant investments in the U.S.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are on the guest list, too.",
      "Bankers have been pitching the administration on handling the IPO for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which will be a major event on Wall Street. Mr. Trump announced in May that he wanted to take the two mortgage giants public, noting at the time that the two had returned to profitability after the government took them over during the 2008 financial crisis. The two entities buy mortgages from lenders and hold them in their portfolios or package them into mortgage-backed securities to be sold.",
      "Fannie and Freddie are not the focus of the dinner, sources said. Instead, Mr. Trump and top administration officials want to discuss affordability, an issue that Americans said was their top concern in the elections last week, where Democrats swept the major races. By Wednesday afternoon, however, the focus of the meeting was still unclear to some attendees, a banking industry source said Wednesday.",
      "In September, the president hosted more than a dozen tech industry tycoons at the White House, including the CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta. And he's held one-on-one events in the Oval Office with a succession of tech and pharmaceutical executives, often to announce multibillion-dollar manufacturing deals.",
      "Last month, JPMorgan Chase \u2014 the nation's largest bank in terms of deposits \u2014 announced it intends to invest $1.5 trillion over the next decade to support \"industries critical to national economic security and resiliency,\" including critical minerals, defense technology and artificial intelligence. That represents a 50% increase from the $1 trillion in investments it had planned, the company said.",
      "Mr. Trump often uses Wall Street as one barometer for his handling of the economy. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired earlier this month, he touted a recent S&P 500 record.",
      "\"We're doing really well, and everybody knows it,\" he said.",
      "But some in the business community have chafed at the president's policies. Stocks plunged in April when Mr. Trump unveiled hefty tariffs on dozens of countries. Though markets have recovered since then, many economists worry the tariffs could lead to higher prices and slower economic growth.",
      "His pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates could also clash with Wall Street's strong preference for an independent Fed, and Mr. Trump has faced pushback from the pro-business Chamber of Commerce over a plan to charge hefty fees for high-skilled worker visas.",
      "Mr. Trump's relationship with Dimon, who has helmed JPMorgan Chase since before the 2008 financial crisis, has gone through a couple of rough patches. In 2023, Mr. Trump called Dimon a \"Highly overrated Globalist,\" after he talked up Mr. Trump's GOP primary rival, Nikki Haley. But the following year, Mr. Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek he had \"a lot of respect for Jamie Dimon.\"",
      "Dimon cautioned in April that Mr. Trump's tariffs could slow economic growth, but told CNBC three months later that the tariffs had been \"greatly moderated.\" He also supported the tax provisions in the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Earlier this year, Dimon told \"60 Minutes\" he understood why Mr. Trump won in 2024, and believed people had \"legitimate concerns\" about issues like immigration. He said that \"people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year directing federal regulators to combat alleged \"debanking\" of conservatives by financial institutions, that is, the refusal of banking services on the basis of \"political affiliations, religious beliefs or lawful business activities,\" according to the order.",
      "JPMorgan Chase reported this month that it was \"responding to requests from government authorities\" regarding its internal policies.",

      "Americans may soon be paying more for their favorite Italian pasta brands \u2014 or even have trouble finding imported spaghetti \u2014 as the Trump administration eyes a new import duty on 13 of Italy's largest pasta exporters.",
      "The proposal, published by the Commerce Department in September, would add a new 92% antidumping duty after a U.S. government probe\u00a0found\u00a0that some Italian pasta brands, including La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, were selling their products below U.S. market prices. Combined with the existing 15% tariff on European Union imports, the total duties on Italian-made pasta could rise to 107%.",
      "That would represent one of the Trump administration's highest import duty rates on any product, according to the Wall Street Journal, which earlier\u00a0reported\u00a0on the pasta dispute.",
      "If the anti-dumping duty goes into effect, the impact on American consumers would be substantial, according to Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru. Some Italian pasta makers may simply stop exporting their products to the U.S., while others might raise their prices, he added.",
      "\"You don't have enough domestic manufacturing to fill up those shelves,\" Lempert said. \"So you're going to walk into the pasta aisle and you're going to see it half empty.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS News, \"Italian pasta is not 'disappearing.'\"",
      "He added that the antidumping duty is a proposal and that it is not yet final. \"The pasta makers still have several months to continue participating in this review before this preliminary finding becomes finalized,\" he said.",
      "Yet some Italian pasta companies are preparing to pull out of U.S. stores as soon as January because of the threat of the new antidumping duty, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Which pasta brands could be affected?",
      "The antidumping duties \u2014 a type of federal tariff applied to imported products sold in the U.S. for less than their market value \u2014 would impact 13 Italian pasta makers, including La Molisana and Garofalo, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce publication.

    "summary": "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm.",
    "story": [
      "Would a 50-year mortgage make homeownership more affordable?",
      "The Trump administration is working on a plan for a mortgage term that spans five decades, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte confirmed this weekend, calling it \"a complete game changer\" and a \"potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now.\"",
      "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm. Experts say homebuyers who opt for the longer loan would see lower monthly payments but a dramatic increase in the total cost of the loan.",
      "\"Borrowers might be able to pay less monthly principal and interest, since the loan would be spread out over half a century,\" said NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. \"But the total interest paid over the life of the loan would be staggering, since even with a low rate, you're looking at 50 years' worth of interest.\"",
      "Take a homeowner who wants to buy a $400,000 home with a 10% down payment, requiring a $360,000 loan. Even if both 30- and 50-year loans carried the same 6.25% rate \u2014 which experts say is unlikely \u2014 borrowers choosing the longer term would save only about $250 a month, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS News.",
      "In reality, rates on 50-year mortgages would probably run higher than 30-year loans, meaning those monthly savings could shrink even further, he added.",
      "Yet total interest on that same 50-year loan would accrue to about $816,000, almost double the $438,000 in interest paid over a 30-year term, he calculated.",
      "At the same time, buyers with a 50-year mortgage would build equity far more slowly than those with shorter loans, Wood noted. That's because a larger share of early payments goes toward interest, leaving less to chip away at the principal.",
      "\"Paying down the loan over so much time could also mean building equity at an incredibly slow pace,\" she said.",
      "Addressing the affordability crisis",
      "The 50-year mortgage proposal aims to spur housing demand at a time when many Americans are priced out of the market by high mortgage rates and soaring home values, Berner noted.",
      "The typical homeowner now spends 39% of their income on housing, well above the 30% affordability threshold recommended by financial experts, according to Redfin.",
      "Mortgage rates have eased this year but remain above 6%, more than double the pandemic-era lows. Meanwhile, home prices, though slightly down from their peak, averaged $410,800 in the second quarter, about 25% higher than in early 2020, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "While 15-year mortgages are also available, most homebuyers opt for 30-year loans because the terms allow them to spread out payments over a longer timeframe, lowering monthly costs,\u00a0according to the personal finance website  Bankrate.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency said it is \"evaluating all options to address housing affordability,\" including making mortgages assumable or portable. A White House official added that \"President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans.\"",
      "What about the interest rate on a 50-year loan?",
      "A half-century mortgage would give Americans an even longer window to pay back their loan, but experts say the monthly savings would be relatively modest because interest rates for 50-year loans would likely be higher than for 30-year terms.",
      "That's because lenders view longer time frames as carrying higher risks of default, notes NerdWallet's Wood. Likewise, rates for 15-year mortgages are generally lower than for 30-year loans because lenders view the shorter timeframe as less risky.",
      "The typical 15-year loan today has an interest rate of about 5.6%, according to Bankrate, versus about 6.25% for the 30-year loan.",
      "Extending loan terms could lift buyer demand, but that might push home prices even higher unless more housing is built, Berner added \u2014 erasing any benefit from lower monthly payments.",
      "\"This is not the best way to solve housing affordability,\" Berner said.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the 50-year mortgage in a Fox News\u00a0interview\u00a0on Monday after host Laura Ingraham questioned the president over criticisms of the plan. Ingraham noted that some in his MAGA base argue the proposal would benefit banks while making it take longer for Americans to fully own their homes.",
      "\"It's not even a big deal,\" Mr. Trump said in response. \"You go from 40 to 50 years, and what it means is you pay something less.\"",

      "Because he had mistaken it for spam, he ignored it. But on Monday, after exploring Boston and returning to the family's accommodation at the end of the day, Strack found his room's door wide open and his family's belongings packed up and left in a hallway.",
      "\"Even our dirty clothes and toiletries were packed up, and our laptops were in plastic bags,\" he told CBS News.",

The company describes itself as a global operator of \"premium, design-forward apartments and intimate boutique hotels serving the modern traveler\" that has faced financial challenges related to its agreement with Marriott, which the hotel chain terminated on Sunday.",
      "\"We are devastated to reach a point where a liquidation is the only viable path forward,\" Janice Sears, interim chief executive officer of Sonder said in a statement Monday. \"Unfortunately, our integration with Marriott International was substantially delayed due to unexpected challenges in aligning our technology frameworks, resulting in significant, unanticipated integration costs, as well as a sharp decline in revenue arising from Sonder's participation in Marriott's Bonvoy reservation system.\"",

But he said the Dublin, Ohio-based company is likely to close in the \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its 6,011 U.S locations, or roughly 300 store closures if it shuts 5% of its existing restaurants.",
      "Wendy's said the closures will start in the fourth quarter this year. Closing underperforming locations will improve traffic and profitability at its remaining U.S. restaurants, Cook added.",

      "The outbreak has sickened babies aged 2 weeks to 5 months since mid-August. The infants were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart powdered formula, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "California officials confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart baby formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that causes the toxin linked to the outbreak. The tests to confirm contamination involve injecting mice with the cultured bacterium and then waiting up to four days to see if they get sick.",
      "\"These mice got sick really quickly,\" Pan said in an interview.",
      "ByHeart officials called for testing of unopened cans of formula. \"Testing unopened cans will provide reliable evidence that will help bring clarity to families who are understandably concerned,\" the company said in a statement Monday.",
      "At least 84 babies in the U.S. have been treated for botulism since August, California officials said. That includes those confirmed to have been fed ByHeart formula. The FDA is investigating whether any of the others are also linked to the same baby formula.",
      "Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It is caused by a type of bacterium that produces a toxin in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis.",
      "Infants younger than 1 are particularly vulnerable to infection because their gut microbiomes are not developed enough to prevent the spores from germinating and producing the toxin. They can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey.",
      "Symptoms can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel \"floppy\" and can have problems swallowing or breathing.",
      "No known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, said Dr. Steven Abrams, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\"This would be extremely rare,\" he said.",
      "The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.",
      "BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators.",
      "All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said. The treatment is delivered in vials that cost $69,300 apiece, Pan said.",
      "There is little danger of infant formula shortages because of this outbreak. ByHeart, which was founded in 2016, accounts for an estimated 1% of national formula sales, according to the CDC. The company sells formula through its website and in retail stores nationwide.",
      "That's far different from the crises in late 2021 and 2022, when four infants were sickened by a different germ after consuming formula made by Abbott Nutrition. Two of the babies died. No direct link was found between the Abbott products and the infections caused by cronobacter sakazakii, but FDA officials closed the company's Michigan plant after contamination and other problems were detected.",
      "Abbott's recall involved top-selling brands of infant formula, triggering a massive nationwide shortage that lasted months.",
      "In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company's packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii, the germ at the heart of the Abbott crisis. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing \"areas that still require corrective actions.\"",
      "Federal health officials have vowed to overhaul the U.S. food supply and are taking a new look at infant formula.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has directed the FDA to review the nutrients and other ingredients in infant formula, which fills the bottles of millions of American babies.",
      "The effort, dubbed \"Operation Stork Speed,\" is the first deep look at the ingredients since 1998.",
      "FDA officials are reviewing comments from industry, health experts and public to decide next steps.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 08:21:49 -0500",
    "summary": "Wholesale prices for frozen turkeys are expected to be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from last year's average.",
    "story": [
      "Turkeys aren't known for flying but their prices are soaring ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A September outlook report from the United States Agriculture Department estimates that wholesale prices for frozen turkeys will be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from 2024's\u00a0average of $0.94 per pound.",
      "The wholesale price is what retailers pay to buy items in bulk. Retailers then decide how much they want to charge consumers.",
      "The reason the birds \u2014 traditionally the centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table \u2014 are getting more expensive comes down to supply. The number of available turkeys has shrunk in recent years amid slightly weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks, according to USDA\u00a0data.",
      "More than 3 million turkeys have been impacted by bird flu outbreaks this year, including over half a million this month alone, USDA data shows.",
      "That translates to fewer turkeys: USDA forecasts that farmers raised around 195 million turkeys in 2025 compared with 200 million in 2024, a 3% decrease. To be sure, the number of turkeys in supply has been sliding over the last decade. In 2016, farmers raised around 245 million turkeys, roughly 50 million more than today's supply.",
      "Deals abound",
      "Amid the rise in wholesale turkey prices, several companies are floating deals in an attempt to win over budget-conscious customers.",
      "Walmart announced Tuesday that it is offering Butterball turkeys for $0.97 per pound this year. The retailer also said its 10-person meal deal will cost under $4 per person. Grocery chain Aldi has\u00a0offered a similar deal, at $40 for 10 people.",
      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Both deals represent a decrease in the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal from 2024, which was $58 for 10 people, according to a\u00a0report from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Frozen turkeys that year accounted for a large share of Americans' holiday grocery bill, at an average retail cost of $25 for a 16-pound bird.",
      "Despite the surge in wholesale turkey prices in 2025, Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u00a0 doesn't expect consumer prices to increase much.",
      "\"We see that uptick right now in the wholesale price by about 40%, so we'll definitely see some price increases there, but I don't think they're going to go a whole lot higher above where they are at,\" he said on a Farm Bureau podcast.",
      "\"Higher wholesale prices for turkeys are likely to translate into somewhat higher prices at the grocery store, but the increase consumers see will probably be smaller than what's happening upstream,\" Ortega explained.",
      "In other welcome news for shoppers, CBS News' price tracker shows that prices for Thanksgiving dinner ingredients like butter, milk and potatoes haven't budged much compared with prices the same time last year.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday ordered MD-11 and MD-11F aircrafts to be grounded as authorities investigate the deadly UPS plane crash in Kentucky.",
      "The emergency airworthiness directive came after UPS and FedEx said they are voluntarily grounding their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo planes \"out of an abundance of caution\" following a deadly crash at the UPS global aviation hub in Louisville.",
      "The FAA's order was issued \"because the agency has determined the unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design,\" the document obtained by CBS News read.",
      "\"We are assessing any potential safety issues and will ensure appropriate corrective actions are taken,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The crash on Tuesday at UPS Worldport killed 14 people, including the three pilots on the MD-11 that was headed for Honolulu. National Transportation Safety Board official Todd Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane\u00a0was a\u00a01991 McDonnell Douglas 2 that had been \"altered\" into a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Freighter.",
      "MD-11 aircrafts make up about 9% of of the UPS airline fleet and 4% of the FedEx fleet, the companies said.",
      "\"We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,\" a UPS statement said late Friday. \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"",
      "FedEx said in an email that it will be grounding the aircrafts while it conducts \"a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer.\"",
      "The planes were built by McDonnell Douglas, but the company merged with Boeing in 1997, making Boeing the manufacturer of record for the aircraft. Boeing told CBS News in a statement that it made the recommendation to ground the aircraft \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "Boeing's Safety Review Board assessed all available information about the crash and determined that further engineering analysis was needed, a company spokesperson told CBS News via email. The manufacturer recommended pausing fleet operations while that analysis was conducted. Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane was currently being \"handled\" by Boeing.",
      "Boeing announced in 1998 that it would be phasing out its MD-11 jetliner production, with final deliveries due in 2000. There are about 70 MD-11 planes in operation today. The planes are only used to ferry cargo. FedEx and UPS each have about two dozen MD-11s, and a third airline, Western Global, has 16. Twelve of those planes were already put in storage, according to the aviation analytics firm Cirium. CBS News reached out to Western Global for comment on the grounding.",
      "Flight records suggest the UPS MD-11 that crashed underwent maintenance while it was on the ground in San Antonio, Texas, for more than a month until mid-October. It is not clear what work was done.",
      "The UPS cargo plane was nearly airborne Tuesday when a bell sounded in the cockpit, Inman said during a briefing Friday. For the next 25 seconds, the bell rang and the pilots tried to control the aircraft as it barely lifted off the runway, its left wing ablaze and missing an engine, and then plowed into the ground in a spectacular fireball. The plane was carrying about 255,000 pounds of jet fuel, as well as up to 20,000 packages.",
      "The cockpit voice recorder captured the bell, which sounded about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, Inman said. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.",
      "Inman said it would be months before a transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.",
      "\"It occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,\" Guzzetti told The Associated Press after Inman's news conference. \"They were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. \u2026 They'll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.\"",
      "Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles. Witnesses recalled chaos on the ground.",
      "\"It was explosion after explosion after explosion, so you just didn't know when it was going to stop,\" Georgie Dow, the chief financial officer of an auto parts business that was struck by the plane, told CBS News. \"It was so hot ... You took a step back because it was like heat in your face. There was no going to help.\"",
      "The UPS package handling facility in Louisville is the company's largest. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.",
      "UPS Worldport operations resumed Wednesday night with its Next Day Air, or night sort, operation, spokesperson Jim Mayer said.",

    "story": [
      "Retailers are betting they can handle the holiday shopping rush with fewer additional workers.",
      "From Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, retail stores are expected to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, down from the 442,000 seasonal hires companies brought on last year, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization.",
      "That would mark the lowest level of seasonal retail hiring in 15 years, according to the NRF.",
      "At the same time, the organization expects holiday sales to hit a record, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time as spending rises between 3.7% to 4.2%.",
      "The decline in expected seasonal hiring comes as the broader labor market is showing signs of strain, with some businesses across the nation holding off on adding new workers. At the same time, layoffs are accelerating, with job cuts this year through October rising to their highest levels since 2020.",
      "The group's hiring expectations \"reflect the softening and slowing labor market,\" NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said in a Thursday press briefing.",
      "\"But nevertheless, we are confident that retailers will be prepared to meet consumers with the prices, with the goods, and the convenient savings and value they're looking for this holiday season,\" he added.",
      "Despite\u00a0diminished consumer sentiment, holiday spending is projected to hold up as shoppers continue to prioritize the season's celebrations over other purchases, he said.",
      "\"People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it and we think that's going to happen again this year,\" Mathews noted.",
      "To be sure, consumers are expressing concern about rising prices, with inflation ticking higher in recent months due partly to wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Retailers are handing some of those tariff costs to shoppers, with a Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis analysis finding that companies\u00a0passed\u00a0about one-third of the new import duties onto consumers from May through July.",
      "\"All signals are consumers continue to be concerned about inflation and rising prices,\" NRF senior economist Jack Kleinhenz said during the press briefing. \"Despite these concerns, I believe consumers are still willing to spend, even though their sentiment is at very low levels.\"",
      "While retailers are planning fewer seasonal hires this year, some have added additional staff in the past few years, which could help compensate, NRF economists added.",
      "\"You might see less hiring, but we are seeing less firing in the retail industry,\" Matthews said. \"Those two are running neck and neck.\"",
      "For example, Target said it's asking current retail employees if they want to pick up additional shifts during the holidays before adding new seasonal hires.",

    "summary": "Estimates of the economic hit from the U.S. government shutdown put the losses at up to $16 billion every week the impasse continues.",
    "story": [
      "With bipartisan congressional talks to end the U.S. government shutdown bogging down on Friday, the hit to the national economy is growing, experts said.",
      "\"Even if there is a reopening of the government in the next couple of weeks, you're going to see a visible and permanent loss of economic activity as a result of the government shutdown,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Estimates of the economic impact range from $7 billion to $16 billion per week, with the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, a U.S. government agency, forecasting a weekly loss of $15 billion. A recent CBS News\u00a0poll\u00a0found that 54% of Americans said they are \"very concerned\" about how the shutdown is affecting the economy.",
      "Here's where the shutdown, now on Day 38, is hitting the economy hardest.",
      "Federal workers",
      "Hundreds of thousands of government employees are going without pay during the shutdown, forcing many to take out loans or seek out temporary jobs to make ends meet.",
      "The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank,\u00a0estimates that at least 670,000 federal workers are furloughed and roughly 730,000 are working without pay.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency that provides analysis to lawmakers, said in a\u00a0letter\u00a0last month that the reduction in hours worked by furloughed federal employees alone could end up costing the economy $14 billion by year-end if the shutdown stretches to Thanksgiving.",
      "Although government workers are expected to receive back pay\u00a0once the stalemate ends, some employees are likely to start to pull back on spending, which could ripple through the economy, said Mark Zandi,\u00a0chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Consumers",
      "The interruption in food-stamp benefits during the shutdown for the more than 40 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is also temporarily sapping consumer spending, Zandi said.",
      "Spending could soon rebound after a federal judge\u00a0ordered\u00a0the Trump administration to provide full federal benefits to states by Friday. Still, the suspension of food stamps comes as many low- and middle-income Americans face other financial strains, including a spike in Affordable Care Act health insurance rates.",
      "\"There's all kinds of funding that's not getting paid out, and that will impact the ability and willingness of these households to spend,\" Zandi said.",
      "Small businesses",
      "One key sector of the economy feeling the pinch is small businesses, many of which rely on government loans and business from federal agencies to stay afloat.",
      "For example, the shutdown is preventing the Small Business Administration from distributing $170 million in federally guaranteed loans per day to hundreds of smaller employers, an agency spokesperson told CBS News. As of Wednesday, that amounted to a total loss of $4.5 billion in capital for more than 8,300 small businesses, according to SBA.",
      "Federal contractors",
      "The government employs millions of contract workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. However, that activity has stopped during the shutdown, depriving many private businesses of revenue.",
      "Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at Oxford Economics, said the investment advisory firm estimates that roughly $800 million in federal awards are at risk of disruption each week the shutdown drags on. Around 5.2 million federal contractor workers stand to be impacted, according to unofficial estimates, she added.",
      "\"A prolonged shutdown could significantly impact these individuals by impacting the cash flow for the contractors, potentially leading to furloughs, pay cuts or layoffs, with the risks greater for small business contractors,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "An Oxford Economics report this week noted that recent jobless claims data point to a rise in private-sector layoffs in states most exposed to the shutdown.",
      "Travel companies",
      "The travel industry is feeling the impact after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to cut thousands of flights across the U.S. starting Friday.",
      "As of Wednesday, the industry had already lost roughly $5 billion in travel spending, according to Erik Hansen, head of government relations at the U.S. Travel Association.",
      "\"The timing couldn't be worse-just weeks before the busiest travel period of the year,\" he said.",
      "Economic growth",
      "Overall, the government shutdown is expected to take a toll on U.S. gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services.",
      "The CBO estimates that the drag on economic activity from the government closure will reduce annualized GDP growth in the final three months of the year by 1 to 2 percentage points, depending on how long the shutdown lasts.",
      "While economists expect most of the decline in growth to be recovered when the government reopens and as spending and commercial activity ramp back up, the CBO forecasts a permanent economic loss of $7 billion to $14 billion. Still, that is a tiny fraction of the $30 trillion economy.",

      "Fifteen of those airports are included on the\u00a0list obtained by CBS News of airports that will be affected by the 10% cut in air traffic. Some major airports, including those in Las Vegas and Charlotte, were not included in the data.",
      "Delays were more significant in some areas than others. Staffing shortages and weather conditions compounded delays in New York City last week. From Oct. 28 to Monday, fewer than 65% of flights arrived on time into the area's three airports. More than 81% of flights landed on time at the airports in September.",
      "Seattle and Denver's airports, on the other hand, have had more flights arrive and depart on time over the same timeframe than in September.",
      "In the first few weeks of the shutdown, the percentage of flights arriving or departing on time had not dropped significantly at most of these airports, the data shows. But many airports experienced their worst days last week. About 43% of cancellations from the shutdown's start on Oct. 1 to Monday happened in the last week of that timeframe.",
      "More air traffic controllers have not been coming to work during the shutdown, with some opting to take on second jobs to make up for lost pay. On CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said controllers are \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",
      "The FAA has issued at least 125 ground delays or stops due to staffing issues since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, compared with 26 in September, according to a CBS News analysis of Air Traffic Control System Command Center Advisories. That doesn't include staffing delays at control towers not based at airports, which also manage air traffic.",
      "Before the decision to cut air travel by 10%, Duffy had warned delays and cancellations would get worse if the shutdown continued, and cautioned the FAA would consider closing some airspace.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" he said. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",

    "summary": "Travel pros are urging people to brace for flight disruptions as the FAA throttles back air traffic starting on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines and travel experts are warning that a move by federal authorities to throttle back the number of flights at 40 major airports starting on Friday could disrupt people's travel plans across the U.S.",
      "\"Even if you're flying out of an airport that doesn't have reductions, there will be a domino effect across the entire system,\" said aviation expert Julian Kheel, CEO of travel booking site Points Path, adding that passengers should prepare for \"significant flight disruptions.\"",
      "One airline chief executive urged customers to buy a second ticket from another airline in case one flight is scrapped \u2014 a workaround that some travelers could see as beyond their means.",
      "\"If you are headed to a wedding, funeral or something you must be somewhere for in the next few days \u2014 given the risk of flights [canceling] I would suggest passengers buy a backup ticket on another carrier that departs after the first ticket,\" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in an Instagram post on Thursday.",
      "\"Carriers like Frontier will be putting you on the next available flight but that may not be until after your event due to the scale of this disruption,\" he added.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Wednesday announced that air traffic in 40 \"high-volume\" airports would be reduced by 10% in the coming days to cope with shortages of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay amid the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "The flight restrictions are expected to be phased in starting Friday, with airlines reaching the full 10% mark by next week, two sources familiar with discussions between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and the airlines told CBS News.",
      "Some airports on the FAA's list for capacity cuts are already experiencing problems. Passengers flying out of Boston's\u00a0Logan Airport\u00a0on Thursday were starting to see flight delays and cancellations due to the shutdown, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "Airlines promise extra help \u2014 and refunds",
      "As the air capacity cuts loomed, major airlines vowed on Thursday to alert customers on flight issues, help people rebook their travel, and provide refunds or credit if their trips are disrupted.",
      "\"As schedule changes are made, we'll proactively reach out to customers who are impacted,\" American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The carrier also said that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason or who choose not to travel can change their flight or request a refund without penalty. American encouraged customers to stay up-to-date on their flight's status using its mobile app.",
      "The airline said that, from Nov. 7 to Nov. 10, it will trim its flight schedules by 4% at the 40 airports affected by the FAA capacity restrictions, the equivalent of about 220 flights canceled each day. That represents a small fraction of the 6,000 daily flights on those days, American noted.",
      "Southwest Airlines said it will notify customers if their flight is canceled and automatically rebook them on new flights. Customers who do not wish to be rebooked are eligible for refunds, provided they cancel a new itinerary arranged by Southwest at least 10 minutes before the new flight's departure, the airline told CBS News.",
      "Delta Air Lines also said it would allow customers to cancel flights without penalty between Nov. 7 and Nov. 9.",
      "Check before you head to the airport",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder of travel rewards site point.me, said travelers should be extra vigilant in monitoring communications from their airline before heading to the airport. \"Pay attention to updates from airlines. If you're not getting emails, call them.\"",
      "John Rose, chief risk and security officer at Altour, a travel management company, recommended that travelers use an airline's app to track inbound flights to anticipate any delays.",
      "\"The main thing to watch is that the flight is still going, that it's on time. That's a trick that's easy to do on the airline's app. See where your plane is coming from and if it has any problems,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Rose added that it's important to look beyond the airports where cuts are implemented for travel disruptions, given that shortages of air traffic controllers in airport towers could affect airspace outside of such regions.",
      "\"Recognize that even with the 10% cutback, other flights could be impacted beyond that, because we don't know where people are going to be calling in sick and having staffing shortages,\" he said.",
      "But don't check luggage",
      "Although travelers should avoid checking luggage, if possible, to minimize another potential hitch, Rose recommends packing essentials like medication and a change of clothes.",
      "\"Plan to be stuck somewhere for an extra day,\" he said.",
      "He noted that international flights might be less prone to disruptions, given that airlines typically operate fewer flights a day to foreign destinations.",
      "\"Historically, the last flights to cancel are international because they tend to only fly there once or twice a day, and if they put you on the next flight, it's in a day or two,\" he said.",
      "When to book a backup fare",
      "Travelers who are especially eager to avoid flight problems can get a backup ticket, Funk said.",
      "\"If you have critical travel you cannot miss, then another ticket on a different carrier is always a good play,\" she said. \"Every carrier will solve for these things differently, so get a ticket on another airline even if there's a connection.\"",
      "Unused tickets can be canceled within 24 hours of purchase, she noted, so it's a relatively risk-free move.",
      "\"If I had a trip scheduled in the next week that I didn't have to take, I would consider rescheduling it,\" said Kheel of Points Path. \"If you do have to take a trip, you can book multiple flights on different airlines to try and protect yourself.\"",
      "Despite the headaches for passengers, air travel remains safe during the closure of federal agencies, now on Day 37 and the longest\u00a0government shutdown in U.S. history, Rose added.",
      "\"People's safety is not being compromised. The FAA is not going to put travelers in a higher-risk situation because of this,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The vote comes after a top shareholder, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, said it would vote against the pay package.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved a\u00a0new pay package\u00a0for CEO Elon Musk that is potentially worth up to $1 trillion over a decade, despite some prominent investors criticizing the size of the compensation plan.",
      "The plan, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history, would be delivered to Musk \u2014 the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $437 billion \u2014 if Tesla hits certain performance goals under his leadership. Meeting such targets would make him the world's first trillionaire.",
      "Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which holds a stake in Tesla, on Tuesday said it would vote against the pay package, while investment advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS also recommended shareholders vote against it.",
      "The vote comes at a delicate time for Tesla, with the electric car maker's sales tumbling earlier this year after Musk spearheaded the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. His role overseeing the layoffs of thousands of government workers antagonized some consumers, with Yale University researchers saying Muks's actions\u00a0reduced Tesla's sales by as many as 1.2 million vehicles over the past three years.",
      "Musk stepped back from DOGE in May, promising to refocus on Tesla.",
      "One prominent Wall Street analyst, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, said the generous pay package is necessary to ensure Musk remains committed to Tesla.",
      "\"Tesla's board members have asked shareholders to approve a long-term incentive package for Musk to retain and motivate the CEO to remain in his current leadership role with a new share package where he will only be paid if he attains 'extraordinary financial returns,'\" Ives said in a Nov. 5 research note.",
      "The package requires Tesla to hit certain milestones, such as reaching a market cap of $8.5 trillion, or about six times its current valuation of $1.4 trillion, shipping 20 million vehicles and delivering 1 million of Tesla's humanoid \"Optimus\" robots.",
      "Despite Musk's controversial leadership, the company's sales and stock price have soared over the years. Since it went public in June 2010, the company's stock has returned almost 35,000%, compared with a roughly 550% gain in the S&P 500 over the same time period.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 08:13:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A trend that started in the technology sector is spreading to other industries, with businesses cutting workers even as their profits expand.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year \u2014 the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy.",
      "The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a \"jobless boom.\" Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs.",
      "\"We've never seen anything like that\"",
      "\"This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook,\" Zhao told CBS News. \"It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well.\"",
      "At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted.",
      "\"You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine \u2014 profits are doing great,\" he said. \"We've never seen anything like that.\"",
      "For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as\u00a0\"no hire, no fire,\"\u00a0meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers.",
      "The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP.",
      "By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring.",
      "\"Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. \"While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP.\"",
      "Why unemployment isn't spiking",
      "The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available.",
      "Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said.",
      "\"You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too,\" he said. \"So that creates a very odd equilibrium.\"",
      "Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies.",
      "Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword.",
      "\"These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up \u2014 it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs,\" he noted.",
      "But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said.",
      "\"People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'\" he said. \"I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'.\"",

    "story": [
      "Apple called out European officials in a heated letter shared with CBS News, arguing European Union regulations that forced the tech giant to allow smaller rivals into its App Store have made its platform less safe for consumers.",
      "Because of the changes, \"risks to users on our devices will inevitably increase,\" Apple Vice President Kyle Andeer says in a letter Thursday to the European Commission, the EU's executive body.",
      "Apple accuses the EU of having an \"enforcement agenda\" that seeks to \"undermine the security and privacy of iOS and iPadOS.\"",
      "It's the latest complaint from an American company about alleged overreach from the EU's powerful digital laws.",
      "The tensions have factored into U.S. trade negotiations. In August, President Trump\u00a0threatened higher tariffs on countries with tech rules he believes are discriminatory to U.S. companies. In an April op-ed, Mr. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused the EU of engaging in \"lawfare\" to \"target America's largest tech firms.\"",
      "In recent years, the EU passed two major laws governing online platforms. The Digital Services Act requires platforms to follow certain rules on illegal or harmful content and advertising to minors, and the Digital Markets Act is designed to promote online competition. Tech companies can face hefty fines for violating either law.",
      "Apple was fined 500 million euros in April for violating the EU's Digital Markets Act by allegedly restricting app developers from steering users toward alternatives to the App Store. Apple appealed the fine.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. health regulators sent warning letters Wednesday to 18 websites selling counterfeit or unapproved versions of Botox and similar injectable drugs commonly used to smooth wrinkles.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it was taking action after receiving reports of injuries in connection with the products, including what it said were symptoms of botulism.",
      "Botox is a diluted, purified form of botulinum, one of the most toxic substances in the world. The ingredient works by temporarily blocking nerve signals and causing muscles to relax. While most famously approved for cosmetic use, Botox is also approved in the U.S. for a number of medical conditions including muscle spasms, eye disorders and migraines.",
      "The FDA warning letters mostly went to cosmetics websites. In each case, the FDA said the companies were offering unofficial or mislabeled versions of Botox-like drugs that haven't been approved by the agency. In addition to the original drug, introduced by Allergan in 1989, the FDA has approved several competing versions.",
      "FDA-approved Botox drugs carry the agency's most serious warning, a boxed label alerting doctors and patients that the medications can cause serious or life-threatening side effects.",
      "In rare cases, the toxin can spread beyond the injection site to other parts of the body, paralyzing or weakening muscles needed for breathing and swallowing. Signs of botulism include difficulty swallowing or breathing, slurred speech and muscle weakness. Those symptoms can occur several hours after an injection.",
      "In a press release Wednesday, the FDA said patients should only receive the drugs from health professionals who are licensed and trained to administer them. Patients experiencing signs of botulism should \"seek immediate medical care,\" the agency noted.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 14:32:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The three emails appear to be exchanges between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as the author Michael Wolff and Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday released emails exchanged between Jeffrey Epstein and others about President Trump.",
      "Among the documents is a 2011 message from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate, that said Mr. Trump \"spent hours at my house\" with one of Epstein's victims, whose name is redacted. In another email in 2019 to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\"",
      "Maxwell\u00a0was convicted of conspiring in Epstein's sex trafficking ring and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Wolff has written several books about Mr. Trump.",
      "House Democrats said the emails were turned over by Epstein's estate, which they said released more than 23,000 documents that lawmakers are now reviewing. The full Oversight Committee also released more than 20,000 pages of records from Epstein's estate Wednesday and claimed Democrats \"cherry-pick\" from the material \"to generate clickbait.\" The latest batch includes emails, records from court proceedings, transcripts from depositions, press clippings and other material.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, and he has not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of selectively leaking emails to \"create a fake narrative\" to harm Mr. Trump. She said the unnamed victim in the emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who met Epstein in the summer of 2000, just before she turned 17,\u00a0while working at the spa\u00a0at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida club. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April,\u00a0had not accused the president of any wrongdoing. She said in her memoir that Mr. Trump \"couldn't have been friendlier,\" when she met him in his office.",
      "\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.\"",
      "CBS has not independently verified the emails.",
      "In one of the messages from Epstein to Maxwell, dated April 2, 2011, the late financier wrote, \"i want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump. [Victim 1] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "Maxwell then replies, \"I have been thinking about that\u2026\"",
      "In a second email that appears to be from Epstein to Wolff, dated Jan. 31, 2019, Epstein references a victim, whose name is redacted, and mentions Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida resort.",
      "\"Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" the message from Epstein reads.",
      "In the third exchange released by House Democrats, which appears to be between Epstein and Wolff, Wolff writes on Dec. 15, 2015, \"I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you\u2013either on air or in scrum afterwards.\"",
      "According to the email exchange, Epstein then replies, \"if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\" Wolff responds, \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his first run for the White House in June 2015 and would have been on the campaign trail when the emails between Wolff and Epstein were exchanged.",
      "Wolff authored a book about the first few months of Mr. Trump's first term in office, titled \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" that was released in 2018.",
      "Mr. Trump and Epstein were friends for years and ran in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said they had a falling out around 2004, more than a decade before Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. Epstein had separately reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida in 2007, in which he agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month prison sentence.",
      "Epstein\u00a0died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial.",
      "The new release comes amid a push for more transparency on the Epstein files in Congress. The House is set to return Wednesday for the first time since Sept. 19. The lower chamber has been away from Washington while the Senate worked through an impasse on reopening the government. The House's absence meant the newest member, Democrat Adelita Grijalva, was not sworn in, preventing her from becoming the final signature needed on a discharge petition to circumvent House GOP leaders and force a vote on a measure to compel the Justice Department to release all of the files from its investigation into Epstein. Grijalva is expected to sign the petition after she's sworn in on Wednesday, starting the clock on the process to move forward with the bill. A vote likely wouldn't come until next month.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0claimed\u00a0on social media Wednesday that the \"Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects. Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap.\"",
      "\"There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!\" the president wrote.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, urged the Justice Department in a statement Wednesday to make the Epstein files public \"immediately,\" pledging that the panel \"will continue pushing for answers and will not stop until we get justice for the victims.\"",
      "\"The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,\" Garcia said. \"These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.\"",
      "Several tranches of records have been turned over to congressional investigators, including from Epstein's estate. The House Oversight Committee has also sought information from a slew of former attorneys general and FBI directors, as well as former President Bill Clinton.",
      "Lawmakers have also questioned Alex Acosta, who was the U.S. attorney in South Florida when prosecutors investigated Epstein in the 2000s and reached the nonprosecution agreement with him.",
      "Acosta went on to serve as Labor secretary during Mr. Trump's first term but resigned in 2019 amid questions about his handling of Epstein's case.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is hosting a private White House dinner Wednesday with some of Wall Street's biggest names, as part of his effort to forge stronger ties with America's business leaders and convince them to invest in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, whose relationship with the president has had its ups and downs, will be attending, as well as Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick, BlackRock's Larry Fink and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, sources familiar with the event planning said.",
      "Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the NYSE, helped organize the dinner, according to the sources. Lynn Martin, the president of the NYSE, will also be attending.",
      "Others who plan to attend the 7:30 p.m. dinner include Citadel founder Ken Griffin, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts co-founder Henry Kravis, Apollo Global Management's Marc Rowan and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, sources said. NYSE President Lynn Martin will also be in attendance.",
      "Many of those attending have been longtime donors to Mr. Trump, and some, like Son, have announced their companies would make significant investments in the U.S.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are on the guest list, too.",
      "Bankers have been pitching the administration on handling the IPO for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which will be a major event on Wall Street. Mr. Trump announced in May that he wanted to take the two mortgage giants public, noting at the time that the two had returned to profitability after the government took them over during the 2008 financial crisis. The two entities buy mortgages from lenders and hold them in their portfolios or package them into mortgage-backed securities to be sold.",
      "Fannie and Freddie are not the focus of the dinner, sources said. Instead, Mr. Trump and top administration officials want to discuss affordability, an issue that Americans said was their top concern in the elections last week, where Democrats swept the major races. By Wednesday afternoon, however, the focus of the meeting was still unclear to some attendees, a banking industry source said Wednesday.",
      "In September, the president hosted more than a dozen tech industry tycoons at the White House, including the CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta. And he's held one-on-one events in the Oval Office with a succession of tech and pharmaceutical executives, often to announce multibillion-dollar manufacturing deals.",
      "Last month, JPMorgan Chase \u2014 the nation's largest bank in terms of deposits \u2014 announced it intends to invest $1.5 trillion over the next decade to support \"industries critical to national economic security and resiliency,\" including critical minerals, defense technology and artificial intelligence. That represents a 50% increase from the $1 trillion in investments it had planned, the company said.",
      "Mr. Trump often uses Wall Street as one barometer for his handling of the economy. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired earlier this month, he touted a recent S&P 500 record.",
      "\"We're doing really well, and everybody knows it,\" he said.",
      "But some in the business community have chafed at the president's policies. Stocks plunged in April when Mr. Trump unveiled hefty tariffs on dozens of countries. Though markets have recovered since then, many economists worry the tariffs could lead to higher prices and slower economic growth.",
      "His pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates could also clash with Wall Street's strong preference for an independent Fed, and Mr. Trump has faced pushback from the pro-business Chamber of Commerce over a plan to charge hefty fees for high-skilled worker visas.",
      "Mr. Trump's relationship with Dimon, who has helmed JPMorgan Chase since before the 2008 financial crisis, has gone through a couple of rough patches. In 2023, Mr. Trump called Dimon a \"Highly overrated Globalist,\" after he talked up Mr. Trump's GOP primary rival, Nikki Haley. But the following year, Mr. Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek he had \"a lot of respect for Jamie Dimon.\"",
      "Dimon cautioned in April that Mr. Trump's tariffs could slow economic growth, but told CNBC three months later that the tariffs had been \"greatly moderated.\" He also supported the tax provisions in the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Earlier this year, Dimon told \"60 Minutes\" he understood why Mr. Trump won in 2024, and believed people had \"legitimate concerns\" about issues like immigration. He said that \"people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year directing federal regulators to combat alleged \"debanking\" of conservatives by financial institutions, that is, the refusal of banking services on the basis of \"political affiliations, religious beliefs or lawful business activities,\" according to the order.",

      "A report released Wednesday by human rights groups determined that the deportation and treatment of more than 200 Venezuelan migrants imprisoned in El Salvador for months at the request of the U.S. amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance under international law.",
      "The investigation, by the groups Human Rights Watch and Cristosal, found the detainees were victims of \"constant beatings\" by Salvadoran guards at the notorious CECOT maximum security prison, as well as other forms of mistreatment, including cases of sexual abuse. Investigators argued some of these alleged abuses constitute torture under international law.",
      "\"The human rights violations documented in this report violate El Salvador's obligations under international law, including the prohibitions on arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and torture and other ill-treatment,\" the report said.",
      "Citing dozens of interviews, including with 40 of the Venezuelan men held at the mega prison, Human Rights Watch and Cristosal said the detainees also faced \"inhumane\" conditions, incommunicado detention, inadequate access to food, limited medical care and the denial of basic hygiene, inconsistent with United Nations rules governing the treatment of prisoners.",

      "The human rights groups argued the U.S. government was \"complicit\" in the mistreatment they found, noting the Trump administration gave El Salvador $4.7 million in March, including to imprison deportees accused of having ties to Tren de Aragua, a gang that originated in Venezuela.",

Many were deported from the U.S. with little to no due process under the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "CBS News was first to obtain and publish the list of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT in March. Using that list, \"60 Minutes\" and CBS News found that many of the deportees did not have any apparent criminal record, in the U.S. or abroad, despite the administration's allegations.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 08:53:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Israel's president says Trump sent him a letter asking him to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who's on trial in three separate corruption cases.",
    "story": [
      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he received a letter from President Trump on Wednesday asking him to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on trial in three separate corruption cases.",
      "Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the ongoing court cases, with no ruling yet delivered, and his supporters have dismissed the trials as politically motivated.",
      "In a speech to the Israeli parliament in October, Mr. Trump urged Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, telling the gathered lawmakers: \"By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know! But I happen to like this gentleman right over here [Netanyahu], and it just seems to make so much sense.\"",
      "\"This morning, President Isaac Herzog received the attached letter from U.S. President Donald Trump, calling on him to consider granting a pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,\" Herzog's office said in a statement, adding that the president could not initiate a pardon based on the American leader's request alone.",
      "In his letter, Mr. Trump said he was writing to Herzog at a \"historic time, as we have, together, just secured peace that has been sought for at least 3,000 years.\"",
      "\"I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister,\" it added. \"While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System ... I believe that this 'case' against Bibi ... is political, unjustified prosecution.\"",
      "Netanyahu has long been known by the nickname Bibi.",
      "Mr. Trump also framed his request for Netanyahu's pardon as something his Israeli counterpart deserved for working with the White House to reach the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, saying: \"Now that we have achieved these unprecedented successes, and are keeping Hamas in check, it is time to let Bibi unite Israel by pardoning him, and ending that lawfare once and for all.\"",
      "He and his wife Sara are accused in one case of accepting more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods including cigars, jewelry and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favors. He is also accused of attempting to negotiate more favorable coverage from two Israeli media outlets in two other cases.",
      "The statement from Herzog's office said the Israeli president holds Mr. Trump \"in the highest regard and continues to express his deep appreciations for President Trump's unwavering support for Israel.\"",
      "\"Alongside and not withstanding this ... anyone seeking a Presidential pardon must submit a formal request in accordance with the established procedures,\" it added.",
      "During his current term, which started in late 2022, Netanyahu proposed far-reaching judicial reforms that critics say sought to weaken the courts. Those prompted massive protests that were only curtailed after the onset of the Gaza war in October 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused his political opponents of using the Justice Department to target him during his time out of office, and since he returned to the White House, the department, now run by his appointees, has pushed for Biden-era justice officials to be prosecuted over an FBI investigation into the fallout of the 2020 election.",
      "In September, he\u00a0pushed\u00a0Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. Comey and James have since been indicted on criminal charges.",

    "summary": "Texas woman will be sentenced Wednesday, after she pleaded guilty to leaving a threatening voicemail for the judge overseeing President Trump's 2020 election criminal case.",
    "story": [
      "Despite President Trump's waves of pardons for allies and supporters who sought to overturn his 2020 election loss and his clemency for all Capitol riot defendants, at least one federal case with tethers to the 2020 election is still lingering.",
      "A federal judge in Houston is set to sentence Abigail Shry on Wednesday afternoon, after she pleaded guilty to phoning a vulgar, violent and racist threat to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in August 2023. The threat was made hours after Chutkan was assigned to oversee Mr. Trump's criminal case for allegedly conspiring to overturn his 2020 loss, of which Jan. 6 was a component.",
      "In charging documents, the Justice Department said Shry, 45, left a voicemail for Chutkan in which she threatened to kill anyone who \"went after President Trump.\"",
      "The document alleged Shry referred to Chutkan as a \"slave,\" used a racial epithet and made threats against a Texas Democratic congresswoman, \"all Democrats\" and the LGBTQ community.",
      "Shry's voice message also said, \"If Trump doesn't get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you, so tread lightly,\" according to the Justice Department's court filings.",
      "Investigators say they linked the message to Shry after determining her cell phone number was used to make the threatening call.",
      "Shry pleaded guilty in November 2024 to a federal charge of transmitting an interstate threat. Her sentencing hearing had been postponed multiple times before Wednesday's court date. Sentencing recommendations, which are frequently posted in public view on federal criminal case dockets, are not publicly listed in Shry's case.",
      "On the day of Shry's guilty plea, the Justice Department offered further details on its investigation, saying Shry admitted that she made the call and \"noted that she had no plans to travel anywhere to carry out anything she stated.\" But she also allegedly told investigators that \"if the congresswoman ever traveled to her city, then 'we need to worry.'\"",
      "Shry's case was one of a fast-rising number of threats made against federal judges in the past few years. Reports from the U.S. Marshals Service, which protects federal judges, said more than 560 threats have been investigated so far this year.\u00a0 That's more than all of 2024 and on pace to match or surpass 2023 levels.",
      "A federal judge had briefly ordered Shry to remain in pretrial detention in the case. In a May 2024 hearing, a Justice Department prosecutor argued, \"My greatest concern in this case is that she starts watching FOX News again, gets herself spun up, she goes out, she gets a case of beer, continues to get herself spun up. There's no way to gauge what's going to happen here, except to look at what she's done in the past six months.\"",
      "A federal judge later released Shry, under the condition that Shry not possess firearms or consume alcohol.",
      "According to a sentencing report submitted by the Justice Department in Shry's case, Shry faces a maximum of five years in prison. Federal defendants are typically sentenced to less than the maximum prison term.",
      "Judge Keith Ellison of Houston will handle the sentencing in Houston.",

    "story": [
      "Jack Schlossberg, the only grandson of the late President John F. Kennedy, is launching a Democratic bid for a New York City congressional seat on Wednesday.",
      "Schlossberg, 32, is entering the Democratic primary to succeed retiring Rep. Jerrold Nadler and represent New York's 12th Congressional District. The seat represents the Upper East Side, Upper West Side and Midtown sections of Manhattan, an overwhelmingly Democratic area, and one of the nation's wealthiest and geographically smallest congressional districts.",
      "Schlossberg announced his campaign in a statement that warned \"America is in crisis\" and castigated President Trump for \"using his power to suspend civil rights, silence dissent, and send armed forces into our cities.\"",
      "\"We can do better,\" the statement read. \"The Democratic Party must win back the House of Representatives and elect a new generation of leaders.\"",
      "Schlossberg is the son of Caroline Kennedy, a former U.S. ambassador to Japan and Australia, and Edwin Schlossberg, an artist and designer who helped design the museums at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, among other projects.",
      "A graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School, he is perhaps best known in political circles for a social media presence that offers up unapologetic and at times crude criticism of Mr. Trump.",
      "Despite his name recognition, political pedigree and resemblance to his grandfather and late uncle, John F. Kennedy Jr., Schlossberg enters what could become a crowded primary.",
      "One candidate already in the race is Democratic Assemblyman Micah Lasher, a former aide to Nadler, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as a political ally of New York Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani. Erik Bottcher, a New York City councilman from the district, is among those also reportedly considering a bid.",
      "Other well-known Democrats living in or near the district, including former head of the Federal Trade Commission Lina Khan and Chelsea Clinton, were encouraged to run, but declined to do so.",
      "Schlossberg campaigned on behalf of former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris last year and has frequently featured Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, on his social media accounts in recent months.",
      "He may score early attention and financing for his campaign, but he joins the fray at a time of generational and ideological upheaval in the Democratic Party nationally and in New York.",
      "Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, is set to take over City Hall next year and the movement that elected him \u2014 including New York-area members of the Democratic Socialists of America \u2014 is pondering how to further engage in city and state politics. Lasher, 43, is seen as a next-generation star who's climbed the city's political ranks through more traditional means.",
      "Nodding to the anticipated fight ahead, Schlossberg's campaign logo puts an emphasis on the word \"New.\" And his announcement said his \"campaign is for the young at heart, the strong in spirit, and anyone who thinks we deserve better.\"",
      "If he wins, Schlossberg would be at least the seventh member of the extended Kennedy family to serve in Congress.",
      "While just 32, Schlossberg is already running behind his late grandfather, who won a Boston congressional seat in 1946 at the age of 29. His grandfather served three terms in the House and was elected twice to the Senate from Massachusetts, before moving to the presidency.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy won a Senate seat from New York in 1964 after serving as JFK's attorney general, and Edward M. Kennedy also served in the Senate from Massachusetts.",
      "RFK's oldest son, Joseph Kennedy II, represented Greater Boston in the House for six terms, and his son, Joseph Kennedy III, served four terms in the House. Patrick Kennedy, the youngest child of Edward M. Kennedy, served eight terms as a Rhode Island congressman.",
      "Several other relatives have served in local or statewide politics or in other public offices, among them Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the oldest of RFK's children, who served as Maryland lieutenant governor from 1995 to 2003. And another of RFK's children, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is Mr. Trump's secretary of health and human services.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House returns Wednesday for the first time since the start of the government shutdown and nearly two months after it last voted, bringing an end to the chamber's longest absence in recent memory.",
      "The House has been out of session since Sept. 19, when it passed a Republican measure to fund the government until Nov. 21. But the funding bill stalled in the Senate, where it needed Democratic support for passage. A breakthrough in the seven-week stalemate came this week when several Democratic senators cut a deal with Republicans to end the shutdown.",
      "The Senate amended the House-passed bill to include three full-year appropriations bills, while extending the remainder of government funding until Jan. 30.",
      "In exchange for their votes, Senate Republicans promised Democrats they would have a vote on tax credits that expire at the end of the year and help millions of Americans afford health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Most Democrats opposed the deal, but the party now appears to be shifting focus to the upcoming fight over health care.",
      "The House's absence",
      "Arguing that the House had done its job after the mid-September vote, Johnson canceled weeks of votes and committee hearings were put on hold.",
      "\"We have a lot of business to do,\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Monday. \"There'll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us.\"",
      "Johnson's decision to cancel weeks in session fueled backlash from House Democrats, who have repeatedly called on the GOP leader to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat who was elected to her late father's seat in Arizona on Sept. 23.",
      "Democrats, and some Republicans, saw Johnson's resistance to immediately swearing her in as an attempt to delay a vote on releasing files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Grijalva will be the final signature on a discharge petition, spearheaded by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, that will force a vote on the issue and could embarrass President Trump.",
      "Johnson also faced criticism from some Republicans over the House's lengthy absence.",
      "Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, one of Johnson's top GOP critics over the decision to keep members away from Washington, told \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" this week that Republicans' House majority \"is being ruined\" by \"inaction.\" Noting the September vote, Greene said the House hasn't \"been to work since.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley of California, who stayed in Washington over the shutdown, had argued that the shutdown could have ended sooner \"if we actually had the House of Representatives in town.\"",
      "In order to end the shutdown, Johnson will have to keep his often-divided conference together, which could prove easier with President Trump's backing of the Senate deal. The chamber is set to vote on the final version of the legislation on Wednesday.",
      "House Republicans can afford to lose only two votes if all members are present and voting. Two Republicans voted against the original version of the bill when it cleared the House on Sept. 19, though it also had the support of one Democrat.",
      "But lawmakers could face travel disruptions on their way back with thousands of flight delays and cancellations around the U.S. as the Federal Aviation Administration limits flights due to staffing issues caused by the shutdown. Johnson urged House members ahead of final passage in the Senate to begin traveling to Washington \"right now.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Monday he expects all members of his party will make it back in time for the vote.",
      "\"I expect that everyone's going to be back, and we'll be at full strength,\" Jeffries, who could face defections of his own during the vote, told reporters.",
      "The House will also have to confront the expiring health care subsidies in the coming weeks. Johnson has not committed to holding a vote on the issue if an extension makes it out of the Senate. Millions of Americans will see their insurance premiums skyrocket next year without an extension or other fix.",
      "Jeffries is considering a discharge petition to sidestep Johnson and force a vote on the expiring tax credits. Democrats would need the support of at least four Republicans.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department is investigating protests outside of a Turning Point USA event on the University of California, Berkeley's campus, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday, which she suggested was part of President Trump's crackdown on the antifa movement.",
      "Bondi wrote in a post on X that the \"violent riots\" Monday evening at the California school are under investigation by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force.",
      "The Turning Point USA event came two months after the group's founder, conservative activist Charlie Kirk, was killed on a Utah college campus. The sold-out event was the final stop on a recent national college campus tour that the group has hosted since Kirk's death.",
      "On Monday night, dozens of mostly peaceful protesters gathered near the Turning Point event on the university's campus, and scuffles broke out between police and some protesters, videos of the demonstrations show. At one point, somebody threw smoke bombs, CBS News Bay Area reported.",
      "According to a statement from the Berkeley Police Department, two men were arrested on suspicion of fighting in public. One of those individuals was released after officers determined that a 25-year-old man had stolen his chain and he was attempting to get it back.",
      "Two other individuals were arrested by campus police for failing to comply with directions, a university spokesman said. One was a current student and the other had no affiliation with the university, according to a spokesperson. One 45-year-old man attending the event was hit by a glass bottle and transported to the hospital.",
      "In a statement, UC Berkeley said the school \"is conducting a full investigation\" and will cooperate with federal authorities to \"identify the outside agitators responsible for attempting to disrupt last night's TPUSA event.\"",
      "\"There is no place at UC Berkeley for attempts to use violence or intimidation to prevent lawful expression or chill free speech,\" the statement read.",
      "This isn't the first time an event featuring conservative speakers has sparked protests on the Berkeley campus. In 2017, a planned speech by right-wing activist Milo Yiannopoulos was canceled after hundreds of protesters gathered and lit fires and damaged property.",
      "Harmeet Dhillon, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Justice Department, wrote on X that her division will investigate \"several issues of serious concern regarding campus and the local security\" on the school's campus.",
      "Bondi referenced antifa in her X post announcing the federal government's Berkeley investigation, writing: \"Antifa is an existential threat to our nation.\"",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order labeling antifa as a \"domestic terrorist organization\" and directed the federal government to use \"all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle\" illegal operations conducted by antifa.",
      "The label antifa, short for anti-fascist, is widely used to describe far-left and anarchist individuals, though the Congressional Research Service has described antifa as \"decentralized\" and without a \"unifying organizational structure or detailed ideology.\" Instead, the group wrote, antifa is a broadly defined movement that believes in anarchism, socialism and communism.",
      "Last month, for the first time ever, the Justice Department charged two Texas men with allegedly providing material support to antifa, referring to their involvement in a violent July Fourth attack at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Alvarado that injured a federal officer. The Justice Department alleged that the pair were part of an \"Antifa cell\" that plotted the attack with guns and explosives.",
      "Mr. Trump's vow to crack down on antifa has drawn some skepticism from legal experts, who note that domestic terrorism isn't a chargeable offense under federal law.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 19:12:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani's mayoral campaign turned out lots of voters who didn't back Kamala Harris last year \u2014 they are ethnically diverse, younger and less affluent.",
    "story": [
      "One of the hallmarks of Zohran Mamdani's historic win in New York City was the big turnout that included lots of new voters. The city's expanded electorate saw far more young people cast votes than usual, as well as many voters who had not turned out in recent elections.",
      "As the Democratic Party discusses whether to focus on turning out its base or persuading those on the other side, CBS News dove deeper into the data on new Democratic voters in last week's election \u2014 specifically, people who didn't back them in 2024. This group differs demographically from voters who backed Kamala Harris in the presidential election. Mamdani's new voters are younger, more ethnically diverse, and less affluent \u2014 and they also voted in the off year for reasons distinct from those that drive consistent voters to the polls.",
      "How many voters did Mamdani bring into the fold?",
      "A closer look at the CBS News Voter Poll suggests that 15% of Mamdani's voters didn't back Harris last year, either because they preferred Donald Trump (5%), voted for a third-party candidate (3%) or just didn't vote for president (6%). Mayoral votes are still being counted, but that translates to about 60,000 Trump-to-Mamdani voters and another 70,000 Mamdani voters who sat out 2024.",
      "An even higher share of Mamdani-not-Harris voters were new mayoral voters. That is, half of them reported they had never voted in an election for mayor before.",
      "Queens stands out as the borough where the Mamdani campaign both flipped and activated the most voters. About one in 10 Mamdani voters backed Mr. Trump last year, and another 7% did not vote for president. Looking at the numbers another way, our polling suggests that 15% of Trump voters turning out in the mayoral election flipped to Mamdani.",
      "Demographic differences",
      "Mamdani-not-Harris voters look quite different from more consistent voters in a variety of ways:",
      "Mamdani benefited from strong youth support, but Mamdani-not-Harris voters are even younger than his other voters \u2014 two thirds of them were under the age of 45.Mamdani-not-Harris voters are less likely to have college degrees, and they tend to have lower family incomes (44% are under $50,000 annually).Mamdani-not-Harris voters are plurality Asian, while Harris-Mamdani voters are plurality White. And when it comes to religion, a 29% plurality of Mamdani-not-Harris voters are Muslim.",

      "Attitudinal differences",
      "Along with being younger and more diverse, Mamdani-not-Harris voters look different in their general political views and how they came to decide their mayoral vote:",
      "Mamdani-not-Harris voters were much less likely to identify as Democrats \u2014 only half did \u2014 or as liberal on most political matters.While most disapprove of the job Mr. Trump is doing as president, the vast majority say he was not a factor in their vote for mayor. By contrast, most consistent Democratic voters say a reason for their vote was opposing Mr. Trump.Related to the socioeconomic differences we see, Mamdani-not-Harris voters are likelier to describe New York's economy in negative terms and somewhat likelier to say they are falling behind financially.Another difference that emerges is the salience of Israel as a voting issue: the majority of Mamdani-not-Harris voters said the candidates' positions on Israel were a major factor in their vote.And finally, Mamdani-not-Harris voters took longer to make up their mind about their choice for mayor. About four in 10 decided in the last month of the campaign. That is consistent with them being less partisan and ideologically committed than Mamdani's other supporters, the vast majority of whom decided on him before October.",

That is consistent with them being less partisan and ideologically committed than Mamdani's other supporters, the vast majority of whom decided on him before October.",
      "Jackson Heights is a good illustration of where Mamdani added plenty of these kinds of voters. This heavily Asian and Latino working-class neighborhood in Queens leans Democratic, but it's not as deeply blue as other pockets of the city. Harris carried it with 56% of the vote, but Mr. Trump still did better than expected last year.",
      "CBS News estimates suggest that Mamdani is on track to match Harris' support level here, despite the fact that many Democrats and Harris voters preferred Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's relative strength in the neighborhood therefore comes from flipping a non-trivial share of Trump voters, as well as a higher-than-expected turnout, featuring lots of 2024 non-voters and new mayoral voters.",
      "Further down the Northeast Corridor\u2026",
      "In summary, Mamdani-not-Harris voters are younger and more diverse, both ethnically and socioeconomically. And they appear to be less ideological and more focused on pocketbook issues than they are on Mr. Trump.",
      "While sizable and diverse, New York City's electorate obviously is not representative of voters nationwide. But the gubernatorial races further south in New Jersey and Virginia offer additional data points on the types of voters Democrats brought into the tent this year \u2014 and many of the same patterns emerge.",
      "Democrats Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia won in landslides, thanks both to high turnout in Democratic areas and some Trump voters flipping. And it was voters of color, specifically Latino voters, and younger voters who were the likeliest to flip. In New Jersey, for example, 18% of Latino Trump voters flipped to Sherrill this year, while only 5% of White Trump voters did so.",
      "Add to this group voters who backed this year's Democratic nominees but didn't turn out in 2024 and you see many of the same characteristics as we saw in New York: the Democrat-not-Harris voters tend to be younger, less partisan, less affluent, and more focused on the economy.",
      "These trends mirror CBS News polling that finds Mr. Trump's approval rating has declined the most with young people, people of color, and less politically engaged Americans. But despite mostly disapproving of the president, new Democratic voters across these states mostly said their vote was not about him. As Democrats chart a path forward, there is much to replicate from their electoral success last week. Whether their goal is persuading former GOP voters to cross over, or persuading those who are disengaged that turning out is worth it, a focus on bread-and-butter economic issues seems to be a winning recipe for ousting incumbents.",
      "This analysis relies on county- and precinct-level election results, demographic estimates, and survey data from the CBS News Voter Poll. The Voter Poll was conducted by SSRS, an independent research company, on behalf of CBS, ABC, CNN, Fox News, NBC, and the Associated Press. It combines data collected from verified registered voters online and by telephone, with in-person exit poll data collected on Election Day.",

      "Rubio said he gave Gor one instruction. \"'OK, whatever you do, don't mention me \u2014 he doesn't even know who I am. And if he knows who I am, it isn't because he likes me.'\"",
      "Gor approached Jagger and chatted with him, Rubio said. \"All of sudden I hear: 'Marco Rubio would love to meet you. He's sitting right over there.'\"",
      "Rubio said Gor introduced them, and Jagger \"couldn't have been nicer.\" And he said that's when it occurred to him that Gor was \"going to be a good ambassador.\"",
      "Gor's ascension to U.S. ambassador to India follows a career in Republican politics with stints at the Republican National Committee and Congress, where he worked for conservative lawmakers. More recently, Gor was the CEO of a publishing company and political organization with ties to the Trump family.",
      "As personnel director, Gor helped choose who made it into the administration \u2014 and who didn't.",
      "Earlier Monday, the president made reference to friction Gor has had with some of his aides.",
      "\"Some people, when they don't like Sergio, they don't like him. But when they like him, they like him more than anybody. But most of them really are in the 'like' category.\"",
      "There were just enough \"likes\" in the Senate to confirm Gor to his new role along party lines earlier this month.",
      "Partygoers on Monday included Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. and Mr. Trump's White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, talked about card games she hosts at her apartment a couple of times a month.",
      "\"I do the cooking; they come and play,\" Pirro told the crowd.",
      "\"Sergio \u2014 and this is where we're really going to miss you \u2014 Sergio cheats at cards,\" Pirro said jokingly, to laughter. \"Sergio, may your diplomatic deals be as unbeatable as your poker face.\"",
      "Rubio took the microphone and deadpanned: \"I didn't know about the card cheating thing. \u2026\u00a0 That was not on the application. We cannot have that. Is anybody here from India? You did not hear that.\"",
      "The ambassador from India, as well as ambassadors from Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyz Republic, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan were also in the crowd.",
      "Rubio said some U.S. ambassadors have a direct line to the president, and Gor will be among the few who do.",
      "\"When Ric was in Germany, he could call the president,\" Rubio said, referring to former U.S. Ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell, \"and when Sergio is in India, he can call the president. And that it's an enormous sign of respect to the country you're sending them to.\"",
      "Rubio said he's been on four international trips with Gor.",
      "\"People ask, 'Why is the personnel director from the White House with you on these trips?'",
      "And I say, 'It's very important. We're talking about positions.' But in fact, it's because there isn't a country I've gone to yet that Sergio hasn't been (to) at least six or seven times. It's actually highly suspicious. We honestly try to ignore those things \u2014 'Why has Sergio been in this country 18 times?'\"",
      "At the Vatican for Pope Leo's inaugural mass in May, Gor told Rubio: \"Oprah Winfrey's here.\"",
      "Rubio said Gor claimed he already knew her. \"How does he know all these people?\" Rubio said, to laughs. \"This is very, very mysterious. I'm telling you, one day we'll know the answers.\"",

      "\"After seven weeks of waiting, I almost can't believe it's true,\" Grijalva said Monday, lamenting that one of her first votes will be on a bill \"that does nothing for affordable health care for the American people.\"",
      "Grijalva was elected in a special election on Sept. 23 to fill the seat of her late father, Raul Grijalva, but the House has not been in session since Sept. 19, when it passed Republicans' short-term measure to fund the government for seven weeks.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has repeatedly extended what was supposed to be a weeklong break after the vote and ignored demands from Democrats to swear in Grijalva, who will be the decisive signature on a petition to force a vote on releasing files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Johnson's reasons for not swearing in Grijalva have shifted over the last several weeks. During the first week of the shutdown, Johnson said he would administer the oath \"as soon as she wants.\" But Johnson has also said that it would happen as soon as the House returns, that the delay was the result of a scheduling issue and that his decision to wait was \"following the precedent.\"",
      "The GOP leader noted that in 2021 it took former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, 25 days to swear in Republican Rep. Julia Letlow of Louisiana, who won a special election during the pandemic to replace her late husband.",
      "Democrats have countered that two Florida Republicans were sworn in earlier this year during a pro forma session on April 2, a day after they won their special elections.",

      "The crown prince is set to visit the White House on Nov. 18, part of a long-planned trip to follow up on investment announcements made last May when Mr. Trump visited Saudi Arabia, the sources said.",
      "The White House visit is expected to include an Oval Office meeting and lunch, similar to the meetings the president has held with other world leaders in recent weeks. But the White House is also preparing for a black-tie dinner on the evening of Nov. 18 to fete bin Salman.",
      "An invitation obtained by CBS News says the Nov. 19 event at the John F.

The forum will \"explore new investment horizons across critical sectors, including energy, technology, financial services, infrastructure, and healthcare\" and will be a platform for \"exclusive business matchmaking,\" the invitation says.",

      "Washington \u2014 A provision of the legislative package that would end the government shutdown allows senators to bring lawsuits if federal law enforcement seizes or subpoenas their data without notifying them, with potential damages of $500,000 for each violation.",
      "The language appears to allow GOP senators to sue over steps that the Justice Department took during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Trump related to the 2020 election. In October, Senate Republicans revealed an FBI document that showed investigators had obtained phone record data from eight senators and one congressman for calls they made in the days before and after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The records were obtained pursuant to a subpoena in 2023, and the new legislation covers alleged violations dating back to 2022.",
      "The revelation that their call records were obtained infuriated the lawmakers, who accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the Justice Department to target Republicans.",
      "\"The FBI's actions were an unconstitutional breach, and Attorney General Bondi and Director Patel need to hold accountable those involved in this serious wrongdoing,\" said GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said the Biden administration's actions were \"arguably worse than Watergate.\" A spokesperson for Grassley did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new legislation.",
      "The document said the FBI collected \"limited toll records,\" which include information about which numbers participated in a call and how long it lasted, but not the contents of the conversation themselves.",
      "In a letter to lawmakers on Oct. 21, attorneys for Smith defended his investigative steps as \"entirely lawful, proper and consistent with established Department of Justice policy.\"",
      "According to the indictment of President Trump in connection with the 2020 election, part of Smith's investigation into the Jan. 6 attack focused on Mr. Trump's alleged attempts to call senators and representatives to pressure them into delaying certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory. Smith's lawyers have said he is eager to testify publicly about the two Trump probes he oversaw.",
      "The language in the new legislation requires service providers to alert Senate offices and the Senate sergeant at arms if federal law enforcement requests senators' data, and says a court cannot delay the notification unless the senator is the target of a criminal investigation.",
      "The bill further states: \"Any Senator whose Senate data, or the Senate data of whose Senate office, has been acquired, subpoenaed, searched, accessed, or disclosed in violation of this section may bring a civil action against the United States if the violation was committed by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or of any Federal department or agency.\"",
      "The bill says senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation of the notification provisions, and it prevents the government from invoking several types of immunity to rebut the claims. Suits can be brought up to five years after a senator is first made aware of a violation, and allows senators to bring suits for any instances that occurred after January 2022. The FBI analyzed the senators' call records in 2023, meaning they could bring lawsuits under the legislation.",
      "The government can defend against a suit by asserting that a senator was a target of a criminal investigation and by showing that a required notification about the records being pursued was delayed under a court order.",
      "The lawmakers whose records were obtained in 2023, according to the FBI document, were Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.",

      "A proposal for a 50-year mortgage wasn't fully vetted by top Trump administration officials and wasn't ready to be made public, sources told CBS News.",
      "Over the weekend, top federal housing official Bill Pulte floated the idea with President Trump, who then approved a Truth Social post.",
      "Some Trump officials this week vented their frustration with Pulte over the move. One source said Mr. Trump was lukewarm about the suggestion but announced it \"to get Pulte to shut up about it.\"",
      "Another source disputed the characterization of the president as tepid about the mortgage proposal, however, and said 40-year and 50-year mortgages had been discussed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett and others in the administration.",
      "Three sources said the Trump administration has been working on other ideas to promote affordability for Americans, including strategies to alleviate the housing crunch.",
      "The internal discussions on the longer-term loans were casual, and no final decisions had been made, the sources said.",
      "The 50-year mortgage idea came about when Pulte spoke to the president at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, two of the sources said. Politico reported earlier that White House officials were upset with Pulte, the head of the independent Federal Housing Finance Agency. The FHFA regulates Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks, which are tasked with providing liquidity to member institutions for home financing and community investment.",
      "After Pulte presented the suggestion, a sign was posted to Mr. Trump's Truth account with a banner at the top reading \"Great American Presidents\" over the portraits of two presidents side by side, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Trump himself. The words \"30-year mortgage\" appear over Roosevelt, while \"50-year mortgage\" appears over Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump approved the Truth Social post, and it went up at 1:10 p.m. Saturday. About half an hour later, Pulte shared Mr. Trump's post on X and added that \"we are indeed working on The 50 year Mortgage\u00a0 \u2014 a complete game changer.\" He also called it a \"potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now.\"",
      "No other details about the proposal have been released.",
      "Pulte didn't immediately comment.",
      "White House spokesman Davis Ingle said the president is committed to making home ownership easier by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply, and lowering costs. \"The White House and the entire Trump administration are appreciative of Mr. Pulte's efforts, and everyone is working together to implement the President's policies,\" Ingle said.",
      "The president defended the 50-year mortgage idea in an interview Monday night with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\"",
      "\"All it means is you pay less per month.You pay it over a longer period of time. It's not like a big factor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It might help a little bit.\"",
      "Analysts are still examining whether a 50-year mortgage would make homes more affordable for Americans. Some point out that while borrowers might pay a little less in monthly principal and interest \u2013 because the loan's duration is 20 years longer \u2013 the total cost for them would be much higher.",
      "\"The total interest paid over the life of the loan would be staggering, since even with a low rate, you're looking at 50 years' worth of interest,\" NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood told CBS News earlier this week in an email.",
      "At this point, typical homeowners spend 39% of their income on housing, well above the 30% affordability threshold recommended by financial experts, according to Redfin. Mortgage rates have eased this year but are still above 6%, about twice the pandemic-era lows. Home prices averaged $410,800 in the second quarter, about 25% higher than in early 2020, according to Federal Reserve data.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump asked the Supreme Court on Monday to review a New York civil jury's 2023 conclusion that he was liable for sexually abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "Mr. Trump is seeking to wipe away a $5 million verdict after two years of failed efforts to win a retrial of the federal case, calling Carroll's claims \"implausible\" and arguing testimony stretched \"credulity past the breaking point.\" He has since promised to challenge the case all the way to the nation's highest court.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied Mr. Trump's appeal in December 2024, and in June rejected a request for an en banc review, in which all the judges on the court consider the case.",
      "The Supreme Court is now his last hope of overturning the jury's unanimous verdict. The jury found that a preponderance of evidence supported Carroll's claim that Mr. Trump sexually abused her during a mid-1990s encounter in a New York City department store, sticking his fingers into her vagina.",
      "The jury rejected Carroll's claim that she was raped, though the trial judge, Lewis Kaplan, later wrote that the conclusion that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing Carroll by forcefully inserting his fingers was an \"implicit determination that Mr. Trump digitally raped her.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claims Kaplan \"erred\" in several evidentiary rulings that affected Mr. Trump's standing with the jury.",
      "His appeal calls Carroll's claims \"facially implausible, politically motivated allegations.\"",
      "A spokesman for his legal team tied the case to others pursued against Mr. Trump during the years between his presidencies.",
      "\"The American People stand with President Trump as they demand an immediate end to all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded travesty of the Carroll Hoaxes,\" the spokesman said. \"President Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he continues to focus on his mission to Make America Great Again.\"",
      "An attorney for Carroll did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Carroll's legal team received some of its funding from a nonprofit tied to a Democratic megadonor, but has said in legal filings Carroll was not involved in obtaining the outside funds, which they received nearly a year after she filed her first lawsuit. They've said the funding was irrelevant to her sexual abuse and defamation claims.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied Carroll's allegations since they first surfaced in 2019, when she went public with a book excerpt published in New York Magazine.",

    "summary": "Use of force by federal agents has become a focus of legal disputes as the Trump administration contends the tactics are necessary. Our visual investigation breaks down some of the key moments.",
    "story": [
      "You've seen the videos in newscasts and social feeds: Federal agents employing chokeholds, firing pepper spray at close range, and even using vehicle maneuvers to control immigration protests.",
      "These videos have spurred debate over whether agents have violated federal policies on use of force, which is authorized \"only when no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative appears to exist,\" according to Department of Homeland Security policies.",
      "A review of hundreds of videos, most recorded on cellphones by protesters and posted online, shows repeated instances that don't appear to meet that standard.",
      "We asked Eric Balliet, a career federal agent who worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations for more than two decades, to review some of the tactics used in these videos. Balliet led internal investigations into use of force misconduct for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement until last year.",
      "\"This isn't policing and law enforcement as I practiced it for 25 years,\" he said.",
      "Customs and Border Protection commander Gregory Bovino, who is leading the federal agents responding to protests in Chicago, disagrees.",
      "\"If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them,\" Bovino said in an interview with CBS News. \"Don't protest and don't trespass.\"",
      "Protesters and media organizations in Chicago have filed a complaint in federal court about the tactics employed under Bovino's command, as well as those captured on video recordings in Portland, Oregon; Los Angeles and other cities. Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Sara L. Ellis issued an order blocking federal agents from deploying chemical spray, tear gas or any other less-lethal weapon \"unless such force is necessary to stop the immediate threat of physical harm to another.\" The Trump administration has filed an appeal.",
      "DHS is now racing to file its implementation guidance in response to the judge's order. Revised directives informing DHS personnel of banned use-of-force tactics must be issued by the end of the day Tuesday.",
      "\"I see little reason for the use of force that the federal agents are currently using,\" Ellis said in her ruling from the bench.",
      "\"The use of force shocks the conscience,\" Ellis said.",
      "But President Trump said in an interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" earlier this month that the tactics employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"haven't gone far enough.\"",
      "\"I don't know where the leadership is here,\" said Balliet. \"It seems to be non-existent. Any oversight and justification for the use of force seems to be absent across the board.\"",
      "Balliet reviewed dozens of videos at the request of CBS News, and he identified several clear areas of concern with the tactics he saw in use against demonstrators.",
      "Firing less-than-lethal munitions at protesters' heads and torsos",
      "Videos taken outside the ICE facilities show federal agents standing several stories above protesters and shooting less-than-lethal munitions towards their heads and torsos.",
      "One cellphone video from September, taken outside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, shows a priest looking up toward agents standing several stories above him. In the video, agents fire pepper balls that land nearby him, and explode on the ground. One agent then fires a pepper ball that strikes the man in the head, and he crumbles to the ground.",
      "Agency policy prohibits agents from firing at anyone above the waist, stating they \"shall not intentionally target the head, neck, groin, or female breast.\"",
      "Balliet says such incidents show a lack of proper training.",
      "\"They are elevating the force to a degree that is excessive,\" Balliet said.",
      "During an interview, CBS News showed Bovino the September video and asked him if the agent had breached department policy. He said the agent had not \u2014 because the protesters were \"trespassing\" on federal grounds and the use of pepper balls didn't deviate from policy.",
      "\"The use of that less-lethal device, a pepper ball, was absolutely in line with policy. And I applaud them for protecting that federal facility there.\" He said use of force outside of the Broadview facility has been \"exemplary.\"",
      "Tear gas and pepper spray at close range",
      "Videos collected from Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles show agents deploying large amounts of tear gas and pepper spray at protesters, sometimes at close range.",
      "In one October cellphone video from Portland, a federal agent can be seen spraying a form of tear gas called \"oleoresin capsicum\" spray directly at an individual protester at close range and in high volume.",
      "The protester can be seen verbally confronting two agents in the street. Another agent then walks up to the protester and sprays her directly in the face with a large can of pepper spray.",
      "\"If you take direct shots to the eye, it can scratch or prick your cornea,\" said Balliet. In his experience, agents have gone to the emergency room for eye damage after being sprayed at similar ranges with this type of munition.",
      "DHS policy allows the deployment of chemical irritants only in cases when subjects offer \"active resistance.\" The footage shows protesters yelling but not physically threatening the agents, which Balliet said was not a sufficient provocation for this level of response.",
      "\"For this particular one, it's a little disturbing because there does not appear to be any sort of de-escalation attempt,\" Balliet said.",
      "Vehicle maneuvers used as deadly force",
      "Cellphone videos have also caught federal agents in several cities using vehicles to push or move\u00a0 demonstrators.",
      "In one video from Chicago, an agent in an unmarked federal vehicle slowly drives into a protester. The agent can be heard yelling, \"I'm gonna slam you on the f****** ground,\" as the vehicle makes contact with the demonstrator.",
      "Balliet says driving a vehicle into a protester constitutes \"deadly force,\" or what the DHS use of force policy defines as \"action that carries a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily injury.\"",
      "\"Anytime you introduce a vehicle into an already volatile situation, it drastically changes the dynamics,\" Balliet said. \"It rises into that deadly force arena.\"",
      "The fact that the vehicle was unmarked and the lack of communication created further risk, he said. A protester in the video can be heard saying, \"Who are you?\" as the car continues to push into the demonstrator.",
      "\"I can't stress enough the significance of markings,\" Balliet said. \"When you blur the line in that world, it presents a danger to everyone involved.\"",
      "Prohibited chokeholds and hand-on contact",
      "Videos received by CBS News reveal agents using aggressive hands-on tactics, including chokeholds, which DHS policy forbids unless the \"deadly force\" is authorized.",
      "\"Chokeholds and carotid restraints must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest,\" states a 2023 DHS Use of Force policy.",
      "But in two videos from Chicago, federal agents are seen putting their hands or arms directly around the necks of protesters during tense encounters. In one Broadview incident, agents surround a female protester who is attempting to block a car from leaving the facility. An agent, who is masked but not wearing a helmet, even as other agents fire pepperballs from an elevated location, puts his arm around her throat. Another officer then pulls the man off the woman and she is released.",
      "\"It's considered lethal force for a reason,\" Balliet said. \"If I were the commander, that individual would be off the team 30 seconds after it happened.\"",
      "In another Chicago video, a Border Patrol agent places his hands around the neck of a protester and slams him onto the ground. As the agent engages in the hands-on approach, he swings his rifle behind him, leaving the muzzle of his potentially loaded gun unprotected.",
      "\"The fact that that weapon, that M4, is just flailing around muzzling the agents, muzzling the crowd, is basically begging some bad actor to grab it,\" said Balliet. \"It's good that somebody didn't get extremely hurt or killed in this.\"",
      "Agents commended by commander, despite alleged violations of DHS policy",
      "Bovino confirmed no one has been disciplined in Chicago in connection to incidents documented during Operation Midway Blitz.",
      "\"Absolutely not,\" Bovino said when asked if anyone acted outside policy.",
      "But Balliet said he believes the lack of accountability could have long-term negative consequences for federal law enforcement.",
      "\"This is gonna have an irreparable harm to the trust and faith that the general public has in its law enforcement officers,\" he said. \"It is creating a divide that is going to take years \u2014 if it can ever be fully repaired.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said federal agents are \"trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves.\"",
      "The agency argued that protesters have \"thrown rocks, bottles, and fireworks\" at agents, \"slashed the tires of their vehicles, rammed them, ambushed them, and \u2026destroyed multiple law enforcement vehicles.\"",
      "\"Despite these real dangers, our law enforcement shows incredible restraint in exhausting all options before force is escalated,\" the agency statement said.",

    "summary": "John Banuelos' case was unique among Capitol riot prosecutions because he was the only defendant accused of pulling and firing a gun while on Capitol grounds.",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. Capitol riot defendant who was accused of firing a gun into the air while among the mob on Capitol grounds on January 6, 2021, now faces charges of sexual assault and kidnapping in Utah.",
      "Prosecutors allege John Banuelos, 40, attacked a woman in the Salt Lake City area in 2018, three years prior to his alleged involvement in the Capitol siege, according to court filings obtained by CBS News.",
      "A DNA test conducted in August linked Banuelos to the 2018 sex assault, prosecutors allege in a charging document filed in Utah.",
      "Banuelos' charges in his U.S. Capitol riot case were dismissed and he was released from custody in January 2025, after President Trump granted clemency to the more than 1,500 people convicted of charges stemming from the Capitol attack.",
      "According to court filings in Utah, Banuelos allegedly invited the victim of the attack, referred to in the court filings only as S.J., to his home in June 2018, falsely claiming there was a party at the house. According to charging documents, Banuelos beat the victim after she entered his house.",
      "Prosecutors said the victim told investigators that Banuelos \"hit her in the face and told her he was going to kill her.\u00a0 Banuelos then grabbed her by the shirt and dropped her on the floor, causing her to hit her head. (The victim) recalled feeling like Banuelos was going to kill her.\"",
      "The victim also told police that Banuelos sexually accosted her, the court documents say. The victim told investigators, \"Banuelos was aggressively kissing her and punched her in the head. She said when she tried to punch him back, he got 'really angry,'\" according to the charging documents from prosecutors. The charging papers also said the victim said that Baneulos \"grabbed her shorts, pulled them off, and threw her, causing her whole body to fly in the air.\"",
      "The charging documents allege Banuelos strangled the victim, who told investigators he \"used a pressure of '10 out of 10' for a couple of seconds. (The victim) said that while strangling her, he told her that she was 'gonna be quiet' and she thought she was 'gonna die.'\"",
      "Banuelos faces charges of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault.\u00a0 A warrant was issued in Utah for Banuelos's arrest on Oct. 1.",
      "Police reports obtained by CBS News under the Freedom of Information Act said Cook County, Illinois sheriff's investigators found Banuelos at a Burger King in the Chicago suburb of Cicero on Oct. 17. The sheriff's department said Banuelos acknowledged his identity to officers when they stopped him as a passenger in a ride-share car minutes later.",
      "He has no listed defense attorney in his case in Utah and was not reachable for comment. It was not immediately clear if he was still being held in Illinois or if he had been transferred to Utah.",
      "Banuelos was among the later waves of arrests in the U.S. Capitol siege case. He was charged in his federal Jan. 6 case in March 2024, more than three years after the attack. Banuelos' case was unique among the tonnage of Capitol riot prosecutions, because he was the only defendant accused of pulling and firing a gun while on Capitol grounds.",
      "The Justice Department alleged \"Open-source media and CCTV captured Banuelos allegedly raising the gun over his head and, at approximately 2:34 p.m., firing two shots into the air. Banuelos returned the firearm to his waistband and climbed down the scaffolding, rejoining the crowd below.\"",
      "Banuelos pleaded not guilty in his Jan. 6 case, but never stood trial because of the dropped charges.",
      "During 2024 court proceedings in his Capitol riot case, Banuelos openly and brazenly predicted he'd be cleared of charges because of the reelection of Mr. Trump.",
      "When urged by Washington, D.C., federal judge Tanya Chutkan to be careful about what he said in open court, Banuelos told the judge, \"Trump is going to be in office in six months, so I have nothing to worry about.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has pardoned dozens of people who allegedly tried to overturn the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, including those who were named as so-called \"alternate state electors\" to certify the results. Ed Martin, a Justice Department attorney whose focus is pardons, posted what appeared to be the\u00a0pardons document on social media, which was later confirmed by the White House.",
      "In addition to these alleged false electors, others granted pardons include former Trump personal lawyer and one-time close Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump's chief of staff from March 2020 to January 2021. More than 70 people are named in the document as receiving pardons.",
      "Electors are part of the 538-member Electoral College that officially elects presidents. In 48 states, they vote for the candidate who won a state's popular vote; elector votes in Maine and Nebraska are awarded based on congressional district and statewide results.",
      "The pardon document, dated Nov. 7, starts out by saying it \"ends a grave national injustice perpetrated upon the American people following the 2020 Presidential Election and continues the process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "In a statement Monday morning, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy.\"",
      "The document also says the pardon doesn't apply to Mr. Trump. That circumvents, at least for now, the issue of whether a president can pardon himself.",
      "The attempt to appoint alternate electors formed a core part of a federal indictment against Mr. Trump that was abandoned by the Justice Department earlier this year shortly before he returned to the White House.",
      "He was accused of participating in a scheme to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election. The federal indictment accused him and others of spreading \"lies that there had been outcome-determinative fraud in the election and that he had actually won,\" ultimately leading to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Mr. Trump denied wrongdoing.",
      "Presidents can't pardon people charged with state crimes.",

      "Giuliani was disbarred in New York and Washington, D.C., over his efforts to overturn the election results in Pennsylvania and claims he made in a federal lawsuit that elections boards there were engaged in a scheme to rig the election against Mr. Trump. He later\u00a0declared bankruptcy after being found liable for $148 million for spreading falsehoods about Georgia election workers.",
      "He was also indicted in Arizona for allegedly spreading false claims that the 2020 election there had been marred by fraud.",
      "A spokesperson for Giuliani, Ted Goodman, said in a statement, \"Mayor Giuliani never sought a pardon but is deeply grateful for President Trump's decision.\" He said Giuliani \"stands by his work following the 2020 presidential election\" and \"deserves to have his bar license immediately reinstated.\"",

      "Others named in the pardon letter include former law professor John Eastman; Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis, attorneys who promoted the claims; Kenneth Chesebro, who prosecutors said proposed the alternate elector plan in a memo to Mr. Trump; and longtime Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn.

      "In a letter to President Trump on Monday, also seen by CBS News, Judiciary Committee Democrats wrote that Maxwell \"is preparing a 'Commutation Application' for your Administration to review, undoubtedly coming to you for your direct consideration. The Warden herself is directly helping Ms. Maxwell copy, print, and send documents related to this application.\"",
      "The letter says the information received demonstrates \"either that Ms. Maxwell is herself requesting you release her from her 20-year prison sentence for her role as a co-conspirator in Jeffrey Epstein's international child sex trafficking ring, or that this child sex predator now holds such tremendous sway in the second Trump Administration that you and your DOJ will follow her clemency recommendations.\"",
      "The letter also alleges that Maxwell is receiving preferential and lenient treatment at the Bryan federal prison camp in Texas, where she was transferred over the summer after meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss the Epstein case.",
      "\"Federal law enforcement staff working at the camp have been waiting on Ms. Maxwell hand and foot,\" says the letter signed by Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee.",
      "The committee's letter says the panel has received information that the prison camp staff \"has heaped favorable concierge-style treatment on Ms. Maxwell,\" such as customized meals that are hand-delivered to her cell.",
      "When Maxwell wanted to arrange a private meeting with visitors, the letter says, \"the Warden personally arranged it for her \u2014 and then provided a special cordoned off area for visitors to arrive, as well as an assortment of snacks and refreshments for her guests.\" The letter also says Maxwell's visitors were allowed to bring computers, which it calls \"an unprecedented action by the Warden given the security risk and potential for Ms. Maxwell to use a computer to conduct unmonitored communications with the outside world.\"",
      "Maxwell's defense attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "CBS News reported on Aug. 1 that Maxwell was transferred from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, to the Bryan prison camp, a smaller minimum-security facility. No reason was given for the move. Her transfer came just days after Maxwell's highly unusual meeting with Blanche in Tallahassee, in which her attorney said she answered all of Blanche's questions.",

    "story": [
      "As if deadly snakes, spiders\u00a0and sharks\u00a0were not enough, Australia now has a new creepy critter: a \"lucifer\" bee with devil-like horns.",
      "The species, dubbed Megachile (Hackeriapis) lucifer, was found in the state of Western Australia, Curtin University announced on Tuesday.",
      "Kit Prendergast at the university's School of Molecular and Life Sciences discovered the bee while surveying a critically endangered wildflower in 2019 and was immediately drawn to the insect's unique appearance.",
      "\"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" she said.",
      "A fan of the Netflix TV show \"Lucifer,\" she said the name was the perfect fit for the bee's distinctively devilish appearance.",
      "Prendergast said DNA barcoding confirmed the new species didn't match any known bees in DNA databases. She also said the specimens she retrieved did not match any in museum collections.",
      "\"It's the first new member of this bee group to be described in more than 20 years, which really shows how much life we still have to discover,\" Prendergast said.",
      "She added that she hopes the discovery will raise awareness about the number of undiscovered species that could still be out there, especially in areas threatened climate change and mining.",
      "\"Many mining companies still don't survey for native bees, so we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems,\" she said.",
      "\"Without knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realize they're there.\"",
      "Almost all flowering plants depend on wild pollinators, particularly bees, but habitat loss and climate change are driving many vital species to the brink of extinction.",
      "Curtin University noted the publication of the research coincides with\u00a0Australian Pollinator Week, which highlights the crucial role bees in maintaining healthy ecosystems.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:42:44 -0500",
    "summary": "James D. Watson, who helped discover the structure of DNA, has died at 97 years old.",
    "story": [
      "James D. Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.",
      "The breakthrough \u2014 made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 \u2014 turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But later in life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks.",
      "Watson shared a 1962 Nobel Prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder. In 2014, he became the first living prizewinner to auction off their medal, though the purchaser returned the award to him several months later.",
      "The breakthrough discovery suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper. Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dali and a British postage stamp.",
      "The findings, based on data from Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and other colleagues at King's College London, were a \"pivotal moment in the life sciences,\" said the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.",
      "Watson spent much of his career at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, becoming its director in 1968 and focusing the facility's research on DNA viruses that cause cancer. Watson, his wife and their two children lived on the laboratory's grounds for decades.",
      "\"Watson's extraordinary contributions to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory during his long tenure transformed a small, but important laboratory on the North Shore of Long Island into one of the world's leading research institutes,\" the institution said.",
      "Watson continued to make scientific discoveries. While at Cambridge in England, he carried out pioneering research on the structure of small viruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said. He also helped demonstrate the existence of mRNA in his lab at Harvard University in partnership with researchers at Cambridge, and later discovered important bacterial proteins that control gene expression, the laboratory said. He also wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, mentored young scientists and guided the early years of the Human Genome Project.",
      "Watson gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when London's Sunday Times Magazine quoted him as saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\" He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\"",
      "Watson\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the remarks after international uproar and was suspended from his job as chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and retired a week later.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \"No, not at all,\" he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab\u00a0revoked several honorary titles\u00a0it had given Watson, saying his statements were \"reprehensible\" and \"unsupported by science.\"",
      "Watson's combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \"a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \"His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim's views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\"",
      "Watson's DNA discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body's blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person's offspring.",
      "\"Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\" Watson once said. He later wrote: \"There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\"",

    "summary": "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" said the lead author of the study, which spotlights the impacts of planetary warming on aquatic ecosystems.",
    "story": [
      "When dolphins began washing up dead by the dozens on Lake Tefe in Brazil's Amazonas state, hydrologist Ayan Fleischmann was sent to find out why.",
      "What he and his colleagues discovered was startling: a brutal drought and extreme heat wave that began in September 2023 had transformed the lake into a steaming cauldron. The lake's waters reached 41 degrees Celsius, or 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 hotter than most spa baths.",
      "Their findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, spotlight the impacts of planetary warming on tropical regions and aquatic ecosystems, and come as the United Nations' COP30 climate talks kick off in Brazil.",
      "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" lead author Fleischmann, of western Brazil's Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development, told AFP.",
      "He recalled the \"psychological impact\" of seeing the carcasses of Amazon River dolphins and tucuxis, another freshwater dolphin species.",
      "It's an \"overlooked problem,\" he said, adding that tropical lakes, essential for the food security and livelihoods of local communities, have been far less studied than those in Europe and North America, and were assumed to be relatively stable.",
      "While this study focused on 2023, another record-breaking drought happened in the Amazon a year later. Such events are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting as a result of human-caused climate change.",
      "In all, the team visited 10 central Amazonian lakes, finding that five experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures exceeding 37 degrees Celsius, far higher than the 29-30 degrees Celsius considered normal.",
      "The most extreme reading came from Lake Tefe, which saw its surface area shrink by about 75%.",
      "According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a hot tub is typically set between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit, or just under 40 degrees Celsius.",
      "Officials from the\u00a0World Wildlife Fund Brazil\u00a0said 153 dolphins were found dead the week of Sept. 23, 2023, including 130\u00a0pink dolphins\u00a0and 23\u00a0tucuxi dolphins. Both are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and the latter of which are considered \"the guardians of rivers and a symbol of good luck,\" according to RiverDolphins.org.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here\"",
      "What made it even more remarkable, said Fleischmann, was that the same temperature was found not just at the surface but throughout the two-meter-deep water column.",
      "Using computer modeling, the team identified four key drivers: strong solar heating, shallow waters, low wind speeds, and high turbidity \u2014 a measure of water haziness.",
      "These factors reinforce one another. Shallowness increases turbidity, which traps more heat, while low wind carries less heat away, leaving the water more exposed to clear skies and intense sunlight.",
      "Another stressor for aquatic life was the large swing between highs and lows, with the peak of 41C in Tefe followed by a nighttime low of 27C.",
      "Though much of the national and global attention focused on the more than 200 dead dolphins recorded in under two months, they represented only the tip of a wider socio-ecological crisis, with fish also dying in droves.",
      "There was even a phytoplankton bloom that turned the lake red as the algae came under stress -- the subject of another forthcoming paper Fleischmann co-authored.",
      "To understand longer-term trends, the researchers combed back through NASA satellite data beginning in 1990, finding that Amazonian lakes have been warming at roughly 0.6C per decade, higher than the global average.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here, there is no doubt about it,\" said Fleischmann.",
      "He added he would be attending the COP30 summit to advocate for long-term monitoring of the Amazon's lakes and for greater inclusion of local populations -- including Indigenous peoples, non-Indigenous riverine dwellers, and Afro-descendant communities -- in developing solutions.",
      "Research\u00a0published in the journal Hydrological Processes found that droughts \"have significant implications for river water temperature extremes\" as radiation during these periods is more intense while water levels are lower and river velocities slow.",
      "\"Rising river water temperatures can have significant and often detrimental implications for aquatic life, impacting both individual species and entire ecosystems,\" study co-author and University of Birmingham professor\u00a0David Hannah\u00a0said. \"Drought conditions often coincide with high atmospheric temperatures and such trends will become more intense and frequent with climate change.\"",

    "story": [
      "A severe geomagnetic storm is forecast to hit Earth's magnetic field on Wednesday, which could cause widespread disruption to infrastructure technology and make northern lights visible for much of the northern half of the U.S.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday issued a G4, or severe, geomagnetic storm watch in response to recent coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, from the sun. CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma that the sun occasionally ejects, NASA says. The highest geomagnetic storm level is G5, which is considered extreme.",
      "The latest CME was the \"most energetic and fastest of the CMEs\" that erupted in the past few days, NOAA said. It was also associated with one of the strongest solar flares of the current solar cycle. The flare\u00a0peaked around 5 a.m. ET Tuesday and was classified as an R3 or \"strong\" flare, meaning it has the potential to cause major disruptions to high-frequency radio on the sunlit side of Earth and cause low-frequency navigation signal issues.",
      "The severe storm is expected to impact Earth around midday Wednesday, the Space Weather Prediction Center said, although it noted the forecast is \"tough\" and it only had a \"moderate level of certainty\" on the timing.",
      "Another G3, or strong, geomagnetic storm was expected to affect Earth on Thursday, NOAA said.",
      "Northern lights forecast",
      "While the potential geomagnetic storms can cause disruptions to critical communication infrastructure, they could also make the aurora visible as far south as Alabama and in Northern California beginning Tuesday night, NOAA said.",
      "The University of Alaska and Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts say the best chance of seeing the northern lights starts as early as 10 p.m. ET Tuesday and will last until around 1 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "During that time, \"highly active auroral displays\" might be visible in places like Portland, Oregon; Cheyenne, Wyoming, and New York City, the University of Alaska said. The northern lights might also be visible close to the horizon as far south as Oklahoma City and Raleigh, North Carolina, the university said.",
      "In May 2024, a\u00a0powerful coronal mass ejection\u00a0brought the strongest\u00a0geomagnetic storm\u00a0in more than 20 years to Earth. During the CME, multiple X-class solar flares\u00a0were recorded. That storm caused some radio blackouts.",
      "Another strong geomagnetic storm in October 2024\u00a0led to the northern lights\u00a0being visible as far south as Florida and over bright areas like New York City and Chicago.",

      "\"Ninety-seven percent could not distinguish between music entirely generated by AI and human-created music,\" said Deezer in a statement.",

      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",

      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",

    "story": [
      "Apple called out European officials in a heated letter shared with CBS News, arguing European Union regulations that forced the tech giant to allow smaller rivals into its App Store have made its platform less safe for consumers.",
      "Because of the changes, \"risks to users on our devices will inevitably increase,\" Apple Vice President Kyle Andeer says in a letter Thursday to the European Commission, the EU's executive body.",
      "Apple accuses the EU of having an \"enforcement agenda\" that seeks to \"undermine the security and privacy of iOS and iPadOS.\"",
      "It's the latest complaint from an American company about alleged overreach from the EU's powerful digital laws.",
      "The tensions have factored into U.S. trade negotiations. In August, President Trump\u00a0threatened higher tariffs on countries with tech rules he believes are discriminatory to U.S. companies. In an April op-ed, Mr. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused the EU of engaging in \"lawfare\" to \"target America's largest tech firms.\"",
      "In recent years, the EU passed two major laws governing online platforms. The Digital Services Act requires platforms to follow certain rules on illegal or harmful content and advertising to minors, and the Digital Markets Act is designed to promote online competition. Tech companies can face hefty fines for violating either law.",
      "Apple was fined 500 million euros in April for violating the EU's Digital Markets Act by allegedly restricting app developers from steering users toward alternatives to the App Store. Apple appealed the fine.",
      "Since then, the company has become more outspoken in claiming the EU rules have opened the door to financial scams, pornography, privacy issues, and other problems.",
      "In its new letter, Apple says the European Commission sent an inquiry in October that questioned whether the tech company had put in place measures to ensure a high level of safety for minors, under the Digital Services Act.",
      "Apple fired back that the EU's other major law \u2014 the Digital Markets Act \u2014 required it to allow developers to link out of their apps to websites and other apps \"with no meaningful guardrails.\"",
      "\"This exposes users to fraud and scams on those third-party platforms that we cannot control or even monitor\u2014even for apps distributed through the App Store,\" the letter says.",
      "It continues: \"Apple has repeatedly warned the Commission that its approach to enforcement of the DMA is reckless and even dangerous, and urged the Commission to address the new risks their approach to the DMA has created for consumers,\" referring to the acronym for the Digital Markets Act.",
      "The European Commission could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "American tech giants like Apple, Meta and Google have faced scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, with regulators accusing them of stifling competition.",
      "Beyond the fines in Europe, U.S. officials sued Apple last year, alleging the company has violated federal antitrust laws by imposing \"shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines.\" And Apple has been embroiled in a long-running dispute with Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, over App Store fees and policies.",
      "Apple has long argued that its App Store restrictions are necessary to protect users from privacy, viruses and scams, and the EU's new rules could expose users to security issues.",

    "summary": "The three emails appear to be exchanges between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as the author Michael Wolff and Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday released emails exchanged between Jeffrey Epstein and others about President Trump.",
      "Among the documents is a 2011 message from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate, that said Mr. Trump \"spent hours at my house\" with one of Epstein's victims, whose name is redacted. In another email in 2019 to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\"",
      "Maxwell\u00a0was convicted of conspiring in Epstein's sex trafficking ring and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Wolff has written several books about Mr. Trump.",
      "House Democrats said the emails were turned over by Epstein's estate, which they said released more than 23,000 documents that lawmakers are now reviewing. The full Oversight Committee also released more than 20,000 pages of records from Epstein's estate Wednesday and claimed Democrats \"cherry-pick\" from the material \"to generate clickbait.\" The latest batch includes emails, records from court proceedings, transcripts from depositions, press clippings and other material.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, and he has not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of selectively leaking emails to \"create a fake narrative\" to harm Mr. Trump. She said the unnamed victim in the emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who met Epstein in the summer of 2000, just before she turned 17,\u00a0while working at the spa\u00a0at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida club. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April,\u00a0had not accused the president of any wrongdoing. She said in her memoir that Mr. Trump \"couldn't have been friendlier,\" when she met him in his office.",
      "\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.\"",
      "CBS has not independently verified the emails.",
      "In one of the messages from Epstein to Maxwell, dated April 2, 2011, the late financier wrote, \"i want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump. [Victim 1] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "Maxwell then replies, \"I have been thinking about that\u2026\"",
      "In a second email that appears to be from Epstein to Wolff, dated Jan. 31, 2019, Epstein references a victim, whose name is redacted, and mentions Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida resort.",
      "\"Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" the message from Epstein reads.",
      "In the third exchange released by House Democrats, which appears to be between Epstein and Wolff, Wolff writes on Dec. 15, 2015, \"I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you\u2013either on air or in scrum afterwards.\"",
      "According to the email exchange, Epstein then replies, \"if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\" Wolff responds, \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his first run for the White House in June 2015 and would have been on the campaign trail when the emails between Wolff and Epstein were exchanged.",
      "Wolff authored a book about the first few months of Mr. Trump's first term in office, titled \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" that was released in 2018.",
      "Mr. Trump and Epstein were friends for years and ran in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said they had a falling out around 2004, more than a decade before Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. Epstein had separately reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida in 2007, in which he agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month prison sentence.",
      "Epstein\u00a0died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial.",
      "The new release comes amid a push for more transparency on the Epstein files in Congress. The House is set to return Wednesday for the first time since Sept. 19. The lower chamber has been away from Washington while the Senate worked through an impasse on reopening the government. The House's absence meant the newest member, Democrat Adelita Grijalva, was not sworn in, preventing her from becoming the final signature needed on a discharge petition to circumvent House GOP leaders and force a vote on a measure to compel the Justice Department to release all of the files from its investigation into Epstein. Grijalva is expected to sign the petition after she's sworn in on Wednesday, starting the clock on the process to move forward with the bill. A vote likely wouldn't come until next month.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0claimed\u00a0on social media Wednesday that the \"Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects. Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap.\"",
      "\"There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!\" the president wrote.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, urged the Justice Department in a statement Wednesday to make the Epstein files public \"immediately,\" pledging that the panel \"will continue pushing for answers and will not stop until we get justice for the victims.\"",
      "\"The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,\" Garcia said. \"These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.\"",
      "Several tranches of records have been turned over to congressional investigators, including from Epstein's estate. The House Oversight Committee has also sought information from a slew of former attorneys general and FBI directors, as well as former President Bill Clinton.",
      "Lawmakers have also questioned Alex Acosta, who was the U.S. attorney in South Florida when prosecutors investigated Epstein in the 2000s and reached the nonprosecution agreement with him.",
      "Acosta went on to serve as Labor secretary during Mr. Trump's first term but resigned in 2019 amid questions about his handling of Epstein's case.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:05:28 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Sunday floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote Sunday in a\u00a0Truth Social post. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that the rebates would likely be given to families making \"less than, say, $100,000.\"",
      "That threshold is still in discussion, though, Bessent added.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how the administration would disburse the checks.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "Bessent on Sunday told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending ew tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

      "Earlier this year, the Japanese automaker also pledged to invest $14 billion in an electric vehicle battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina, which the company said will create up to 5,100 new jobs.

      "\"Today's launch of Toyota's first U.S. battery plant and additional U.S. investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company's history,\" Ted Ogawa, CEO of Toyota Motor North America, said in a statement. \"Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company's significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities and suppliers.\"",
      "The North Carolina plant will assemble batteries to power the Toyota Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and an additional, yet-to-be-announced electric car model. Toyota also said the hub will provide on-site childcare, a pharmacy, medical clinic and fitness center for workers.",

    "summary": "A report released by human rights groups found that the treatment of Venezuelan migrants imprisoned in El Salvador's CECOT prison amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance.",
    "story": [
      "A report released Wednesday by human rights groups determined that the deportation and treatment of more than 200 Venezuelan migrants imprisoned in El Salvador for months at the request of the U.S. amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance under international law.",
      "The investigation, by the groups Human Rights Watch and Cristosal, found the detainees were victims of \"constant beatings\" by Salvadoran guards at the notorious CECOT maximum security prison, as well as other forms of mistreatment, including cases of sexual abuse. Investigators argued some of these alleged abuses constitute torture under international law.",
      "\"The human rights violations documented in this report violate El Salvador's obligations under international law, including the prohibitions on arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and torture and other ill-treatment,\" the report said.",
      "Citing dozens of interviews, including with 40 of the Venezuelan men held at the mega prison, Human Rights Watch and Cristosal said the detainees also faced \"inhumane\" conditions, incommunicado detention, inadequate access to food, limited medical care and the denial of basic hygiene, inconsistent with United Nations rules governing the treatment of prisoners.",
      "\"These beatings and other abuses appear to be part of a practice designed to subjugate, humiliate, and discipline detainees through the imposition of grave physical and physiological suffering,\" the report says. \"Officers also appear to have acted on the belief that their superiors either supported or tolerated their abusive acts.\"",
      "The human rights groups argued the U.S. government was \"complicit\" in the mistreatment they found, noting the Trump administration gave El Salvador $4.7 million in March, including to imprison deportees accused of having ties to Tren de Aragua, a gang that originated in Venezuela.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not address the allegations in Wednesday's report, but said, \"President Trump is committed to keeping his promises to the American people by removing dangerous criminal and terrorist illegal aliens who pose a threat to the American public.\"",
      "\"CBS should spend their time and energy amplifying the stories of Angel Parents, whose innocent American children have tragically been murdered by vicious illegal aliens that President Trump is removing from the country,\" Jackson added in a statement.",
      "The Venezuelan men at the center of the investigation were released from CECOT this summer and returned to Venezuela as part of a U.S.-brokered prisoner swap. Most of them were deported to El Salvador in mid-March by the U.S. government after the Trump administration accused them of being dangerous criminals and members of Tren de Aragua. Many were deported from the U.S. with little to no due process under the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "CBS News was first to obtain and publish the list of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT in March. Using that list, \"60 Minutes\" and CBS News found that many of the deportees did not have any apparent criminal record, in the U.S. or abroad, despite the administration's allegations.",
      "The human rights groups made similar findings in their report, saying their \"review of criminal record background documents indicates that many of them had not been convicted of any crimes by federal or state authorities in the United States, nor in Venezuela or other Latin American countries where they had lived.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-death-row-executions-2025-rise/",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 11:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "This year is expected to see capital punishment carried out more often than any other year since 2009. Experts weigh in on the increase.",
    "story": [
      "Executions are on the rise in the United States. After creeping upward since the coronavirus pandemic, when the country's use of the death penalty reached a historic low, the numbers have skyrocketed this year.",
      "Forty-one executions have been carried out so far in 2025, and, without intervention from government officials or the courts, another six will take place before January. Three are scheduled for this week: one each in Florida and\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0on Thursday, and another in\u00a0South Carolina on Friday.",
      "Identifying a previous year in which the prevalence of executions in the U.S. rivaled the current one requires looking back at least decade. Whether or not the remaining six proceed as planned, the death penalty has already had its busiest year since 2012, when 43 people were executed. The last time 47 executions took place over a single 12-month period was 2009.",
      "Criminal justice experts say the factors driving this year's increase are multifaceted, although they cite partisan pressure and the ripple effects of expired moratoriums as key contributors. There also is a lack of evidence suggesting citizen support for capital punishment has anything to do with it.",
      "\"A political effort\"",
      "Robin Maher, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, attributes the growing sum of executions to \"largely, a political effort.\" Her nonprofit organization is recognized among the nation's leading sources of data and analyses on how capital punishment is applied, but it doesn't take a position on the issue.",
      "\"The number of executions is certainly garnering some headlines right now because it does represent an increase from where we were in years' past, but there's absolutely no evidence it represents a change in public support for the death penalty by Americans,\" Maher said.",
      "Polling data suggests cultural attitudes nationwide have shifted away from backing the death penalty over the last half-century, with the October results of a Gallup survey showing just 52% of respondents favored the practice. Those results followed a steady decline in Americans' support for capital punishment since the early 1990s, according to Gallup's earlier polls, and they also marked a slight drop in support from 2024.",
      "At the same time, both the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Death Penalty Information Center have tracked a dramatic decrease in new death sentences imposed by American juries since an annual peak in 1996, when 316 death sentences were imposed. Three years later, the U.S. executed 98 people, a record high in the modern history of the death penalty.",
      "Juries have sentence far fewer people to death each year \u2014 as of August, only 10 people have received death sentences in 2025,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Death Penalty Information Center \u2014 and the execution rate has generally mirrored that decline since the late 90s. After hitting a trough during the pandemic, executions did start taking place more often year to year, with 11 in 2021, 18 in 2022, 24 in 2023, and 25 in 2024.",
      "Capital punishment under Trump",
      "President Trump issued an executive order upon retaking office that encouraged attorneys general and district attorneys in states across the country to pursue the death penalty more aggressively, especially if an undocumented person is charged with a capital offense or a law enforcement officer has been killed.",
      "The order described capital punishment as \"an essential tool for deterring and punishing those who would commit the most heinous crimes,\" and claimed its application \"continues to enjoy broad popular support.\" A number of studies have refuted or at least cast doubt on the theory that the threat of capital punishment meaningfully deters violence. Others have found the overall body of research on the topic to be inconclusive either way.",
      "Mr. Trump's order also said politicians and judges who oppose capital punishment \"have defied and subverted the laws of our country,\" using former President Joe Biden's decision to commute the sentences of most inmates on federal death row as an example of actions that the administration \"will not tolerate.\"",
      "The executive order came amid a broader backdrop of advocacy for the use of capital punishment under the Trump administration. After ending a 17-year hiatus on federal executions during the last six months of his first term, when he oversaw 13 of them, Mr. Trump more recently pledged to refill federal death row and seek the death penalty for murder cases\u00a0in Washington, D.C. Pam Bondi, his attorney general, has also prioritized reviving the federal death penalty.",
      "\"This administration has talked a lot about the death penalty and has not made any secret about their enthusiasm over the death penalty,\" Maher said. \"So, for some officials, that environment has made it easier for them to schedule executions to curry favor with this administration.\"",
      "Executions this year have taken place in 11 states: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. All but Arizona are led by Republican governors.",
      "Florida has carried out 15 executions in 2025 \u2014 the largest share of any state \u2014 with three still to go. Alabama and Texas have carried out the second-highest number, with five executions each, a threshold that South Carolina is also expected to reach on Friday. Other than South Carolina, which had its first execution in 13 years in September 2024, those states are typically responsible for most executions that take place in the U.S. annually, but Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been signing death warrants at an unprecedented pace since January.",
      "\"Many of these states that are actively executing people are states that have governors who are politically aligned with the president on this,\" said John Blume, director of the Death Penalty Project at Cornell University, referencing DeSantis, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. \"They're very conservative and believe in this, and their attorneys general are too. They believe that in those jurisdictions that, you know, it's politically expedient for them to appear to be tough on the death penalty.\"",
      "Backlogs on death row",
      "Political pressures aren't the only forces motivating the increase. Multiple states that have executed inmates this year or plan to do so by the year's end recently resumed executions after lengthy hiatuses, some of which were legally binding.",
      "States like Arizona have restarted executions after being ordered to pause them for various stretches of time, while authorities reviewed capital punishment protocols that had drawn criticism and, in several cases, accusations of unconstitutional cruelty. Over the last decade or so, many correctional departments struggled to obtain viable drugs for lethal injections and came under intense public scrutiny as horror stories emerged of repeatedly botched procedures.",
      "As moratoriums lifted in one jurisdiction after another, states started \"clearing out the backlog\" of death row inmates who could not be executed while they were in place, Blume said. Some had new or renewed ways to do it: Alabama and Louisiana have now authorized the use of nitrogen gas to execute inmates, while South Carolina reintroduced firing squads and in March carried out the nation's first execution by that method in 15 years. If Friday's execution proceeds, South Carolina will have used a firing squad to put to death three of five inmates this year.",
      "Lethal injection remains the most common method for putting inmates to death. That could be partly due to Mr. Trump's executive order, which included a promise to supply \"a sufficient supply of drugs needed to carry out lethal injection\" to each state that allows executions.",
      "\"The death penalty is the only proper punishment for some of the vilest crimes,\" said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, in a statement to CBS News that also contained some of the language from Mr. Trump's executive order. \"President Trump knows this, that's why he signed an Executive Order on day one of his second term to restore the death penalty and protect public safety.\"",

      "Nearly 900 U.S. flights have been canceled as of midday, according to data from the tracking site FlightAware. Another 720 flights were delayed, though none of those delays were due to staffing.",
      "Flight cuts are set to ramp up again on Thursday, meaning 8% of scheduled flights at 40 of the nation's busiest airports will be canceled. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy warned that the impacts might become more serious if the deal to reopen the government does not pass.",
      "\"If this doesn't open, you might have airlines that say 'We're going to ground our planes. We're not going to fly anymore,'\" Duffy warned on Tuesday night. \"That's how serious this is.\"",
      "Tuesday had\u00a0fewer flight delays and cancellations\u00a0than previous days. Air traffic control towers reported minimal staffing shortages. There were only four staffing triggers, or times when the air traffic controller levels fell below planned minimums, compared to the 81 that occurred on Saturday.",
      "Even once the government reopens, reversing the flight cuts will not be immediate, Duffy said on Tuesday. The process may happen gradually, as the cuts themselves were phased in, he said. Duffy said that he and FAA safety officials would look at relevant data, including pilot complaints, incidents where planes fly too close together, and runway incursions before reversing any of the cuts.",
      "Delta CEO Ed Bastien told CNBC that he believed the airline's operations would normalize shortly after the end of the shutdown.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, one of Johnson's top GOP critics over the decision to keep members away from Washington, told \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" this week that Republicans' House majority \"is being ruined\" by \"inaction.\" Noting the September vote, Greene said the House hasn't \"been to work since.\"",

      "But lawmakers could face travel disruptions on their way back with thousands of flight delays and cancellations around the U.S. as the Federal Aviation Administration limits flights due to staffing issues caused by the shutdown. Johnson urged House members ahead of final passage in the Senate to begin traveling to Washington \"right now.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Monday he expects all members of his party will make it back in time for the vote.",
      "\"I expect that everyone's going to be back, and we'll be at full strength,\" Jeffries, who could face defections of his own during the vote, told reporters.",
      "The House will also have to confront the expiring health care subsidies in the coming weeks. Johnson has not committed to holding a vote on the issue if an extension makes it out of the Senate.

      "Los Angeles \u2014 Three paintings from famously chill public television legend Bob Ross sold Tuesday for more than $600,000 at auction. The paintings were the first of 30 Ross works being sold to benefit public TV stations hurt by cuts in federal funding.",
      "At the live auction at Bonhams in Los Angeles, a serene snow vista called \"Winter's Peace\" that Ross painted entirely during a 1993 episode of \"The Joy of Painting\" went for $318,000 to a bidder on the phone.",
      "\"For a good cause - and you get the painting,\" auctioneer Aaron Bastian said during the bidding. He invoked a common sentiment of Ross, who died in 1995, during a brief lull. \"Bob would remind you that this is your world, and you can do anything you want.\"",
      "Another painting done on a 1993 episode, a lush green landscape called \"Home in the Valley,\" went for $229,100. A third, \"Cliffside,\" sold for $114,800.",
      "The final prices include a charge for the auction house added to the final bid known as the buyer's premium. The identities of the buyers weren't immediately revealed.",
      "Bids for all three paintings went well past pre-auction estimates of their value, which topped out around $50,000.",
      "Three more Ross paintings will be up for auction at Bonhams in Marlborough, Massachusetts, on Jan. 27, with others to follow at Bonhams locations through next year.",
      "The 30 paintings comprise the largest release of Ross originals ever offered to the public, according to Bob Ross, Inc.",
      "All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "Ross, a public television staple in the 1980s and '90s, was known for his dome of hair and warm demeanor.",
      "The special sales seek to help stations in need of licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that along with Ross' show include \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics,\" and \"This Old House.\" Small and rural stations are particularly challenged.",
      "The stations \"have been the gateway for generations of viewers to discover not just Bob's gentle teaching, but the transformative power of the arts,\" Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc., said in a statement.",
      "As sought by the Trump Administration, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations.",
      "Ross died at age 52 of complications from cancer after 11 years in production with the therapeutic how-to show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" The former Air Force drill sergeant was a sort of pioneer, known for his calm - and calming - manner and encouraging words.",
      "Ross spoke often as he worked on air about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\"",
      "He has only became more popular in the decades since his death, and his shows saw a surge in popularity during the lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "Escobedo and Kimmel met as children in Las Vegas, where they grew up across the street from each other. Kimmel wrote on Tuesday that they were \"inseparable.\"",
      "\"We just met one day on the street, and there were a few kids on the street, and him and I just became really close friends, and we kind of had the same sense of humor. We just became pals, and we've been pals ever since,\" Escobedo said in a 2022 interview for Texas Tech University's Southwest Collection oral history archive, disclosing that he and Kimmel were huge fans of David Letterman as kids.",
      "Escobedo would grow up to become a professional musician, specializing in the saxophone, and touring with Earth, Wind and Fire's Phillip Bailey and Paula Abdul. He recorded with Marc Anthony, Tom Scott and Take Six. When Kimmel got his own ABC late-night talk show in 2003, he lobbied for Escobedo to lead the house band on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"Of course I wanted great musicians, but I wanted somebody I had chemistry with,\" Kimmel told WABC in 2015. \"And there's nobody in my life I have better chemistry with than him.\"",

      "Escobedo's father is also a member of the Kimmel house band and plays tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, the father-son duo celebrated nearly two decades of performing on-screen together.",
      "\"Jimmy asked me, 'Who are we going to get in the band?' I said, 'Well, my normal guys,' and he knew my guys because he had been coming to see us and stuff before he was famous, just to come support me and whatever. I'd invite him to gigs, and if he didn't have anything to do he'd come check it out, so he knew my guys,\" Escobedo recounted in the 2022 interview. \"Then he just said, 'Hey, man, what about your dad? Wouldn't that be kind of cool?' I was like, 'That would be way cool.'\"",
      "In the 2022 interview, Escobedo said the bandleader job had one major benefit: family time.",
      "\"Touring and all that stuff is fun, but it's more of a young man's game. Touring, also, too, is not really conducive for family life. I've learned over the years, being on the road and watching how hard it is, leaving your kids for so long. Sometimes they're babies; you come back and then they're talking, it's like, 'What?'\" he said.",

Around 9 p.m. on June 29, a hit-and-run driver killed Tilly as she walked to her car after a fundraiser performance in Hollywood.",
      "\"I've just got to figure out how to keep living. And the hard part with that is not knowing why,\" Edwards said of his wife's death.",
      "Despite local, state, and federal safety campaigns, such as the global Vision Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities, such deaths are up 20% in the U.S. from a decade ago, from 32,744 in 2014 to an estimated 39,345 in 2024, according to data from the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Although traffic deaths have declined since peaking at 43,230 in 2021, the number of deaths remains higher than a decade ago.",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pew Research Center found, Americans' driving habits have worsened across multiple measures, from reckless driving to drunk driving, which road safety advocates call a public health failure. They say technology could dramatically reduce traffic deaths, but proposals often run up against industry resistance, and the Trump administration is focusing on driverless cars to both innovate and improve public safety.",
      "\"Every day, 20 people go out for a walk, and they don't return home,\" said Adam Snider, a spokesperson for the Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state road safety offices.",
      "American roads have become more dangerous than violent crimes in some cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Houston are among the major cities that now report more traffic fatalities than homicides. In 2024, the Los Angeles Police Department reported an estimated 268 homicides and 302 traffic deaths, the second consecutive year that the number of people killed in collisions exceeded the number of homicide victims, according to Crosstown LA, a nonprofit community news outlet.",

      "\"Simply put, the United States is in the middle of a road safety emergency,\" David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, testified during a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing this summer. Harkey said that, out of 29 high-income countries, America ranks at the bottom in road safety. \"This spike is not \u2014 I repeat, is not \u2014 a global trend. The U.S. is an outlier.\"",
      "In January 2017, then-Mayor Eric Garcetti joined 13 other L.A. city leaders in pledging to implement the Vision Zero action plan and eliminate traffic deaths in the city by 2025.",
      "Instead, deaths have increased.",
      "An audit\u00a0released in April that was commissioned by the city's administrative officer found that the level of enthusiasm for the program at City Hall has diminished and that it suffered because of \"the pandemic, conflicts of personality, lack of total buy-in for implementation, disagreements over how the program should be administered, and scaling issues.\" The report also cited competing interests among city departments and inconsistent investment in the city's most dangerous traffic corridors.",
      "Mayor Karen Bass' office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Last year, California state Sen. Scott Wiener proposed a bill that would have required new cars sold in the state to include \"intelligent speed assistance,\" software that could prevent vehicles from exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 mph. But the bill was watered down following pushback from the auto industry and opposition from some legislators who called it government overreach. It was ultimately vetoed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said a state mandate would disrupt ongoing federal safety assessments.",
      "Meanwhile, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an influential automotive lobby, this year sued the federal government over an automatic emergency braking rule adopted during the Biden administration. The lawsuit is pending in federal court while the Department of Transportation completes a review. Even before Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, the alliance appealed to the president-elect in a letter to support consumer choice.",
      "Under President Trump, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is prioritizing the development of autonomous vehicles by proposing sweeping regulatory changes to test and deploy driverless cars. \"Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards were written for vehicles with human drivers and need to be updated for autonomous vehicles,\" NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser said in September in announcing the modernization effort, which includes repealing some safety rules. \"Removing these requirements will reduce costs and enhance safety.\"",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers, however, have criticized the administration's repeal of safety rules as misguided since new rules can be implemented without undoing existing safeguards. NHTSA officials did not respond to requests for comment about Democrats' concerns.",

Authorities have charged Davontay Robins with vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, felony hit-and-run driving, and driving with a suspended license due to a previous DUI. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is out on bail.",

      "In a letter to President Trump on Monday, also seen by CBS News, Judiciary Committee Democrats wrote that Maxwell \"is preparing a 'Commutation Application' for your Administration to review, undoubtedly coming to you for your direct consideration. The Warden herself is directly helping Ms. Maxwell copy, print, and send documents related to this application.\"",
      "The letter says the information received demonstrates \"either that Ms. Maxwell is herself requesting you release her from her 20-year prison sentence for her role as a co-conspirator in Jeffrey Epstein's international child sex trafficking ring, or that this child sex predator now holds such tremendous sway in the second Trump Administration that you and your DOJ will follow her clemency recommendations.\"",
      "The letter also alleges that Maxwell is receiving preferential and lenient treatment at the Bryan federal prison camp in Texas, where she was transferred over the summer after meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss the Epstein case.",

      "Maxwell's defense attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "CBS News reported on Aug. 1 that Maxwell was transferred from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, to the Bryan prison camp, a smaller minimum-security facility. No reason was given for the move. Her transfer came just days after Maxwell's highly unusual meeting with Blanche in Tallahassee, in which her attorney said she answered all of Blanche's questions.",

      "The brooch, which can also be worn as a pendant, features an oval diamond weighing over 13 carats, surrounded by smaller cut diamonds.",
      "\"This historical and highly important diamond jewel was part of other personal belongings the Emperor had taken with him to Waterloo, including medals, weapons, silverware, a hat and a jewellery box containing dozens of loose diamonds as well as jewellery,\" Sotheby's said in a news release.",

    "story": [
      "A report released Wednesday by human rights groups determined that the deportation and treatment of more than 200 Venezuelan migrants imprisoned in El Salvador for months at the request of the U.S. amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance under international law.",
      "The investigation, by the groups Human Rights Watch and Cristosal, found the detainees were victims of \"constant beatings\" by Salvadoran guards at the notorious CECOT maximum security prison, as well as other forms of mistreatment, including cases of sexual abuse. Investigators argued some of these alleged abuses constitute torture under international law.",
      "\"The human rights violations documented in this report violate El Salvador's obligations under international law, including the prohibitions on arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and torture and other ill-treatment,\" the report said.",
      "Citing dozens of interviews, including with 40 of the Venezuelan men held at the mega prison, Human Rights Watch and Cristosal said the detainees also faced \"inhumane\" conditions, incommunicado detention, inadequate access to food, limited medical care and the denial of basic hygiene, inconsistent with United Nations rules governing the treatment of prisoners.",
      "\"These beatings and other abuses appear to be part of a practice designed to subjugate, humiliate, and discipline detainees through the imposition of grave physical and physiological suffering,\" the report says. \"Officers also appear to have acted on the belief that their superiors either supported or tolerated their abusive acts.\"",
      "The human rights groups argued the U.S. government was \"complicit\" in the mistreatment they found, noting the Trump administration gave El Salvador $4.7 million in March, including to imprison deportees accused of having ties to Tren de Aragua, a gang that originated in Venezuela.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not address the allegations in Wednesday's report, but said, \"President Trump is committed to keeping his promises to the American people by removing dangerous criminal and terrorist illegal aliens who pose a threat to the American public.\"",
      "\"CBS should spend their time and energy amplifying the stories of Angel Parents, whose innocent American children have tragically been murdered by vicious illegal aliens that President Trump is removing from the country,\" Jackson added in a statement.",
      "The Venezuelan men at the center of the investigation were released from CECOT this summer and returned to Venezuela as part of a U.S.-brokered prisoner swap. Most of them were deported to El Salvador in mid-March by the U.S. government after the Trump administration accused them of being dangerous criminals and members of Tren de Aragua. Many were deported from the U.S. with little to no due process under the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "CBS News was first to obtain and publish the list of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT in March. Using that list, \"60 Minutes\" and CBS News found that many of the deportees did not have any apparent criminal record, in the U.S. or abroad, despite the administration's allegations.",

    "story": [
      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he received a letter from President Trump on Wednesday asking him to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on trial in three separate corruption cases.",
      "Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the ongoing court cases, with no ruling yet delivered, and his supporters have dismissed the trials as politically motivated.",
      "In a speech to the Israeli parliament in October, Mr. Trump urged Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, telling the gathered lawmakers: \"By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know! But I happen to like this gentleman right over here [Netanyahu], and it just seems to make so much sense.\"",
      "\"This morning, President Isaac Herzog received the attached letter from U.S. President Donald Trump, calling on him to consider granting a pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,\" Herzog's office said in a statement, adding that the president could not initiate a pardon based on the American leader's request alone.",
      "In his letter, Mr. Trump said he was writing to Herzog at a \"historic time, as we have, together, just secured peace that has been sought for at least 3,000 years.\"",
      "\"I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister,\" it added. \"While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System ... I believe that this 'case' against Bibi ... is political, unjustified prosecution.\"",
      "Netanyahu has long been known by the nickname Bibi.",
      "Mr. Trump also framed his request for Netanyahu's pardon as something his Israeli counterpart deserved for working with the White House to reach the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, saying: \"Now that we have achieved these unprecedented successes, and are keeping Hamas in check, it is time to let Bibi unite Israel by pardoning him, and ending that lawfare once and for all.\"",
      "He and his wife Sara are accused in one case of accepting more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods including cigars, jewelry and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favors. He is also accused of attempting to negotiate more favorable coverage from two Israeli media outlets in two other cases.",
      "The statement from Herzog's office said the Israeli president holds Mr. Trump \"in the highest regard and continues to express his deep appreciations for President Trump's unwavering support for Israel.\"",
      "\"Alongside and not withstanding this ... anyone seeking a Presidential pardon must submit a formal request in accordance with the established procedures,\" it added.",
      "During his current term, which started in late 2022, Netanyahu proposed far-reaching judicial reforms that critics say sought to weaken the courts. Those prompted massive protests that were only curtailed after the onset of the Gaza war in October 2023.",

      "Communication with the plane was lost 27 minutes into its flight to Turkey, according to media outlets in the country.",

      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",

    "summary": "Pakistani officials implicate Afghanistan and India as explosion hits courts in Islamabad, killing at least a dozen people.",
    "story": [
      "Islamabad, Pakistan\u00a0\u2014 A suicide bombing outside district court buildings in a residential area of the Pakistani capital killed at least a dozen people on Tuesday, Pakistan's interior minister said.",
      "\"At 12:39 p.m. (0239 Eastern), a suicide attack was carried out at the Kachehri (district courts) ... so far 12 people have been martyred and around 27 are wounded,\" Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told reporters at the scene of the incident.",
      "\"As I entered the court building, a huge blast occurred. I thought the entire judiciary building would collapse on me,\" Zahid Khan, who works as an assistant to a lawyer at the court, told CBS News' Sami Yousafzai. \"When I went upstairs, I saw people lying on the ground around the fire \u2026 Just three minutes earlier, I had been at that exact spot while parking my bike.\"",
      "\"I saw many people lying injured, with blood on the road,\" he said.",
      "He noted the timing of the attack, coming a week after the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, along with some elements of the Afghan Taliban issued threats against Pakistani cities.",
      "Pakistani later issued a statement, saying te government \"strongly condemns the cowardly suicide attack in Islamabad that claimed 12 innocent lives, including members of the judiciary.\"",
      "\"The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has claimed responsibility for this reprehensible act, aimed at spreading fear and undermining Pakistan's justice system,\" the statement said.",
      "The alleged suicide attack in Islamabad also came a day after militants stormed a military college in Wana, in Pakistan's South Waziristan region. Two militants were killed in the assault, officials said.",
      "The TTP, in statements shared with CBS News, denied involvement in both the Islamabad and Wana attacks, but Pakistani security officials and analysts said the group was likely responsible for both.",
      "Last week, a TTP source told CBS News the group considers its campaign against Pakistan's government a \"holy struggle,\" and they warned that it has \"human and technical resources in all major cities\" \u2014 and plans to stage new, large-scale attacks.",
      "The attacker tried on Tuesday to \"enter the court premises but, failing to do so, targeted a police vehicle,\" Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told journalists. He alleged that the attack was \"carried out by Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" linked to the TTP, but he said authorities were \"looking into all aspects\" of the explosion.",
      "In a statement issued later Tuesday, Indian government spokesperson Shri Randhir Jaiswal said the country \"unequivocally rejects the baseless and unfounded allegations\" by Pakistan, calling it \"a predictable tactic by Pakistan to concoct false narratives against India.\"",
      "Pakistan's Minister of Defense Khawaja Asif blamed Afghanistan's Taliban rulers for allowing the attack to take place on Tuesday. The neighbors have long had tense relations, with Islamabad accusing Afghan authorities of allowing the TTP to operate within Afghanistan's borders.",
      "\"Kabul's rulers can stop terrorism in Pakistan, but today's suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts proves this is a nationwide war,\" Asif said in a statement Tuesday. \"Anyone who believes the Pakistan Army is only fighting on the Afghan-Pakistan border and in remote Balochistan should take this attack as a wake-up call. This is a war for all of Pakistan.\"",
      "Pakistan and Afghanistan held two rounds of talks aimed at addressing mutual security concerns in October and earlier this month, but both ended without any solid agreement between the neighbors, and Asif said in his statement after the Tuesday explosion in Islamabad that, \"in this environment, it would be futile to place greater hope in successful negotiations with the rulers in Kabul.\"",
      "One member of the Afghan Taliban's negotiating team told CBS News on Tuesday that the talks had failed due to Pakistan's unrealistic demands for the Taliban to restrain the TTP.",
      "\"It was far beyond our control and capacity,\" the Afghan Taliban official said, accusing Pakistan of failing to effectively counter the TTP itself.",
      "The Islamabad explosion also came a day after a large blast rocked the Red Fort, a major tourist destination in neighboring India's capital city New Delhi.",
      "That explosion killed eight people, and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Tuesday that the \"conspirators\" behind the blast \"will not be spared,\" vowing that \"all those responsible will be brought to justice.\"",
      "Pakistan and India are nuclear armed neighbors that have clashed often, usually over the disputed Kashmir border region.\u00a0Dozens of people were killed in May\u00a0when India launched military strikes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and deep inside Pakistan, saying it was targeting militants in the country that had carried out multiple attacks on India.",

But the absence of the leaders from the world's three largest greenhouse gas emitters \u2014 China, the United States and India \u2014 cast a shadow over the summit as it kicked off.",
      "Beijing and New Delhi did dispatch senior-level delegations for the two-week summit. The White House, however, said no high-level U.S. officials would attend this year's COP. President Trump has repeatedly dismissed human-caused climate change as \"a hoax.\"",

      "\"What the hell is going on here?\" Newsom asked at a global investors' summit in S\u00e3o Paulo on Monday, where he fired off a characteristic criticism of the Trump administration. \"We're in Brazil \u2014 one of our great trading partners, one of the world's great democracies. Home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with, not slapping with 50% tariffs.\"",
      "Ten years ago, 195 nations taking part in the COP21 summit signed onto the landmark Paris Agreement, intended to commit individual nations to take measures that, collectively, would limit the rise in average global temperatures to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The objective in the agreement, which the Obama administration signed, was to pursue efforts to cap the global temperature increase at 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) above pre-industrial levels.",
      "That target now appears out of reach.",
      "Based on national plans submitted this year, the planet is on course to warm by roughly 2.5\u00b0C (4.5\u00b0F) during this century. The Earth's average surface temperature in 2024 was the hottest since record keeping began in 1880 \u2014 and the last 10 years have all ranked among the warmest ever observed.",
      "Still, U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates in Brazil this week that after three decades of dedicated talks, \"we are now bending the curve of planet heating emissions downwards \u2014 for the very first time.\"",
      "\"I am not sugarcoating it,\" Stiell hastened to add. \"We have so much more work to do.\"",
      "A new U.N. analysis released this week shows that, if current national commitments are met, global emissions should fall by about 12% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels. That's an improvement from last month's projection of 10%, but still far short of the 60% reduction scientists say would be needed to keep warming within the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C goal.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has been pressing for stronger action, warning that surpassing the 1.5\u00b0C limit now looks almost inevitable and slamming it as both a \"moral failure\" and \"deadly negligence\" putting the lives of billions of people at risk.",
      "Despite low expectations for any sweeping breakthroughs, the delegations at COP30 are broadly expected to update national commitments to curb emissions in the next decade.",
      "A Brazil-led initiative to raise $125 billion for rainforest protection, coupled with renewed scrutiny of fossil fuel companies \u2014 which Guterres accused of \"holding back change\" while collecting record profits and government subsidies \u2014 were also expected to come out of the two-week gathering.",
      "There is also likely to be more pressure applied on the governments of wealthy nations to help finance climate adaptations around the world, to help developing countries mitigate the impacts of a warming planet.",
      "At last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries agreed on an aspirational goal of mobilizing $1.3 trillion annually by 2035, with at least $300 billion expected to come from developing economies.",
      "Publicly available data on how much climate finance has actually been delivered since then, however, remains scarce, and that could be a key point of contention for the negotiators gathered in Bel\u00e9m to discuss.",

      "NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is arguably the United States' most important alliance, enduring for over 75 years. In Sweden, CBS News saw that alliance in action this week \u2014 in waters contested by Russia.",
      "Our team watched as an enemy submarine prepared for a covert espionage and sabotage mission in the Baltic Sea against America's NATO allies in northern Europe.",
      "It was just a military exercise, launched from Stockholm's harbor, and a German submarine played the role of the unnamed enemy being hunted by NATO forces across the Baltic Sea.",

      "\"NATO is a defensive alliance,\" Commander Arlo Abrahamson, a U.S. Navy officer and a spokesman for NATO's maritime headquarters, which has been closely monitoring Russia's military build-up in the Baltic, told CBS News. \"The potential threats of adversaries in this region are interconnected throughout the world.\"",
      "Abrahamson said that if northern Europe is drawn into a conflict, it would have a negative impact on the United States, too.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The outgoing director of the BBC addressed staff of the publicly-funded British national broadcaster in a call on Tuesday admitting mistakes were made but urging them to \"fight for our journalism\" after President Trump threatened to sue the corporation for $1 billion over a program it aired in 2024 about the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "\"I do hear everyone when we have to be very clear and stand up for our journalism. We are in a unique and precious organization, and I see the free press under pressure. I see the weaponization. I think we've got to fight for our journalism,\" Tim Davie said in the Tuesday call.",
      "Davie gave three main reasons for his decision to step down from his role, including the demanding nature of the job and the upcoming BBC Charter renewal process that will take place in the U.K.",
      "He also said: \"I think we did make a mistake and there was an editorial breach and some responsibility had to be taken. So putting that together, that's what made my decision.\"",
      "There was no direct mention of Mr. Trump's threat of legal action, but Davie said political pressures on the BBC from both the U.K. and abroad were \"challenging.\"",
      "In a letter to the BBC's legal team dated November 9, lawyers working for Mr. Trump alleged that the October 28, 2024 episode of the network's \"Panorama\" documentary program, called \"Trump: A Second Chance,\" which was produced by an external production company, sought to mislead viewers by editing together three separate sections of a speech made by Mr. Trump on Jan. 6.",
      "The letter claimed that the program \"has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\" and that it was defamatory under Florida law.",
      "It outlined demands by Mr. Trump that the BBC retract the documentary, issue an apology, and \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.\"",
      "The letter did not clarify what would be considered appropriate compensation, but it warned that if the BBC failed to comply with Mr. Trump's demands by Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern, Mr. Trump would file \"legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages. The BBC is on notice.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the BBC said Monday that it would \"review the letter and respond in due course.\"",
      "U.K. media lawyer Mark Stephens said it would be hard for Mr. Trump to sue the BBC in the United States.",
      "\"Panorama wasn't broadcast in the USA, and BBC iPlayer (the BBC's streaming platform) isn't available \u2026 so it's not clear that any U.S. court would have jurisdiction to hear the claim,\" Stephens said on the BBC's breakfast program.",
      "The Director General of the BBC, Tim Davie, and its CEO of news, Debora Turness, resigned Sunday amid criticism of the program.",
      "\"Overall, the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said in a letter to staff.",
      "Turness said the controversy around the Panorama episode about Mr. Trump had \"reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC \u2014 an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.\"",

    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors in Mexico arrested another alleged accomplice in the 1994 assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, a crime that shocked the country and remains unsolved, even though the confessed killer has been imprisoned for more than 30 years.",
      "A federal official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed Monday to The Associated Press that Jorge Antonio S\u00e1nchez Ortega was arrested in Tijuana in connection with Colosio's assassination. The official did not specify the charges against S\u00e1nchez Ortega, who is being held in a maximum-security prison in central Mexico, awaiting trial.",
      "According to the National Registry of Detentions, the arrest took place on Saturday.",
      "Colosio, the 1994 presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), was shot twice during a rally in the northern Mexican city of Tijuana. Since 2024, federal prosecutors have been seeking to prosecute an intelligence agent assigned as his bodyguard, identified only as Jorge Antonio \"S,\" as the alleged perpetrator of the second shooting.",
      "As of Monday, the prosecutor's office had not officially commented on the arrest of S\u00e1nchez Ortega, and authorities have not confirmed whether new evidence has emerged.",
      "According to reports, S\u00e1nchez Ortega was employed then as an agent for the Center of Investigation and National Security - back then Mexico's equivalent of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "Mario Aburto has been serving a 45-year prison sentence since 1994 after declaring himself the sole perpetrator of the assassination, a confession he later retracted, claiming he was tortured.",
      "As a result of Aburto's complaints, during the administration of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (2019-2024) the National Human Rights Commission recommended that the federal prosecutor's office reopen the investigation.",
      "Colosio's murder triggered a major political crisis in Mexico and was always surrounded by controversy fueled by the possibility that it was encouraged by certain spheres of power, amid internal struggles within the ruling PRI to choose a successor of then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.",
      "In a January 2024 statement, the Attorney General's Office said there was evidence that the agent assigned to Colosio's security was at the scene and had clothing stained with the victim's blood. It also stated that ballistic evidence indicated that he fired a weapon - with only a difference of seconds between the two shots - and witnesses saw him flee immediately after the shooting.",
      "In the same statement, the agency considered it confirmed that the National Security and Investigation Center, which in 1994 was under the Ministry of the Interior, sent the agent to the scene of the assassination only to later \"cover for him and take him out of Tijuana urgently and surreptitiously.\" The statement concluded that the agent's immediate release was \"an evident criminal cover-up.\"",
      "Since Colosio's assassination, other politicians have been targeted by violence in Mexico.\u00a0In 2010, a front-running gubernatorial candidate, Rodolfo Torre, was assassinated in northern Mexico. Plagued by drug-related violence for decades, the country has also seen numerous local politicians murdered recently, including a mayor who was beheaded in 2024.",

    "story": [
      "A French court on Friday sentenced an American man to 30 years in prison for killing his estranged wife and mother of his three children and her lover outside Paris in 2020.",
      "Charles Dietrich, 50, was found guilty of shooting dead his former partner and her new love interest in the town of Saint-Maur-des-Fosses in the southeastern suburbs of Paris in July 2020.",
      "The court in the southeastern Paris suburb of Creteil imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years and stripped Dietrich of his parental rights.",
      "\"You coldly contested the facts without expressing any regret or questioning your actions,\" the judge said.",
      "\"I do not believe that by killing the mother of your three daughters, you are being a good father,\" the judge added. \"I hope you understand that.\"",
      "\"I do,\" Dietrich replied, speaking in English.",
      "The American man's relatives said he and his wife Aurelie were in conflict over the custody of their three daughters.",
      "Witnesses told investigators that Dietrich believed his wife had \"stolen\" their children after she received primary custody, according to a court document filed with an arrest warrant for Dietrich in August 2020.",
      "The children lived in France with their mother but spent Christmas and summer holidays with their father across the Atlantic.",
      "Dietrich's estranged wife and her new lover were found naked, their bodies riddled with bullets and covered in blood in the woman's bedroom. Investigators found 18 gun casings at the scene, according to the court document.",
      "Aurelie, 43, and Christophe, 42, had known each other for only two weeks when they were shot dead.",
      "Separated since 2015, Dietrich and his wife had been in the process of divorcing.",
      "AFP is not disclosing the last names of his wife and the man she was with at the time of her death to protect the privacy of their families.",
      "Dietrich claimed in court he had been framed, insisting on his innocence. He followed the proceedings with the help of an interpreter.",
      "Wig, gloves and mask",
      "Earlier this week the judge asked him whether he had enemies who could \"plot to frame him for the murder of a couple in Saint-Maur-des-Fosses.\"",
      "\"He wasn't in the CIA,\" the judge pointed out.",
      "The Colorado resident admitted to returning to France at the time of the crime for less than 48 hours without informing his family or daughters, who were with him in the U.S. for the summer holidays.",
      "Dietrich was arrested in August 2020. He admitted to having gone to Aurelie's place but denied having broken into her home.",
      "Confronted with photos of the bodies, he described the scene as \"savage\" and \"disgusting\" but insisted he had nothing to do with it.",
      "He accused investigators of being biased and claimed that some evidence had been falsified by the police.",
      "\"The police very much think that the law must be followed by you, the suckers, and not by them,\" he said in court.",
      "Earlier this week prosecutor Stephanie Gauthier had described the double murder as \"an act of war following a battle plan, an act of private war\" with the aim of regaining custody of his daughters.",
      "\"He came to the conclusion that his goal \u2014 being reunited with his children \u2014 could only be achieved through Aurelie's death,\" the prosecutor said, adding that he had \"methodically planned his actions.\"",
      "Investigators uncovered numerous pieces of incriminating evidence.",
      "Security camera footage near the woman's home showed a person wearing a wig, gloves and a mask. Footage showed Dietrich returning to a hotel about 3:30 a.m. the next day, prosecutors said in a court document.",
      "Several weeks after the murder, police recovered the frame of a gun from the Marne River.",
      "Ballistics tests determined that the weapon had been purchased in 2019 in Colorado, using information from Dietrich's driving license.",
      "The American man's lawyer said his client might have been in denial.",

    "story": [
      "Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa met President Trump at the White House on Monday, continuing a stunning reversal of fortunes for a man branded until three days ago as an international terrorist by the U.S. government with a $10 million bounty on his head.",
      "The former leader of an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria disavowed Islamic extremism after rising to lead his war-torn country. Nearly a year ago, he led his rebel militia to force long-time dictator Bashar al-Assad out of office and into exile in Russia.",
      "Syria was crippled for decades under sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other nations against Assad, and Al-Sharaa is now seeking to normalize relations.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed to CBS News on Monday that Syria will be joining the U.S.-led Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS, marking a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy. Al-Sharaa's own former militia, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, opposed ISIS during the latter years of Syria's 14-year civil war, when he went by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "He was expected to possibly sign a formal agreement with President Trump during their in person meeting on Monday \u2014 which will be their third to date \u2014 to cooperate on counterterrorism. That would be a highly symbolic moment, indicating a 180-degree turnaround in how Syria is viewed by the U.S. government.",
      "Under Assad about 12 years ago, ISIS was allowed to grow and metastasize into one of the most powerful terrorist organizations in the world. At one point, it controlled a huge swath of land spanning the Syria-Iraq border.",
      "After meeting Al-Sharaa for the first time in Saudi Arabia in May, Mr. Trump called the Syrian leader a \"young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past.\"",
      "Over the weekend, he also became the first Syrian leader to shoot some hoops with the U.S. military. Video shared Saturday by the Syrian foreign ministry shows him nailing a three-pointer as he plays with a U.S. admiral and a brigadier general at an undisclosed location in the U.S.",
      "But until Friday morning, the Syrian president was still officially designated a terrorist by the U.S. government, as he had been since 2013. That designation was lifted by the end of the day.",
      "There was expected to possibly be discussion at the White House on Monday about the official lifting of U.S. economic sanctions against Syria, which Mr.\u00a0Trump put in motion in May with an executive order.",
      "That order removed sanctions on Syria, \"while maintaining sanctions on the former president, Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, persons linked to chemical weapons activities, ISIS and their affiliates, and Iranian proxies,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in June.",
      "Al-Sharaa's transitional government has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief for months, and work had been underway to ease some sanctions even before the president's May announcement, but other measures still need to be formally revoked by Congress.",
      "In an apparent bid to show its determination to crack down on ISIS and other extremists, the Syrian government announced that more than 70 alleged members of the group had been detained just hours before al-Sharaa landed in Washington.",
      "In September, addressing the U.N. General Assembly in New York \u2014 another landmark moment as it had been nearly six decades since a Syrian leader had done so \u2014 Al-Sharaa told the gathered leaders that his country was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world.\"",
      "But to reclaim its place, it also needs to rebuild \u2014 a herculean task that Al-Sharaa recently told CBS News' Margaret Brennan in an interview for 60 Minutes will likely cost $600-$900 billion.",
      "He stressed that it would require the international community's help.",
      "\"The world watched this tragedy unfold for 14 years and couldn't do anything to stop this massive crime,\" he said of the Syrian civil war. \"So, the world today should provide support to Syria.\"",
      "On Monday, he was likely to ask the leader of the world's wealthiest nation to help however he can.",

      "U.N. climate negotiations get underway Monday at a meeting on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, with leaders pushing for urgency, cooperation and acceleration after more than 30 years fighting to curb global warming by drastically reducing the carbon pollution that causes it.",
      "Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, president of this year's conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in \"mutir\u00e3o,\" a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.",
      "\"Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,\" do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators Sunday. \"We can change. But we must do it together.\"",
      "Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.",
      "The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.",
      "\"I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,\" said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States. Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land. \"The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity'' of the whole negotiating system.",

      "\"It's a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn't going to be constructive if they did,\" he said.",

The\u00a0State of the Global Climate report\u00a0confirmed global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024.",

      "\"We need to accelerate the fight against global warming and strengthen multilateralism in combating climate change,\" they said, noting that \"climate change has increased the exposure of the poorest to natural disasters.\"",
      "In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, \"but we must accelerate in the Amazon.

      "Not only must nations do more faster but they \"must connect climate action to people's real lives,\" Stiell wrote.",
      "The Nature Conservancy chief scientist Katharine Hayhoe compared the multinational negotiations to a potluck dinner.",
      "\"Everybody brings the contributions that they are making,\" which in this instance are new and strengthened plans to cut carbon pollution, Hayhoe said. \"And it's obvious who took the time to bake the fresh pie with fruit that they picked and who fished out that year old chicken frozen chicken nuggets from the back of their freezer.\"",
      "\"The United States as a country will not be showing up with a dish,\" Hayhoe said. However, she and several others including former lead American negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will take up the slack.",

      "7 STEPS TO \u2018SUPER-AGING\u2019 ARE KEY TO LIVING A LONGER, MORE FULFILLING LIFE, EXPERTS SAY",

      "Below are the five strategies that Attia shared with \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "No. 1: Train like life is a sport",
      "Attia recommends approaching life \u2014 particularly in advanced age \u2014 like an athlete would approach a sport.",
      "As people age, their level of fitness, strength and mobility matters more than many traditional markers, he noted.",
      "7 COMMON FITNESS MISTAKES OLDER ADULTS MAKE AND HOW TO AVOID THEM FOR BETTER WORKOUTS",
      "The longevity expert said he logs about 10 hours per week of exercise \u2014 a mix of fat-burning cardio, high-intensity intervals (to boost VO\u2082 max), and strength training to maintain muscle.",
      "Attia said he alternates between \"zone two\" exercise, which entails steady cardio activity that allows you to maintain a conversation, and\u00a0higher-intensity \"zone four\" training.",
      "No. 2: Use meaningful tests \u2014 not just standard bloodwork",
      "Attia recommends closely tracking VO\u2082 max, which measures the maximum amount of oxygen the body uses during strenuous exercise.",
      "VO\u2082 max is usually measured in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min).",
      "Longevity expert Dr. Peter Attia says most people experience a steep decline in their 70s \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure,\" Attia said. \"It predicts your risk of death from any cause, even more than your blood pressure, cholesterol or smoking status.\"",
      "\"I think this is the neglected part of medical testing, is how fit are you, how strong are you, how well do you move?\" he said. \"And in many ways, these tests are even more predictive of how long you're going to live than what I might get out of your bloodwork.\"",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure.\"",
      "Attia also uses scans like DEXA (short for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), which measures bone density, muscle mass and body fat.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" he added.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" the doctor said. (iStock)",
      "Attia also is a proponent of full-body MRI scans, which can detect cancers and other conditions earlier for better outcomes, although he warns of the potential for false positives.",
      "He also recommends getting tested for APOE, the gene that indicates an elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Having one copy of the gene roughly doubles or triples the chances of developing the common dementia, while two copies raises the risk by 10 times and lowers the average age of onset by five to 10 years, data shows.",
      "No. 3: Eat more protein than standard guidelines suggest",
      "Boosting protein intake has been linked to increased muscle mass and strength, stronger immune function and reduced disease burden, studies show.",
      "Attia recommends consuming more than twice the protein recommended in current nutritional guidelines.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, which would be 55 grams for a 150-pound person or 73 grams for a 200-pound person.",
      "No. 4: Prioritize emotional, mental and relational health",
      "Emotional and mental health are just as important as physical health, according to Attia.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"It\u2019s as much a practice as what I put into exercise, blood work and cancer screening,\" he said.",
      "\"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline,\" Attia went on. \"But if we're being deliberate and active on our emotional health, it can actually improve.\"",
      "\"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline,\" Attia said. \"But if we're being deliberate and active about our emotional health, it can actually improve.\" (Getty Images)",
      "The expert credits his wife of more than two decades for enabling his progress.",
      "\"Just like the exercise data, I don't think this is just a correlation,\" Attia said in the interview. \"I really think that there is also some causality that flows from the end of having great relationships to living a longer life.\"",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Vaughan echoed that the common denominator in \"super agers\" involves a supportive community, a healthy social environment and regular contact with people who care for one another.",

      "No. 5: Optimize the \u2018marginal decade\u2019",
      "While decline is inevitable, Attia said his goal is to make what he calls the \"marginal decade\" as enjoyable as possible.",
      "\"The marginal decade's not going anywhere. We will all have a final decade of life,\" he said.",

COVID ended \u2014 it\u2019s time these insurance company credits do, too.\u00a0Republicans have real solutions to lower premiums for hardworking families, and they don't include bailing out insurance companies that are increasing prices,\" Scalise said.",

      "Democrats have sought the extension to the credits since the government plunged into a government shutdown on Oct. 1. Democrats, led by Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., refused to consider spending legislation without first extending the subsidies in some way.

But those are not things a presidential pardon can do.\"",
      "For example, Giuliani was disbarred in both New York and Washington in 2024.

    "story": [
      "Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss a violent protest on the UCBerkeley campus ahead of a Turning Point USA event now being investigated by the Department of Justice, and two indictments in an MLB gambling case.",
      "Last month, a band of demonstrators marched across West Temple Street in downtown Los Angeles in the national anti-Trump #NoKings protests, carrying a banner that read: \"DEFEAT TRUMP\u2019S FASCIST TAKEOVER. Stop ICE raids and deportations by any means necessary.\"",
      "In one corner, four bold letters stood out: \"BAMN,\" an acronym for \"By Any Means Necessary.\" The rest of the banner spelled out clues to the group\u2019s full name in smaller print: \"Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigration Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary.\"",
      "That organization \u2013 one of 266 groups with combined annual revenues of $2.9 billion identified by Fox News Digital leading the #NoKings protests \u2013 would soon reappear at this week\u2019s flashpoint on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "Protesters hold signs as they demonstrate outside a Turning Point USA event at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley). Two months after Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was killed, the tour made a stop in California at UC Berkeley. The demonstration took place in Berkeley, California, on Nov. 10, 2025. (Photo by Justin Sullivan)",
      "On Monday night, the group proudly broadcast videos on its Instagram channel of its leaders stoking an angry mob on the streets again, this time on the Berkeley campus, staging a protest that turned into a bloody brawl outside a Turning Point USA event, leading to the arrest of several people.",
      "'NO KINGS' ORGANIZER DISCOURAGES VIOLENCE FOLLOWING COAST-TO-COAST ARRESTS",
      "A flyer circulated before the demonstration urged participants to \"End Fascist Turning Point\u2019s Youth-Oriented Campaign of Incitement to Violence!\" It announced a rally outside Zellerbach Hall an hour before doors opened for the event.",
      "The group calling itself BAMN, an acronym for By Any Means Necessary, was part of the anti-Trump #NoKings rally last month, and then showed up at a protest against Turning Point USA that turned violent.",
      "At first glance, the flyer appears like many other activist handouts. But its digital trail tells a deeper story.",
      "A QR code printed on the flyer leads to a page on BAMN.com, a domain displayed on the #NoKings banner weeks earlier for the group, \"By Any Means Necessary.\" On the page, visitors could directly download a \"PDF of flyer\" and \"PDF of poster.\" Journalist Andy Ngo, the author of a book on far-left violence and the Antifa network, shared the flyer on social media, warning that \"By Any Means Necessary\" is a long-standing fixture within the chaotic ecosystem of groups associated with the \"anti-fascist\" movement.",

      "Fox News Digital examined the metadata embedded in both documents to follow the money on \"By Any Means Necessary.\" Each file was created on Nov. 9, a day before the protest, and both listed the \"owner\" as \"ronald.cruz@ueaa.net.\" The email domain, ueaa.net, links to a far-left Detroit-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit, \"United for Equality and Affirmative Action Legal Defense Fund,\" which \"By Any Means Necessary\" describes as its nonprofit \"affiliate.\" They act as a seamless entity at protests, from #NoKings to anti-Israel actions after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas terrorists.",
      "Protesters confront University of California police outside a Turning Point USA event at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley).

      "What\u2019s more, under a label for \"Storage Used,\" both documents note the files are \"Owned by UEAA Legal Defense Fund.\" By Any Means Necessary and the United for Equality and Affirmative Action Legal Defense Fund didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",

Money goes toward our legal cases and broader organizing and education.\" With one click, visitors are directed to the \"UEAALDF website\" at \"ueaa.net,\" legitimizing the activist network under the guise of charity.",
      "While the organization\u2019s balance sheet is small, with reported tax-deductible \"public support\" totaling $99,348 over five years from 2018 through 2022, the most recent year available, the implications are significant.",

      "In the wake of the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in September, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance called for closer scrutiny of nonprofits that receive tax benefits while allegedly promoting political violence.",
      "The convergence of tax-exempt organizations, campus unrest and politically motivated violence underscores an emerging challenge in the nonprofit sector. Groups like \"By Any Means Necessary\" allegedly exploit the credibility and financial protections of charitable status while acting as de facto political operatives, often in coordination with broader ideological movements like Students for Justice in Palestine, first established at UC Berkeley by Palestinian American academic Hatem Bazian.",
      "The metadata and cross-linked digital trails for the UC Berkeley protest reveal a well-coordinated infrastructure beneath the seemingly spontaneous protests, raising questions about accountability, transparency and the weaponization of the tax code for political warfare.",
      "ANTI-ISRAEL RADICALS FROM 'GLOBAL INTIFADA' MOVEMENT JOIN 'NO KINGS' PROTESTS",
      "The contrast between \"By Any Means Necessary\" activists marching relatively peacefully in last month\u2019s #NoKings protest and the violent clash their protests helped incite at UC Berkeley this week highlights how some groups exploit nonprofit status to appear charitable one day while allegedly fomenting chaos, sectarianism, hate and violence the next day.",
      "The UC Berkeley protests also raise questions about malign foreign influence. On its \"Affiliates\" webpage, \"By Any Means Necessary\" includes a link to the website for the \"International Trotskyist Committee for the Regeneration of the Fourth International,\" which is organizing \"militants\" who support early 20th century Soviet communist leader Leon Trotsky and the rise of a global \"revolutionary Marxism.\" The committee includes the Revolutionary Workers League and the Revolutionary Internationalist League, both self-declared communist groups.",
      "The nonprofit group's participation in the #NoKings rally as well as the violent protest at Berkeley underscores a disturbing connection.",
      "A flyer, \"Victory to the Palestinian Struggle,\" includes the logos for \"By Any Means Necessary\" and the communist groups.",
      "The violence at Berkeley prompted Attorney General Pam Bondi and U.S. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon to open a federal anti-terrorism investigation into the agitation. In a letter to UC Berkeley administrators and the UC Berkeley police, Dhillon directed officials to preserve all records related to the protest as she investigated whether the university violated federal civil rights or free speech protections. She told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that the protesters exercised a \"heckler\u2019s veto\" against Turning Point USA, and she would be investigating whether university officials and agitators conspired to deny political conservatives equal protection under the law.",
      "In its most recent tax filing, \"United for Equality and Affirmative Action\" lists four officers: Shanta Driver, president and director; Mark Airgood, secretary and treasurer; Yvette Felarca, director; and Hoku Jeffrey, director. They didn\u2019t return requests for comment.",
      "One Instagram video featured a note across the front, noting, \"BAMN National Organizer Hoku Jeffrey speaks out against Turning Point.\" In the video, Jeffrey told the rally that he wanted the protesters to communicate to Turning Point USA attendees that \"this is not a campus where they are welcome at.\" \"What Hitler got away with, Donald Trump and his fascist movement never can get away with,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, in its tax filing, the United for Equality and Affirmative Action Legal Defense Fund claims its \"primary exempt purpose\" is straightforward: \"Further the Civil Rights movement; educate the public on civil rights; conduct research on civil rights matters.\"",

      "Artificial intelligence has supercharged online scams, creating personalized and convincing traps that even adults can fall for. The latest Bitwarden \"Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2025\" poll shows that while parents know these risks exist, most still haven't had a serious talk with their children about them.",
      "This growing communication gap is leaving the youngest internet users vulnerable at a time when online safety depends more than ever on education and oversight.",
      "Young children face real risks online",
      "Children as young as preschool age are now part of the connected world, yet few truly understand how to stay safe. The Bitwarden survey found that 42% of parents with children between 3 and 5 years old said their child had accidentally shared personal information online.",

      "5 PHONE SAFETY TIPS EVERY PARENT SHOULD KNOW",
      "AI-powered scams are finding new ways to reach kids who go online earlier than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Nearly 80% of kids between the ages of 3 and 12 already have their own tablet or another connected device. Many parents assume supervision software or family settings are enough, but that assumption breaks down when kids explore apps, games and chat spaces designed to hold their attention. Device access has become nearly universal by early elementary school, but meaningful supervision and honest safety conversations are lagging behind.",
      "The AI threat and the parental disconnect",
      "Artificial intelligence has changed the nature of online scams by making them sound familiar, personal and hard to recognize. Bitwarden's data shows that 78% of parents worry their child could fall for an AI-enhanced threat, such as a voice-cloned message or a fake chat with a friend. Despite that fear, almost half of those same parents haven't talked with their kids about what an AI-powered scam might look like. The disconnect is even stronger among Gen Z parents.",
      "About 80% of them say they are afraid their child will fall victim to an AI-based scheme, yet 37% allow their kids full or nearly full autonomy online. In those households, problems are more common. Malware infections, unauthorized in-app purchases and phishing attempts appear at the highest rates among families who worry the most but monitor the least. The paradox is clear. Parents recognize the threat but fail to translate awareness into consistent action.",
      "Why parents haven't had the talk",
      "There are many reasons this important talk keeps getting delayed. Some parents simply feel unprepared to explain AI, while others assume their existing safety tools will protect their children. Only 17% of parents in the United States actively seek information about AI technologies, according to related research by Barna Group. That leaves a large majority relying on partial knowledge or outdated advice.",
      "Many parents also juggle multiple devices at home, making it difficult to track every app or game their child uses. Some overestimate how safe their own habits are, even though they admit to reusing passwords or skipping security updates. Without firsthand understanding or personal discipline, it becomes even harder to teach those lessons to children. As a result, many kids face the internet with curiosity but without proper guidance.",
      "Smart ways to protect your child online",
      "The Bitwarden findings make one thing clear: kids are getting connected younger, and scams powered by artificial intelligence are already targeting them. The good news is that parents can take practical steps right now to reduce those risks and build lasting online safety habits.",
      "Set up tablets, laptops and gaming consoles in shared family areas rather than bedrooms. When screens stay visible, you naturally become part of your child's online world. This not only encourages open conversation but also helps spot suspicious messages, fake friend requests or scam links before they cause trouble.",
      "Staying involved in your child\u2019s digital life is the best defense against today\u2019s AI threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Most devices have strong tools you can activate in minutes. Apple's Screen Time and Google Family Link let you limit screen time, approve new app installs and monitor how long your child spends on specific apps. These controls are especially useful for younger kids who, according to the Bitwarden poll, often have little supervision despite heavy device use.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Before your child installs a new game or app, take a moment to check it together. Read the reviews, look at what data it collects and confirm the developer's name. Explain why some games or \"free\" apps might ask for camera or contact access they don't need. This kind of shared review teaches healthy skepticism and helps children recognize red flags later on.",
      "AI scams thrive on weak or reused passwords. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins for each account.\u00a0Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible so that even if a password is stolen, the account stays protected.\u00a0Let your kids see how you use these tools so they learn that security isn't complicated, it's just a habit.",
      "Many parents delay important online safety talks because they feel unprepared to explain AI, leaving kids curious but without the guidance they need to stay safe. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "One of the best defenses is simple: encourage your child to pause and talk before reacting to anything unusual online. Whether it's a pop-up claiming a prize, a strange link in a chat or a voice message that sounds familiar, remind them it's always okay to ask you first. Quick conversations like these can prevent costly mistakes and turn learning moments into trust-building ones.",
      "Outdated software can leave gaps that scammers exploit. Regularly update operating systems, browsers and apps to close those holes. Add strong antivirus software. Explain to your child that updates and scans keep their favorite games and videos running safely, not just their parents happy.",
      "The best way to safeguard from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't save these conversations for when something goes wrong. Bring them up casually during family time or when watching YouTube or gaming together. Treat digital safety like any other life skill, something practiced daily and improved with time. The more normal it feels, the more confident your child becomes when facing online risks.",
      "Talking about online safety early helps build trust and awareness before trouble starts.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a parent, guardian or anyone helping a child use technology, this issue deserves your attention. Start talking early, even before your child begins exploring the web on their own. Teach them simple concepts like asking before clicking or sharing. Instead of relying only on parental controls, have ongoing conversations that help them recognize suspicious links, messages or pop-ups. Show them that cybersecurity isn't about fear but about awareness. Model strong digital habits at home by using unique passwords and turning on\u00a0two-factor authentication. Explain why those steps matter. When your child understands the reasoning behind the rules, they are more likely to follow them. Make technology part of your family routine rather than a private space your child navigates alone. Regularly check the apps they use and the people they interact with. Set clear expectations and age-appropriate boundaries that can grow with your child's experience. Staying engaged is the most powerful protection you can offer.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The numbers from Bitwarden show a clear warning sign. Concern among parents is high, yet actual conversations about AI-powered scams remain rare. That silence gives scammers the upper hand. Children who learn about online safety early are more confident, more cautious and better equipped to handle unexpected messages or fake alerts. It only takes a few minutes of honest conversation to create awareness that lasts for years. By taking action now, you can close the gap between fear and understanding, protecting your family in a digital world that changes every day.",

      "The dream of personal flight has always felt just out of reach, until now. A company called AltoVolo has unveiled something that might make it real: the world's first eVTOL configurator.",
      "That might sound technical, but it's actually simple. \"eVTOL\" stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing. Think of a small, quiet aircraft that lifts off like a helicopter but flies forward like a plane, all powered by electric or hybrid engines instead of noisy fuel-burning ones.",
      "And a configurator? It's a tool that lets you design your own version online, choosing colors, materials and other personal details. Put the two together, and you've got something quite remarkable: the ability to design your own flying vehicle from your laptop.",

      "THE WORLD'S FIRST FLYING CAR IS READY FOR TAKEOFF",
      "With AltoVolo\u2019s world-first online configurator, you can design every detail of your Sigma eVTOL. (AltoVolo)",
      "A new kind of personal aircraft",
      "AltoVolo's aircraft is called the Sigma, and it's unlike anything on the market. It's a three-seater hybrid-electric vehicle that combines quiet operation with long range. The Sigma can fly about 500 miles, reach speeds over 220 mph and is more than 80% quieter than a helicopter.",
      "That quietness isn't just about comfort; it's what makes urban air travel possible. Imagine small aircraft quietly taking off from rooftops or open fields, connecting cities and towns without the noise pollution we associate with helicopters today.",
      "Safety is built in, too. The Sigma can keep flying even if one of its small electric jet engines fails, and it carries a ballistic parachute for emergencies. It's compact and light, just under 16 feet wide and weighing a little over 2,100 pounds, making it easier to operate and store than you might expect.",
      "The Sigma is over 80% quieter than a helicopter combining sleek hybrid-electric power with quiet performance. (AltoVolo)",
      "From concept to customization",
      "The idea of customizing your own aircraft might sound futuristic, but AltoVolo's online configurator makes it surprisingly accessible.",
      "Like building your own car online, you can choose colors, seat materials, interior details and even the stitching on your seatbelts. Founder and CEO Will\u00a0Wood says the company's goal isn't to compete on price but on experience and technology.",
      "\"Much like you'd expect from a supercar brand, we're focused on performance and refinement,\" he explained.",
      "The first 100 Sigma models will be limited editions, offering special finishes and materials that won't appear on later production units.",
      "NASA'S 'QUIET' SUPERSONIC JET COMPLETES FIRST FLIGHT IN POTENTIAL BREAKTHROUGH FOR COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL",
      "Taking flight before you take off",
      "AltoVolo isn't stopping at online design. They've built a high-fidelity flight simulator that mirrors the Sigma's cockpit exactly, right down to its carbon fiber and soft leather interior.",
      "Customers can train in the simulator and even use those hours toward a pilot's license. The simulator gives them a chance to \"fly\" their customized Sigma before ever leaving the ground.",
      "And for everyone else? The company is sharing flight footage from its simulator on YouTube, so people can see how the Sigma handles in the air.",
      "\"For AltoVolo, opening our order book is a major milestone in bringing the Sigma to life,\" Wood tells CyberGuy. \"Having early customers make an initial financial commitment shows us real demand. In turn, we are able to raise capital to finalise the product, progress certification and prepare for production. Presenting the flight simulator has been a useful catalyst. Allowing customers to fly in a simulated environment really helps them realise how easy this type of aircraft will be to fly.\"",
      "An exclusive community for early Sigma owners shapes the future of personal air travel and sustainable innovation. (AltoVolo)",
      "Innovation you can feel",
      "One of the most interesting details about the Sigma is something you can't see: the sound inside the cabin. AltoVolo's engineers are working to reduce vibration and interior noise, creating a calm, smooth flight experience.",
      "At the same time, they're experimenting with a synthesized soundscape, a gentle background tone that changes with the aircraft's power use. It helps pilots sense how the vehicle is performing and adds a cinematic touch to the flying experience.",
      "It's part science, part art and a hint at how human-centered this design really is.",
      "Future pilots can train in a realistic Sigma cockpit simulator and even log hours toward a license. (AltoVolo)",
      "The path to certification",
      "The Sigma will benefit from new U.S. aviation rules called MOSAIC, which simplify the process for certifying small, advanced aircraft. This means the Sigma can be sold as a light sport aircraft, lowering costs for both the company and future pilots. Certification is also underway in Europe and the UK, which could make global operations possible in the next few years.",
      "Building a community around flight",
      "Buying a Sigma isn't just about owning an aircraft; it's about joining a new kind of community. AltoVolo wants Sigma owners to become collaborators, helping to shape the product and the future of urban flight. The company is also planning a global service and support network, including maintenance and training centers, to make ownership practical for people beyond traditional aviation circles.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For most of us, flying still means boarding a big plane at a crowded airport. But companies like AltoVolo are trying to change that. The Sigma represents a future where small, efficient aircraft could handle regional travel, connecting towns, suburbs and cities in new ways. It's the kind of innovation that could one day make air travel as personal as driving. And while it's still very early, AltoVolo's new configurator makes the dream of personal air travel feel a bit more real.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AltoVolo's Sigma may not replace your car anytime soon, but it gives us a glimpse of what's coming: a world where flight is cleaner, quieter and designed around the individual. It's a preview of how the future of travel might not be on the road at all, but instead in the air.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 07:36:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Electric vehicles overtake gas cars in total CO2 savings after just two years of driving, with emissions benefits growing over time as power grids get cleaner.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses how President Donald Trump bought a red Tesla at the White House and Democrats' reaction to it on \u2018Jesse Watters Primetime.\u2019",
      "Electric vehicles are proving their worth when it comes to long-term emissions. While building an EV creates more pollution upfront because battery production demands more energy, the balance changes fast once the car is on the road. After about two years of normal driving, an electric car overtakes a gas-powered one in total CO2 savings and keeps widening the gap over time.",
      "A peer-reviewed study published in\u00a0PLOS Climate supports this finding. Researchers Pankaj Sadavarte, Drew Shindell, and Daniel Loughlin conducted the analysis titled,\u00a0\"Comparing the climate and air pollution footprints of Lithium-ion BEVs and ICEs in the U.S. incorporating systemic energy system responses.\" Their work examined how manufacturing, fuel production and vehicle operation affect both climate and air quality over a vehicle's lifetime.",
      "POWER ON THE MOVE: IS PILOT PROGRAM THE FUTURE OF EV CHARGING?",

      "New research from PLOS Climate shows electric cars surpass gas vehicles in total CO2 savings after just two years on the road. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the study shows EVs overtake gas cars in emissions",
      "Using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), the study simulated how U.S. transportation and energy systems interact through 2050 under different rates of EV adoption. The results show that while manufacturing EVs releases about 30% more CO2 than producing gas cars, that gap closes quickly once you drive. By the end of year two, EVs emit less carbon overall, and the advantage widens over time as the power grid shifts toward cleaner energy sources.",
      "Each additional kilowatt-hour of battery capacity is projected to eliminate roughly 485 pounds of CO2 by 2030 and about 280 pounds by 2050. That reflects continued progress in electricity generation and efficiency gains across the EV industry. Over an estimated 18-year lifespan, gas-powered vehicles produce two to three and a half times more pollution-related damage than electric ones. Those damages include the social and economic costs of climate change and health issues linked to air pollution.",
      "While building EV batteries creates more emissions upfront, cleaner power grids and zero tailpipe output help electric vehicles pull ahead over time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the GCAM model works",
      "The GCAM model links global energy use, economic activity, and emissions across multiple sectors. In this analysis, researchers measured not only tailpipe emissions but also the upstream effects from mining, refining, and fuel processing. They also factored in how growing EV adoption changes the energy mix. As electricity demand rises, cleaner energy sources like wind, solar and nuclear expand their share, while coal steadily declines.",
      "By 2050, electricity generation from gas, wind and solar grows while coal falls below 6% of the total mix. This cleaner grid makes charging electric cars progressively less carbon-intensive, strengthening the case for a large-scale EV transition.",
      "The study found lifetime health and climate damages from gas cars can be up to 3.5 times higher than from EVs, underscoring the long-term benefits of going electric. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How EVs impact you and the environment",
      "If you keep a car for more than two years, switching to an EV can meaningfully reduce your carbon footprint. The study found that EVs start paying back their manufacturing emissions faster in regions with renewable-heavy grids. In states still dependent on coal, the break-even point arrives later but still occurs well before a car's third birthday. The cleaner your local power mix, the faster your EV moves into net-positive territory.",
      "INHALERS PRODUCE CARBON EMISSIONS EQUAL TO 530,000 CARS ON ROAD ANNUALLY, STUDY FINDS",
      "The findings also highlight public health benefits. Gas vehicles emit more nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, both of which contribute to respiratory illnesses and smog. As EVs replace traditional engines, these pollutants drop, improving air quality and reducing healthcare costs.",
      "Context and limitations",
      "The authors acknowledge that their analysis does not include emissions from recycling or disposing of vehicle parts at the end of life. Nor does it count emissions from building charging networks or new power infrastructure. Despite those exclusions, the study provides one of the most comprehensive long-term looks at how EV adoption affects both the economy and the environment.",
      "Because the study uses projections through 2050, results depend on future technology and energy trends. Even so, the consistent pattern across all scenarios is that EVs deliver large reductions in CO2 and air pollutants once on the road.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you drive often and plan to own your car for several years, the data shows an EV can save both emissions and money over time. Charging on a renewable or low-carbon plan speeds the payoff even more. Choosing a vehicle that matches your driving needs helps minimize unnecessary battery production and further reduces your footprint.",
      "For communities, broader EV adoption means cleaner local air, fewer health-related costs and lower long-term damage from climate change.",

The authors note that the analysis does not include emissions from recycling or charging infrastructure, yet it remains one of the most thorough long-term views of EV adoption and its effects on the economy and environment.",

      "When Joe A. from Shelton, Connecticut, received a text about a crypto investment opportunity, he thought it was his chance to rebuild after a divorce. Instead, he lost every dollar he had. Joe's story is a heartbreaking reminder of how easy it is to fall for an online investment scam that promises quick success and easy money.",

      "HOW TO STOP IMPOSTOR BANK SCAMS BEFORE THEY DRAIN YOUR WALLET",
      "After his account access vanished, scammers allegedly demanded more cash to \"reactivate\" it. By then, Joe\u2019s retirement savings were wiped out. (Gabby Jones/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How the online investment scam began",
      "In August, Joe got a message from a company calling itself\u00a0\"ZAP Solutions.\" It promised that if he invested $30,000, he'd soon have $368,000 in returns. It sounded like a smart move. Like many victims, Joe believed the pitch because it seemed professional and legitimate.",
      "But soon he was led deeper into a trap. Each \"short-term investment\" required another wire transfer. Before he knew it, Joe had sent every penny, his 401K, IRA and other investments.",
      "When the investment scam fell apart",
      "The moment Joe was locked out of his account, panic set in. The scammers demanded more money to \"reactivate\" it. By the end, Joe had lost $228,000.",
      "His mother, Carol, was devastated when she found out.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" she said. \"He showed us the screenshots, the messages. He emptied everything.\"",
      "Joe and his family filed a police report with local authorities and contacted the FBI. But, according to officers, recovery is unlikely.",
      "\"They told us there's no way to get it back,\" Carol said. \"These cyberstalkers move the money too fast.\"",
      "The bigger picture: Online investment scams are rising",
      "Joe's story isn't unique. The FBI reports that cybercriminals have stolen more than $50 billion from Americans in just five years. Scammers prey on emotion, targeting people who are hopeful, lonely or in transition.",
      "\"If it seems too good to be true, it probably is,\" Joe said, stating a phrase we all should remember.",
      "How to protect yourself from online investment scams",
      "Staying safe starts with awareness and consistent action. Cybercriminals are getting more creative, so protecting your finances means staying alert every step of the way. Follow these proven steps to safeguard your accounts and identity.",
      "Always verify any investment opportunity before sending money. Look up the company through official government or financial websites, such as the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure database or FINRA's BrokerCheck. Read reviews, confirm licenses and search for scam alerts online.",
      "If a text, email or social media message promises high returns, stop and think. Legitimate firms never cold-contact people about investment offers. Delete suspicious messages immediately and never click on links from unknown sources. Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. This can block phishing attempts, malicious downloads, and fake investment platforms designed to steal your data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Once you wire money to a scammer, recovery is nearly impossible. Never send money to someone you've only met online, even if they claim to represent a reputable company. Always confirm payment details through verified sources.",
      "Before you invest large sums, get a second opinion from a licensed financial advisor. A professional can spot red flags and unrealistic promises that you might overlook.",
      "Protect your personal information by using a data removal or privacy service that scrubs your phone number, address and other details from people search sites. This reduces the chance of scammers finding and targeting you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the Internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.

      "Joe's story is painful, but it's also powerful. His honesty may stop someone else from losing everything. Online scams thrive when people stay silent, but sharing stories like Joe's helps others stay alert.

      "A new chapter in trucking has begun. Waabi, the leader in physical artificial intelligence, has revealed a major milestone in autonomous trucking, integrating the Waabi Driver with the Volvo VNL Autonomous. Together, these technologies mark a major step toward delivering an autonomous solution that is safe and supports broad commercial deployment.",

      "AI TRUCK SYSTEM MATCHES TOP HUMAN DRIVERS IN MASSIVE SAFETY SHOWDOWN WITH PERFECT SCORES",
      "Waabi integrates its Waabi Driver with Volvo\u2019s VNL Autonomous, signaling a push toward safe, scalable Level 4 trucking. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "How this AI-powered autonomous truck was built for scale",
      "In early 2025, Waabi and Volvo Autonomous Solutions announced a long-term partnership to develop and deploy autonomous trucks.",
      "Volvo's New River Valley plant in Virginia is producing the VNL Autonomous with six critical redundant or back-up systems \u2014 including dual braking, steering, communication, computing, power, energy storage and motion control \u2014 which are key to safe operations without a driver in the seat.",
      "Waabi provides the Waabi Driver, an end-to-end AI model that learns from experience and adapts to new conditions. The company also uses its advanced simulator, Waabi World, to expose the AI to millions of realistic driving situations before it reaches the road. Waabi calls this approach \"physical AI,\" which allows it to generalize across different environments safely.",
      "\"The future of autonomous trucking depends on technology that is safe, scalable, and built for customer needs,\" said Raquel Urtasun, Founder and CEO of Waabi.\u00a0\"Together with Volvo and NVIDIA, we're leading autonomous freight into a safer and more efficient era.\"",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "Volvo\u2019s New River Valley plant builds the VNL Autonomous with six redundant systems to enable driverless operations. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "Why the AI-powered autonomous truck matters for freight",
      "The U.S. freight market continues to face growing demand and a shortage of qualified drivers. AI-powered autonomous trucks offer one of the most promising solutions to keep goods moving. By integrating the self-driving technologies of partners like Aurora Innovation and Waabi into the Volvo VNL Autonomous on the pilot line at its New River Facility in Virginia, Volvo Autonomous Solutions is able to deliver autonomous trucks with OEM-grade quality and consistency.",
      "Nils Jaeger, President of Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said the partnership is helping build the broader ecosystem needed for commercial deployment.",
      "\"Autonomy has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in the transport industry, including safety, efficiency and capacity,\" he said.",
      "The collaboration also draws strength from NVIDIA's computing platform.",
      "\"Self-driving is one of the first frontiers in which we will see physical AI become a reality,\" said Rishi Dhall, Vice President of Automotive at NVIDIA.\u00a0\"Our purpose-built compute platform complements Waabi's pioneering end-to-end verifiable trucking system, and it's coming to life on the VNL Autonomous. Level 4 autonomy in trucking is happening now.\"",
      "Concerns and challenges facing AI-powered trucks",
      "Despite the excitement, driverless freight faces real challenges. Safety remains the top concern as trucks encounter unpredictable weather, road debris and human drivers. While simulation can prepare AI for millions of events, regulators are still defining how to certify systems for nationwide deployment.",
      "The shift toward automation also raises economic questions. Trucking employs millions of drivers across the United States, and experts predict that job roles will evolve as fleets adopt autonomous systems. Labor groups and state officials are calling for retraining programs to help workers transition into new positions that support automation.",
      "Data privacy and cybersecurity are growing priorities, too. These trucks depend on constant cloud connectivity, which makes them potential targets for hackers.",
      "Public perception could also influence how fast adoption moves. Many people like the idea of innovation but hesitate to share the road with fully autonomous vehicles. Building trust will require transparency, safety trials and a strong performance record on open highways.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Volvo and Waabi say their integrated platform targets broad commercial deployment as U.S. freight demand grows. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "What comes next for the AI-powered autonomous truck",
      "Volvo and Waabi have already completed the integration of the Waabi Driver with the Volvo VNL Autonomous. The companies describe this milestone as a key step toward Level 4 autonomous operation, meaning the truck will be able to drive itself without human intervention under defined conditions.",
      "This collaboration builds on Volvo Group Venture Capital's early investment in Waabi in 2023 and its later participation in Waabi's $200 million Series B funding round in 2024. That support helped set the stage for this integration and for future broad commercial deployment.",
      "Shahrukh Kazmi, Chief Product Officer at Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said Waabi's technology fits perfectly into Volvo's platform.",
      "\"We are excited to integrate Waabi's cutting-edge system into our autonomous truck and jointly develop a safe, efficient, and scalable transport solution,\" he said.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you depend on deliveries or shop online, driverless freight could soon shape how products reach your home. These AI-powered trucks can operate longer hours than human drivers, reducing shipping delays and potentially lowering transportation costs.",
      "Automation could also make highways safer by cutting down on fatigue-related crashes. With fewer disruptions from freight incidents, travel may become smoother for everyone sharing the road.",
      "This collaboration highlights how artificial intelligence is moving from theory to production lines and changing the way goods move across America.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here:\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The road ahead for self-driving freight looks both exciting and uncertain. The progress made by AI-powered trucks shows how far automation has come in solving real challenges like driver shortages and delivery delays. At the same time, it sparks debate about safety, employment and trust in technology. As this shift continues, clear communication and responsible testing will help the public feel more confident sharing the road with these trucks. Change is already rolling out, and how we respond today will define the future of transportation.",

      "Russian state-backed hackers have stepped up their game with new malware families that hide behind fake CAPTCHA tests. The group, known as Star Blizzard or ColdRiver, now uses ClickFix attacks to trick people into launching dangerous malware disguised as a simple \"I'm not a robot\" check.",
      "These attacks represent a new wave of cyber deception, targeting governments, journalists and NGOs with malware that keeps changing faster than researchers can analyze it.",

      "The ClickFix trap: A new kind of social engineering",
      "Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) first observed the hackers using LostKeys malware in espionage operations. Once researchers exposed it, the attackers pivoted quickly, abandoning LostKeys within a week and deploying new tools: NoRobot, YesRobot and MaybeRobot.",
      "NORTH KOREAN HACKERS USE AI TO FORGE MILITARY IDS",
      "The ClickFix attack works like this: a victim lands on a fake CAPTCHA page that looks identical to the real thing. When they click to prove they're human, the system silently runs NoRobot, infecting the computer and establishing persistence via registry changes and scheduled tasks.",
      "A fake \"I\u2019m not a robot\" CAPTCHA can launch hidden malware in seconds. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Inside the Russian \"robot\" malware chain",
      "The Russian hackers built their latest attack around a chain of connected malware families that unfold step by step once a victim clicks the fake CAPTCHA.",
      "NoRobot acts as the first stage of infection. It prepares the environment by downloading files, modifying registry keys and creating tasks to ensure it stays active even after a reboot.",
      "The hackers briefly tested YesRobot, a Python-based backdoor, but dropped it quickly after realizing the full Python installation drew unwanted attention from defenders.",
      "3,000+ YOUTUBE VIDEOS DELIVER MALWARE DISGUISED AS FREE SOFTWARE",
      "MaybeRobot replaced YesRobot as a stealthier PowerShell-based tool. It can download and execute payloads, run command prompts, and send stolen data back to the attackers. Researchers say MaybeRobot's development has now stabilized, allowing the hackers to focus on refining NoRobot's stealth.",
      "How these attacks keep evolving",
      "Security analysts noticed the malware's delivery chain has shifted several times. At one point, it became\u00a0\"drastically simplified,\" only to grow complex again as the attackers began splitting cryptographic keys across multiple files. This strategy makes it harder for researchers to reconstruct how infections work. Without every piece of the puzzle, the final malware payload cannot be decrypted correctly.",
      "Who's being targeted by the Russian malware",
      "ColdRiver's operations have been linked to the Russian intelligence service (FSB), with years of activity focused on espionage and data theft. The group has consistently targeted Western governments, think tanks, media organizations and NGOs to steal sensitive information and gain strategic insight.",
      "Despite sanctions, infrastructure takedowns and public exposure, the hackers continue to evolve. Their quick shift from LostKeys to NoRobot and MaybeRobot shows a highly organized and well-funded operation capable of retooling within days.",

      "These practical steps can help you protect your data and devices from the growing wave of Russian malware using fake CAPTCHA pages to spread.",
      "Fake \"I'm not a robot\" pages are the main lure in this Russian malware campaign. If you're redirected to a CAPTCHA on an unfamiliar site or after clicking a suspicious link, stop immediately. Real CAPTCHAs usually appear only on trusted websites, not random pop-ups or login pages. When in doubt, close the page and verify the URL before taking any action.",
      "Choose reputable antivirus protection that not only scans for known malware but also monitors suspicious behavior. Since the \"Robot\" malware evolves rapidly, behavior-based detection helps stop new variants before signature updates are available. Enable automatic updates and schedule daily scans to catch infections early. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Many cyberattacks begin with publicly available data. Using a data removal or privacy protection service helps eliminate your personal information from data broker sites. By reducing what hackers can find online, you make it harder for them to tailor phishing emails or social engineering traps that lead to malware infection.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.

      "The malware used in these attacks exploits known security flaws in unpatched systems. Always apply updates as soon as they're released. Turn on automatic updates for your browser, antivirus and operating system. Outdated software is one of the easiest entry points for Russian hackers and other advanced groups.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The rise of these Russian malware campaigns is a reminder that cybercriminals are always one step ahead. What looks like a harmless \"I'm not a robot\" test can actually hide a serious threat. Protecting yourself isn't just about having antivirus software; it's about staying alert to small online details that can make a big difference. Keep your devices updated, question unexpected pop-ups, and use trusted tools to guard your personal information.

People will need to decide what balance they want between innovation and privacy and how technology should support public safety.",
      "As the pilot continues, community participation will matter more than ever. Residents, civic leaders and advocacy groups can shape how this technology develops by speaking up about clear rules, fair data use and transparency.

Scams involving criminals pretending to be bank representatives have surged, with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reporting record-breaking losses exceeding $2.9 billion in recent data.

      "Why you and others are targets",
      "Banks are trusted institutions, and scammers know it. That trust makes impersonation one of the easiest and most effective fraud tactics today. With\u00a0spoofing tools, criminals can mimic real bank phone numbers and even use AI to reproduce familiar voices. Their approach is psychological: they create panic and urgency to make victims act quickly and irrationally.",

The FTC found that losses of over $100,000 to impostor scams among people aged 60 and older have skyrocketed, from $55 million in 2020 to $445 million in 2024.

      "STATE DEPARTMENT UNVEILS PATRIOTIC 'AMERICA FIRST' REBRAND AS PART OF SWEEPING MAKEOVER",
      "President Donald Trump delivers remarks to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, on Oct. 13, 2025 in Jerusalem. (Evelyn Hockstein/Pool/Getty Images)",
      "Mike Makovsky, CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), said Israel effectively absorbs threats that would otherwise demand U.S. military action. \"Historically, there are about three reasons why we have interests in the region,\" he said. \"One is Israel. Two is oil. And three is Islamic extremism \u2014 terrorism, Shia and Sunni.\"",
      "Makovsky said it is ironic that the America First debate has resurfaced \"only a few months after Israel smoked America\u2019s Mideast enemies.\" He pointed to Iran\u2019s nuclear advances and the role of its proxies. \"They\u2019re building ballistic missiles\u2026 They could reach the eastern seaboard of the United States,\" he said. \"You marry missiles with nukes that could hit the U.S. \u2014 you\u2019ve got the North Koreans on the West Coast; do you really want Iran that could hit the East Coast?\"",
      "According to Makovsky, Israel\u2019s campaign against those threats shows the alliance\u2019s strategic value. \"What did the Israelis just do? They took care of it. The United States came in with the B-2 at the very end\u2026 but it was Israel that did all that work,\" he said.",
      "He added that Israel \"pretty much finished off Hamas,\" weakened Hezbollah \u2014 \"which has hundreds of American soldiers\u2019 blood on their hands\" \u2014 and continues to confront the Houthis to \"ensure freedom of navigation.\" That, he argued, is deterrence in action: \"As long as we support Israel, we give them some help, we give them the weapons they need, they\u2019re really doing our work.\"",
      "Fleitz called Iran \"the biggest threat,\" encompassing \"Iran and Iran\u2019s proxies in the region. This includes Hamas, Hezbollah in Syria, Iran-backed militias in Iraq, and then Iran itself, with its nuclear weapons program and its sponsorship of terror.\"",
      "He said Israel\u2019s actions have \"destroyed Hamas proxies and significantly weakened Iran,\" adding that \"we joined Israel in June in taking on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which was a threat to global security.\"",
      "Both analysts framed Iran as part of a wider axis of power alongside Russia and China, each exploiting Middle East instability to undermine U.S. influence \u2014 by fueling proxy wars, spiking energy prices, and threatening trade routes through the Gulf and the Red Sea. Fleitz said Trump\u2019s willingness to act decisively \"to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program\" exemplified using strength to prevent costlier wars later.",

The attacks targeted multiple military, scientific and residential locations, as well as senior government officials. (Stringer/Getty Images)",
      "Both agree that energy policy is where America First becomes measurable. Fleitz said that \"energy independence is a very important part of President Trump\u2019s America First policy to free Americans from high energy bills.\" At the same time, he noted, energy diplomacy abroad reinforces economic security at home. \"By pushing the Saudis \u2014 and the Saudis, I think, are happy to help us with this \u2014 to produce more oil, it may actually help us end the war in Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "Makovsky made a similar case for regional stability: \"The biggest threat to the Gulf Arab oil exporters \u2026 is Iran,\" he said. Without Israel\u2019s containment of Tehran, \"Iran would have taken over the Middle East, most likely. And if you care about oil prices, that\u2019s not too good.\"",
      "Both experts said that when Israel shoulders the burden of defending energy corridors and trade routes, Americans save in both dollars and deployments.",

      "Fleitz said Trump\u2019s doctrine is about selective force, not retreat. \"He wants to keep our country out of new and unnecessary wars, but he will use military force prudently to defend our national security,\" he said. \"He is going to avoid sending American troops into certain situations and using military force. But that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t do these things when it is in U.S. strategic interests.\"",
      "He pointed out U.S. personnel who are currently stationed in Israel but \"they\u2019re not going to Gaza\" and \"will not be engaging in combat operations against Hamas.\" Their mission, he said, fits the model of minimal footprint, maximum leverage.",
      "Makovsky warned that abandoning Israel would erode America\u2019s credibility worldwide. He recalled what a senior Arab leader once told him: \"If America doesn\u2019t help Israel attack the nuclear facilities of Iran, it will be one of the great catastrophes.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s because everybody in the Mideast, everyone in Asia, knows that the U.S.\u2013Israel relationship is one of the closest in the world,\" Makovsky said. \"If we don\u2019t help Israel, it undercuts our credibility. The Chinese and the Russians and the North Koreans know that if we\u2019re not going to support Israel, we\u2019re not going to help other allies \u2026 and it would make us more vulnerable to the Chinese without a doubt.\"",

      "Fleitz said Trump\u2019s \"20-point peace plan\" for Gaza exemplifies the America First balance between toughness and diplomacy. \"It achieved its two primary objectives, getting all the living hostages out of Israel and enacting a ceasefire,\" he said, acknowledging that \"the ceasefire is fairly shaky.\" The next step, he added, is \"an international stabilization force\" \u2014 a complex process still under negotiation.",

      "The email was apparently referencing Trump and Epstein's soured relationship. The two were friends for years, but the White House said earlier this year that Trump booted Epstein \u201cout of his club for being a creep.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After a weeks-long delay, Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., on Wednesday are on the cusp of securing enough signatures to bypass GOP leaders and force a floor vote to compel the Justice Department to release all of the files in its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz. \u2014 who won the seat of her late father in a September special election \u2014 has vowed she\u2019ll be the 218th signature on Massie and Khanna\u2019s \u201cdischarge petition\u201d after she is sworn into office at around 4 p.m. ET Wednesday.",
      "That number represents a simple majority of the entire 435-member House chamber.",
      "Under House rules, once a discharge petition hits that magic number of 218 signatures, the House must act on it, though seven legislative days must pass before a vote can be called.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that for seven-plus weeks, Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva ... decisively has been denied the ability to serve more than 800,000 people in Arizona. And why is that the case? It\u2019s because Republicans are running a pedophile protection program. They are intentionally hiding the Jeffrey Epstein files,\u201d House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cBut those days are over, because as soon as Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva becomes Congresswoman Grijalva, her first act ... is going to be to sign that discharge petition,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to force a vote on the House floor, and the American people are going to get the transparency that they deserve.\u201d",
      "The development comes on the same day that Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a new tranche of emails from Epstein to his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, and a journalist, which were provided to the panel by the Epstein estate. Epstein says in one 2019 email that Trump \u201cknew about the girls.\u201d",
      "In another email Epstein allegedly sent to Maxwell in 2011, Epstein says Trump \u201cspent hours\u201d with someone the committee says was a victim. The White House disputed the emails, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying they were \u201cselectively leaked\u201d by Democrats \u201cto create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.\u201d",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the emails.",
      "The Massie-Khanna bill, known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, would require the Justice Department to \u201cpublicly disclose all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in its possession that relate to Epstein,\u201d the convicted sex offender who died in prison in 2019 or his co-conspirator, Maxwell, who is currently serving a prison sentence.",
      "The bill contains some limited exemptions, including for personally identifiable information of victims and for classified information.",
      "It is expected to pass the House, but it still would need to clear the GOP-controlled Senate and be signed by the president to become law, which is unlikely.",
      "Grijalva was supposed to take the oath of office shortly after her Sept. 23 election victory. But the government shut down a week later, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., refused to swear in Grijalva until a handful of Senate Democrats joined Republicans in voting to reopen the government.",
      "They did so on Monday, and the House is set to pass the funding bill later Wednesday.",
      "The seven-week delay sparked Democratic protests outside the speaker\u2019s office; on one occasion, Democrats verbally sparred with Johnson himself.",
      "Grijalva becoming the 218th signature on the discharge petition marks a dramatic development in the Epstein saga, which has dogged President Donald Trump and his administration since July, when the Justice Department and FBI published a short memo stating that their Epstein records contained no \u201cincriminating \u2018client list\u2019\u201d or evidence that would lead to additional prosecution of third parties.",
      "That information was at odds with what Kash Patel himself had said about the existence of a client list before he became Trump\u2019s FBI director this year. And the fight over the Epstein files has driven a wedge between Trump and some in his MAGA base who say they want justice for Epstein\u2019s victims.",
      "\u201cWhat the hell are the House Republicans doing?\u201d Patel told conservative media personality Benny Johnson on his podcast in 2024. \u201cThey have the majority. You can\u2019t get the list? ... Put on your big boy pants and let us know who the pedophiles are!\u201d",
      "After the Trump administration\u2019s memo, Massie and Khanna began building bipartisan support for their discharge petition. As lawmakers returned from their five-week summer recess in early September, the pair held a news conference outside the Capitol with more than a half dozen women who said Epstein and Maxwell had abused them when they were minors. Some said they had been trafficked to Epstein\u2019s island in the Caribbean or his ranch in New Mexico.",
      "Four Republicans \u2014 Massie, along with Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., and Nancy Mace, R-S.C. \u2014 signed on to the discharge petition, as did all 212 Democrats.",
      "But Speaker Johnson has slammed the discharge effort as \u201creckless\u201d and unnecessary. The House Oversight Committee is already investigating the matter, he said, and has been releasing troves of records from both the government and the Epstein estate. Many of the first batch of files released by the committee had already been made public. It then released a 2003 book of congratulatory letters to mark Epstein\u2019s 50th birthday, provided to the committee by his estate.

      "The U.S. Mint struck the final 1-cent coin that will be used as legal tender on Wednesday, six months after the Trump administration announced that it would stop producing pennies because the cost of making them is almost four times more than they\u2019re worth.",
      "From now on, the only new pennies the Mint releases will be collector versions that aren't currency and will be produced \"in limited quantities,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Treasurer Brandon Beach were at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia when the coin press punched out the historic final penny, the agency confirmed.",
      "There are still an estimated 250 billion pennies in circulation, the American Bankers Association said in October.",
      "But back in February, President Donald Trump said it made no fiscal sense to keep producing cents.",
      "\u201cFor far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents,\u201d Trump wrote in an online post. \u201cThis is so wasteful! I have instructed my Secretary of the U.S. Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\u201d",
      "Officially known as the cent, the first penny was struck in 1787 and had a sundial design that was dreamt up by Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers.",
      "The U.S. Mint took over penny production in 1793, a year after Congress passed the Coinage Act.",
      "Like its predecessor, this penny was also made of copper. But it was slightly bigger and came to be known as the \u201cFlowing Hair\u201d cent because it had a woman representing liberty on one side and 15 chain links on the other side.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until 1909 that the woman was replaced by President Abraham Lincoln in profile to mark what would have been his 100th birthday.",
      "The Mint said that ending penny production will save taxpayers about $56 million annually. And it will continue to be legal tender for as long as it's around.",
      "That said, the penny is not worth much. You can\u2019t even buy penny candy, which made its debut in 1896, with just a penny.",
      "But its cultural value is incalculable.",
      "Stingy people still \u201cpinch pennies.\u201d An unexpected windfall is still referred to as \u201cpennies from heaven.\u201d And a fiscal planner who is \u201cpenny wise and pound foolish\u201d should be avoided.",
      "But after Wednesday, the penny once saved and cherished will be the penny spurned, rather than earned."

      "A Life-Changing Moment for a Small Business",
      "The Elbaums are the latest small business owners to experience the \"Taylor Swift effect,\" referring to the singer's cultural and economic influence. Other examples include the NFL's increase in female viewership after Swift started dating Kelce and jewelry designer Kindred Lubeck's explosion in social media followers after Kelce proposed with one of her rings.",

      "\"I appreciate what she does to all small businesses, not just ours. It's really a special thing to see,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says.",
      "A Launchpad for a 'New Phase'",
      "The Elbaums started Audry Rose in 2015 shortly after Jaclyn Elbaum's grandmother, the brand's namesake, passed away.",
      "\"She started in the clothing industry and was entrepreneurial before that was really a thing for women. She was really ahead of her time and I always looked up to her. She was always a role model for me. Quality of things was always very important to her, so we wanted that to be infused into the brand,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says.",

      "Before Paul began filming the dating series, Ngatikaura had the opportunity to bestow some advice on her friend.",
      "\"I was kind of on the journey with her leading up to her leaving. She hadn\u2019t really watched the show, and I grew up watching it. So I feel like I gave her a lot of advice just from being a viewer on what to expect,\" she says.",
      "Paul's on-and-off relationship with Dakota Mortensen has been a focal point in the first two seasons of \u201cThe Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,\u201d which returns for Season 3 on Nov. 13.",
      "After calling it quits with Mortensen, Paul was ready to move on when she began filming \"The Bachelorette,\" Ngatikaura says.",

      "Paul, who was previously married to Tate Paul, went public with her relationship with Mortensen in 2022 amid a soft swinging scandal that rocked the #MomTok community.",
      "In a TikTok Live video, Paul admitted that she and her ex-husband had engaged in soft swinging with other members of the group. The show's other cast members denied the allegations.",
      "Paul later introduced her followers to Mortensen as the man she \u201ccheated with\u201d during the soft swinging scandal. The couple's son, Ever, was born in 2024.",
      "Throughout their relationship, Paul and Mortensen navigated cheating rumors and what some members of Paul's family described as a volatile communication style.",
      "In the Season 2 reunion special, Paul said she and Mortensen had broken up and were working on themselves."

      "The series, whose first two episodes premiered on Nov. 7, tells the story of Carol Sturka (Rhea Seehorn), a grumpy romance-fantasy author who finds herself among the dozen or so people tasked with saving the world after an alien virus puts everyone else into a happy hive mind.",

For most of the way it\u2019s Seehorn\u2019s show, and she\u2019s marvelous \u2014 running through a range of emotions, confused, clever, resigned and determined by turns, as she navigates (as they say in the comics) a world she never made, an angry person beating against a sea of contentment, a complicated person in a one-speed society.\u201d",
      "Nicholas Quah of Vulture also urged viewers to stick with the series, writing, \u201cYou owe it to yourself to give \u2018Pluribus\u2019 a chance. Something glorious is gestating inside this entrancing piece of television, and to experience its full effect, you have to trust the process.\u201d",
      "Chase Hutchinson of the Seattle Times praised the series for asking challenging questions.",
      "\u201cThe more it goes on, the more \u2018Pluribus\u2019 becomes a show of immense, urgent feeling, one that grapples with the terrors of growing numb to loss. It\u2019s about survival versus resistance, compliance versus conflict, fantasy versus reality, and whether a false happiness is worth losing all of who you were for.",
      "\u201cCarol is a bit of a grump,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut she\u2019s our grump, a graceful sliver of humanity\u2019s complexity in a world that\u2019s seeking to flatten it.\u201d",
      "What Have Fans Said About \u2018Pluribus\u2019?",
      "Fan reviews on Rotten Tomatoes have also been mostly glowing. The show currently boasts an 84% rating from audiences at home.",
      "\u201cVince Gilligan is the greatest TV writer/show runner of the Gen X cohort. The pilot is original, riveting, mysterious, funny and tragic, all at the same time. I cannot remember being so engaged in a story, at least since his last masterpiece, \u2018Better Call Saul,\u2019\u201d wrote one.",
      "\u201cI was hooked from the beginning. Kept up the pace. Kept up the excitement so far threw (sic) the first 2 episodes ... The acting is superb! Finally something exciting to watch! Thank you,\u201d another agreed.",
      "Not all viewers were happy with \u201cPluribus.\u201d A handful said they were disappointed by the show and confused by all its glowing reviews.",
      "\u201cI went in knowing nothing about this show plus I\u2019m a massive sci-fi fan but I just don\u2019t understand the hype here,\u201d wrote one in part, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s like people\u2019s body were taken over and forced to give 5 stars.\u201d"

      "Now, ahead of its Season 2 premiere, Sylvia tells TODAY.com that for the new episodes, he \u201cwanted to continue to explore the ideas of sisterhood and female friendship and how women bond together in times of adversity to make their way in the world.\u201d",
      "The Season 1 finale of \u201cPalm Royale\u201d was filled with high fashion, an emotional musical performance by Maxine, as well as lies, betrayal, attempted murder and... perhaps an unexpected death?",
      "Throughout the 10 episodes, viewers saw how Chattanooga-native, former beauty pageant contestant Maxine made it her mission to infiltrate the Palm Beach high society and become one of them, despite her humble beginnings. With her husband Douglas (Josh Lucas) by her side \u2014 and his wealthy and incapacitated aunt Norma Dellacorte\u2019s funds and fashion \u2014 she almost got away with it.",
      "It hasn\u2019t been an easy ride if you add Maxine\u2019s love-hate relationship with bartender/pool boy/Norma\u2019s caretaker Robert Diaz (Ricky Martin) and torn-then-repaired friendship with Linda (Laura Dern), who happened to be Douglas\u2019 ex-fianc\u00e9e.",

      "Evelyn discovers that Norma is back in good health and might be up to something, including getting rid of Maxine. Maxine confronts Norma and tells her she is turning her house into a nightclub.",
      "Norma\u2019s life story is recounted at the Beach Ball, but some things don\u2019t add up. Robert asks Axel why things didn\u2019t work out with him and Norma back in the day. Axel shares how after Norma\u2019s dad died she found her boarding school roommate dead at the bottom of the stars. \u201cAgnes was diabetic,\u201d he says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t live long back in those days, at least not without a lot of money.\u201d",
      "Axel continues by sharing how he followed Norma back to Palm Beach but she cut him out of her life. \u201cShe was a completely different person,\u201d Axel says, which leaves Robert disturbed and pondering about who the real Norma is.",
      "Mitzi, after confiding in Norma, tells Maxine that she is pregnant. Maxine tells Mitzi she should tell the father of the baby that he needs to marry her and take responsibility.",
      "Things start to unravel right before Maxine\u2019s performance of \u201cIs That All There Is\u201d when she\u2019s on stage and sees Mitzi go up to Douglas, who turns out to be the father of her child. Norma mischievously smiles while on the side of the stage.",

      "What Happens With Maxine and Douglas?",
      "Sylvia says that they\u2019re planning to address the couple\u2019s \u201ccomplicated future\u201d in a potential second season.",
      "\u201cI think like a lot of marriages that go through hard things, where one partner has been basically awful to the other, it\u2019s not so easy to just walk away from a 20-year relationship that is based on love,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope what we\u2019ve built, between Kristen and Josh\u2019s characters, a complicated relationship that people can actually really relate to.\u201d",
      "Lucas also tells TODAY.com that he believes Douglas is still \u201chead over heels in love\u201d with Maxine.",
      "\u201cI think he absolutely loves her. I think he\u2019s confused as to why she would want to go back to this place that he thinks is awful,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then once he realizes he has staff and he has access to money that he hasn\u2019t had, it becomes just a great challenge. A fun challenge for him. But, I think he totally loves her.\u201d",
      "When asked why he thinks Douglas was unfaithful, he laughs as if caught in a lie. The actor chalked it up to \u201ca lot of alcohol and a crazy night.\u201d",
      "What Does Mitzi\u2019s Future Look Like?",
      "Gerber tells TODAY.com that Mitzi \u201cgenuinely loves\u201d Maxine and doesn\u2019t want to hurt her and \u201cwishes her situation was completely separate.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think in this situation, Maxine is the person that she would have wanted to go to for help and advice,\u201d Gerber says. \u201cThat\u2019s maybe why she feels so isolated and therefore is making decisions that she doesn\u2019t even fully understand.\u201d",
      "Gerber hopes that Mitzi pulls through this difficult situation.",
      "\u201cI hope she\u2019s OK. I have so much empathy for her. I hope she\u2019s learning her lessons, and unfortunately, she\u2019s learning the hard way. It really devastated me to have to leave things like that between Maxine and Mitzi,\u201d she says, adding that Mitzi really loved Maxine in her own way.",
      "The actor and model said it \u201cbroke her heart to see these two people who we see really caring about each other and trying to lift each other up ... and you see them hurting each other. I think that was a very painful thing. So I hope that there is an opportunity for (reconciliation).\u201d",
      "Who Is the Real Norma? Who is Agnes?",
      "Sylvia says the big Norma/Agnes reveal has been a long time coming.",
      "He points to the ninth episode where Norma tells Robert she needs \u201chelp with certain tasks, but that she expects discretion, and it\u2019s surrounding the care of her diabetes. She didn\u2019t want anybody to know that she had a weakness.\u201d Her diabetes is brought up later in the episode where Robert tells Linda that Norma is diabetic.",
      "In episode eight, he says, Axel asks Norma why she ghosted him and that she became \u201ca completely different person.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything really has for the last three episodes been leading up to this revelation that only Robert has put together because of the intimate knowledge he has of Norma and her diabetes,\u201d Sylvia explains.",
      "\u201cSo when Axl says, \u2018Yes, Agnes, she was a diabetic, they didn\u2019t live long back in those days. At least not without a lot of money.\u2019 I think Robert isn\u2019t completely sure of himself until he says \u2018Agnes\u2019 to Norma. She says, \u2018Why did you call me that?\u2019 and then, \u2018Oh my gosh, that secret might die with Robert.\u2019\u201d",
      "Sylvia noted the ironies of Norma\u2019s secret because throughout the entire season, Maxine has been trying to fit in and feels like an imposter.",
      "\u201cBut Norma is the biggest impostor of all,\u201d he says.",
      "Why Didn\u2019t Virginia Get Arrested By the Cops?",
      "Virginia finds Linda locked inside the library in her house after Mary locked her in there. As she opens the door, she gets locked inside as well. Linda asks her why she didn\u2019t get arrested along with the rest of their feminist group.",
      "Robinson tells TODAY.com that Virginia has worked very hard to be where she is.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd those friends in high places come in handy throughout the season. I can\u2019t give away too much about that. But I will say that she has connections,\u201d teased Robinson.",
      "The mystery continued with Sylvia simply adding, \u201cYou have to wait and see.\u201d",
      "However, when pressed, he teased, \u201cVirginia, just like everybody else on this show, has secrets \u2014 and we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d"

Rini\u2019s launch consisted of \"everyday\" face masks in the shape of a puppy, unicorn or panda, a hydrating hydrogel facial mask and an after-sun hydrogel facial mask. The facial sheets contain ingredients like vitamin E, vitamin B12 and aloe vera.",

      "What are consumers saying about the brand's launch and what do dermatologists think? We're breaking it all down below.",
      "What Is Rini?",
      "Shay Mitchell first teased her new company Rini on Instagram Nov. 5 by posting a photo of a child using a face mask. The company formally launched the next day.",
      "\"This has been three years in the making, inspired by my girls, their curiosity, and all the little moments that made me realize how early it starts. From birthday parties and face paint to wanting to do 'what mommy does' with her face masks\u2026 it was only a matter of time,\" Mitchell wrote on Instagram.",
      "Mitchell explained that she and her close friend and business partner Song specifically came up with the idea for the aloe vera recovery mask when they saw Song's daughter\u2019s skin after a day in the sun.",
      "\u201cI wanted something that worked, but was still clean enough for my kids and now it\u2019s finally here,\u201d Mitchell, who is a mom to 6-year-old Atlas and 3-year-old Rome, said. \u201cKids are naturally curious and instead of ignoring that, we can embrace it. With safe, gentle products parents can trust, and sweet moments that bring us closer.\u201d",
      "On Rini's website, they added that they \"created Rini because we wanted products that are gentle, trust-worthy, and inspire creativity.\"",

      "\"The ingredients in these masks are crazy. They actually shouldn\u2019t be used for kids at all,\" she said.",
      "A press release for the launch said that Rini's formulas were developed with pediatric chemists and labs in South Korea and the brand\u2019s \u201cproprietary formulas reflect the brand\u2019s \u2018rini promise\u2019 of transparency, safety, and quality to redefine play for Little Faces with Big Imaginations.\u201d",
      "The brand claims that its products are dermatologist-tested, EU-complaint, hypoallergenic, vegan and cruelty free.",

      "\"The only face product a child needs is sunscreen, this is wild!\" another added.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m genuinely concerned by this. kids don\u2019t need hydrogel masks or actives. their skin barrier is already healthy and still developing. this kind of \u2018early skincare\u2019 marketing really blurs the line between care and consumerism. do better,\" a third wrote.",
      "Representatives for Mitchell did not respond to TODAY.com's request for comment by the time of publication.",

      "Many young \"skinfluencers\" have emerged on social media and built large followings by filming videos about their skin care routines and product faves.",
      "Naiya, an 11-year-old skinfluencer on TikTok, spoke to TODAY and said she's \"learned a lot about skin care and makeup\" by filming TikTok videos.",

      "Do Kids Need Skin Care Products? We Asked  Dermatologists",
      "TODAY.com spoke with two dermatologists to get their thoughts on the rising trend of child skin care. Here's what they had to say.",
      "Rini\u2019s website lists out the ingredients featured in the kids\u2019 skin care products. The after-sun face mask includes aloe vera and chamomile; the hydrating mask is made with vitamin B12, glycerin and red algae extract; and the \u201ceveryday\u201d mask features  vitamin E, white tremella mushroom and beta-glucan.",
      "Dermatologist Dr. Fatima Fahs, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of the practice Dermy Doc Institute, tells TODAY.com that kids \u201cdon\u2019t really need to be using any of these ingredients.\u201d",
      "That's because the derm says kids\u2019 skin is typically balanced on its own and \u201cnot problematic.\u201d",
      "Fahs says kids\u2019 skin \u201cneeds very basic things.\u201d Children\u2019s skin barriers are \u201calready very healthy and resilient,\u201d she adds.",
      "Aloe vera is a calming ingredient that can be used after sun exposure, she says. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps support the skin barrier, though she says it\u2019s not needed topically.",
      "Similarly, Fahs says that vitamin B12 is \u201cnot necessarily proven to have any topical benefits on the skin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt can reduce inflammation overall, but most kids are getting vitamin B12 in their normal diet, so it\u2019s not something that necessarily needs to be applied on the skin,\u201d Fahs says.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re already potentially pushing the agenda that kids\u2019 skin needs to be fixed, then we\u2019re potentially highlighting imperfections for kids at a really young age. ... It\u2019s kind of blurring the lines of self-care and promoting this idea that their skin is not already perfect,\u201d Fahs says.",
      "Rini was \u201ccreated for growing faces ... to hydrate, soothe and recover\u201c and is intended for kids ages 3 and up, according to the brand\u2019s product pages.",
      "Dr. Rosemarie Ingleton, a board-certified dermatologist, says parents don't need to rush their children into a skin care routine.",
      "\"At age 3, the only thing I think we should be considering is getting them into a little habit of being clean and just (hygienic),\" she says, adding that masks and scrubs aren't necessary for young children.",
      "Per Ingleton, children don't need to use preventative skin care products until the onset of puberty.",
      "\"Wait until there is an issue when their skin actually changes.  Then you are targeting their skin with specific products,\" she says.",
      "Fahs seconds that sentiment and advises parents to consider introducing a skin care routine once their kids start to show signs of puberty in their pre-teen years.",
      "At this stage, children might notice an increase in oiliness in their skin, or \u201clittle bumps on the skin toward the end of the day.\u201d Generally, this change can occur between the ages of 8 and 13, with 8 being on the earlier side, Fahs says.",
      "\u201cIntroducing a gentle cleanser, a gentle moisturizer and a broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen is a great routine to encourage,\u201d Fahs says. \u201cIf I see patients in the office starting to have these changes, the very first thing I\u2019ll try to get them into the habit of doing is just washing their face with a gentle cleanser daily. Sometimes that\u2019s all they need.\u201d",
      "Overall, Fahs says she is seeing more marketing geared toward children, \u201cwhether that\u2019s intentional or not,\u201d and is seeing children come into her clinic \u201cwith more reactive skin barriers now or with problems they didn\u2019t have before starting a routine.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough I\u2019m all for healthy routines and habit building, especially in children, this almost takes it to the next level where it becomes harmful,\u201d she says.",
      "Fahs says that children's skin \u201cisn\u2019t just like a smaller version of adult skin.\u201d Rather, it is already \u201cnaturally balanced.\u201d",
      "\u201cChildren don\u2019t need these seven step routines, or these complicated products,\u201d Fahs says. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking to do some healthy habit building for your kids, the number one thing should just be encouraging them to wear a daily sunscreen before going outside to play.\u201d",
      "She adds, \u201cA lot of this is being disguised in this idea of self-care, but I find that self-care for children is encouraging them to go outside and play or be with their friends, and it\u2019s not standing in front of the mirror or putting on a sheet mask.\u201d",
      "During a live segment on TODAY on Nov. 10, NBC\u2019s Stephanie Gosk said the dermatologists she spoke to suggested avoiding skin care products with harsh ingredients, including retinol, fragrance and artificial dyes. They also suggested steering clear of scrubs, which can irritate skin.",
      "The dermatologists Gosk spoke to recommended seeking out products that say they're dermatologist-tested, hypoallergenic, calming and gentle. Ingredients like oatmeal, aloe vera and chamomile are good.",
      "\"But again, it is a conversation with your kids about what they actually need. And remember that they are going to see this stuff, so you do have to talk about it probably,\" she said."

      "Born in 1942 in Chicago, John Wayne Gacy was a building contractor who also dressed as \"Pogo the Clown\" for children's parties.",
      "According to History.com, he had a relatively normal middle-class upbringing, though there were accounts that he had an abusive alcoholic father. He got married in 1964 to Marlynn Myers, whose father owned a couple of Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises in Waterloo, Iowa. As seen in \"Devil in Disguise,\" Gacy managed one of the restaurants. He was later charged and sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting one of his male employees in 1968. He was released early due to good behavior.",
      "Gacy and Myers had two children together, Michael and Christine, before they divorced following his charges.",
      "After his release, he moved back to Chicago and remarried Carole Hoff. Once there, he started his construction business and clown work.",
      "What Did John Wayne Gacy Do?",
      "From 1972 to 1978, Gacy lured young men and boys, oftentimes for sex before murdering them and burying them in his home's crawl space.",
      "His murders would go undetected for years until December 1978 when police started investigating the disappearance of 15-year-old teenager named Robert Piest.",
      "How Did John Wayne Gacy Get Caught?",
      "Robert Piest was last seen with Gacy. \u201cDevil in Disguise\u201d shows how he would lure young men with hopes of a construction job, taking him to his home before he killed them.",
      "Piest went missing on his mother Elizabeth Piest's birthday, when he never returned home for dinner.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot out there about Elizabeth, which is good for the Piest family, which I think really valued their privacy,\u201d Ireland tells TODAY.com about portraying the victim\u2019s mother. \u201cFor me, I focused on just telling a story of a woman who was going through this very sudden and intense grief.\u201d",
      "Police began to look into Gacy after learning of his prior conviction. After obtaining a search warrant for his Norwood Park home, they discovered a foul smell and items from other missing men.",
      "According to NBC Chicago, Gacy's then-lawyer Sam Amirante shared in his book \u201cJohn Wayne Gacy: Defending a Monster,\u201d that Gacy confessed to him that Robert Piest was dead and \u201che\u2019s in the Des Plaines River.\u201d",
      "Gacy would go on to detail each of his murders and where he buried or dumped the bodies.",
      "\u201cHe went on, murder by murder, piece by piece, burial by burial,\u201d Amirante wrote. \u201cHe wanted to prove that what he was saying was true. He wanted to take us to his house and show us the burial ground.\u201d",
      "In 1979, Gacy was arrested in Cook County, Illinois. Police continued to find bodies in Gacy's home, as well as the river where he said he disposed of the victims.",
      "What Happened to John Wayne Gacy?",
      "In March of 1980, Gacy was convicted of murdering 33 young men, who ranged from 14 to 21. He was sentenced to death and transferred to death row in the then-new downstate Menard Correctional Center, according to the Chicago Tribune.",
      "More victims continued to be identified as the months and years went by. In 1985, an appeal was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court, upholding Gacy's death sentence.",
      "Gacy was executed by lethal injection at Stateville Correctional Center in 1994.",
      "Five of his victims recovered from his residence remain unidentified. According to the Cooks County Sheriff\u2019s Department, officials tested the remains using the latest technology and DNA profiles suitable for comparison have been obtained.",
      "\u201cI really hope that (with this show) we can start to talk about changing the narrative around dehumanizing people who aren\u2019t like ourselves,\u201d Chernus says. \u201cI really think we are trying to, in a way, address the systemic biases that allowed Gacy to get away with this for so long. And there are still unidentified victims that I hope, in some way, maybe this show allows someone to call in a tip.\u201d",
      "The PD stated that after Gacy\u2019s arrest, they learned that some of his victims were never reported missing by their families. At the time, many were estranged from the victims or were unaware that they were missing.",
      "The department is still accepting information from people who believe their friends or family members might have been one of Gacy\u2019s victims."

      "Used on an almost nightly basis in the war in Ukraine, a spate of mysterious drone incursions above airports and sensitive sites has also highlighted Europe\u2019s vulnerability to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and sparked alarm that NATO nations are unprepared to defend themselves from the cheap but effective weaponry.",
      "As a result, European leaders have backed plans for a \u201cdrone wall,\u201d a network of sensors and weapons to detect, track and neutralize intruding UAVs, and in Riga, the team at a small tech company called Origin is on the forefront of this new, high-tech battleground.",

    "story": [
      "Fears over dependency on Chinese technology have reached an unlikely corner of the West: the previously serene and efficient world of Scandinavian public transportation.",
      "European nations have become increasingly worried that their vast amounts of Chinese-built infrastructure could be weaponized \u2014 tampered with, immobilized or even commandeered \u2014 if tensions were to rise with Beijing.",
      "Now, bus providers in Denmark and Norway say they are urgently investigating and remedying what they say is a security loophole discovered in their fleets of vehicles made by Yutong, a company based in Zhengzhou, China, that is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of buses by sales volume.",
      "Because these buses can receive updates and diagnostic tests \u201cover the air,\u201d they can be \u201cstopped remotely, either by the manufacturer or by a hacker,\u201d Jeppe Gaard, chief operating officer of the Danish public transport provider Movia, told NBC News in an email Wednesday.",
      "\u201cElectric buses, like electric cars, in principle can be remotely deactivated if their software systems have online access,\u201d he said. This isn\u2019t just a \u201cChinese bus concern; it is a challenge for all types of vehicles and devices with these kinds of electronics built in,\u201d Gaard added.",
      "In Denmark, Movia\u2019s fleet includes 262 Yutong buses, which have been phased in since 2019 across a network that covers the capital, Copenhagen, and the east of the country, Movia said.",
      "The alarm was first raised earlier this month by the Norwegian bus operator Ruter, which runs half of the country\u2019s public transport, including in Oslo, the capital.",
      "Ruter performed underground tests \u201cinside a mountain\u201d on two buses: the Yutong model and one from the Dutch manufacturer VDL.",
      "While the Dutch buses \u201cdo not have the capability for autonomous software updates over the air,\u201d Yutong \u201chas direct digital access to each individual bus for software updates and diagnostics,\u201d it said.",
      "In theory, \u201cthis bus can be stopped or rendered inoperable by the manufacturer,\u201d it said, although Yutong wouldn\u2019t be able to remotely drive these vehicles.",
      "Asked for comment on the Danish and Norwegian moves, Yutong sent an emailed statement saying that it \u201cunderstands and highly values the public\u2019s concerns regarding vehicle safety and data privacy protection,\u201d and \u201cstrictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.\u201d",
      "It said its vehicle data in the European Union is stored in an Amazon Web Services data center in Frankfurt, Germany, where it is \u201cprotected by storage encryption and access control measures,\u201d and that \u201cwithout customer authorization, no one is allowed to access or operate the system.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "This is just the latest episode in Europe\u2019s complex relationship with China: deeply reliant on Beijing\u2019s trade and increasing know-how, but critical of its alleged cyber-aggression, rampant intellectual property theft and human rights violations.",
      "Even as hope rises for a new trade agreement between China and the E.U., there are grave concerns over plans for a new mega-embassy in London and a lingering scandal over the collapse of an alleged spying case at the heart of Westminster.",
      "Meanwhile, the Dutch government has seized control of the Chinese chipmaker Nexperia, in a saga that has raised fears that car production could come to a halt on the Continent.",
      "Even more so than the United States, European nations have relied on China for critical infrastructure \u2014 only to conclude that it poses a problem if and when relations go south.",
      "A number of European governments have torn out 5G networks made by the Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE \u2014 under pressure from Washington \u2014 because of fears they could be used by Beijing to compromise Western national security.",
      "Today\u2019s hot-button issue is Chinese electric vehicles, which are effectively blocked from sale in the U.S. but whose market share is ballooning in Europe, doubling to 5.1% in the first half of 2025 from last year, according to the auto consultancy JATO Dynamics.",
      "As with other Western concerns, China has roundly rejected that its EVs and other technologies present a security risk.",
      "In January, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned American moves to block Chinese tech from the U.S. auto market, accusing it of \u201coverstretching the concept of national security\u201d and calling for Washington to \u201cstop going after Chinese companies,\u201d spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a daily news briefing.",
      "But plenty of security and intelligence officials are concerned.",
      "Western nations had \u201cthe whole problem with Huawei and 5G, and you\u2019ve now got a similar problem in Chinese electric cars: that they can all be immobilized at a switch from the manufacturer,\u201d the former head of Britain\u2019s MI6 intelligence agency, Richard Dearlove, told NBC News in an interview earlier this year.",

      "In reality, this is also true of any electric vehicle \u2014 including those made by Tesla, for example \u2014 and many other items reliant on internet connectivity, said Ken Munro, founder of the British American cybersecurity consultancy Pen Test Partners.",
      "In Norway, Ruter, the electric bus operator, said it had carried out several fixes, including stricter controls on future bus purchases, \u201cfirewalls\u201d to protect against hackers, and \u201ccollaborating with national and local authorities on clear cybersecurity requirements.\u201d",
      "Are experts convinced this will work?",

      "Munro questioned whether China would actually want to exploit a potential vulnerability like the one identified in the Scandinavian buses.",
      "\u201cDo we believe that China would destroy its entire export industry for vehicles, EVs or not, in order to prove a political and military point? It is within the bounds of plausibility,\u201d but the chances are \u201cincredibly small,\u201d Munro said.",
      "\u201cIt just comes down to trust,\u201d he added."

      "LONDON \u2014 It\u2019s been a strange sort of prison break: no daring escapes, no Hollywood getaways \u2014 just inmates quietly released, by mistake, onto the streets of Britain.",
      "What once might have been an isolated blunder comes at an unwelcome time in a country strained by rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "One man, an Algerian sex offender, was arrested in London on Friday after being freed in error nine days earlier; another, a British national and convicted fraudster, accidentally released from the same prison shortly afterward and turned himself in on Thursday.",
      "Their cases followed the mistaken release of a convicted sex offender from a separate prison in October, which sparked a three-day manhunt before he was rearrested.",
      "At least four prisoners released in error over the past year remain at large, the BBC reports. More than 260 were wrongly released in England and Wales in the year to March, official data shows \u2014 more than double the figure the year before.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy said on X Friday that he was \u201cappalled at the rate of releases in error,\u201d and had ordered \u201ctough new release checks, launched an investigation, and started overhauling archaic prison systems.\u201d",
      "He told Parliament on Wednesday that the opposition Conservative Party, whose 14-year spell in government was ended by Prime Minister Keir Starmer last year, had \u201cleft our prisons on the brink of collapse entirely.\u201d",
      "But the recent litany of errors coincides with the ruling Labour Party battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity.",
      "British prisons have been in a state of crisis for several years, with the prison population more than doubling in size since 1990, while staffing and infrastructure struggle to keep pace.",
      "The Algerian offender, Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, 24, was mistakenly let out on Oct. 29, though police say they weren\u2019t informed until nearly a week later. He was rearrested for being unlawfully at large and on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker in connection with an earlier incident.",
      "As officers bundled him into a van, he offered his own verdict on the system that lost track of him: \u201cLook at the justice of the U.K., they release people by mistake,\u201d he said in a video aired by NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News.",
      "It\u2019s a throwaway line, but it lands with an uncomfortable truth. In a country where little seems to function as it should \u2014 from the courts to the National Health Service to the trains \u2014 even the prisons can\u2019t quite manage to keep the doors locked.",
      "Years of budget cuts are \u201ccatching up\u201d with Britain\u2019s public services, according to Glen O\u2019Hara, a professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University.",
      "\u201cThe whole system of social care, for instance, is completely overwhelmed,\u201d he told NBC News on Saturday, adding that Britain\u2019s prisons had been swamped by a large number of short prison sentences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just overwhelming the system that can\u2019t cope economically with all these numbers,\u201d he said.",
      "Last summer, the men\u2019s prison system was nearly filled to capacity with only a hundred or so empty places, a crisis that triggered the government\u2019s emergency release scheme, allowing some inmates to leave after serving 40% of their sentence instead of the usual 50%. Introduced to ease overcrowding, the policy has since seen nearly 40,000 prisoners released early, Ministry of Justice figures show.",
      "Staffing issues have also plagued the services. In the year to June, nearly 13% of staff left British prisons, according to data from the Prison and Probation Service.",
      "Prison officers said a clerical error meant there was no warrant from the court to hold Kaddour-Cherif, and he was let go. William Smith, the convicted fraudster, was released as a result of a clerical error at the court level, the BBC reports.",
      "Wandsworth prison, where Smith and Kaddour-Cherif were released, was built in 1851 to house fewer than 1,000 prisoners. An August 2024 report by the prison\u2019s independent monitoring board found inmate numbers had grown to 1,513.",
      "\u201cWings were chaotic and staff across most units were unable to confirm where all prisoners were during the working day,\u201d the report said.",
      "The Victorian-era prison, one of many still in use dating back to the 1800s, has previously been the scene of high-profile escapes. Wandsworth made headlines in 2023 when former British soldier Daniel Khalife escaped by clinging to the underside of a lorry while awaiting trial for espionage and terrorism offenses.",
      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that the recent cases \"further expose the scale of the crisis in our prisons we inherited,\" adding: \"This will not be fixed overnight, but we are using every possible lever to bear down on these errors.\"",
      "For all the headlines and investigations, the mistakes continue to pile up in a country struggling to hold itself together, one unlocked gate at a time."

      "The journey from the RSF-controlled city of el-Fasher to the town of Tawila is just 30 miles, but nonetheless perilous as gunmen rove around, robbing people, taking them hostage and in some cases slaughtering them by the dozen, the organizations say.",
      "Under international pressure, the RSF said Thursday that it was willing to engage in a U.S.-brokered humanitarian ceasefire. But the Sudanese military, which it has been fighting since April 2023, has yet to agree to a truce, and the State Department has said it is still working to get both parties to agree to a pause in the fighting amid warnings from the humanitarian organizations that the northeast African nation is returning to its genocidal past.",
      "While talks are ongoing, eyewitness accounts, videos shared to social media and an analysis of satellite imagery that has shown pools of blood visible from space have revealed the scale of the killing in the region and the increasing use of drone strikes by both sides as they seek to gain an advantage on the battlefield.",

      "The issue has become a major story in the U.K. where Prime Minister Keir Starmer told lawmakers at the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session in parliament on Wednesday: \"I believe in a strong and independent BBC. Some would rather the BBC didn't exist ... I'm not one of them.\"",
      "He added, however, that \"where mistakes are made they do need to get their house in order.\"",

Trump said he was stopping all U.S. aid to the country and told reporters he would soon announce new tariffs on Colombia.",
      "Moreno wanted to encourage Trump to take a more targeted approach \u2014 directly aimed at Petro. To do so, the senator brought along a document titled \u201cThe Trump Doctrine For Colombia and the Western Hemisphere.\u201d In addition to five policy ideas, the one-page outline featured large images of Petro and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the president of Venezuela, in orange prison jumpsuits. The images appear to be generated by artificial intelligence. NBC News obtained the memo from a person familiar with the episode.",
      "Now that document is at the center of an even further strain in diplomatic relationships between Colombia and the U.S.",
      "On Sunday, the publication Cambio Colombia first reported on the existence of the document when it discovered that the White House had posted a photo from the Oct. 21 event showing James Blair, a deputy chief of staff, holding Moreno\u2019s memo.",
      "Petro posted on X that he was recalling the Colombian ambassador to the U.S. for the second time in a month and demanding to know why he is being portrayed \u201cas if I were a prisoner,\u201d calling the print-out \u201ca brutal disrespect\u201d to his supporters and nation.",
      "And on Monday, Colombian Foreign Minister Rosa Villavicencio told journalists in Santa Marta that her government had \"sent verbal notes to the United States through our diplomatic representation\" to \"request clarification regarding\" Moreno's memo.",
      "The episode also marks the latest chapter in the use of fake images in politics. The Trump administration has made extensive use of AI-generated images and videos in online political messaging, with the president himself often sharing them on social media.",
      "The White House directed NBC News to Moreno\u2019s office for comment. Moreno\u2019s office declined to comment.",
      "Moreno, who was born in Bogota and immigrated to the U.S. as a child, is among a few lawmakers advocating on Colombia policy to the president. A Treasury Department official told NBC News that both Moreno and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who endorsed Trump\u2019s call to impose new tariffs on the South American nation, have been backchanneling on Colombia to the White House for a while, with their advocacy culminating at the Rose Garden lunch in October. This person, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been heavily involved as well.",
      "Tensions between the two nations have risen in recent months with the U.S. building up its military deployment in the Caribbean in an effort to target Venezuela. U.S. forces have killed dozens aboard boats officials say are trafficking drugs into the U.S. as lawmakers in both parties have called for the Trump administration to share evidence to support its claims.",
      "Moreno\u2019s memo called for the president to designate more cartels as foreign terrorist organizations; target Petro, his family and associates for further sanctions; and launch an investigation into Petro\u2019s campaign finances, among other measures. The proposal did not include advocacy for new Colombian tariffs or the cutting off of aid to the country. It also did not call for the U.S. to engage in a regime-change effort.",
      "Moreno's document is below. (NBC News added in the watermarks indicating the images are fake.)",
      "Three days after the lunch with senators, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against Petro, his family and a government official over allegations of involvement in the global drug trade, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying in a statement that Petro \u201chas allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\u201d Petro has strongly denied involvement with the drug trade and has said he will fight the sanctions in U.S. courts.",
      "Trump has yet to announce new tariffs on Colombia. And CNN reported last week that there has been no interruption yet to U.S. assistance to the country.",
      "Petro, a socialist, accused the U.S. of killing a fisherman last month in one of its attacks on a boat the U.S. claimed was involved in drug smuggling. The U.S. revoked Petro\u2019s visa during the United Nations General Assembly in September after the Colombian leader spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York and called for U.S. soldiers to resist Trump.",
      "Writing for Time magazine, Petro on Sunday countered Trump\u2019s claims, saying that his government had delivered \u201crecord cocaine seizures\u201d and that the U.S. government\u2019s support \u201cwas crucial in this fight.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever the attitudes of the current administration, I will continue to pursue a counter-narcotics and broader security policy that is in the interests of Colombians and Americans alike,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Petro himself has called out Moreno as leading the charge against him. After the Trump administration announced the sanctions on him last month, Petro posted on X that Moreno\u2019s \u201cthreat has come true.\u201d",
      "Separately, Moreno pushed back on claims Petro made that he and Trump sought to overthrow him in a coup.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s 100% completely false,\u201d Moreno wrote on social media last month. \u201cThe United States wants the people of Colombia to have a free and fair election, as scheduled, without any influence from outside agitators or narco traffickers.\u201d",

He also said the U.S. should not equate all Colombians with Petro and his views, adding that imposing tariffs on the entire country could carry a significant \u201cpolitical risk\u201d and help to \u201cre-elect the left\u201d by giving Petro the ability to tap into nationalistic fervor."

      "The species, Megachile lucifer, was discovered by scholars surveying a critically endangered wildflower in Western Australia\u2019s Goldfields in 2019, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research.",
      "The highly distinctive, upward-pointing horns on the female bee\u2019s face inspired its name, said Kit Prendergast, lead author of the study and an adjunct research fellow at Curtin University.",
      "\u201cWhen writing up the new species description[,] I was watching the Netflix show Lucifer,\u201d Prendergast said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe name just fit perfectly.\u201d",
      "A DNA test later showed that the species didn\u2019t match any known bees in existing databases, making it the first new member of this group to be described in more than 20 years, researchers said.",
      "The horns, each measured at about 0.9 millimeters long, could be used to access flowers, compete for resources, and defend nests, researchers suggested, though their exact functions remain unclear. The species\u2019 male bees lack the horns.",
      "The discovery highlighted the need to study native bees, Prendergast said, adding that the new species could be at risk from habitat disturbance and other threatening processes like climate change.",
      "\u201cWithout knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realize they\u2019re there,\u201d she said.",
      "Australia has around 2,000 native bee species, more than 300 of which are yet to be scientifically named and described, according to CSIRO, an Australian national science agency.",
      "The country\u2019s native bees are \u201cunderstudied and data poor,\u201d leading to a lack of knowledge on the conservation status of \u201calmost all species,\u201d Tobias Smith, a bee researcher at the University of Queensland, told NBC News in an email Tuesday.",
      "Australian authorities need \u201cstronger policies\u201d to protect native bees from habitat loss, inappropriate fire regimes, and increased risks from megafires, said Smith, who is not involved in the study.",
      "Smith said he encouraged Australians to \u201cget outside and look for some native bees and appreciate them.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A cyberattack against British car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, the country\u2019s largest automaker, has been so catastrophic that it put a dent in the U.K.\u2019s gross domestic product, the Bank of England said.",
      "In its quarterly monetary policy report, released Thursday, the Bank of England said headline GDP had grown by 0.2%, less than it had projected. That slowdown was due to reduced exports to the U.S. and \u201cdisruption linked to the Jaguar Land Rover cyberattack,\u201d it said.",
      "The hack against Jaguar Land Rover, which began in August, has proven to be the most economically devastating in British history, said Ciaran Martin, the chair of the technical committee at Cyber Monitoring Centre, a nonprofit that tracks the impacts of cyberattacks on the country.",
      "\u201cWhat makes this incident so bad is the total shutdown of industrial production. That\u2019s much rarer in cyberattacks than is commonly understood,\u201d Martin told NBC News.",
      "Jaguar Land Rover didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The company first publicly acknowledged the attack on Sept. 2, saying that while the hackers didn\u2019t appear to steal customer data, \u201cour retail and production activities have been severely disrupted.\u201d It then took almost four weeks before the company announced it was even close to resuming manufacturing.",
      "In a report on the hack published last month, the Cyber Monitoring Centre found the attack had cost an estimated 1.9 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), surpassing the WannaCry attack of 2017. WannaCry, which the U.S. and U.K. accused North Korea of creating, spread across computers around the world, with the British National Health Service among the biggest victims. Roughly 1 in 5 of the trusts that administer NHS hospitals were locked down through that attack.",
      "Though the Cyber Monitoring Centre said that the specifics of what happened at Jaguar Land Rover are still unclear, the attack\u2019s fallout has been extremely far-reaching, affecting the company\u2019s global manufacturing operations at at least three U.K. plants, as well as car dealerships and a host of smaller companies that supply automotive parts.",
      "\u201cProduction lines were halted for several weeks, dealer systems were intermittently unavailable, and suppliers faced cancelled or delayed orders, with uncertainty about future order volumes,\u201d the report found.",
      "The known details of the event are consistent with ransomware, where cybercriminals gain access to a company\u2019s or government\u2019s computer systems and encrypt or threaten to delete them, demanding an extortion payment to make them usable again. Even when victims choose to pay their attackers, it can take weeks or months to restore operations.",
      "Ransomware is one of the most destructive and profitable forms of cybercrime. An analysis published in February by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence found there had been at least 5,289 attacks in 2024, with some netting tens of millions of dollars in ransom payments.",
      "The British government has not publicly accused anyone of masterminding the hack. A group of hackers who had claimed to be behind a string of other hacks against large British and American companies earlier this year told the BBC in September that they were responsible for hacking Jaguar Land Rover. NBC News was unable to confirm with the group, as their channel on Telegram, the app where they had previously made such claims, has been deleted."

      "Canada has lost its measles elimination status, the country\u2019s Public Health Agency announced Monday. It\u2019s the first country in the Americas to do so since the pandemic, and it could serve as a warning sign for others.",
      "There are multiple criteria for losing an official measles elimination status, including declines in vaccination rates. The most significant factor is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada\u2019s outbreak started in October 2024 in New Brunswick, a province on the country\u2019s eastern seaboard. As of Monday, Canada\u2019s health officials had tallied 5,138 measles cases since the outbreak began. Two babies, infected in utero, were born pre-term and died.",
      "Despite \u201cgreat efforts\u201d made by Canadian health officials, \u201cthe country has lost its measles elimination status and is now considered endemic for the disease,\u201d Jarbas Barbosa, the head of the Pan American Health Organization, said during a media briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cThis loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible,\u201d Barbosa said.",
      "Canadian health officials will now have to come up with a plan to get back on track, including improving vaccination rates and \u201cenabling better overall surveillance efforts,\u201d the country's public health agency said in a statement.",
      "The country eliminated measles in 1998, two years before the U.S.",
      "The spread of measles in the Americas is not limited to Canada. As of last week, PAHO officials reported that there\u2019ve been 12,593 confirmed measles cases across the entire region, which encompasses North, Central and South America \u2014 30 times the number reported last year.",
      "The vast majority of 2025 cases \u2014 95% \u2014 have been in Canada, Mexico and the U.S., and the latter two countries could soon also lose their measles elimination status.",
      "In Mexico, nearly 4,000 cases have been reported since February. Ongoing spread in the state of Chihuahua, in the northwestern part of the country, accounts for 93% of the country\u2019s outbreak. Twenty-three people have died.",
      "In the U.S., an outbreak that began in January continues to spread across the country.",
      "The outbreak started in West Texas and stretched into New Mexico. At least 862 people \u2014 mostly in Texas \u2014 were infected. Three people died, including two little girls who lived in the epicenter of the outbreak, Gaines County, Texas.",
      "Though cases have subsided in West Texas, the virus has continued to spread. Forty-one states have reported cases. As of last week, 1,681 measles cases had been confirmed in the U.S. in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most in more than 30 years.",
      "In Utah and Arizona, an outbreak concentrated in a close-knit community that straddles the border between the states is nearing 200 cases.",
      "In South Carolina, 38 cases have been reported in the northwestern part of the state since July.",
      "The outbreaks have occurred as vaccination rates have declined steadily in the U.S.",
      "A monthslong NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots. Two are recommended.",
      "Vaccination coverage for both MMR doses across countries in the PAHO region averaged 79% last year, according to the group.",
      "Measles is the most contagious virus known on the planet. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the room. Anyone in that room who hasn\u2019t been vaccinated against measles will likely get sick.",
      "Who determines a nation\u2019s measles elimination status?",
      "The PAHO, part of the World Health Organization, determines whether a country in North, South or Central America has maintained or lost its elimination status.",
      "Elimination means that a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, meaning that it\u2019s been wiped out worldwide.",
      "On a technical level, when one country in the Americas loses its status, the region as a whole is deemed to have lost its elimination status. Canada is the only country in the region, however, that\u2019s been specifically called out for its year-plus measles spread.",
      "Measles is nowhere near being eradicated. Even with Canada losing its measles elimination status, the region of the Americas accounts for just 7.5% of cases globally, Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with PAHO, said during a media briefing Monday. Most are in the Middle East and South Asia.",
      "In 2019, PAHO established a panel of independent experts, called the Regional Verification Commission, to do an annual review of how countries are able to control measles spread.",
      "The panel met last week in Mexico City to analyze the latest measles data submitted from countries with active outbreaks through October.",
      "A PAHO spokesman said the group could not confirm whether its independent committee will meet again in January to discuss measles spread in the U.S."

      "Suharto, a staunch anti-communist who was a close U.S. ally during the Cold War, ruled for 32 years before he was ousted by deadly mass protests in 1998 amid the Asian financial crisis. His rule was marked by rapid economic growth and political stability as well as accusations of human rights violations, corruption and nepotism.",
      "Suharto was among 10 people who received the national hero title at the presidential palace in Jakarta.

      "Minister of Culture Fadli Zon said Suharto had played a key role in Indonesian independence and also led the military operation that helped regain what is now West Papua from the Dutch in the 1960s.",
      "Suharto was a key military officer during a 1965 military-led purge of communists said to be planning a coup. Indonesia has never investigated the purge, during which historians say about 500,000 people were killed in one of the 20th century\u2019s worst massacres, and Suharto was never proved to be involved.",
      "He also oversaw Indonesia\u2019s 1975 invasion of East Timor and the 24-year occupation that followed, which is estimated to have killed 100,000 people or more. East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, gained independence from Indonesia in 2002.",
      "Suharto and his family were also accused of stealing as much as $45 billion in state funds, though it was never proven. Though authorities tried to bring corruption charges starting in 2000, Suharto did not appear in court and the charges were later dropped because of his poor health. He died in 2008 in his late 80s.",
      "He is also credited with driving the rapid economic development of Indonesia, a country of 280 million people that is the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation.",
      "\u201cIn the \u201970s and \u201980s, 50 million people were lifted out of the most severe poverty,\u201d David Henley, a professor of contemporary Indonesian studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThat is Suharto\u2019s greatest claim to hero status.\u201d",
      "Despite the atrocities that marked Suharto\u2019s regime, he was \u201cnever completely disgraced,\u201d Henley said.",

      "Others have resisted that trend.",
      "Every Thursday there is a silent protest outside the presidential palace in Jakarta over Suharto's alleged abuses, including by people still searching for loved ones.",
      "Protesters also gathered in Jakarta last week to oppose giving Suharto the national hero title.",
      "Prabowo, who was formerly married to Suharto\u2019s daughter Siti Hediati Hariyadi, also has a military background. He has denied accusations of human rights violations in East Timor, where he led a special forces unit in the 1980s, and in Papua.",
      "He was also commander of a special forces unit that was accused of abducting and torturing democracy activists in the 1990s, though Prabowo was never charged.",

      "Since toppling the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2018s interim leader has spent the past year transforming his global image while tackling deep divisions at home.",
      "Now, al-Sharaa, who has thrown off his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, made history as the first Syrian president to visit the White House.",
      "\"It was an Honor to spend time with Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, the new President of Syria, where we discussed all the intricacies of PEACE in the Middle East, of which he is a major advocate. I look forward to meeting and speaking again,\" Trump posted on Truth Social after his meeting with al-Sharaa, who would not have been able to set foot in the U.S. a year ago thanks to the $10 million bounty on his head. \"Having a stable and successful Syria is very important to all countries in the Region,\" Trump added.",
      "During his Washington visit, Al-Sharaa committed to joining the U.S.-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State militant group, a senior administration official told NBC News, a significant step in Syria's engagement with the West. And diplomats will be allowed to return to the Syrian embassy in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe United States will allow Syria to resume operations at its Embassy in Washington to further counterterrorism, security, and economic coordination,\" the senior administration official said.",
      "The State Department removed al-Sharaa and his interior minister from the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list Friday, while the United Kingdom and Europe removed sanctions on al-Sharaa after the United Nations Security Council voted in favor of a U.S.-drafted resolution to do so.",
      "The Washington trip is \u201ca high-level sign of the trust that the American administration has placed in al-Sharaa \u2014 and the hope that he will succeed in holding Syria together during this incredibly complicated transition period,\u201d said Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "A \u2018turning point\u2019",
      "Al-Sharaa rose to power after leading Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, in toppling Assad\u2019s regime last December.",
      "Since then, he has sought to distance himself from his past as a jihadist who had been jailed by U.S. forces in Iraq, trading military fatigues for smart suits and vowing to rebuild Syria and unify its myriad religious and ethnic groups.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach, a dramatic shift for the U.S., has underscored al-Sharaa\u2019s success in breaking the country\u2019s decadeslong global isolation.",
      "The U.S. removed its terrorist designation for HTS, along with the bounty on al-Sharaa himself, before lifting a string of sanctions following a May meeting between the Syrian leader and Trump in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Sharaa was in New York in September to address the United Nations General Assembly, but Syrian Information Ministry said that being welcomed to the White House marked a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d for the country.",
      "At home, however, al-Sharaa has struggled to unify a deeply divided Syria while grappling with broader threats: a resurgent ISIS, fraught relations with increasingly assertive neighbor Israel, and Russia\u2019s determination to maintain its strategic foothold in Syria while giving safe haven to Assad.",
      "Syria has experienced flashes of violence, including deadly attacks against minority groups allegedly carried out in part by government forces. Growing tensions with Kurdish authorities in northeast Syria have also erupted into violent clashes.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s certainly being (very) smart,\u201d John Jenkins, a former British diplomat who has previously served as head of mission in Syria, said of al-Sharaa in emailed comments.",
      "\u201cA trip to D.C. makes him look respectable,\u201d said Jenkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House and a leader at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Geopolitics. But, he added, \u201dthe key issues are domestic.\u201d",
      "And within Syria, opinions have been deeply divided.",
      "\u201cHe does not represent the Syrian people,\u201d said Sami Zain Al-Din, a 72-year-old political activist from Sweida, a southern city that was rocked by deadly clashes involving the Druze community, which has close ties to Israel.",
      "For Dr. Jalnar Hamad, doubts over al-Sharaa were balanced against hopes that his meeting with Trump could open a \u201cnew chapter\u201d that could see Sweida \u201cbenefit from development or reconstruction programs,\u201d she said.",
      "Ilham Ahmed, co-chair of the Syrian Democratic Council, the political arm of the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, said the Trump meeting was \u201can opportunity to redefine the position of the new Syrian state.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also a chance for Trump to address \u201cthe rights of the Kurdish people and the coalition partners who fought terrorism on behalf of the world,\u201d he said, referring to the SDF\u2019s role against ISIS.",
      "Further sanctions lifted?",
      "Al-Sharaa will be hoping to emerge strengthened domestically, and key to that effort is his bid to remove remaining sanctions imposed on Syria during Assad\u2019s rule.",
      "Already, \u201cthe pace with which sanctions have been eased on Syria since May has been absolutely spectacular,\u201d Karam Shaar, a consultant on Syria and the research director at the Operations and Policy Center think tank in Turkey, said in a voice note.",
      "Shaar said he expected that two \u201cmain pieces of sanctions will have been either lifted or just about to be lifted\u201d by the time al-Sharaa and Trump meet, including the removal of Syria from America\u2019s list of \u201cstate sponsors of terrorism\u201d and the repeal of sanctions under the Caesar Act, a 2019 law targeting the Assad regime.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a statement on Monday that he had given Syria another waiver on the Caesar Act.",
      "But sanctions will not be the only focus, with the effort to quell ISIS\u2019 resurgence and relations with Israel also expected to play a central role.",
      "The U.S. ally has faced growing isolation on the global stage over its deadly assault in Gaza, but Trump has previously expressed hopes Syria would join other Arab nations in normalizing ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, which were expanded again last week.",
      "It remains unclear whether Trump will push the matter during talks with al-Sharaa on Monday.",
      "Syria, historically a staunch ally of Iran, has never recognized Israel and has been locked in a state of conflict with the country since its establishment in 1948. Iranian proxy Hezbollah has also long been deeply embedded in Syria after joining the Assad regime\u2019s military efforts.",
      "When Assad was in power, Israel routinely carried out airstrikes against what it said were Iranian-linked targets inside Syria, and since his ouster, it has deployed troops to a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone and has repeatedly launched airstrikes and incursions into Syria.",
      "Damascus has so far refused to retaliate, while both countries have kept the lines of communication open."

      "Workers at some overseas U.S. military bases are going without pay during the shutdown, with employees on at least one base in Germany directed to food pantries before local officials stepped in.",
      "Active-duty military personnel across the world have continued to get paychecks during the shutdown, though the funding to pay them could dry up later this month if no agreement is reached.",
      "But local civilians employed on overseas bases have already seen their salaries disrupted, with thousands going without pay since the longest shutdown in U.S. history began almost six weeks ago.",
      "At the largest U.S. military base in Europe, official guidance directed local workers to food banks before German officials stepped in to cover the funding gap.",
      "A list of support organizations on the shutdown guidance webpage for U.S. Army Garrison Bavaria included German food-sharing charity Food for All, the app \u201cToo Good to Go,\u201d and Tafel Deutschland, which it described as an umbrella organization that \u201cdistributes food to people in poverty through its more than 970 local food banks.\u201d The list was removed sometime on Wednesday.",
      "The Defense Department said that the guide was for foreign nationals employed on the base and not intended for U.S. troops or American military personnel.",
      "A Pentagon spokesperson told NBC News on Friday that the list \u201cwas created weeks ago, when the U.S. Army was concerned that its German employees might not be getting paid\u201d during the shutdown.",
      "Soldiers and U.S. civilian employees \u201chave access to several support programs on their bases,\u201d the spokesperson added. Soldiers \u201cdid in fact get paid at the end of October,\u201d a spokesman for U.S. Army Europe and Africa told NBC News.",
      "The German government stepped in to pay the salaries of nearly 11,000 civilians who work on U.S. military bases, the nation\u2019s finance ministry said in a statement. It is counting on being repaid once the shutdown ends, a spokesperson said.",
      "While some governments have stepped in to foot the bill, others have not done so, with employees in Italy and Portugal working unpaid as the gridlock in Washington drags on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an absurd situation because nobody has responses, nobody feels responsible,\u201d said Angelo Zaccaria, a union coordinator at the Aviano Air Base in northeastern Italy.",

    "story": [
      "A powerful quake rattled northern Japan Sunday evening, followed by several more temblors, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. A tsunami advisory was issued.",
      "The earthquake, with an upgraded magnitude of 6.9 and depth of 16 kilometers (10 miles), struck off the coast of Iwate prefecture at 5:03 p.m. Japan time.",
      "There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, or any reports of abnormalities at the two nuclear power plants in the area.",
      "The agency issued an advisory for a tsunami of up to 1 meter (3 feet) along the northern coastal region, and subsequently said the water could reach as high as 3 meters in some spots.",
      "A tsunami of about 10 centimeters (4 inches) was detected at Ofunato city in Iwate Prefecture, Ominato port, Miyako and Kamaishi, and subsequently as high as 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the coastal area of Kuji. The tsunami that followed in Ofunato also reached 20 centimeters (8 inches), according to the agency.",
      "Tsunami waves that follow earthquakes can continue for a few hours afterward, hitting the coast repeatedly, and can possibly get bigger with time.",
      "While the advisory was in place, people were warned to stay away from the ocean and coastal areas and told more shaking could follow in the area.",
      "The tsunami advisory was lifted about three hours after the initial quake, but the meteorological agency told reporters the area was at risk for strong quakes for about a week, especially the next two or three days.",
      "More quakes were recorded in Iwate Prefecture, and the northernmost major island of Hokkaido was also rocked by the series of quakes.",
      "Northeastern Japan is prone to earthquakes, including a triple disaster of a quake, tsunami and a nuclear meltdown in Fukushima, just south of Iwate, in March 2011, that killed nearly 20,000 people, mostly from the tsunami, and severely damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station.",
      "More than a decade later, people still remain displaced from the no-go zone. Demonstrations are still periodically held, as recent as Saturday, to protest what is being seen as a lack of recognition by the authorities of the serious risks of nuclear power.",
      "An agency official, briefing reporters late Sunday, said there was nothing to indicate the latest quake was directly related to the one in 2011, except that the region was generally at risk for major quakes, including another one that hit in 1992.",
      "Bullet trains in the area were temporarily delayed, according to JR East railway operator. Japan, which sits on the Pacific \u201cring of fire,\u201d is one of the world\u2019s most earthquake-prone countries."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has handed his authoritarian Hungarian ally Viktor Orb\u00e1n a special exemption from Russian energy sanctions, a major boost for the far-right populist whose 15-year rule has been used as a blueprint by the MAGA movement.",
      "Orb\u00e1n visited Trump in Washington on Friday, with one of his explicit goals being to win a carveout from the latest sanctions imposed against Russian oil and gas companies last month.",
      "Hungary is a major importer of Russian energy, and the sanctions were set to squeeze its already ailing economy ahead of elections next year that present the biggest challenge to what the European Union calls Orb\u00e1n\u2019s \u201chybrid regime of electoral autocracy.\u201d",
      "In a post on X, Orb\u00e1n said he had received a guarantee of \u201cfull sanction exemptions\u201d for key pipelines, allowing Hungary to continue providing \u201cthe lowest energy prices in Europe.\u201d",
      "He said Hungary was in a \u201csignificantly different situation\u201d from other European countries, suggesting it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to secure affordable energy if sanctions remained in place.",
      "A White House official told Reuters that Hungary has received a one-year exemption from U.S. sanctions for using Russian oil and gas.",
      "Hungary has meanwhile agreed to buy U.S. liquefied natural gas, the State Department said, noting contracts were expected to be worth about $600 million.",
      "The two nations also agreed to work together on nuclear energy, with Hungary agreeing to purchase American nuclear fuel, which it currently buys from Russia.",
      "Under Orb\u00e1n\u2019s premiership, Hungary is one of the only E.U. member states to maintain warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Orb\u00e1n has also cultivated close ties with Trump\u2019s allies in Washington, sharing CPAC stages, coordinating through think tanks and syncing anti-immigrant and anti-woke messaging across the Atlantic.",
      "In comments to state radio last week, Orb\u00e1n made clear he would try to \u201cmake the Americans understand\u201d that Hungary needs a carveout for its continued purchases of Russian energy.",
      "And Hungarian officials said in the run-up to the meeting that the prime minister aimed to discuss a path to a U.S.-Russia meeting and seek exemptions from U.S. energy sanctions. International Monetary Fund figures show Hungary relied on Russia for 74% of its gas and 86% of its oil in 2024.",
      "Trump canceled his planned summit with Putin, which was slated to take place in Hungary\u2019s capital, Budapest, after the Russian leader stuck to his hard-line demands on ending his war in Ukraine."
