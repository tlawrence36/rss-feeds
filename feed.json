    "story": [
      "\"Wicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a fresh take on the original musical's second act",
      "Are you ready for more \u201cWicked\"? \u201cWicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a bulked-up take on the music of the original \u201cWicked\u201d musical's second act, grounded in yet-again stellar vocals from Cynthia Erivo as a misunderstood but defiant Elphaba and Ariana Grande as a conflicted but changing Glinda. New songs and lyrics raise the stakes \u2014 even if the music itself is at times weighed down by the plot it helps move along, like the film it accompanies.",
      "The soundtrack opens with \u201cEvery Day More Wicked,\u201d a lengthened-version of a section of the original Act 2 opener \u201cThank Goodness\u201d with new verses about Elphaba's perceived wickedness and Glinda's presumed goodness set to bold orchestration that matches the first film's opening number, \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked.\" Drum beats and ensemble singers are the world builders here, twisting the melody into a march.",
      "The album's first solo goes to Michelle Yeoh's Madame Morrible, the sorceress at the center of a propaganda campaign against Elphaba \u2014 a choice that works for the plot, but which offsets the power of Erivo and Grande's forthcoming vocals. They are introduced later, through brief interpolations of the Act 1 showstoppers \u201cThe Wizard and I\" and \u201cPopular.\" All of that makes for a dynamic film opener \u2014 but is more fractured in audio form, sans the sumptuous visuals and character reveals that tie those musical references together on screen.",
      "Fortunately, \u201cThank Goodness / I Couldn't Be Happier\u201d quickly follows, bringing Grande center-stage \u2014 and providing a rare-here opportunity for her soprano head-voice to give way to a deeper belt (her passionate tone, like other Glindas before her, turns this almost nonsensical lyric, \"There are bridges you cross you didn\u2019t know you crossed until you've crossed them,\" into a revelation). That's not the last we hear from this capital \u201cG\u201d Good, Glinda. \u201cWonderful,\u201d usually a duet between Elphaba and the Wizard of Oz, is \u2018Galinda-fied,\u2019 with Grande adding welcome harmonies \u2014 and a brief \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d interlude \u2014 to Jeff Goldblum's Wizard romp.",
      "It was always going to be hard for this album to live up to the soundtrack of the first \u201cWicked,\u201d which ended with Erivo\u2019s take on the iconic \u201cDefying Gravity\" battle cry, and saw Grande own the over-the-top glitz of \u201cPopular.\" But that grandness is replicated in key moments: In Grande's operatic soprano, in Erivo and Jonathan Bailey's sensual \u201cAs Long As You're Mine,\" in which Bailey as Fiyero manages to keep up with Erivo's beckoning vocals, and in \u201cNo Good Deed,\" the album's sonic peak.",
      "At 44 minutes and 52 seconds, the soundtrack adds over 15 minutes of music to the runtime of the original Broadway cast recording's second act. That includes two brand new songs written for the film (making them eligible for Oscar consideration), one for Erivo\u2019s Elphaba and one for Grande\u2019s Glinda. In lengthening the shorter second act into a 2 hour and 17 minute long film, director Jon M. Chu stretches some of these songs across scenes, filling them out with dialogue, additional verses from composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and additional scoring from composer John Powell. All of that is a double-edged sword (broom? wand?), at times deflating the power of the tight original tracks, at others adding felt emotional stakes ripe for satisfying listening.",
      "For example: Some of the drama of Marissa Bode, Ethan Slater and Erivo's \u201cWicked Witch of the East,\u201d a song performed on Broadway that was also left off the original cast recording, is weakened by which pieces of the interspersed dialogue remain, and which don't, in the soundtrack version of the song. Like the Tin Man, it feels a bit piecemeal.",
      "But the new tracks are highlights, fleshing out the album. Erivo's \u201cNo Place Like Home\u201d pulls on the iconic line said by Dorothy in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\" providing this Oz-inspired show its take on the theme, like another Oz-inspired show, \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d found before. (\"Home,\" that show's nod to the line, was sung by Erivo at this year's Oscars ceremony). The song is the most inherently political, a timely tale of borders, defiance and community. It starts with Erivo's voice almost isolated, strings swelling behind her, and ends with the first of her transcendent vocal runs, restored to a full open note (after being cut short by the Cowardly Lion on screen) in the album.",
      "That power is felt tenfold in Erivo's take on \u201cNo Good Deed.\" The film may belong to Glinda\u2019s emotional trajectory, but it is Erivo who steals the soundtrack's climax. Drums return as the agony heard in her voice intensifies, the strings crescendoing with her final call.",
      "Glinda's emotional journey may at first be more subtle, but Grande portrays it deftly. Airy and introspective, \u201cGirl in the Bubble\u201d serves as turning point, filling in gaps about Glinda's internal reckoning. Her voice is restrained but emotional, Schwartz's lyrics straightforward with a cheese that feels earned, and thus earnest. This is Glinda after all, not Grande.",
      "Both songs boost the emotional payoff of the character\u2019s finale duet, the fan-beloved tear-jerker \u201cFor Good.\" And it's no surprise, years into their own journey with the characters, that Erivo and Grande nail the chemistry of their character's friendship.",

It also made a splash in theaters in August where it was estimated to have made around $18 million (which would have topped the charts if Netflix released theatrical earnings) and got a subsequent release over Halloween weekend.

      "The first runner-up was 29-year old Praveenar Singh of Thailand and 25-year-old Stephany Adriana Abasali Nasser of Venezuela placed third.",
      "Rounding up the finishers were Ahtisa Manalo, 28, of the Philippines, and 27-year-old Olivia Yac\u00e9 of Ivory Coast who came fifth.",
      "The bad vibes at this year\u2019s event sprang from a sharp-tongued scolding of the Mexican contestant, Bosch, which sparked a controversy marked by a walkout, feminist solidarity and a teary melodramatic apology from the local organizer who set it all off.",
      "At the livestreamed sashing ceremony for virtually all 130 contestants on Nov. 4, Thai national director Nawat Itsaragrisil hectored Bosch for allegedly not following his guidelines for taking part in local promotional activities. He called security when she spoke up to defend herself.",
      "Bosch walked out of the room, joined by several others in a show of solidarity, including Miss Universe 2024, Victoria Kj\u00e6r Theilvig of Denmark.",
      "\u201cWhat your director did is not respectful: he called me dumb,\u201d an unbowed Bosch told Thai reporters. \u201cIf it takes away your dignity, you need to go.\u201d",
      "The Miss Universe Organization president, Mexican businessman Ra\u00fal Rocha Cant\u00fa, released a statement condemning Nawat\u2019s conduct as \u201cpublic aggression\u201d and \u201cserious abuse.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt seems to me that it is an example of how women should raise our voices,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",

It says she has volunteered with sick children, promoted environmental awareness, and engaged in supported migrants and mental health issues.",
      "This year's competition also saw a report that two judges had quit, with one of them suggesting that there was an element of rigging to the contest. The allegation was denied. Separately, Thai police investigated the alleged illegal promotion of online casinos as part of the event\u2019s publicity, a turn of events that may have been connected with the organizers\u2019 feud.",
      "Mishaps and controversies are not rare for the pageant. The 2021 event attracted criticism because it was held in Israel, to the dismay of supporters of the Palestinian cause.",
      "An example of a minor misstep \u2014 literally \u2014 occurred Wednesday when Miss Universe Jamaica, Gabrielle Henry, fell off the stage during the evening gown competition. She was not badly hurt.",

      "In whatever window she can find, Paine squeezes in scales and mouth exercises, going to great lengths not to disturb others on round-the-clock shifts. That means slipping out of the main base to a hut built in 1957 under the leadership of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary as New Zealand established its presence in Antarctica.",

      "A grand jury in Texas has indicted a man on a murder charge in the shooting of \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d voice actor Jonathan Joss",
      "HOUSTON -- A grand jury in Texas has indicted the man accused of killing \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d voice actor Jonathan Joss on a murder charge.",
      "But it is unclear whether Joss\u2019 killing will be considered a hate crime. Police in San Antonio did not immediately return an email seeking comment Wednesday on whether its investigation had determined that Joss' sexual orientation played a role in his shooting, and the Bexar County District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Police allege Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, 57, confronted Joss and his husband on June 1 as they were checking their mail at their San Antonio home, which had been burned down in January.",
      "Joss\u2019 husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, has claimed the person who killed the actor yelled \u201cviolent homophobic slurs\u201d before opening fire.",
      "Ceja Alvarez\u2019s attorneys did not immediately return emails seeking comment Wednesday.",
      "In June, Alfonso Otero, one of Ceja Alvarez\u2019s attorneys, said his client was innocent and denied making any homophobic statements.",
      "The grand jury returned the indictment Monday, and Ceja Alvarez remains free on a $200,000 bond.",
      "A friend of the 59-year-old Joss has said that Joss and Ceja Alvarez were neighbors and the two had argued for years.",
      "Initially, San Antonio police had said there was no evidence indicating the shooting was related to Joss\u2019 sexual orientation. But San Antonio Police Chief William McManus later walked back that statement, saying it had been \u201cpremature\u201d and that whether Joss\u2019 sexual orientation played a role in the shooting was \"part of the investigation.\u201d",

      "The 76th annual National Book Awards have been presented by the nonprofit National Book Foundation, with winners including Rabih Alameddine for fiction, Patricia Smith for poetry, and Omar El Akkad for nonfiction",
      "NEW YORK -- National Book Awards judges honored authors worldwide on Wednesday night, from Lebanese novelist Rabih Alameddine\u2019s \u201cThe True True Story of Raja the Gullible (and His Mother)\" to Chicago-born poet Patricia Smith's \u201cThe Intentions of Thunder.\u201d",
      "Alameddine's narrative of intense family bonds within the chaos of modern Lebanon received the fiction prize, while Smith, who has received numerous previous awards for her lyricism and intensity, won for poetry. The nonfiction prize was given to the Canadian Iranian novelist-journalist Omar El Akkad for his fierce indictment of the contemporary West, \u201cOne Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This.\"",
      "Iranian American Daniel Nayeri\u2019s \u201cThe Teacher of Nomad Land: A World War II Story\" won for young people\u2019s literature and Argentine Gabriela Cabez\u00f3n C\u00e1mara\u2019s \u201cWe Are Green and Trembling,\u201d translated from Spanish by Robin Myers, was cited for translated literature.",
      "Winners each receive $10,000.",
      "The awards have often served as a kind of counter voice to current events. The night\u2019s honorees expressed gratitude for prizes bestowed and for literature itself, and horror and disenchantment at the political and social climate, from immigration raids in the U.S. by masked agents to the carnage in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to speak in Spanish because there are fascists who don\u2019t like that,\u201d Cabez\u00f3n C\u00e1mara said, her words translated on stage by Myers.",
      "El Akkad said it was \u201cvery difficult to to think in celebratory terms about a book that was written in response to a genocide (in Gaza). It\u2019s difficult to think in celebratory terms when I spent two years seeing what shrapnel does to a child\u2019s body.\u201d",
      "Alameddine's speech, like his novel, combined humor and agony. He began with a lament for the bombing of a Palestinian refugee camp, but went on to joke about the demands of his agent, Nicole Aragi, and thank everyone from his gastrointestinal doctor to the \u201cpsychiatrist who has been telling me to get over myself for more than 20 years.\u201d",
      "Smith, in a highly emotional speech, offered a litany of racial and social barriers she confronted, including harsh words from her ailing mother, while offering tribute to poetry as a path to transcendence.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lidia Bastianich grew up in a small town in Italy where neighbors were like extended family. If kids came home from school and mom was out, they went to the neighbors for a snack. If someone had a problem with a sibling, they went next door.",

      "She's hoping to spotlight and cultivate togetherness with her 14th TV special, \u201cLidia Celebrates America: A Nation of Neighbors,\u201d which premieres Nov. 25 on PBS and streams on PBS.org.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my way of really thanking America. I think that there\u2019s no better place in the whole world than the United States of America and somehow it\u2019s been maligned,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I know is that out there, in the midst of America, there\u2019s a lot of good American people.\u201d",
      "Bastianich travels to wildfire-scarred neighborhoods outside Los Angeles, a pay-how-you-can caf\u00e9 in Denver, a Japanese-American community center in Portland, Oregon, and a first-of-its-kind free grocery market in San Francisco. At every stop, there are hands reaching out to help.",
      "\u201cThat connection makes you feel good, it makes you feel more of a human being. And it gives you back that kind of desire to live on positively,\u201d she says.",
      "The hourlong special starts in Altadena, California, hurting from the recent wildfires. Bastianich joins volunteers making 175 five-course meals that are delivered to victims. One of the volunteers is someone himself living out of his car because the flames had made him homeless.",
      "\u201cI got the shivers. I just needed to hug him,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI know that he needed that. I know he was in his car by himself, and yet he found it within him to give. That takes fortitude. It takes character.\"",
      "She also meets self-taught cook Kiki Ruff in Porter County, Indiana. Ruff hosts a viral TikTok series that helps families struggling with food insecurity stretch their groceries, using recipes from the Depression, recessions and wartime.",

There, they lived in a refugee camp for two years until an aid organization helped bring them to New York in 1958.",

      "George Clooney stars in \"Jay Kelly,\" a film by Noah Baumbach that blurs reality and fiction, says Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy",
      "During his glittering career, George Clooney has played a casino thief, a Batman,a chain-gang convict, an assassin and a high-flying layoff artist. This fall, he's stretching even more, playing an utterly charming and gorgeous movie star. Kidding!",
      "Reality and fiction beautifully weave in and out in \u201cJay Kelly,\u201d director Noah Baumbach's love letter to Hollywood that, in other hands, could so easily have become just a love letter to Clooney.",
      "The script by Baumbach and Emily Mortimer finds Clooney \u2014 sorry, Jay Kelly \u2014 in a sort of midlife funk. He's 60, a universally beloved, deeply earnest movie hunk who has worked his way to the top and found, well, artifice.",
      "\u201cMy life doesn't really feel real,\u201d he says at one point, an actor trained in pretending going meta playing an actor trained in pretending. In another scene he muses: \u201cAll my memories are movies.\u201d",
      "A chance meeting with an old acting partner \u2014 a brilliant Billy Crudup, whose character was betrayed by Kelly years ago \u2014 reveals some unpleasant truths. \u201cIs there a person in there? Maybe you don\u2019t actually exist,\u201d he asks the star, sending Kelly on a journey of self-discovery that just so happens to lead to one of Clooney's favorite places, Italy.",
      "Kelly's careful facade \u2014 the stories he tells about himself \u2014 soon gets chipped away. On his way up the hills of Hollywood, he apparently left some personal carnage behind. \u201cJay Kelly\u201d is about those who sacrificed to get him there.",
      "Adam Sandler and Laura Dern play Kelly's long-suffering manager and publicist, respectively, while his resentful adult daughters are portrayed by Grace Edwards and Riley Keough. Kelly, we learn, put career first and that meant walking away from things like his daughters' school recitals and making his staff miss things like their daughters\u2019 school recitals. \u201cHe's not our family or our friend,\u201d Dern's character screams in despair. \u201cWe're not to him what he is to us.\u201d",
      "You'd expect Clooney to not have to shift out of second gear for this, but he gives a soulful performance, charming enough that his Kelly seduces a trainful of strangers in Italy with his aw-shucks charisma and yet also bristles when his oldest daughter makes him confront her abandonment issues.",
      "\u201cDo you know how I knew you didn't want to spend time with me?\u201d his daughter asks him, before answering in a line that will land like a gut punch with any parent: \u201cBecause you didn't spend time with me.\u201d Another killer: \u201cI wish you were the man I thought you were.\u201d",

There emerges an off-putting, in-his-own-world Jay Gatsby vibe to him, alluded to by his first name and the name of one of his daughters, Daisy.",

He was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.",
      "The petition also argues that the trial judge demonstrated a bias against the Church of Scientology, allowing an \u201cunconstitutional intrusion\u201d into the church's doctrine and a misinterpretation of its scripture.",

It says the witnesses included some who would have testified that the women spoke favorably of the sexual relationships they had with Masterson. And they included psychological and pharmacological experts who would have testified about the effects of alcohol and drugs on memory.",
      "The court filing says there was \u201cunexpected and unreasonable failure of trial counsel to present any of the mountain of exculpatory evidence\u201d that had been amassed by Masterson's pretrial attorney Shawn Holley, and the result was a violation of his constitutional rights.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine F. Olmedo declined to delay Masterson\u2019s first trial to accommodate Holley\u2019s representation of former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer against his own allegations of sexual misconduct. Cohen then took over as lead attorney.",

      "Max Hollein, CEO and director of the Met, said in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement that he hopes the exhibit will take visitors to the New York museum on a (very fashionable) journey through art history, where they will see connections throughout.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a show that can really live in fascinating ways at the museum and can pull from all different areas of our collection \u2014 paintings, sculpture, drawings,\u201d Hollein said.",

      "Indonesia has remained largely polio-free as the highly contagious disease was declared eliminated in the country in 2014.

In 2021, only 50.9% of infants born in Aceh received polio vaccination.",

The government has also been prioritizing COVID-19 vaccinations since they became available.",
      "Over the next two years, cases appeared in the provinces of Banten, West Java, Central Java, East Java, North Maluku, Central Papua, Highland Papua and South Papua, prompting the mass immunization and information drive. Nearly 60 million additional doses of polio vaccine were administered to children during the response.",

Kennedy Jr. spent a recent Wednesday showered in praise from the vice president and health technology CEOs at a glitzy \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d event in Washington, designed to celebrate the health secretary\u2019s successes and the movement he has built.",
      "Yet online, a different narrative of his tenure was playing out as a small but vocal group of Kennedy\u2019s supporters and former employees assailed top Trump administration advisers, claiming they were sabotaging him and redirecting MAHA away from its original goals.",
      "\u201cMAHA is not MAHA anymore,\u201d Gray Delany, a former Department of Health and Human Services official ousted in August, said in a podcast interview that day. \u201cI\u2019m not there, but what I\u2019ve heard of what\u2019s happening today is not the MAHA that we signed up for.\u201d",
      "The criticisms, which grew loud enough that the health secretary took to social media to defend his colleagues two days later, exposed the cracks that are beginning to form within his coalition as it amasses power and broadens in scope.",

They\u2019re also wary that the Health Department appears willing to collaborate with pharmaceutical companies, tech firms and other big corporations whose motives they don\u2019t trust.",
      "The fissures pose a threat to the cohesion of a movement that has given President Donald Trump an important ally and Republicans access to a new group of voters.

      "Kennedy, a longtime environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist who helped lead the crusade against COVID-19 shots during the pandemic, has taken many steps to curtail vaccines this year. He pulled $500 million for their development, ousted and replaced every member of a federal vaccine advisory committee and pledged to overhaul a federal program for compensating Americans injured by shots. He also has repeatedly spread false and misleading information about vaccines while in office.",
      "As recently as this week, in a move that thrilled Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its website to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "But many of Kennedy's supporters in what they call the \u201chealth freedom\u201d movement say it\u2019s not enough. Some want punishments for companies that profited from vaccine and mask requirements during the pandemic. Others want mRNA-based COVID-19 shots pulled from the shelves, despite scientific consensus that they have saved millions of lives.",
      "In their attacks on the administration last week, a few MAHA influencers and two fired HHS employees suggested White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Kennedy\u2019s close adviser, Stefanie Spear, were conspiring to limit Kennedy\u2019s ability to restrict vaccines and crack down on pharmaceutical companies.",
      "Some Kennedy supporters latched on to the claims and pointed to Wiles\u2019 career history at a lobbying firm that has worked with Pfizer as evidence she\u2019s trying to undermine him. They also shared years-old social media posts from Spear criticizing Trump.",
      "Kennedy defended his colleagues in two posts on X, saying the MAHA movement has \u201cno better friend in Washington\u201d than Wiles and that Spear has become a Trump loyalist.",

    "story": [
      "Sometimes our immune system runs amok and attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus\u201d \u2014 the brain",
      "\u201cMy year of unraveling\u201d is how a despairing Christy Morrill described nightmarish months when his immune system hijacked his brain.",
      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness. She\u2019d brushed off some oddities \u2014 a little forgetfulness, zoning out a few minutes \u2014 until she found herself in an ambulance because of a seizure.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual, I mean extremely unusual, to just complain of a problem with autobiographical memory,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cOne has to think about unusual disorders.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s a type most common in men over age 50. Those rogue antibodies disrupt how neurons signal each other, and MRI scans showed they\u2019d targeted a key memory center.",

      "\u201cI lost total mental capacity and fell apart,\u201d Morrill describes it.",

      "Clinical trials, offered at major medical centers around the country, are testing two drugs now used for other autoimmune diseases to see if tamping down antibody production can ease encephalitis.",
      "More awareness of these rare diseases is critical, said North Carolina's Alexander, who sought out fellow patients. \u201cThat's a terrible feeling, feeling like you're alone.\u201d",
      "As for Morrill, five years later he still grieves decades of lost memories: family gatherings, a year spent studying in Scotland, the travel with his wife.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m reentering some real time of fun, joy,\u201d Morrill said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t shooting for that. I just wanted to be alive.\u201d",

      "At the halfway point of annual United Nations climate negotiations in Brazil, it appears the talks may do more than just focus on implementing past promises, as some observers had expected",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren\u2019t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on \u201cimplementation\u201d of past promises not yet kept.",
      "Throw that out the window.",
      "The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action \u2014 on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more \u2014 including from Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2014 the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he'll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqu\u00e9, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.",
      "\u201cI think things have changed, which is a very good thing,\u201d said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there\u2019s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say that what\u2019s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you\u2019re looking at an ambition gap,\u2033 said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of expectation, there\u2019s a lot of excitement here, but there\u2019s also a lot of political signals that\u2019s been sent by President Lula.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It\u2019s almost like a staring contest,\u201d Inventor said. \u201cBut next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.\u201d",
      "Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.",
      "Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.",
      "In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn\u2019t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth's warming.",
      "Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.",
      "So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what\u2019s planned in national pledges and what\u2019s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.",
      "That's not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year\u2019s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.",
      "So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.",
      "On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.",
      "\u201cThe parties will decide how they want to proceed,\u201d do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.",
      "In a casual exchange with a reporter about how the conference is going, COP President do Lago said: \u201cEh, could be better but not as bad it could be.\u201d",

      "Reconnecting with old friends can be challenging",
      "NEW YORK -- When Jennifer Austin met Molly in second grade, they quickly became best friends. They giggled through classes until the teacher separated them, inspiring them to come up with their own language. They shared sleepovers and went on each other's family vacations.",
      "But they gradually drifted apart after Austin's family moved to Germany before the girls started high school. Decades passed before they recently reconnected as grown women.",
      "\u201cStrong friendships really do stay for the long haul,\" Austin, 51, said. \"Even if there are pauses in between and they fade, that doesn\u2019t mean they completely dissolve or they go forgotten. They\u2019re always there kind of lingering like a little light in the back.\u201d",
      "Early friendships are some of the deepest: the schoolmates who shared bike rides and their favorite candy. The roommates who offered comfort after breakups. The ones who know us, sometimes better than we know ourselves.",
      "But as adults take on jobs and the responsibilities of homes and families, it can be challenging to stay connected with everyone we've loved.",
      "Technology plays a role, too. Loneliness has increased since the television was invented and intensified with the introduction of smartphones, according to psychologist Marisa Franco, a University of Maryland assistant clinical professor and author of \u201cPlatonic,\u201d a book about the science of attachment.",
      "Once they've lost touch with friends, some people are reluctant to reach out, fearing rejection. But most of those on the receiving end appreciate the effort more than we expect, Franco said.",
      "\u201cPeople are delighted to hear from their old friends and open to connections,\u201d she said.",
      "Franco suggests reminiscing about a shared memory to span the time and distance. It can be something as simple as, \"This pic came up and I just realized I wanted to check in on you,\u201d she said. Propose a meetup. If the friend lives far away, try scheduling a phone date to catch up.",
      "Below, six people who tried to rekindle lost friendships reflect on distance, loss and reconnection.",
      "Heather Robb and Laine DiPasquantonio were nearly inseparable in their 20s, when they both lived in Boston. They went to concerts and vacationed together. DiPasquantonio was there when Robb met her future husband and attended their wedding as a bridesmaid.",
      "But sometime after Robb married and DiPasquantonio moved to Colorado, their circle of friends scattered. They became busy raising children, juggling jobs and caring for aging parents.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible because you don\u2019t know it\u2019s happening,\u201d Robb, 60, said in a joint interview. \u201cI think it was simply space and time. We were all in different cities, we were all in that busy time of toddlers.\u201d",
      "Years passed with occasional holiday cards and texts but few meaningful interactions. DiPasquantonio saw photos on social media of Robb skiing and traveling with other friends. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure there was so much room for me, from a distance,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAww, I feel badly about that,\u201d Robb replied. \u201cI would argue that's the bad side of social media.\u201d",
      "The women found their way back to each other when Robb, president of Heather Robb Communications, had a business trip to Denver in April. She called to see if DiPasquantonio wanted to get dinner. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if she was going to be that happy to hear from me. I actually had some trepidation in reaching out,\" Robb said.",
      "When she did, Robb learned her friend was about to undergo surgery for breast cancer. Instead of meeting for dinner, DiPasquantonio, a placement specialist at Harmony Senior Referrals, invited Robb to stay for the weekend. A mutual friend flew out to join them.",
      "\u201cI was so tickled that you called and wanted to get together. It was awesome,\u201d DiPasquantonio, 63, said during their interview. \u201cWhat took us so long, right?\u201d",

      "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has broken the glass ceiling to become Japan's first female leader",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Sanae Takaichi made history by becoming Japan's first female prime minister in October. She must now decide whether she'll break another barrier: the taboo barring women from the sumo ring.",
      "The winner of the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament that ends Sunday will be presented with the Prime Minister\u2019s Cup. Some of her male predecessors, including former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, have entered the ring to hand over the cup.",
      "Takaichi, a staunch conservative who supports Japan\u2019s traditional gender and paternalistic values, may not break the taboo. In any case, she won't face a decision on whether to enter the sumo ring this time because she returns a day later from the Group of 20 summit in South Africa.",
      "Her next chance to make a decision will come at the New Year's tournament in Tokyo.",
      "But a debate on the taboo against women likely will continue, in no small part, because a woman now leads Japan. There also is criticism that the ban in sumo and other religious places is out of touch with the changing place of women in Japanese society.",
      "The sumo ring is only part of the controversy.",
      "In Japan, female worshippers have for centuries been banned from certain holy mountains, religious training sessions, temples, shrines and festivals.",
      "Other places in the world have similar taboos, but the one in Japan stems from the belief in female \u201cimpurity\u201d associated with menstruation and childbirth, as well as certain misogynic Buddhist views, says Naoko Kobayashi, an Aichi Gakuin University professor and expert on religion and gender.",
      "The female ban at holy mountains, including Mount Fuji, and religious establishments has been largely eliminated over the years. But it lingers at certain shrines and festivals.",
      "Many of these bans are from the 19th century Meiji era or later, Kobayashi said, and the taboo has been hard to break because women were also kept from political and religious decision-making over the years.",
      "Sumo's origins are linked to rituals for Japan\u2019s indigenous religion of Shinto, which is largely rooted in animism and the belief that thousands of kami, or spirits, inhabit nature. The first sumo matches date back 1,500 years as a ritual dedicated to the kami, with prayers for bountiful harvests, dancing and other performances at shrines.",
      "The dohyo where sumo takes place is an elevated ring made of special clay, with its edge marked by a circle of rice-straw separating the inner sanctuary and the outside world of impurity. It's off-limits to women in professional sumo.",
      "Some experts say sumo follows the Shinto belief in female impurity.",
      "The Japan Sumo Association has denied the female ban is based on the Shinto belief of impurity.",
      "\u201cThis interpretation is a misunderstanding,\u201d said the association chief, Nobuyoshi Hakkaku, in 2018. He said sumo rituals are tied to folk beliefs like being thankful for a good harvest and are not about rigid religious principles.",
      "\u201cWe have consistently denied sexist intentions,\u201d Hakkaku said. \u201cThe rule that makes the dohyo a serious battleground for men is only natural for wrestlers, making the dohyo a male-only world and (leading to) passing down the practice of not having women go up there.\u201d",

Two female medical experts rushed in and started performing first aid as several male sumo officials watched. Two more women tried to join the first-aid effort before announcements demanded the women leave the ring. Sumo officials threw salt afterwards, a gesture of purification.",
      "Days later, the association refused to allow Tomoko Nakagawa, then-mayor of Takarazuka city, to enter the dohyo to give a speech for an exhibition tournament. Nakagawa, forced to speak from the side of the ring, said she was mortified to be rejected just because she is female.",
      "The sumo association chief apologized over the \u201cfailure to take appropriate action in a life-threatening situation\u201d and for making Nakagawa uncomfortable, and formed a panel of outside experts to examine the female ban. Seven years later, a decision is still pending.",
      "\u201cExcluding women under the premise of male-centered traditions and customs can be no longer justified under the values of the times,\u201d Kobayashi, the professor, said.",

      "Takaichi is trying to win back support from right-wing voters who have been drawn to emerging populist groups in recent elections. An attempt to present the trophy in the ring would be seen as defying sumo's traditions and could harm her image with those voters.",

      "Striking a diplomatic tone Thursday in his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskyy said his country needs a peace that ensures Russia does not invade again. He said he would work with the European Union and the Americans.",
      "Here's a look at key elements of the proposal and some context surrounding them.",
      "THE PROPOSAL: The plan says it will confirm Ukrainian sovereignty while also stating that Crimea and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions will be recognized as de facto Russian land, including by the United States. According to the proposal, the borders of the other two regions Russia has partially occupied and claimed as its own \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhzhia \u2014 will be frozen along the front line.",
      "Because Russia does not control all of Luhansk and Donetsk, the plan would, in effect, see Ukraine withdraw from areas Russia has not been able to claim in the fighting. This withdrawal zone would be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as belonging to Russia.",
      "The proposal also says Russia would relinquish other territories it controls outside the five regions, which could include the northeast Sumy region, where Russian forces have crossed the border, and areas around the eastern Kharkiv region that border Russia, although the details are unclear.",
      "THE CONTEXT: Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that Ukraine will never recognize the occupied territories as part of Russia.",
      "For Ukrainians, the main issue with the plan lies in its contradictions, said Oleksandr Merezhko, head of Ukraine\u2019s foreign affairs parliamentary committee. It starts by guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty but then lists several points that would inhibit or violate that sovereignty, he said.",
      "The plan \"is definitely a nonstarter, but I don\u2019t rule out that it might be part of Trump\u2019s game,\u201d Merezhko said. \u201cHe starts with something absolutely absurd, ludicrous, which causes shock, and then he becomes more reasonable.\u201d",
      "THE PROPOSAL: The plan says Ukraine must enshrine in its constitution a commitment not to join NATO and that NATO must adopt a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future. The size of the Ukrainian army would be limited to 600,000 soldiers, and NATO forces would be prohibited from being stationed in Ukraine, a measure that would curtail Kyiv\u2019s right to choose who it cooperates with militarily.",
      "The plan addresses Ukraine\u2019s hopes for membership in the European Union by saying Kyiv should receive short-term preferential access to the European market while it seeks to implement reforms to reach the standards needed for EU membership, including dealing with corruption.",
      "The plan also alludes to security guarantees from Ukraine\u2019s Western allies but without going into detail. It is unclear how the U.S. would ensure Russia does not invade again.",
      "THE CONTEXT: Zelenskyy has continually made the case that NATO membership would be the cheapest way to guarantee Ukraine's future security. Since he took office, President Trump has made it clear that NATO membership is now off the table.",
      "NATO\u2019s 32 member countries said last year that Ukraine is on an \u201cirreversible\u201d path to membership. But some NATO members, led by the U.S., have balked at moving forward with Ukraine while the war rages and before the country\u2019s borders are clearly demarcated.",

      "Archaeologists in Budapest have unearthed a well-preserved Roman sarcophagus, revealing insights into the life of a young woman from 1,700 years ago",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- A remarkably well-preserved Roman sarcophagus has been unearthed in Hungary\u2019s capital, offering a rare window into the life of the young woman inside and the world she inhabited around 1,700 years ago.",
      "Archaeologists with the Budapest History Museum discovered the limestone coffin during a large-scale excavation in \u00d3buda, a northern district of the city that once formed part of Aquincum, a bustling Roman settlement on the Danube frontier.",
      "Untouched by looters and sealed for centuries, the sarcophagus was found with its stone lid still fixed in place, secured by metal clamps and molten lead. When researchers carefully lifted the lid, they uncovered a complete skeleton surrounded by dozens of artifacts.",
      "\u201cThe peculiarity of the finding is that it was a hermetically sealed sarcophagus. It was not disturbed previously, so it was intact,\u201d said Gabriella F\u00e9nyes, the excavation\u2019s lead archaeologist.",
      "The coffin lay among the ruins of abandoned houses in a quarter of Aquincum vacated in the 3rd century and later repurposed as a burial ground. Nearby, researchers uncovered a Roman aqueduct and eight simpler graves, but none approaching the richness or pristine condition of the sealed tomb.",
      "Keeping with Roman funerary customs, the sarcophagus held an array of objects: two completely intact glass vessels, bronze figures and 140 coins. A bone hair pin, a piece of amber jewelry and traces of gold-threaded fabric, along with the size of the skeleton, point to the grave belonging to a young woman.",
      "The objects, F\u00e9nyes said, were \u201citems given to the deceased by her relatives for her eternal journey.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe deceased was buried very carefully by her relatives. They must have really loved who they buried here,\u201d she said.",
      "During the Roman period, much of what is now Hungary formed the province of Pannonia, whose frontier ran along the right bank of the Danube River less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the site. A short distance away stood a legionary camp guarding the empire\u2019s border, and the newly found structures are believed to have been part of the civilian settlement that grew around it.",

      "The sarcophagus and its contents \u201cdefinitely make it stand out,\u201d said Gergely Kosty\u00e1l, a Roman-period specialist and coleader of the project. \u201cThis probably means that the deceased was well-to-do or of a higher social status.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is truly rare to find a sarcophagus like this, untouched and never used before, because in the fourth century it was common to reuse earlier sarcophagi,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is quite clear that this sarcophagus was made specifically for the deceased.\u201d",
      "Excavators also removed a layer of mud roughly 4 centimeters (1.5 inches) thick from inside the coffin that F\u00e9nyes hopes could contain more treasures.",
      "\u201cI suspect we could find jewelry. We haven\u2019t found any earrings or other jewelry belonging to the woman, so I hope that these small items will turn up during the sifting of the mud,\u201d she said.",
      "For F\u00e9nyes, the discovery of the Roman sarcophagus is not only of scientific significance, but an emotionally resonant insight into the devotion displayed by people in an ancient time.",
      "\u201cI was very touched by the care and expression of love that we were able to get a glimpse of,\u201d she said. \u201cEven now, I shudder to think how painful it must have been for the people at that time to bury this young lady.\u201d",

      "Populations of brown bears and wolves are burgeoning in Greece, thanks to conservation efforts",
      "LEVEA, Greece -- It was a shocking sight for the farmer \u2014 three of his sheep lying dead on the ground, signs of their mauling unmistakable. The large paw prints in the earth left no doubt they had been killed by a bear, a once rare but now increasingly frequent visitor in this part of northwestern Greece.",
      "\u201cIt was a bear, a very big one, and they come often now. I wasn\u2019t the only one, it struck elsewhere too,\u201d said Anastasios Kasparidis, adding that another farmer had lost some chickens and pigs. He decided to move the rest of his small flock into a sheep pen near his house for protection.",
      "\u201cBecause in the end I wouldn\u2019t have any sheep,\" Kasparidis said. \"The bears would eat them all.\u201d",
      "Environmentalists have welcomed the rebound of bear and wolf populations in Greece thanks to the protected species designation that banned them being hunted. But some farmers and residents of rural areas say they now fear for their livelihoods and, in some cases, their safety. They are calling for greater protection in a phenomenon playing out elsewhere in Europe, with some arguing conservation has gone too far and pushing to roll back restrictions.",
      "Brown bears, Greece\u2019s largest predator, have made a remarkable comeback. Their numbers have increased roughly fourfold since the 1990s, said Dimitris Bakaloudis, a professor at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki who specializes in wildlife management and conservation.",
      "Up to an estimated 870 brown bears roam the forests of northern Greece, according to the most recent survey by Arcturos, an environmental organization set up in 1992 that provides a sanctuary for rescued bears and wolves.",
      "And it's not just bears. Wolves also have seen their numbers rise. While wolves could only be found as far south as central Greece in 2010, they have now spread to the outskirts of Athens and into the Peloponnese in southern Greece, Bakaloudis said.",
      "Their recovery has been sustained in part by the also increasing population of wild boars, which is unrelated to conservation efforts. Rather, a combination of a number of factors, including a reduction of hunting, milder winters and cross-breeding with domestic pigs have led them to reproduce at a faster rate, Bakaloudis explained.",
      "Viewed by many as pests that destroy crops, the sight of a dozen or more boars trotting along sidewalks or snuffling through backyards are no longer uncommon in many parts of Greece.",
      "The larger number of wild animals has also resulted in more contact with humans \u2014 the vast majority of whom are unfamiliar with how to behave during an encounter. Lack of familiarity has led to fear in some communities, particularly following a small number of serious incidents this year: a child bitten by a wolf, an elderly man injured by a bear in his yard, a hiker bitten by a bear and another hiker who died after falling into a ravine during a bear encounter.",
      "In Levea, a village of about 660 people surrounded by fields in northwestern Greece, several bear encounters were reported in October, while boars frequently roam through the village, said community president Tzefi Papadopoulou. The bears especially had frightened residents.",
      "\u201cAs soon as they heard a dog bark, they were ready to go out with the gun,\u201d she said.",

      "The burgeoning wild boar population, meanwhile, has led to calls for the hunting season to be extended.",
      "Giorgos Panagiotidis, deputy mayor of the nearby small town of Amyntaio, said boars had been increasingly encroaching on houses. In May, he asked authorities for hunters to be allowed to shoot boars out of season to tackle the problem.",
      "It\u2019s an issue that isn\u2019t unique to Greece. In a victory of farmers over environmentalists, European Union lawmakers voted in May to reduce protections for wolves across the EU\u2019s 27 member states. The movement even gained support from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, whose pony Dolly was killed by a wolf three years ago.",
      "Experts note it isn't just the larger number of wild animals that has led to encroachment on urban areas. Many factors are at play, they say, from loss of habitat due to wildfires, to noise disturbances from wind turbines and recreational vehicles, and animals emboldened by dwindling human populations in villages.",
      "\u201cThere is of course fragmentation of the bears\u2019 habitat, frequently there is drought, there\u2019s a lack of food in the natural environment, there\u2019s a desertification of villages which makes inhabited areas more attractive to bears, so they approach and find food,\u201d said Panos Stefanou, communications officer at Arcturos.",
      "Measures to keep wolves and bears at bay have been developed and approved by scientists, said Bakaloudis, the Thessaloniki university professor, including using lights around property, proper disposal of trash and dead livestock and avoiding feeding strays.",
      "In exceptional circumstances more invasive methods are used, he said, such as in the case of the wolf attack on the child in northern Greece, where authorities decided to capture and remove the animal.",
      "With so many factors contributing to increasing encounters between wild animals and humans, Stefanou cautioned against overly simplistic solutions.",
      "\u201cKilling the animals is not what will solve the problem,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Tusk\u2019s government in Poland has struggled to reverse changes to the judicial system made by the previous nationalist, conservative government",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- When Donald Tusk\u2019s government came to power in Poland two years ago, it had high ambitions to roll back a political takeover of the judiciary by its nationalist, conservative predecessor.",
      "The reality proved more complicated.",
      "Law and Justice (PiS), which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023, established political control over key judicial institutions by stacking higher courts with friendly judges, and punishing its critics with disciplinary action or assignments to far-away locations. It appointed enough sympathetic judges to the Constitutional Tribunal that a PiS-aligned president can delay government plans by sending them for constitutional review.",
      "European courts have condemned the PiS changes, while regular Poles found themselves facing legal chaos. Efforts to undo them, however, have been blocked by two successive PiS-aligned presidents.",
      "For over a decade, Poland has been deeply polarized between a bloc of urban, pro-EU voters backing Tusk and a mix of conservatives and other voters frustrated with Poland's post-socialist development, who have favored PiS. The gridlock in justice further divides the population.",
      "Tusk, who came to power promising to fix the situation, removed his first justice minister, Adam Bodnar, in July because he wasn\u2019t seeing enough results.",
      "\u201cAll those dreams have faded away by now and we can forget about them,\u201d Bodnar told The Associated Press. \u201cWe will be in a strange process for the next years.\u201d",
      "His successor, Waldemar \u017burek, a former judge known for his opposition to PiS judicial changes, has taken a more confrontational approach.",
      "In October, \u017burek announced prosecutors were ready to press charges against former Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, the architect of the PiS changes. Prosecutors allege Ziobro misused a fund for victims of violence, including for the purchase of Israeli Pegasus surveillance software.",
      "Tusk\u2019s party says PiS used Pegasus to spy illegally on political opponents while in power. Ziobro says he acted lawfully.",
      "If PiS returns to power at the next parliamentary elections in two years\u2019 time, \u017burek knows he could pay a high price. He speaks with unusual ease about the possibility that he could end up in prison, saying \u201cit would be an honor.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have zero tolerance for criminals,\" \u017burek told The Associated Press. He said he will not allow the abuse of power to go unpunished, \u201ceven if I am threatened that I will be sitting in jail for a long time.\u201d",
      "To fix the judicial system, the government must pass laws \u2014 but under the Polish Constitution, those laws must be approved by the president.",
      "This is where the coalition's project ran aground.",
      "Initially, Tusk\u2019s ministers were forced to cohabit with President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, until the end of his term in August 2025. They saw this as a temporary inconvenience.",
      "As justice minister, Bodnar did propose draft laws and negotiated with the presidential office. Duda didn't budge.",
      "\u201cIt was natural to count on the change of president,\u201d Bodnar said in an interview in Warsaw.",
      "Among his priorities was to reestablish the independence of the body responsible for appointing judges, the National Council of the Judiciary, known by its Polish initials KRS.",
      "In 2018, PiS changed the rules governing KRS, bringing it under party control. As a result, 60% of judges now sitting on Poland's Supreme Court were appointed by the reshaped council.",
      "Bodnar wanted to put KRS back under the control of judges as well as restoring the neutrality of the Constitutional Tribunal.",
      "Instead, what happened was that Nawrocki, an independent candidate backed by PiS, narrowly won a presidential election in June. Analysts said the failure to restore judicial independence was a factor in the defeat of Tusk's coalition.",

      "Where presidential approval wasn't needed, Bodnar says he achieved positive change. He removed court presidents appointed by PiS and ended disciplinary cases against independent judges. Poland joined the European public prosecutor\u2019s office, which means better accountability for how EU funds are spent.",
      "Yet he was perceived as handling the process with kid gloves, advancing carefully and legalistically. Tusk felt he needed someone ready to throw the gloves off. Enter Waldemar \u017burek.",
      "After Nawrocki\u2019s victory, \u017burek presented detailed proposals to fix the justice system, but he says there are already signals from the president's office that they will be vetoed. In November, Nawrocki announced he would not nominate to higher courts judges who opposed PiS changes to the judicial system.",
      "\u201cI would much more prefer it if we could sit down at the table and talk, even in front of cameras,\u201d \u017burek said. \u201cI want to end the Polish-Polish war.\u201d",
      "In the absence of legislative progress, \u017burek\u2019s office has announced efforts to prosecute allies of PiS. The cases are the result of painstaking work by prosecutors, who for months have been investigating accusations that the former government used public office for political goals.",
      "\u201cIf we can\u2019t introduce legislation because the president is blocking us, then we are going to go about it in a different way,\u201d is how legal expert Jakub Jaraczewski, from NGO Democracy Reporting International, sums up Tusk\u2019s tactics. \u201cWe will go after the \u2018bad guys\u2019 and we will make them pay.\u201d",
      "Even without convictions, \u201cdisclosing the truth\u201d about the abuse of power is important for informing voters, said Bodnar.",
      "Nawrocki's election in June indicates that a coalition of Law and Justice and the far-right would win general elections in two years if they decided to run together.",
      "So has Tusk's coalition made enough progress in shoring up judicial independence to ensure PiS will not take revenge if it returns to power?",
      "\u017burek does not answer directly. Instead, he speaks about his readiness to face any costs, including prison time, in fighting for democracy.",
      "If Tusk's camp does manage to hold on to power, it could wait out some of the PiS appointments until they've retired or finished their terms, says Jaraczewski.",
      "But the problems with the Polish judiciary run deeper than the rule-of-law crisis, he cautions. The system is plagued with delays and inefficiencies, undermining trust.",
      "\u017burek has said he wants to fix this, listing it as one of his two priorities alongside restoring judicial independence. However, that would take time, money and cooperation between the new government and PiS appointees.",
      "Jaraczewski says a \u201cbigger conversation\u201d is needed about how to safeguard democracy, pointing to Hungary, where the European Union has raised the alarm about the decline in the rule of law, and the United States, where President Donald Trump has tested the limits of executive power.",
      "\u201cOur constitutional orders should be strengthened against these kinds of takeovers, against the actions of politicians who openly ignore the rule of law,\" Jaraczewski said.",
      "Even then, preserving democracy will still depend on electing people inclined to respect the rules, he says.",
      "\u201cPolitical polarization makes protecting the rule of law harder, as voters will accept anything the party they support pursues \u2014 including the takeover of courts \u2014 and will reject anything that the opposite side proposes, including attempts to undo the damage,\u201d Jaraczewski said. It's therefore \u201ccrucial to reduce polarization and educate society.\"",
      "When PiS was in power, independent Polish judges made an unprecedented effort to reach out to normal citizens, by marching in the streets, organizing a countrywide information tour about the constitution, and speaking at music festivals.",
      "\u201cThe democrats must go beyond the sphere of those who voted for them,\u201d \u017burek argues. \u201cWe must speak also to those who do not understand the language of lawyers, but who take part in elections and can be manipulated by politicians.\u201d",

      "The extremists \u2014 brothers Gareth and Nathaniel Train and Gareth\u2019s wife, Stacey Train -- were among six people killed in a six-hour gunbattle that began on Dec. 12, 2022, in the sparsely populated Wieambilla region west of the Queensland state capital, Brisbane.",
      "The trio killed two police officers, Rachel McCrow and Matthew Arnold, and a neighbor, Alan Dare, who had come to investigate scrub fires the Trains had ignited.",
      "Four police officers had come to Gareth and Stacey Train\u2019s home in response to a missing persons report for Nathaniel Train, who had been a school principal in neighboring New South Wales state.",
      "State Coroner Terry Ryan on Friday accepted psychiatric evidence that the Trains \u201ceach had an undiagnosed and untreated psychotic illness. A shared delusional disorder.\u201d",
      "The disorder began with Gareth Train, the older brother. All three believed the world was about to end in accordance with Christian teachings.",
      "\u201cThey were psychotically unwell and driven by their persecutory beliefs. I consider that Gareth, Stacey and Nathaniel were from the time the Queensland Police Service officers entered their property intent on killing the officers and, if necessary, intent on dying rather than being taken into custody,\u201d Ryan said.",
      "\u201cI accept that while End of Times religious themes became central to their beliefs system, their psychotic disorder was underpinned by broader persecutory beliefs including that the government was evil and that police officers, including the police officers who attended at their property \u2026 were demons intent on killing them,\u201d he added.",
      "Ryan had heard medical evidence, during a 17-day inquiry hearing last year, that shared delusional disorders were exceptionally rare.",

      "\u201cRather I consider they were acting defensively within their delusional framework to defend themselves and their property from what they regarded was an evil advance on them,\u201d Ryan said.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The president of Ukraine is facing a confluence of crises testing his ability to lead an increasingly weary nation nearly four years into a devastating full-scale invasion by Russia.",
      "For more than a week, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has struggled to contain the fallout from a $100 million corruption scandal implicating top officials and other associates. The pressure on Zelenskyy has ratcheted up as the United States pushes a proposal it drew up with Russia that would require major concessions from Ukraine \u2014 and seemingly few from Russia \u2014 to bring an end to the war.",
      "All this is playing out as Russia makes slow but steady advances across parts of the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line and relentlessly bombs Ukraine's power plants, causing severe electricity shortages as colder weather sets in.",
      "Here are 5 things to know about the growing pressures confronting Zelenskyy:",
      "Zelenskyy has been facing a rebellion from lawmakers in his own party since the country's corruption watchdogs revealed that $100 million had been embezzled from the energy sector through kickbacks paid by contractors.",
      "After investigators publicized their findings, Zelenskyy dismissed two top officials and imposed sanctions on close associates. One Zelenskyy associate implicated in the scheme, Tymur Mindich, has reportedly fled the country. Mindich is a partner in a media production company that Zelenskyy was a co-owner of before he became president.",
      "Some Ukrainian lawmakers and activists are calling on the president to sack his powerful chief of staff, Andrii Yermak.",
      "Neither Zelenskyy nor Yermak have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators. But because Yermak is widely believed to decide key government appointments and to have sway in top political affairs, lawmakers believe he should take responsibility as a way to help restore the public's trust.",
      "The Servant of the People party that Zelenskyy leads won over two-thirds of parliamentary seats in 2019. But some politicians warn Zelenskyy could lose his parliamentary majority, or face a split in his party, if he doesn't part ways with Yermak.",
      "Many of Zelenskyy\u2019s political allies feel something has to change, even if they have not gone public with their concerns, said Mykola Davidiuk, an independent political expert. One of the chief criticisms of Zelenskyy's government is that too much power is concentrated in the hands of Yermak and his advisers, Davidiuk said.",
      "\u201cThe management style of Zelenskyy is not working,\" he said.",
      "How decisively Zelenskyy responds to the corruption scandal could determine whether the fallout damages Ukraine\u2019s standing with allies, said Davidiuk.",
      "Russia's invasion triggered martial law in Ukraine, indefinitely postponing presidential and parliamentary elections.",
      "So even if Zelenskyy's grip on parliament weakens and his popularity plummets, he is highly unlikely to be unseated while the war is still going on \u2014 unless he voluntarily resigns.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s presidential term is normally five years and, before the war, the next elections had been scheduled for spring of 2024.",
      "The growing political headwinds Zelenskyy faces could challenge his ability to push through parliament any potential peace deal being negotiated with Russia. And if he were to seek reelection after the war, his chances could be hurt if Yermak is still in the picture, political analysts say.",

      "Many of the activists, scientists and government leaders at United Nations climate talks underway in Brazil have a beef: They want more to be done to transform the world\u2019s food system",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- With a spotlight on the Brazilian Amazon, where agriculture drives a significant chunk of deforestation and planet-warming emissions, many of the activists, scientists and government leaders at United Nations climate talks have a beef. They want more to be done to transform the world's food system.",
      "Protesters gathered outside a new space at the talks, the industry-sponsored \u201cAgrizone,\u201d to call for a transition toward a more grassroots food system, even as hundreds of lobbyists for big agriculture companies are attending the talks.",
      "Though agriculture contributes about a third of Earth-warming emissions worldwide, most of the money dedicated to fighting climate change goes to causes other than agriculture, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.",
      "The FAO didn't offer any single answer as to how that spending should be shifted, or on what foods people should be eating.",
      "\u201cAll the countries are coming together. I don\u2019t think we can impose on them one specific worldview,\u201d said Kaveh Zahedi, director of the organization's Office of Climate Change, Biodiversity and Environment.",
      "Research has generally shown that a plant-based diet can be better for health and the planet. But many people in poverty around the world who are hardest hit by climate change depend on animal sources of protein for survival. People in higher-income countries have more options for a healthy diet without meat. But those people still tend to contribute more to climate change with their dietary choices.",
      "\"We have to be very, very aware and conscious of those nuances, those differences that exist,\u201d Zahedi said.",
      "When world leaders gather every year to try to address climate change, they spend much of their time in a giant, artificial world that typically gets built up just for the conference.",
      "One corner of COP30, as this year's conference is known, featured the alternative universe of AgriZone, where visitors could step into a world of immersive videos and exhibits with live plants and food products. Those included a research farm that Brazilian national agricultural research corporation Embrapa built to showcase what they call low-carbon farming methods for raising cattle, and growing crops like corn and soy as well as ways to integrate cover crops like legumes or trees like teak and eucalyptus.",
      "Ana Euler, executive director of innovation, business and technology transfer at Embrapa, said her industry can offer solutions needed especially in the Global South where climate change is hitting hardest.",
      "\"We need to be part of the discussions in terms of climate funds,\" Euler said. \"We researchers, we speak loud, but nobody listens.\u201d",
      "AgriZone was averaging about 2,000 visitors a day during COP30's two-week run, said Gabriel Faria, an Embrapa spokesman. That included tours for Queen Mary of Denmark, COP President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago and other Brazilian state and local officials.",

Sirens blared through a chaotic day as Chicago police responded to a Border Patrol call for help and confronted demonstrators.",

      "\u201cThe only thing you can do is have faith in God and not be afraid,\u201d Herrera said in an interview at the couple's South Side house, already bedecked with Christmas decorations just days after Halloween. \u201cFear gives way to depression and other things. At the end of the day, they don't deport you to Mexico but you are sick with depression and other things because you didn't have faith in God.\u201d",
      "Hernandez agreed. \"We know people who have fallen into depression. They don't leave the house. It's very sad.\u201d",
      "The couple's Little Village food stand, adorned with American flags, is in a bustling area the Border Patrol has visited often. The two-lane commercial drag is lined with family-owned restaurants serving birria and chilaquiles, and clothing stores with displays of Mexican sports team jerseys and white dresses for quincea\u00f1era parties \u2014 a coming-of-age celebration for 15-year-old girls in Latino families.",
      "Vendors sell sliced fruit and pottery from parked vehicles. Strains of ranchera music from cars and shops add to the festive atmosphere, drawing Mexican immigrant visitors from across Chicago and beyond. A family from Waterloo, Iowa, nibbled corn smothered in mayonnaise, cotija cheese, lime and chili powder at the couple's stand under a cold drizzle.",
      "Many of the couple\u2019s friends haven\u2019t ventured outside in more than two months. That fear has sparked a grassroots effort to buy out street vendors, allowing them to go home early and avoid public exposure.",
      "Sidewalk traffic on 26th Street is livelier than many commercial areas in Chicago, even with the immigration crackdown. It is lined with barber shops, groceries and other businesses that have signs in Spanish and English demanding immigration authorities stay away unless they have a court warrant.",

Herrera and Hernandez say they are eager to share their story to foster understanding of how the Trump administration's push for mass deportations is playing out.",
      "Herrera crossed the border in 2004, followed later by her two children who are now adults living in Chicago. Hernandez made the journey in 2005.

      "\u201cRental Family,\u201d a moving drama from Searchlight Pictures starring Brendan Fraser, is sure to spark interest in Japan\u2019s real-life industry",
      "TOKYO -- Ryuichi Ichinokawa's life could be right out of the movie \u201cRental Family\u201d as the founder nearly two decades ago of the Heart Project business in Japan, which he bills as a surrogate attendance service complete with furnishing of extras and family members.",
      "He has hired dozens of people to act like reporters with cameras and voice recorders, taking notes and milling with real journalists to fill up an otherwise rather vacant event. He has posed as the boyfriend of a woman who needs to discuss legal paperwork with her former spouse. And he has gone to a hospital as a stand-in husband for a woman getting fertility treatments.",
      "\u201cI am being of service to people. I hope they will be happy,\u201d said Ichinokawa, a dapper elderly man who asked The Associated Press to not be photographed lest his identity become public.",
      "\u201cRental Family,\u201d a moving drama from Searchlight Pictures starring Brendan Fraser, is sure to spark interest in Japan's real-life industry. The film, which opens in theaters Friday, centers on Phillip, an American actor who is recruited by a Tokyo \u201crental family\u201d agency in need of a \u201ctoken white guy.\u201d His recurring jobs range from playing video games with a loner to portraying a little girl's long absentee father. It isn't long before Phillip starts to become emotionally invested in what were supposed to be superficial relationships. The film's Japanese supporting cast also bring to life the intense highs and lows of assuming a role in a stranger's life.",
      "In reality, these niche businesses highlight how deeply people in Japan experience loneliness or worry about keeping up appearances. Outsiders may cringe at the idea of paying amateur actors to be fake family members or friends. But users say they find these services comforting and even healing.",
      "The film's director, Mitsuyo Miyazaki whose professional name is Hikari, was born in Japan yet knew little about the concept. Once she learned about it, she couldn't stop thinking about what a unique story it could inspire. So Hikari started researching and found hundreds of companies in Japan that offer rental families or similar services. She spoke with several people in that world.",
      "\u201cI kind of started tackling those questions, and interviewed them on what are the necessities of the business that needs to happen in Japan. And then that\u2019s how I kind of built stories,\u201d Hikari said.",
      "Even at a time when people seek company through Artificial Intelligence, she thinks hiring of actors to fill emotional voids will always be in demand.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they will disappear, honestly, it might just probably expand,\u201d she said.",
      "In Ichinokawa's experience, most people who ask for the service have a certain social status to protect. He has organized visits to a bar for a hostess who wants to impress her employer with lots of clientele. Similar to the movie, Ichinokawa has gone to school events with a single mother and her child, acting as a friendly uncle.",
      "Sometimes Ichinokawa takes extra steps to ensure the facade. If required, he will print fake business cards \u2014 which are routinely exchanged at Japanese gatherings.",
      "Some parts are easy, like being a wedding guest who just sits and eats. But it\u2019s often stressful work. You're coached to avoid uttering the wrong name or background information. You might have to be prepared to talk about childhood memories you have no clue about. Ichinokawa used to scribble names on his hand. He also pores over notes in advance. If he's really desperate, he excuses himself to the restroom.",
      "Payment for getting rented out varies. For Heart Project, the relatively easy roles can make 9,800 yen ($63) for a couple of hours. For the more elaborate parts, the client dishes out 20,000 yen ($130) to 30,000 yen ($190) per person.",
      "Ichinokawa's rule is that you only play a role once. To do it more than once is setting yourself up for failure. And he has never failed in his mission, he added proudly.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel I am acting. I really get angry if that\u2019s what the situation requires,\u201d he said.",
      "Japan has long grappled with loneliness, high suicide rates and a stigma surrounding mental illness. After a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the country examined how the disasters were affecting mental health, said Miwa Yasui, a professor at the University of Chicago whose research includes the influence of culture on mental health.",

      "Judge Cheryl Higgins gave Christopher Darnell Jones, Jr., who had been on the football team, the maximum possible sentence after listening to five days of testimony. Jones pleaded guilty last year.",
      "The penalty includes five life sentences, one each for the killings of Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D\u2019Sean Perry, and the aggravated malicious wounding of Michael Hollins and Marlee Morgan, Cville Right Now reported.",
      "Authorities said Jones opened fire aboard a charter bus as he and other students arrived back on campus after seeing a play and having dinner together in Washington, D.C. The shooting erupted near a parking garage and prompted a 12-hour lockdown of the Charlottesville campus until the suspect was captured. Many at the school of some 23,000 students huddled inside closets and darkened dorm rooms, while others barricaded the doors of the university\u2019s stately academic buildings.",
      "Jones\u2019 time on the team did not overlap with the players he shot and there was no indication they knew each other or interacted until briefly before the shooting.",
      "Jones will be able to apply for parole when he turns 60, WTVR reported.",
      "Higgins said no one was bullying Jones that night and no was threatening him. The sentence was not \u201cvindictive\u201d but rather based on a logical analysis, said Higgins, who is an Albemarle County Circuit Court judge.",
      "Jones had \u201cdistortions in his perception\u201d or reality, but understood his actions, she said, noting that he texted people before the shooting that he would either \u201cgo to hell or spend 100-plus years in jail.\u201d Jones discarded clothing and the gun afterward and lied to police he ran into five minutes later, the judge said.",
      "Within days of the shooting, university leaders asked for an outside review to investigate the school\u2019s safety policies and procedures, its response to the violence and its prior efforts to assess the potential threat of the student charged. School officials acknowledged Jones previously was on the radar of the university\u2019s threat-assessment team.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty daunting, challenging reality when half of our water isn\u2019t necessarily going to be reliable for the future,\" said Brian Richter, president of Sustainable Waters and a senior fellow with the World Wildlife Fund. \u201cSo we have to really address that.\"",
      "By breaking down the balance sheet, the researchers are hopeful policymakers and regulators can determine where water use can be reduced and how to balance supply with demand.",
      "Warnings of what was to come first cropped up in the late 19th century when irrigation in Colorado\u2019s San Luis Valley began to dry the snowmelt-fed river, resulting in diminished flows as far south as El Paso, Texas. Now, some stretches of the river run dry for months at a time. The Big Bend area and even Albuquerque have seen dry cracked mud replace the river more often in recent years.",
      "Irrigating crops by far is the largest direct use of water in the basin at 87%, according to the study. Meanwhile, losses to evaporation and uptake by vegetation along the river account for more than half of overall consumption in the basin, a factor that can't be dismissed as reservoir storage shrinks.",
      "The irrigation season has become shorter, with canals drying up as early as June in some cases, despite a growing season in the U.S. and Mexico that typically lasts through October.",
      "In central New Mexico, farmers got a boost with summer rains. However, farmers along the Texas portion of the Pecos River and in the Rio Conchos basin of Mexico \u2014 both tributaries within the basin \u2014 did not receive any surface water supplies.",
      "\u201cA key part of this is really connecting the urban populations to what\u2019s going on out on these farms. These farmers are really struggling. A lot of them are on the brink of bankruptcy,\" Richter said, linking water shortages to shrinking farms, smaller profits and less ability to afford labor and equipment.",

      "The analysis found that between 2000-2019, water shortages contributed to the loss of 18% of farmland in the headwaters in Colorado, 36% along the Rio Grande in New Mexico and 49% in the Pecos River tributary in New Mexico and Texas.",
      "With fewer farms, less water went to irrigation in the U.S. However, researchers said irrigation in the Mexican portion of the basin has increased greatly.",
      "The World Wildlife Fund and Sustainable Waters are working with researchers at the University of New Mexico to survey farmers on solutions to the water crisis.",
      "Jason Casuga, the chief engineer and CEO of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, said he is not surprised by the findings and was particularly interested in the data on how much water is lost to riparian areas along the river. He talked about his crews clearing thick walls of thirsty invasive salt cedar trees, describing it as an unnatural ecosystem that stemmed from human efforts to manage the river with levees and reservoirs.",
      "While cities and farmers try to conserve, Casuga said there are few rules placed on consumption by riparian areas.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re willing to accept hundreds and hundreds of acres of invasive species choking out native species. And I'm hoping a study like this will cause people to think and ask those kinds of questions because I think our bosque is worth fighting for. As a culture in New Mexico, agriculture is worth fighting for,\u201d he said.",
      "The responses to overuse and depletion are as varied as the jurisdictions through which the river flows, said Enrique Prunes, a co-author of the study and the manager of the World Wildlife Fund's Rio Grande Program.",
      "He pointed to Colorado, where water managers have threatened to shut off groundwater wells if the aquifer that supports irrigated farms cannot be stabilized. There, farmers who pump groundwater pay fees that are used to incentivize other farmers to fallow their fields.",
      "New Mexico's fallowing program is voluntary, but changes could be in store if the U.S. Supreme Court signs off on proposed settlements stemming from a long-running dispute with Texas and the federal government over management of the Rio Grande and groundwater use. New Mexico has acknowledged it will have to curb groundwater pumping.",
      "New Mexico is behind in its water deliveries to Texas under an interstate compact, while Mexico owes water to the U.S. under a 1944 binational treaty. Researchers said meeting those obligations won't get easier.",
      "Prunes said policymakers must also consider the environment when crafting solutions.",
      "\u201cRebalancing the system also means maintaining those basic functions that the river and the aquifers and the groundwater-dependent ecosystems have,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the indicator of resilience to a future of less water.\u201d",

      "California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4.",
      "\u201cWe will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",

      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.",
      "Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over \u2014 often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement\u2019s radar.",
      "Once limited to policing the nation\u2019s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country\u2019s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans\u2019 daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.",
      "The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.",
      "This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration\u2019s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.",
      "The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.",
      "This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America\u2019s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.",
      "The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.",
      "The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers\u2019 behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency\u2019s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency\u2019s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.",
      "Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are \"governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,\u201d the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed \u201cto operate anywhere in the United States,\u201d the agency added.",
      "While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol\u2019s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that \u201clarge-scale surveillance technology that\u2019s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time\u201d might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.",
      "Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America\u2019s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.",
      "\u201cThey are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know \u2026 engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,\u201d Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP\u2019s findings. \u201cThese surveillance systems do not make communities safer.\u201d",
      "In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina\u2019s low country.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck\u2019s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.",
      "But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.",
      "They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash \u2014 money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.",
      "Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paqueter\u00eda El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.",
      "\u201cWe did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,\u201d said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver\u2019s name and get the trailer out of impound.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: \u201cwhisper,\u201d \u201cintel\u201d or \u201cwall\u201d stops. Those stops are meant to conceal \u2014 or wall off \u2014 that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who\u2019s traveling on America\u2019s roads and predicting who is \u201csuspicious,\u201d according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.",
      "In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff\u2019s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.",
      "Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.",
      "At Border Patrol\u2019s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff\u2019s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.",
      "\u201cThe beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there\u2019s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,\u201d said Joel Babb, the sheriff\u2019s deputy who stopped Schott\u2019s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.",
      "According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott\u2019s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott\u2019s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.",
      "Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff\u2019s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.",
      "The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles\u2019 travel patterns \u2014 based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.",
      "In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone\u2019s driver\u2019s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. \u201cNeed BP?,\u201d responded a group member whose number was labeled \u201cbp Intel.\u201d \u201cYes sir,\u201d the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.",

      "Border Patrol's parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers \u201dfor a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,\u201d the document states.",
      "But that\u2019s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major \u2014 and in some places permanent \u2014 fixture of the border region.",
      "In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, \u201ccollects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist \u2026 in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.\u201d Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.",
      "Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls \u201cpatterns of life\u201d of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining \u201cabnormal\u201d routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle\u2019s plates as well as its driver\u2019s face, the official said.",
      "Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field \u2014 develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.",
      "The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are \u201cread\u201d by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system's algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system\u2019s algorithm can flag an unusual \u201cpattern of life\u201d for human inspection.",
      "The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to \u201cDallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta\u201d before ending up south of San Antonio.",
      "Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.",
      "Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company \u201cfor now\u201d had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol\u2019s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.",
      "Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP\u2019s public records requests.",
      "CBP\u2019s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program\u2019s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas \u201cwould permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.\u201d Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.",
      "One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp\u2019s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.",
      "The Border Patrol\u2019s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.",
      "CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops.",
      "Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.",
      "A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.",
      "In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol\u2019s to prioritize border security.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, \u2018Don\u2019t come here,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a \u201ccovert, mobile, License Plate Reader\u201d to pipe data to Border Patrol\u2019s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff's department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency\u2019s surveillance network.",
      "How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol\u2019s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.",
      "In Trump\u2019s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration\u2019s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.",
      "The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.",
      "\u201cWe took Alek\u2019s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,\u201d said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. \u201dWhat we found was something much larger \u2014 a system of mass surveillance that threatens people\u2019s freedom of movement.\u201d",
      "AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite \u201csuspicious\u201d travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged \u201cconducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns\u201d as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.",
      "In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase \u201csubsequent to prior knowledge\u201d when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.",
      "Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.",
      "Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.",
      "\u201cI assume for every one person like me, who\u2019s actually standing up, there\u2019s a thousand people who just don\u2019t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don\u2019t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,\u201d Schott said. \u201cI think there\u2019s thousands of people getting treated this way.\u201d",

      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",

      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness.

      "Children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups are urging parents not to buy AI-powered toys during the holiday season",
      "They\u2019re cute, even cuddly, and promise learning and companionship \u2014 but artificial intelligence toys are not safe for kids, according to children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups urging parents not to buy them during the holiday season.",
      "These toys, marketed to kids as young as 2 years old, are generally powered by AI models that have already been shown to harm children and teenagers, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, according to an advisory published Thursday by the children\u2019s advocacy group Fairplay and signed by more than 150 organizations and individual experts such as child psychiatrists and educators.",
      "\u201cThe serious harms that AI chatbots have inflicted on children are well-documented, including fostering obsessive use, having explicit sexual conversations, and encouraging unsafe behaviors, violence against others, and self-harm,\u201d Fairplay said.",
      "AI toys, made by companies such as Curio Interactive and Keyi Technologies, are often marketed as educational, but Fairplay says they can displace important creative and learning activities. They promise friendship but also disrupt children\u2019s relationships and resilience, the group said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,\u201d said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay\u2019s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the amount of trust young children are putting in these toys can exacerbate the harms seen with older children.",
      "Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for more than 10 years. They just weren\u2019t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel\u2019s talking Hello Barbie doll that it said was recording and analyzing children\u2019s conversations.",
      "\u201cEverything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,\u201d Franz said.",
      "It\u2019s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual \u201c Trouble in Toyland \u201d report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered magnets and button-sized batteries that young children can swallow. This year, the organization tested four toys that use AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cWe found some of these toys will talk in-depth about sexually explicit topics, will offer advice on where a child can find matches or knives, act dismayed when you say you have to leave, and have limited or no parental controls,\u201d the report said.",
      "Dr. Dana Suskind, a pediatric surgeon and social scientist who studies early brain development, said young children don't have the conceptual tools to understand what an AI companion is. While kids have always bonded with toys through imaginative play, when they do this they use their imagination to create both sides of a pretend conversation, \u201cpracticing creativity, language, and problem-solving,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAn AI toy collapses that work. It answers instantly, smoothly, and often better than a human would. We don\u2019t yet know the developmental consequences of outsourcing that imaginative labor to an artificial agent\u2014but it\u2019s very plausible that it undercuts the kind of creativity and executive function that traditional pretend play builds,\u201d Suskind said.",

We will continue to invest in setting the highest standards for safe, secure and responsible AI integration for Miko products.\u201d",

A simple block set or a teddy bear that doesn\u2019t talk back forces a child to invent stories, experiment, and work through problems. AI toys often do that thinking for them,\" she said. \u201cHere\u2019s the brutal irony: when parents ask me how to prepare their child for an AI world, unlimited AI access is actually the worst preparation possible.\u201d",

Many experts stand by carbon-dating of scraps of the cloth that put it in the 13th or 14th century, but many faithful \u2014 some accomplished scientists among them \u2014 say the results might have been skewed by contamination, calling for larger samples to be analyzed. Many insist that the cloth contains pollen from Jerusalem and is woven in a pattern that was unique to the first century.",
      "The cloth, considered a relic by many Christians, was most recently on display in the spring of 2015. While the shroud may never leave Turin, the new exhibit will remain at least through 2030 on the Christ Cathedral campus, next to the famous glass tower and sanctuary erected by televangelist Robert H. Schuller that is now home to the Catholic Diocese of Orange.",
      "The Most Rev. Timothy Freyer, an auxiliary bishop at the diocese, said he hopes the exhibit will reinforce for visitors the power of God\u2019s love for all.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that people of faith will have stronger faith, people who are doubting will come to belief and people with no faith will begin the questioning process and then come to faith,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the highlights of the immersive experience is a re-creation of Christ\u2019s resurrection on Easter morning, with museum visitors sitting in the tomb and watching the shrouded body disappear in a flash of light. The exhibit also features replicas of the spear believed to have pierced Christ\u2019s chest and the helmet of thorns placed on his head.",
      "Philip Rizzo, a parishioner at St. Bonaventure Catholic Church in Huntington Beach who was part of a group that got a preview, said seeing these items up close created a powerful visual representation of Christ\u2019s suffering and sacrifice. Also, he said, witnessing the extensive scientific research conducted on the cloth makes the artifact more relatable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re tangible beings, not just spirit and light,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cScience really helps make that connection.\u201d",
      "While some scientists have criticized the eagerness of Christians to authenticate the cloth, the new exhibit had its origins in such curiosity. Its main proponent was August Accetta, a gynecologist who opened up the Shroud Center of Southern California in 1998 and has studied the cloth's mystery for over three decades.",
      "Accetta said it was the Shroud of Turin that converted him from agnostic to Catholic. His Shroud fascination continued after meeting John Jackson, a nuclear physicist, who in 1978 led a 40-person team of scientists as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project. Their study determined that the cloth was not a manufactured work of art, but contained human bloodstains and that no known physical, chemical or biological process could adequately explain how the image on the Shroud was formed.",
      "Accetta believes, as some other scientists do, that the image was created by a burst of radiation and that a massive amount of energy is required to create the image without burning the cloth.",
      "\u201cOn the shroud, you see four centimeters of anatomically correct information encoded in two microns, which is about half the thickness of a strand of hair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t even begin to understand that, let alone reproduce it.\u201d",
      "To him, the only explanation \u2014 as the interactive exhibit illustrates \u2014 is that the body of Christ became light and the shroud simply collapsed, leaving the fine imprint of his face on the white linen.",

      "BELEM, Brazil -- With a direct letter sent to nations and a draft text released Tuesday, host country Brazil is shifting the U.N. climate conference into a higher gear.",
      "The letter sent late Monday comes during the final week of the first climate summit in the Amazon rainforest, a key regulator of climate because trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that warms the planet. COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago later released a proposal with 21 options for negotiators to choose from on four sticky and interrelated issues.",
      "\u201cIt's text Tuesday and we\u2019re sort of off to the races,\u2019\u2019 said World Resources Institute's David Waskow, who said the nine-page proposal \u201caddresses some of the core questions that have been part of the presidency consultations.\u2019\u2019",
      "The four key political issues are whether countries should be told to do better on their new climate plans; details on handing out $300 billion in pledged climate aid; dealing with trade barriers over climate; and improving transparency, which Waskow said is really about reporting climate progress.",
      "While the options in the draft text \"are a first step, what\u2019s required now is to eliminate the options that add to delay and ignore the urgency of action,\u201d said Jasper Inventor, deputy program director of Greenpeace International.",
      "Tuesday was also a day for speeches from high-level ministers.",
      "\u201cAt this very moment, there are people in a number of countries across the world, including my own, who want to deny the crisis even exists or delay the urgent action we need to address it,\u201d said U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband.",
      "Sophie Hermans, the Netherlands' deputy prime minister, said \"the transition is no longer about setting targets. It is about executing them. And execution requires realism, planning and the ability to adjust when circumstances change.\u201d",
      "The documents ask leaders to hash out many aspects of a potential agreement by Wednesday so that much is out of the way before the final set of decisions Friday, when the conference is scheduled to end. Climate summits routinely go past their last day as nations face balancing domestic concerns with the major shifts needed to protect the environment and cut greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was scheduled to return to Belem on Wednesday and the deadline may be timed for him to push parties together or celebrate some kind of draft agreement, observers said. But many don't think countries will actually be ready with everything Brazilian leaders have asked for by Wednesday. That timeline is \u201cpretty ambitious,\u201d said Alden Meyer, a senior associate at climate think tank E3G.",
      "Brazil\u2019s guidance for the summit, called COP30, is raising hopes for significant measures to fight global warming, which could range from a road map to move away from fossil fuels like oil and coal to more money to help nations build out clean energies like wind and solar.",

      "For technology adopters looking for the next big thing, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is the future. At least, that's what the marketing pitches and tech industry T-shirts say.",
      "What makes an artificial intelligence product \u201cagentic\u201d depends on who's selling it. But the promise is usually that it's a step beyond today's generative AI chatbots.",
      "Chatbots, however useful, are all talk and no action. They can answer questions, retrieve and summarize information, write papers and generate images, music, video and lines of code. AI agents, by contrast, are supposed to be able to take actions on a person's behalf.",
      "But if you're confused, you're not alone. Google searches for \u201cagentic\u201d have skyrocketed from near obscurity a year ago to a peak earlier this fall.",
      "A new report Tuesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston Consulting Group, who surveyed more than 2,000 business executives around the world, describes agentic AI as a \u201cnew class of systems\u201d that \u201ccan plan, act, and learn on their own.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not just tools to be operated or assistants waiting for instructions,\u201d says the MIT Sloan Management Review report. \"Increasingly, they behave like autonomous teammates, capable of executing multistep processes and adapting as they go.\u201d",
      "AI chatbots \u2014 such as the original ChatGPT that debuted three years ago this month \u2014 rely on systems called large language models that predict the next word in a sentence based on the huge trove of human writings they've been trained on. They can sound remarkably human, especially when given a voice, but are effectively performing a kind of word completion.",
      "That's different from what AI developers \u2014 including ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI, and tech giants like Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Salesforce \u2014 have in mind for AI agents.",
      "\u201cA generative AI-based chatbot will say, \u2018Here are the great ideas\u2019 \u2026 and then be done,\u201d said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at Amazon Web Services, in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s useful, but what makes things agentic is that it goes beyond what a chatbot does.\u201d",
      "Sivasubramanian, a longtime Amazon employee, took on his new role helping to lead work on AI agents in Amazon's cloud computing division earlier this year. He sees great promise in AI systems that can be given a \u201chigh-level goal\u201d and break it down into a series of steps and act upon them. \u201cI truly believe agentic AI is going to be one of the biggest transformations since the beginning of the cloud,\u201d he said.",
      "For most consumers, the first encounters with AI agents could be in realms like online shopping. Set a budget and some preferences and AI agents can buy things or arrange travel bookings using your credit card. In the longer run, the hope is that they can do more complex tasks with access to your computer and a set of guidelines to follow.",

      "Dietterich has some quibbles with certain companies using \u201cagentic\u201d to describe \u201cany action a computer might do, including just looking things up on the web,\u201d but he has no doubt that the technology has immense possibilities as AI systems are given the \u201cfreedom and responsibility\u201d to refine goals and respond to changing conditions as they work on people's behalf.",
      "\u201cWe can imagine a world in which there are thousands or millions of agents operating and they can form coalitions,\u201d Dietterich said. \u201cCan they form cartels? Would there be law enforcement (AI) agents?",

Tambe said he's been \u201camused\u201d by the sudden popularity of \u201cagentic\u201d as an adjective. Previously, the word describing something that has agency was mostly found in other academic fields, such as psychology or chemistry.",
      "But computer scientists have been debating what an agent is for as long as Tambe has been studying them.",
      "In the 1990s, \u201cpeople agreed that some software appeared more like an agent, and some felt less like an agent, and there was not a perfect dividing line,\u201d said Tambe, a professor at Harvard University. \u201cNonetheless, it seemed useful to use the word \u2018agent\u2019 to describe software or robotic entities acting autonomously in an environment, sensing the environment, reacting to it, planning, thinking.\u201d",
      "The prominent AI researcher Andrew Ng, co-founder of online learning company Coursera, helped advocate for popularizing the adjective \u201cagentic\u201d more than a year ago to encompass a broader spectrum of AI tasks. At the time, he also appreciated that mainly \u201ctechnical people\u201d were describing it that way.",
      "\u201cWhen I see an article that talks about \u2018agentic\u2019 workflows, I\u2019m more likely to read it, since it\u2019s less likely to be marketing fluff and more likely to have been written by someone who understands the technology,\u201d Ng wrote in a June 2024 blog post.",

      "In a four-page statement announcing her resignation posted on X, Greene repeatedly addressed her recent falling-out with Trump.",
      "\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men,\u00a0should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States,\u00a0whom I fought for,\" she said.",
      "\"I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family way too much, and do not want my sweet district to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms,\" Greene added.",
      "Greene, who has served in the House since 2021, came under attack from Trump last week, when the president announced that he was removing his endorsement of Greene's reelection campaign after she broke party rank and signed onto a discharge petition forcing a vote to order the Department of Justice to release its full Epstein files -- another issue that Greene has come to champion from the campaign trail to Capitol Hill in recent years.",
      "In a social media post Trump called Greene \"a ranting Lunatic\" who has \"gone Far Left.\" In an ensuing online back-and-forth with Greene over the weekend, he called her \"Marjorie 'Traitor' Greene\" and said he would support a primary challenger.",
      "In a video released Friday alongside her statement Greene said, \"My self-worth is not defined by a man, but instead by God.\"",

      "\"When the common American people finally realize and understand that the Political Industrial Complex of both parties is ripping this country apart, that not one elected leader like me is able to stop Washington's machine from gradually destroying our country, and instead the reality is that they, common Americans, The People, possess the real power over Washington, then I'll be here by their side to rebuild it,\" she said.",

      "He added, \"Everyone should read her statement; there\u2019s more honesty expressed in these four pages than most politicians will speak in a lifetime.\"",

Bob Ferguson declared an emergency earlier this week, waiving some safety restrictions on truck drivers to allow more jet fuel to be hauled to the airport by road, and his office said Friday that measure was working to help more fuel reach the airport.

      "Her break with him was a notable fissure in his grip over conservatives, particularly his most ardent base. But her decision to step down in the face of his opposition put her on the same track as many of the more moderate establishment Republicans before her who went crosswise with Trump.",
      "The congresswoman, who recorded the video announcing her resignation while sitting in her living room wearing a cross necklace and with a Christmas tree and a peace lily plant behind her, said, \u201cMy life is filled with happiness, and my true convictions remain unchanged, because my self-worth is not defined by a man, but instead by God.\u201d",
      "Greene had been closely tied to the Republican president since she launched her political career five years ago.",

Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., and other lawmakers.",

      "Nevada gaming regulators voted to fine Caesars Palace $7.8 million Thursday over failing to comply with anti-money laundering rules, settling a case that centered on an illegal bookmaker with ties to the former interpreter for the baseball star Shohei Ohtani.",
      "The Nevada Gaming Control Board alleged that Caesars Palace failed to verify bookmaker Mathew Bowyer's source of funds as he gambled millions of dollars between 2017 and 2024, despite suspicions being raised on several occasions and an anonymous tip that Bowyer was a bookie.",
      "It's the third casino to be fined at least partly in relation to Bowyer's activity; a $10.5 million stipulated fine handed to the Resorts World casino earlier this year was the second-largest ever from the gaming board.",
      "Caesars executives said their systems for catching such behavior had failed.",
      "\u201cThere is no customer that\u2019s worth illegitimate profits. We didn\u2019t catch Bowyer and we should have,\u201d Tom Reeg, the CEO of Caesars Entertainment, said at Thursday's hearing.",
      "Bowyer pleaded guilty to federal charges in 2024, which included running an illegal gambling business and money laundering. Prosecutors said Bowyer took bets from hundreds of people, including Ohtani's former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara.",

      "The Kennedy Center is receiving $7.4 million ahead of the World Cup draw next month",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Kennedy Center said Friday that it is being paid $7.4 million to hold the draw for the World Cup at the performing arts venue on Dec. 5.",
      "FIFA is donating $2.4 million to the Kennedy Center as it prepares to host one of the biggest events in sports, Roma Daravi, the Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, told The Associated Press. Soccer's world governing body \u201chas also given us sponsorship opportunities separate from their commitments for an additional $5 million,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the full picture, it totals $7.4 million to the Kennedy Center, plus incurred expenses,\u201d Daravi added.",
      "The figures, which haven't been previously reported, emerged as Senate Democrats question spending and management practices by Kennedy Center leadership. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, released documents Thursday showing the Kennedy Center entered into an agreement giving FIFA \u201cexclusive\u201d use of the facility from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12 at no cost, arguing that the venue was at risk of losing millions in potential revenue because of the arrangement.",
      "Responding to the committee in a letter and on social media, Richard Grenell, the Kennedy Center\u2019s president, said FIFA paid several million dollars as a sponsor, instead of participating in a traditional rental agreement. He added the FIFA was paying for all expenses related to the event.",
      "Asked for comment on the $7.4 million figure, a spokesperson for Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee said they have requested that the Kennedy Center answer its questions with documents and have not yet received any documents.",
      "More broadly, Democrats sought to portray wasteful spending by the venue\u2019s management, including thousands of dollars spent on meals, champagne and other beverages along with hotel rooms. Whitehouse targeted $10,773.19 spent by Kennedy Center leaders between April 17 and July 2 on private lunches, dinners and alcohol purchases that he said were unrelated to fundraising needs.",
      "In his response, Grenell insisted the food and beverage costs were related to \u201cdonor-based events\u201d and paled in comparison to the amount spent under the Kennedy Center's previous leadership. He wrote that fundraising costs totaled $4 million from April through June 2024 and $9.3 million for the full year.",
      "Whitehouse also questioned $27,185 spent on rooms at the Watergate Hotel for new hires between April 21 and July 16. Grenell said such expenses are incurred as new employees prepare to move to Washington and said the prior leadership spent $878,000 at the Watergate in 2024.",
      "The final weeks of the year are typically a lighthearted period for the Kennedy Center, with the focus on holiday programming and the annual awards program celebrating some of the top artists in the U.S. But the dispute between Whitehouse and Grenell reflects how the Kennedy Center has become a backdrop for partisan politics.",
      "\u201cI have ample reason to be concerned by reports and information that cast doubt on your stewardship of the institution,\u201d Whitehouse wrote in a letter to Grenell.",

      "\u201cI take financial responsibility extremely seriously,\u201d he said, noting that he has raised $117 million this year.",
      "During his first term in the White House, President Donald Trump largely eschewed the Kennedy Center and never attended the annual awards ceremony celebrating the arts. But shortly after returning to Washington this year, he ousted the institution\u2019s leadership, appointed Grenell and filled the board of trustees with his supporters. Trump also announced he was elected the board\u2019s chair.",

The event was widely expected to take place in Las Vegas but Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino started discussions about bringing it to Washington when they attended the Club World Cup final in July. Infantino has forged a close bond with Trump ahead of the World Cup, appearing with the president in the Oval Office earlier this week as the administration announced a new initiative for foreigners traveling to the U.S. for next year's tournament.",

      "The fiery crash of a UPS plane shortly after its left engine flew off its wing and sparked a massive fire during takeoff could spell the end of the 109 remaining MD-11 airliners that have been exclusively hauling cargo for more than a decade.",
      "The fate of the planes won't be determined until after UPS, FedEx and Western Global see how expensive the repairs the Federal Aviation Administration orders will be and learn whether there is a fatal flaw in their design. The package delivery companies may have already been thinking about retiring their MD-11s \u2014 which average more than 30 years old \u2014 over the next few years and replacing them with newer planes that are safer and more efficient. The FAA grounded all MD-11s and the 10 remaining related DC-10s after the crash.",
      "Fourteen people \u2014 including the plane's crew of three \u2014 died after the aircraft crashed into several businesses just outside the Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, on Nov. 4. The plane got only 30 feet (9 meters) into the air.",
      "Mary Schiavo, a former U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General, said it probably won't be worth fixing the planes when better options are available from Boeing and Airbus, though the manufacturers have such a backlog that it takes years to get a plane after it is ordered. Still, it will depend on exactly what investigators find.",
      "\u201cFor them to order inspections and to ground them as readily as they did makes me think that they\u2019re worried about them,\u201d Schiavo said.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday that its investigators discovered cracks in key parts that failed to keep the rear of the engine attached to the UPS plane's wing. The crash reminded experts of the 1979 disaster that killed 273 after the left engine of an American Airlines jet catapulted up and over its wing after takeoff in Chicago.",
      "That crash led to the worldwide grounding of 274 DC-10s, the predecessor to the MD-11. The airline workhorse was allowed to return to the skies because the NTSB determined that maintenance workers improperly using a forklift to reattach the engine damaged the plane that crashed. That meant the crash wasn't caused by a fatal design flaw even though there had already been a number of accidents involving DC-10s.",
      "The lugs that the NTSB said were cracked and failed in the crash earlier this month are located close to the part that failed in the 1979 crash, but they are different. Investigators will have to determine whether there is a common defect between the UPS plane and other MD-11s or whether the problem that caused the engine to fall off was unique to the plane.",

      "Both the DC-10 and MD-11 have some of the highest accident rates of any commercial planes, according to statistics published annually by Boeing. Twice in the 1970s, a DC-10 lost its rear cargo door in flight. The second time in 1974 caused a crash outside Paris that killed 346 people. But airlines loved the DC-10 for years, and the Air Force maintained a fleet of dozens of tankers based on the DC-10 that it flew for decades before retiring them last year.",
      "Formerly independent aircraft company McDonnell Douglas announced the MD-11 in 1984. The three-engine plane appeared promising with its larger capacity and longer range than the DC-10, but its performance never fully lived up to expectations, and newer planes from Boeing and Airbus eclipsed it. Schiavo said the MD-11 was \u201cpractically obsolete\u201d when it came out compared to two-engine planes, which are cheaper to operate. Only 200 MD-11s were built between 1988 and 2000.",
      "Most MD-11s started out carrying passengers, but eventually airlines decided to retire the model in favor of other planes. The last MD-11 passenger flight by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines took place in 2014.",
      "MD-11 aircraft made up about 9% of the UPS fleet and 4% of the FedEx fleet, the companies have said. Western Global only owns 16 MD-11 planes.",
      "Aviation journalist Wolfgang Borgmann, who devoted one of his \u201cLegends of Flight\u201d books to the history of the MD-11s and DC-10, said, \u201cI think there is still much more useful life in them.\u201d He pointed to the B-52 bombers that are still key planes for the Air Force even though they debuted in 1955.",
      "\u201cAge doesn't matter in aviation. It's the maintenance that counts,\u201d said Borgmann, editor of the Aero International magazine in Germany.",
      "Investigators are looking at the maintenance history of the UPS plane closely. NTSB said the last time a detailed inspection was done on its engines was in 2021. A similar inspection was not done during the extended maintenance the plane underwent the month before the crash, and the plane wasn't due for another in-depth engine inspection until after roughly 7,000 more flights. Boeing and the FAA will have to determine whether that current maintenance schedule is adequate.",

      "NCAA athletes and athletic department staff will not be allowed to bet on professional sports after the organization's membership voted Friday to rescind a rule change that would have permitted those bets.",
      "The move follows a string of high-profile gambling cases that have raised questions about the integrity of competition in college and pro sports. In late October, an NBA coach and player were arrested in a takedown of two sprawling gambling operations, and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was accused of exploiting private information about players to win bets on NBA games.",
      "The NCAA announced two weeks ago that it was revoking the eligibility of six men\u2019s basketball players over allegations of sports betting. And on Friday, the NCAA said former Temple guard Hysier Miller placed dozens of bets on Owls games, including some against his team.",
      "The rule change to allow gambling on pro sports would have taken effect on Nov. 1, but under a rarely used rule, each Division I school was given 30 days to vote to rescind the proposal, since it was adopted by less than 75% of the DI cabinet.",
      "More than two-thirds of DI members needed to vote to stop the rule change, and that number was reached on Friday. The 30-day period would have ended Saturday.",
      "Even if the rule had passed, athletes and athletic department staff would have continued to be banned from any betting on NCAA events.",
      "The vote by DI members also applies to Divisions II and III, which had also been poised to allow gambling on pro sports. Such bets will continue to be banned at all three levels.",

    "story": [
      "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints says it has lowered the minimum age for women serving as missionaries from 19 to 18",
      "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced on Friday that it will allow women to serve missions starting as young as 18, lowering the minimum age by one year and making the age requirement the same for men and women.",
      "The change, one of the first big moves by new church President Dallin H. Oaks, equalizes opportunities and is a likely response to increasing numbers of young women who are engaged in the church\u2019s global missions. These opportunities to serve are seen as rites of passages for young church members, who work to recruit new members and share the beliefs of the Utah-based faith that has 17.5 million members around the world. Missions are designed to strengthen their faith, broaden their perspective on the world and prepare many of them for future leadership positions in congregations.",
      "It marks the first time since 2012 that the faith known widely as the Mormon church has changed this rule for missionaries. At that time, the minimum age for missionaries was lowered from 21 to 19 for women and from 19 to 18 for men. That change, seen as a watershed moment for women in the church, led to applications for new missions doubling just within a few days of the announcement.",
      "That rule change led to a significant increase in women serving missions. Currently, about 25,000 of the 85,000 missionaries are women, said Sam Penrod, a spokesperson for the church. That equates to 29% \u2014 a number that has remained consistent over the past decade. That is more than double the 12% of missionaries women accounted for before the 2012 rule change.",
      "The new change will likely lead to even more women serving missions, said Matt Martinich, a church growth researcher for The Cumorah Project, a privately funded research organization.",
      "\u201cIt shows more equality in terms of missionary opportunity,\" Martinich said, adding that he has heard from mission presidents that women also tend to be more effective as teachers and proselytizers.",
      "Church spokesperson Doug Andersen said this change is a reflection of Oaks\u2019 desire to provide \u201cadditional options and flexibility for young women\u201d who want to serve. The 55 new worldwide missions announced for the coming year will also help accommodate the demand, he said.",
      "Yet, some disparities remain. The length of missions remains longer for men than women: two years for men and 18 months for women. And in the statement announcing the change, the church pointed out that every \u201cworthy, able young man\u201d should prepare to serve a mission while it remains optional for women.",
      "The faith reserves its top leadership roles to men.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Thursday ordered President Donald Trump to end the deployment of National Guard troops to the nation\u2019s capital. But the ruling is unlikely to be the final word by the courts, the president or local leaders in the contentious duel over the federal district.",

The ruling marks another flashpoint in the months-long legal battle between local leaders and the president over longstanding norms about whether troops can support law enforcement activities on American streets.",
      "Trump issued an emergency order in the capital in August, federalizing the local police force and sending in National Guard troops from eight states and the District of Columbia. The order expired a month later but the troops remained.",

They have set up checkpoints on highways and supported federal agents in raids that have arrested hundreds of people, often for immigration-related infractions.

      "Here's what to know about the National Guard deployment in the nation's capital.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed the lawsuit against the administration that led to Cobb\u2019s ruling.",
      "Cobb ruled that Trump's troop deployment violated the governance of the capital for a variety of reasons, including that the president had taken powers that officially resided in Congress; that the federal district's autonomy from other states had been violated; and that Trump had moved to make the troop deployment a possibly permanent fixture of the city.",
      "\u201cAt its core, Congress has given the District rights to govern itself. Those rights are infringed upon when defendants approve, in excess of their statutory authority, the deployment of National Guard troops to the District,\u201d Cobb wrote.",
      "The judge also added that D.C. \u201csuffers a distinct injury from the presence of out-of-state National Guard units\u201d because \u201cthe Constitution placed the District exclusively under Congress\u2019s authority to prevent individual states from exerting any influence over the nation\u2019s capital.\u201d",
      "Cobb added that repeated extensions of the troop deployment by the National Guard into next year \u201ccould be read to suggest that the use of the (D.C. National Guard) for crime deterrence and public safety missions in the District may become longstanding, if not permanent.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has three weeks to appeal the decision and White House officials have already vowed to oppose it. Troops remained stationed around the city on Friday after the ruling came down.",
      "Before the ruling, states with contingents in the capital had indicated their missions would wrap up around the end of November unless ordered otherwise by the administration. According to formal orders reviewed by The Associated Press, the Washington D.C. National Guard will be deployed to the nation\u2019s capital through the end of February. One court document indicated that the contingent could stay into next summer.",

      "Democratic Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii predicts Americans will want a peacemaking leader by 2028",
      "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Gov. Josh Green, a Hawaii Democrat who has floated the possibility of running for president, predicted that Americans will want a peacemaker once Donald Trump\u2019s second term is over \u2014 and California Gov. Gavin Newsom may not fit the bill.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, Green doubted that politicians skilled in \u201chand-to-hand combat\u201d would be successful with voters weary of political conflict.",
      "The remarks reflect how ambitious Democrats are already jockeying for position in a crowded field of White House hopefuls three years before the next presidential election, especially with no heir apparent and uncertainty about how the party regains power in Washington.",
      "Newsom is a leading Democratic contender who has drawn attention as one of Trump's most high profile antagonists. But Green, a moderate who has occasionally frustrated liberal interest groups, said he worries that Newsom will be seen as \u201ca radical from California.\u201d",
      "Green said he has deep respect for Newsom and his successful fight to redraw U.S. House districts in California to help Democrats in the midterm elections.",
      "\u201cBut if Gavin is ultimately going to win over America, he will have to also adopt some of the conciliatory, collegial rhetoric \u2014 or even policy ideas \u2014 that others are going for,\u201d Green said Thursday during a meeting in Arizona of the Western Governors Association.",
      "Spokespeople for Newsom did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Green said he's hopeful both parties will nominate candidates committed to healing the deep partisan divide, warning that the country is \u201cdangerously close to a political civil war.\u201d He named Democratic Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, along with Republican Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah and himself.",

      "His office has also relentlessly mocked the president by mimicking his style on social media, trying to get under his skin while earning laughs \u2014 and attention \u2014 from Democrats who are eager for a more confrontational approach.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A group of public school students' parents and taxpayers has filed a lawsuit challenging Tennessee's new statewide school voucher program, saying that allocating nearly $150 million in state funding to help parents send their kids to private schools is unconstitutional.",
      "In their lawsuit filed Thursday in Davidson County Chancery Court, the plaintiffs requested injunctions to block the Republican-backed law while the case proceeds.",
      "Similar scholarship and voucher initiatives have proliferated in Republican-led states such as Texas, which passed a $1 billion program. States have increasingly offered vouchers to families beyond only the neediest ones, contributing to budget concerns as expenses rapidly pile up.",
      "Tennessee's voucher initiative allows 20,000 education vouchers of about $7,300 each for the 2025-26 school year. Half go to specific categories of students, such are those who are lower income or disabled. Any student entitled to attend a public school can apply for one of the remaining 10,000. Students who were already enrolled in private schools, including religious ones, are eligible.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who pushed for the initiative, has indicated that he wants to seek funding for more vouchers during the coming legislative session. His office says more than 40,000 families have applied for the program.",
      "The lawsuit argues that the Tennessee Constitution includes an obligation to provide a system of free public schools and does not allow for the state to to maintain and support K-12 schools outside of the public school system.",
      "It says schools that participate \u201cmay deny admission or otherwise discriminate based on race, disability, religion, English proficiency, LGBTQ+ status, academic ability, or other criteria.\u201d They are not required to provide services that public schools must offer, such as special education, and are not free to attend, the lawsuit states.",
      "Additionally, the private schools accepting vouchers are not required to administer the full Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program, which public schools must, and can instead opt for a national standardized test, the lawsuit says.",
      "The initiative also reduces funding for public schools below an already inadequate level, further violating the state constitution's guarantee of public schools that offer all students the opportunity to receive an adequate education, the plaintiffs contend.",

It siphons desperately needed resources away from public schools that serve all students and hands that money to private schools with no accountability, no transparency, and no obligation to serve every child.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A special election in Tennessee has gained national attention in a heavily Republican district",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- For weeks, a Tennessee special election was flying under the radar in a heavily Republican congressional district. But now funding from President Donald Trump\u2019s allies and an appearance by former Vice President Kamala Harris have turned the Dec. 2 contest into a marquee political battle with potential consequences for next year's midterms.",
      "The race is the first for federal office since the Nov. 4 elections, when Democrats cruised to victories that were framed as a referendum on Trump. Now Republicans want to change the storyline, sinking money into the campaign and inviting Trump to visit the state after holding a virtual rally last week.",
      "Failing to run up the score \u2014 or worse, losing the seat \u2014 would be a sign of weakness, emboldening Democrats as they try to take back control of the U.S. House. If places like Tennessee's 7th congressional district seem within reach, the party could expand its list of targets next year.",
      "MAGA Inc., a Trump-supporting super PAC, has reported more than $1 million in spending so far to support Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate and former Army helicopter pilot who served in combat tours overseas. It\u2019s the first time that the organization has participated in a campaign since last year\u2019s presidential race.",
      "With the election taking place just days after Thanksgiving, \u201cI\u2019m very concerned that we could be caught with our pants down,\" said Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the request for Trump to campaign for Van Epps, which was disclosed by two people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "State Rep. Aftyn Behn, the Democratic candidate and progressive community organizer, is getting national support of her own, including a visit by party chair Ken Martin.",
      "The Tennessee Democratic Party hosted Harris for a canvassing kickoff on Tuesday while she was in Nashville on her book tour. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said it hadn\u2019t invited the former vice president, who didn\u2019t appear with Behn even though they spoke at different times at the same event.",
      "Libby Schneider, deputy executive director at the Democratic National Committee, said a strong showing by Behn \u2014 even if she doesn't win \u2014 will boost the party as it tries to take back control of the U.S. House next year.",
      "\"We continue to overperform in places where we have no business overperforming,\" Schneider said.",
      "In four previous special House elections that were completed this year, the Democratic candidate exceeded Harris\u2019 vote share by an average of 9 percentage points.",
      "Tennessee organized a special election after Republican Rep. Mark Green, first elected in 2018, retired earlier this year.",
      "Green won the district by 21 percentage points in 2024, and Trump scored a similar margin. It was one of three seats redrawn in redistricting in 2022 that attempted to erode the influence of Nashville, the state's largest city and a Democratic bastion.",
      "Van Epps, a former state general services commissioner, has closely aligned himself with Trump, whose endorsement helped him win a crowded primary.",
      "\u201cI will have your back 100%,\" he told the president during the virtual rally. He pledged to focus on lowering costs and helping veterans, plus supporting Trump's immigration enforcement and rules preventing transgender women from playing on women's sports teams.",
      "Behn, who describes herself as a \u201cpissed off social worker,\u201d narrowly won Democrats' four-way primary. She supported Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential primary, and she was removed from the Tennessee House gallery in 2019 for shouting in protest of the former speaker.",

      "\u201cWe have been building the coalition of the disenchanted,\u201d Behn said at a recent Nashville rally. \u201cIf you are upset about the cost of living and the chaos of Washington, we are your campaign.\u201d",
      "Behn has condemned Trump\u2019s tax and spending legislation known as the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d and his tariffs, both of which Van Epps supports. She also has criticized Republicans\u2019 reluctance to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a sex offender who became infamous for his connections to the rich and powerful.",
      "Van Epps originally opposed a House vote to force the Justice Department to disclose more documents, but changed his stance to mirror Trump after the president backed the measure this week.",
      "Democratic allies hope to undermine Van Epps by promoting Jon Thorp, a conservative independent candidate in the race. Your Community PAC, which has spent more than $16 million supporting Democratic candidates across the country since last year, is sending out mailers that encourage Republicans to vote for Thorp by describing Van Epps as a \u201chedge fund billionaire-backed RINO.\u201d",
      "The bulk of the PAC\u2019s funding has come from North Fund, a nonprofit umbrella group for left-of-center advocacy organizations.",
      "Conservatives for American Excellence, backed by megadonor Ken Griffin, is spending over $600,000 in advertisements opposing Behn, according to a campaign finance report filed this week.",

      "Chip Saltsman, a Tennessee political strategist not involved in the race, said the slew of spending does not change his expectation that Van Epps will win. But he could fall short of previous margins.",
      "He suggested that Republicans take \u201ca extra couple swigs of Pepto Bismol on election night.\"",

    "story": [
      "Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.",
      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.",

      "\"You know, while I was writing it, I wasn't really sure that it was going to see the light of day,\" Allen told CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason in an interview for \"CBS Mornings\" that aired Thursday, describing the music as \"an act of desperation.\" The studio album, released in late October, was written during the breakup of her nearly 4-year marriage to \"Stranger Things\" actor David Harbour.",
      "The theme of what's been described as Allen's epic \"breakup album\" centers around tales of a deceptive partner, which the singer says is based partly on truth and partly on fantasy.",
      "Harbour has not directly addressed his breakup with Allen or commented on her \"West End Girl\" album. But in an interview with Esquire UK, published around the album's release, Harbour discussed the importance of accepting your mistakes. \"I'd change everything or nothing. If you accept your past, you accept it completely, even the pain, the mistakes... It's all part of the journey, the growth, the wisdom, the empathy, and the connection, and if you change one thing, you change everything,\" he told the magazine at the time, adding that his work is about being honest.",
      "New album says \"everything that I needed to say\"",
      "But Allen said it was a \"nightmare\" holding onto the album and stunted her healing process. She felt a sense of relief and peace when she finally was able to share her words with the world.",
      "\"Since I've put it out, it's felt completely and utterly liberating. It was kind of hellish having it in the background,\" Allen said. \"I don't know. I just feel like I couldn't \u2013 it said everything that I needed to say. And I felt like I couldn't really like get on with my life until I'd said it.\"",
      "Her newly released music quickly lit up social media, with fans reacting to it on TikTok.",
      "Allen wrote most of the record within the span of 10 days at the end of last year. She was excited to complete the album, but at the same time her personal life was falling into pieces.",
      "After spending Christmas with her two daughters whom she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper, Allen decided to check herself into a treatment facility.",
      "\"I knew the things I was feeling were too intense,\" Allen explained her decision to seek professional help at the time following her separation. As a recovering alcoholic, Allen said she's not afraid of working on herself and knew she needed some quiet time.",
      "A cathartic release",
      "The Brooklyn townhouse that Allen and Harbour gave Architectural Digest a tour of in 2023 is now listed for around $8 million. The pair bought the home in early 2021 shortly after they got married.",
      "Allen said her music was cathartic \u2013 for herself and her children.",
      "\"All of the pain that, you know, that I've been through in the past year, they've been through too,\" Allen said. \" But you know, one thing that I wanted to do was to show my kids that, you know, you can use that pain and harness it and turn it into something else. And I think I've done that.\"",
      "Now, Allen is preparing for her 2026 tour \u2013 her first since she got sober in 2019.",
      "The singer said she's planning her touring schedule around her girls' holidays so they'll be able to come and bring their friends.",
      "\"I can't wait to have them there. It's like, it's gonna be... It's as much for them as it is for me,\" Allen said, adding that she feels like she's living her best life after a year of healing.",

      "\"Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise,\" McIntosh said in a statement. \"The data reflects that, with the Cambridge Dictionary website seeing spikes in lookups for 'parasocial.'\"",
      "A recent example of this happened when pop star Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce announced their engagement. Many fans who have been captivated by Swift's lyrics for years celebrated the moment despite not actually knowing her or Kelce.",
      "But parasocial relationships can become problematic, Simone Schnall, a professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, said.",
      "\"We've entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers,\" Schnall said. \"This leads to a sense that people 'know' those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. Yet it's completely one sided.\"",
      "The trend is also evolving to include artificial intelligence.",
      "\"Parasocial trends take on a new dimension as many people treat AI tools like ChatGPT as 'friends,' offering positive affirmations, or as a proxy for therapy. This is an illusion of a relationship and group think, and we know young people can be susceptible for this,\" Schnall said.",
      "Cambridge Dictionary's announcement follows Dictionary.com naming \"67\"\u00a0as its 2025 word of the year.",

    "story": [
      "YouTuber and social media influencer Jack Doherty was arrested for drug possession and other charges in Miami Beach after he was found disrupting traffic to allegedly film social media content, police said.",
      "Miami Beach Police announced that the 22-year-old was taken into custody early Saturday on multiple charges, including possessing amphetamine and marijuana, along with resisting an officer without violence.",
      "\"The Miami Beach Police Department remains steadfast in its commitment to maintain public safety and order throughout the city\u2014regardless of celebrity status,\" the agency said. \"The Department will continue to take proactive enforcement action against behavior that endangers residents, visitors, or officers and will hold all individuals accountable under the law.\"",
      "Later Saturday night, Doherty posted a TikTok video showing him bonding out of jail with the caption \"I got arrested last night and now I'm free.\"",
      "\"I'm a free man, baby,\" he said in the video, while holding the property bag that held his personal items at the time of his arrest. \"Let's go.\"",
      "According to his bio on Delka Talents, his talent agency, Doherty has over 3.2 million YouTube subscribers and over 500 million YouTube views. Doherty is best known for filming \"daredevil\" stunts and pranks, and his most-watched video has over 18 million views as of March 2018, his bio said.",
      "CBS News Miami has reached out to Doherty's representatives for comment on his arrest.",
      "An influencer blocks traffic for the sake of \"content\"",
      "Around 3:12 a.m. Saturday, Miami Beach Police officers were conducting a high-visibility detail along the 700 block of Washington Avenue within the city's Entertainment District, when a group of individuals entered the roadway from the east sidewalk into the northbound lanes. A man from the group -- later identified as Doherty -- separated from them and attempted to engage officers to \"create video content, positioning himself in the middle of the roadway with passing vehicular traffic and creating a significant safety hazard,\" according to arrest documents obtained by CBS News Miami.",
      "Miami Beach Police officers began issuing multiple commands to direct Doherty to exit the roadway, but he refused. Even after his group urged him to comply, he continued refusing officers' commands.",
      "Officers continued, warning Doherty that failure to comply would result in his arrest. Still, the influencer continued to refuse commands and told them, \"Once I'm done with this bet,\" the arrest documents said. At this moment, Miami Beach Police safely apprehended Doherty in the middle of the road due to his \"deliberate refusal to follow lawful orders and continued to obstruct traffic.\"",
      "According to arrest documents, while officers searched Doherty's person, they found \"half of an orange oval-shaped pill with 3 imprinted on it, consistent with a Schedule II amphetamine, as well as a black plastic container holding three hand-rolled suspected cannabis cigarettes weighing approximately 4.0 grams combined.\"",
      "After a records check that showed no active warrants, officers took Doherty to Miami Beach Police's holding facility for booking and contacted an after-hours attorney for charging guidance.",

      "In \"Defying Gravity: The Creative Career of Stephen Schwartz, from Godspell to Wicked\" (published by Applause Books), biographer Carol de Giere explores the life and work of the Grammy- and Oscar-winning composer of treasured Broadway and movie hits.",
      "Read an excerpt below, in which Schwartz finds the inspiration of what will become his most successful musical production to date, when he discovers Gregory Maguire's prequel to L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" \u2013 the genesis of the long-running Broadway musical \"Wicked.\"",
      "And don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Stephen Schwartz on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 16!",
      "\"Defying Gravity\" by Carol de Giere",
      "Landing in Oz",
      "\"It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap!\" \u2014Wicked",
      "At the start of 1996, Stephen Schwartz never imagined he would end the year envisioning his next Broadway musical, Wicked. Movie songwriting seemed to be his future, especially after one eventful evening in March. He donned his newly-purchased black tuxedo and white silk dress shirt, strode across the red carpet, and met up with his Pocahontas writing partner Alan Menken at Los Angeles' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. For forty-eight-year-old Schwartz, being nominated for an Academy Award was a welcome twist on his childhood dream of writing musicals for the stage. With his parents and wife in the audience, he waited for the announcement.",
      "\"And the Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score goes to\u2026\" An expectant silence settled in the hall while presenter Quincy Jones opened the envelope.",
      "\"Alan Menken, musical and orchestral score, and Stephen Schwartz, lyrics, for Pocahontas.\" Applause burst out while the pair made their way to the stage. As Menken thanked their Pocahontas music team, Schwartz clutched his golden statuette and smiled, looking down at Mel Gibson in the front row making funny faces at him and soaking in the acknowledgment from Hollywood. That evening he and Menken also stepped up to accept the award for Best Original Song, \"Colors of the Wind.\"",
      "Back home in Connecticut, he placed his gold-plated statuettes beside his Grammy gramophones in a trophy case converted from an aquarium that his kids no longer used.",
      "The rest of the year was a busy one, with the premiere of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and early work on The Prince of Egypt involving meetings with the DreamWorks team and the writing and demo-ing of songs. He was also working on an early production of a revue musical Snapshots in Seattle, confident that when finally finished, the show would go direct to stock and amateur licensing rather than to a commercial production. The one thing he was emphatically not doing was planning anything new for Broadway.",
      "Then towards the end of the year, a phone call came that would change everything. He was in Los Angeles finishing some work on The Prince of Egypt when his long-time buddy, songwriter John Bucchino, called him from the island of Maui in Hawaii. Singer-songwriter Holly Near had hired Bucchino as a piano accompanist for her performances at a conference at the tropical getaway. Once on Maui, Bucchino decided it was too good not to share. His room included an extra bed, and he had a car and free food. \"If you can cash in some frequent flyer miles and come for the weekend, you'll have a free vacation in Hawaii,\" Bucchino offered.",
      "\"Why not?\" thought Schwartz. He had the weekend free, and after all, it was Hawaii. \"I am so there,\" came Schwartz's answer from LA, and by December 16th, he was.",
      "When Bucchino and Near had a block of time away from the stage, they organized a snorkeling adventure with Schwartz and Near's friend, Pat Hunt. A small boat sped them over to Molikini, a mostly submerged volcanic crater popular for its rainbow spread of sea creatures that delight snorkelers.",
      "On the trip back, Holly casually mentioned to Stephen, \"I'm reading this really interesting book called Wicked, by Gregory Maguire.\"",
      "The novel's title sounded intriguing. \"I think I've heard of it. What's it about?\" he inquired.",
      "\"It's the Oz story from the Wicked Witch of the West's point of view.\"",
      "In an instant, Schwartz's imagination flashed through the implications of a backstory for The Wizard of Oz told from the perspective of the unpopular witch. His reaction was visceral: \"All the hairs on my arms stood on end,\" he recalls. \"I thought it was the best idea for a musical I had ever heard.\"",
      "As soon as he returned to his LA apartment, he called his attorney in New York, inquiring about Maguire's 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. \"Okay, this book has been out for a while, so somebody has the rights. I need you to find out who has them. Meanwhile, I'm going to get the book and read it, because I think I have to do this.\"",
      "There was no way around it. This was a Broadway concept not suited to a small-budget theater company. And he knew it was a highly theatrical idea, not one meant for film or television. Although he had firmly decided, indeed pledged, never to work on Broadway again, his instincts didn't leave him a choice.",
      "But with such a popular novel, surely someone in Hollywood was converting it to the silver screen. Schwartz would have to stop them, and somehow inspire the rights holders to consider instead the risky, expensive, and time-consuming venture of producing a musical in New York City.",
      "While his attorney, Nancy Rose, followed clues on the rights trail, Wicked's prospective composer-lyricist read the novel and confirmed that his hunch had been right: musicalizing the Wicked Witch's story seemed \"quintessentially an idea for me,\" meaningful enough to be worth the potential struggle.",
      "For one thing, he loved looking at traditional stories from a new angle. When he was in college he saw Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Tom Stoppard's play in which two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet are made the central characters. \"It was a revelation to me,\" he recalls. \"From that point on, the idea of looking at familiar material from an unfamiliar point of view became a goal for my own work.\" Godspell had approached the New Testament in a fresh way, Children of Eden reworked Genesis for a new take on family life, and The Prince of Egypt explored the Exodus story from the standpoint of the brother relationship between Moses and Ramses. But Gregory Maguire's twist on The Wizard of Oz was a chance to do something more directly like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern concept. \"I recognized immediately that this was a genius idea and that it was an idea for me: the way it took a familiar subject and spun it,\" Schwartz recalls.",
      "Wicked also felt inherently musical to him. \"Elphaba is a very musical character with big emotions. She is fantastical. The world is fantastical. Glinda is very musical.\" To him it was clear that the world of musical theater was where the story belonged.",
      "And then there was the character Maguire's vision had moved to the center of the story: Elphaba, the quirky and misunderstood green girl who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Maguire named her after L. Frank Baum, who penned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, when he pondered the sound of the author's initials \"eL\" \"Fa\" \"Ba.\" Elphaba's story seemed close to Schwartz's own emotional experience. He knew what it felt like to be \"green\" and what inner resources are needed to carry on with life. \"The idea of the story created a sympathetic resonance in me,\" Schwartz affirms, \"and I know that I'm not alone. Anyone who is an artist in our society is going to identify with Elphaba. Anyone who is of an ethnic minority, who is black or Jewish or gay, or a woman feeling she grew up in a man's world, or anyone who grew up feeling a dissonance between who they are inside and the world around them, will identify with Elphaba. Since that's so many of us, I think there will be a lot of people who will.\"",
      "\"There were things that I knew right away. I knew how it was going to begin, I knew how it was going to end, I knew who Elphaba was, and I knew why\u2014 on some strange level\u2014this was autobiographical even though it was about a green girl in Oz.\" \u2014Stephen Schwartz",
      "Schwartz bought a spiral notebook in which he would capture all his story and lyric ideas\u2014snatches of inspiration, research notes, lists of rhyming words, first drafts of lyric lines, and later drafts. On the black cover, the manufacturer's slogan, \"Five Star\u2014In a Class By Itself,\" hinted at what would become of the musical that began as penciled scrawls on the lined pages.",
      "Maguire had created, as the author himself described it, a dense, almost nineteenth-century-type novel that takes place over thirty-eight years and has thirty-eight speaking parts. Could any group of musical collaborators successfully distill these ingredients into a viable evening of theater?",

    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

      "When songwriter Stephen Schwartz sits at the piano, he feels the music. \"When I was a kid and playing my Beethoven \u2026 I would play that bar over and over again, and cry. It's very embarrassing! Beethoven, living in a world that has nothing to do with ours, but he writes, and it speaks to us across the centuries.\"",
      "Schwartz knows a little something about speaking to audiences. He's the composer and lyricist of \"Wicked,\" the blockbuster stage musical-turned-two-part movie musical. Part two, \"Wicked: For Good,\" opens Nov. 21.",
      "The prequel to the classic \"Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" tells the story of Elphaba (played by Cynthia Erivo), who grows up to be the Wicked Witch of the West. The bubbly Glinda (played by Ariana Grande) becomes the Good Witch of the North.",
      "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo perform \"Popular,\" from \"Wicked\":",
      "Schwartz has been telling stories through song for over five decades. \"My sort of glib joke where people say, like, how do you write a song? I just say, tell the truth and make it rhyme,\" he said. \"And if I can be honest enough, then that'll speak to other people.\"",
      "\"Wicked\" opened 22 years ago, making it the fourth-longest-running Broadway show in history.",
      "And where was Schwartz on the night of Oct. 30, 2003? \"Well, that was the opening night of 'Wicked' on Broadway, and therefore, I was not at the Gershwin Theatre, because I don't go to my own openings,\" he said. \"It's too nerve-wracking for me. I don't like the opening night parties where everybody is just waiting to hear what reviews come in.\"",
      "Kristin Chenoweth originated the role of Glinda on Broadway. She and Schwartz have reunited for the recently-opened new musical, \"The Queen of Versailles.\" \"I'm working with my Rodgers and Hammerstein; it's just packed into one person,\" she said of Schwartz. \"There's not five of him. There's one. He's original. He's singular. And there's nobody else like him.\"",
      "Schwartz grew up on New York's Long Island. A prodigy, he attended the prestigious Juilliard School as a high schooler. Just after college, he collaborated on the musical that became his first big hit, \"Godspell.\" The musical features a ragtag group who help Jesus tell various parables.",
      "I asked, \"It's a musical with Jesus as a central character. You're a Jewish guy. Did you think, well, alright, I'll give it a go?\"",
      "Schwartz replied, \"I think one of the things that made 'Godspell' work was the fact that I didn't know a lot of those stories. So, I think I came to it with a kind of fresh eye about not preaching to the converted, so to speak.\"",
      "In 1972, Schwartz brought that fresh eye to the story of \"Pippin,\" a young man searching for the meaning of life in the Middle Ages. Hit #3, 1974's \"The Magic Show,\" starred magician Doug Henning. Schwartz was 3-for-3, with all three playing simultaneously on Broadway when he was just 27 \u2013 a theatrical trifecta that Schwartz described as \"very dizzying.\"",
      "\"The truth is, when you are very young and unprepared for a success, it can be difficult to handle,\" he said. \"It was difficult for me to handle. I think I got very, quite full of myself. I got kind of difficult to deal with. I kept thinking, well, why isn't everybody just doing exactly what I say? I lost somewhat the ability to collaborate. You know, it took some failures to kind of learn how to deal with both success and failure.\"",
      "The failures came in short order, a \"four-fecta\" of flops\": \"Working\" (which closed after a month), and 'Rags\" (which closed after four performances), while \"The Baker's Wife\" and \"Children of Eden\" never made it to Broadway.",
      "I noted, \"You haven't always been critic's choice.\"",
      "\"I'm almost never a critic's choice,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Why? \"I have no idea,\" he said. \"I'll be frank about it, you know, I wish I got Steve Sondheim's reviews.\"",
      "\"But listen, as great as he was, his shows didn't run the way yours have.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the grass is always greener,\" Schwartz replied.",
      "In the early 1990s Schwartz stepped away from the piano. Had he quit Broadway? \"Absolutely, a hundred percent,\" he said.",
      "\"Did you worry that you were out of juice?\" I asked.",
      "\"Totally, yeah. And in the '90s, I actually went back to school. I was pursuing a degree in psychology. I was gonna become a therapist.\"",
      "Studying to become a therapist turned out to be quite therapeutic. \"I think that time away reminded me of how to behave myself and how to collaborate and how to deal with other people, and not just come in like a bull in a china shop,\" he said.",
      "When he returned to songwriting, it was not for Broadway, though, but for Hollywood, writing songs for \"Pocahontas,\" \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" \"Enchanted,\" and music and lyrics for \"The Prince of Egypt.\" He picked up three Academy Awards along the way.",
      "\"The Colors of the Wind,\" from \"Pocahontas\":",
      "But Stephen Schwartz's home will always be the stage. \"I feel so blessed and so fortunate that work I've done has this ongoing life that I know is gonna keep going when I'm not here on this planet anymore,\" he said. \"Listen, I'm 77 years old, and they still let me do this!\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 16:23:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The new dummy, known as THOR-05F, contains female-specific proportions, according\u200b to the Transportation Department.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation introduced a new female crash dummy as it seeks to step up safety for women, who face a higher injury risk in car crashes than men.",
      "The U.S. government has used a dummy model for decades that is based almost entirely on male proportions.",
      "The new dummy, known as THOR-05F, is more human-like and contains female-specific proportions, according to the Transportation Department. The new model could potentially replace the Hybrid III dummy, which has previously been utilized for crash testing.",
      "\"Advances in technology now make it possible to more accurately account for the biological differences between male and female anatomy in crash testing,\" the Department of Transportation said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a head-on crash, and they are 17% more likely to be killed in a car crash, than men.",
      "Transportation officials will consider using the new dummy in the government's vehicle crash test five-star ratings once a final rule is adopted, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday in a news release.",
      "The department also noted that THOR-05F will be available to manufacturers to build models and to the automotive industry, which can begin testing the model in their vehicles.",
      "The road to THOR-05F",
      "The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man.",
      "The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "But the change is not guaranteed to happen. Some American automakers have been skeptical and a group representing auto insurers has already said it thinks the current crash test dummies are fine.",
      "The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said.",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn, a law student at New York University, started lobbying members of Congress to pass a law requiring the new female dummy after surviving a 2019 crash in Ireland in which her seat belt slid off her hips and ruptured her intestines. She welcomed Duffy's support but said she won't celebrate until NHTSA incorporates the new model into its testing \u2014 a step that has been delayed numerous times.",
      "\"I fear that with this announcement everybody will throw up their hands and say we've won,\" Kuhn said Friday. \"But we are far from crossing the finish line.\"",
      "Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Despite Duffy's announcement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, continues to advocate for the current line of dummies used to represent women and has seen dramatic improvements in safety as a result, spokesperson Joe Young said.",
      "\"Certainly, we are going to continue to monitor the new tools and perhaps do some additional research,\" Young said. \"But for now, our researchers are content and confident that the dummies we're using are doing a good job.\"",
      "Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements, but developments have been slow.",
      "U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement.",
      "\"Any progress here is good because there's simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,\" Duckworth said.",
      "Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor.",
      "\"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said.",

    "story": [
      "Bitcoin continued to slide on Friday, extending a weeks-long slump that has wiped out nearly $800 billion in value since the cryptocurrency hit its 2025 peak last month. The downturn has stripped away all of bitcoin's gains this year \u2014 and raised questions about where it might go from here.",
      "Since closing at almost $125,000 on Oct. 6, its highest price this year, bitcoin has shed about one-third of its value. On Friday, bitcoin sank below $82,000 before rebounding slightly to $83,509 before noon EDT, according to CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator.",
      "The cryptocurrency, which is trading at its lowest level since April, is now on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022, when a spate of corporate collapses sparked turbulence in the crypto sector, Bloomberg\u00a0reported\u00a0Friday.",
      "The precipitous drop comes as Wall Street grapples with unease over whether there's a bubble in artificial technology and tech stocks, prompting a shift away from assets that are viewed as carrying more risk, analysts say. Investors are also cautious given signs of weakness in the labor market, and the outlook for the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision next month, with more economists now expecting the Fed to hold off on cutting rates.",
      "\"The future is uncertain. It almost feels like it's moving back to the question: do I even want to hold [bitcoin] in this environment?\" said Thomas Chen, the CEO of cryptocurrency company Function, in an email.",
      "Why is Bitcoin falling?",
      "Concerns about an AI bubble can translate into turbulence for cryptocurrencies because tech stocks tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, experts noted.",

      "Aside from pulling back from riskier assets, some investors may be selling bitcoin to cover margin calls. Coinbase, for example, now offers \"perpetual futures,\" a product that lets traders use up to 10-to-1 leverage on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",
      "Leveraged positions can force investors to sell because borrowing amplifies every price move \u2014 for both gains and losses. Even a small drop in the underlying asset can lead to an outsized loss on a leveraged trade. But if an asset tumbles and the investor can't meet the margin requirements, the trading platform may automatically liquidate the position, which leads to more selling and downward pressure on its price.",
      "\"When traders borrow heavily to magnify positions, any reversal triggers liquidations that accelerate the move,\" Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, a financial advisory organization, said in an email.",
      "Large declines in bitcoin's price aren't unusual, and the cryptocurrency has always rebounded, experts noted.",
      "Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, said in a Tuesday email that bitcoin has historically experienced around five corrections of 20-30% or more during bull markets, adding that the issues may represent \"temporary headwinds\" as some investors could view lower crypto prices as a buying opportunity.",

    "summary": "The agency's \"Golden Age of Travel\" campaign aims to restore civility to air travel. Experts say they have doubts.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Wednesday unveiled a campaign aimed at bringing more civility to air travel, urging Americans to dress \"with respect\" and remember simple courtesies like saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" to flight attendants. Travel experts say they're skeptical it will make much difference.",
      "The new plan \u2014 called \"The Golden Age of Travel Starts With You\"\u00a0\u2014 is meant to \"jumpstart a nationwide conversation around how we can all restore courtesy and class to air travel,\" the agency said.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is rolling out the civility campaign in part as a response to what the agency called a record rise in unruly passenger incidents, including altercations with other travelers and airline staff. The issue isn't new, with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration data showing that incidents with unruly passengers peaked in 2021, although reports remain roughly double their pre-pandemic level.",
      "The Transportation Department didn't define what it meant by \"dressing with respect.\" In a Wednesday social media post, Duffy wrote, \"Dress up to go to the airport, help a stranger out, and be in a good mood.\"",
      "Duffy said he's encouraging air travelers to ask themselves the following five questions to ensure civility:",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?Are you dressing with respect?Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?",
      "Are you dressing with respect?",
      "Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?",
      "Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?",
      "Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Can dressing better improve economy class?",
      "Travel experts are skeptical that the Transportation Department's call to dress up for the airport will result in meaningful changes. Most travelers now prize comfort over formality, especially given the typically tight seating in economy and the likelihood of delays.",
      "In response to Duffy's social media post, some users chimed in with their own ideas \u2014 from widening cramped economy seats to making security checkpoints friendlier for travelers. While some agreed that a little more civility would be welcome, others noted that comfortable clothes make flying more tolerable in such tight quarters.",
      "A few decades ago, when Americans typically dressed up to fly, the travel experience looked a whole lot different.",
      "\"Economy class was actually nice. Now, everyone is wedged together on planes,\" Chris Elliott, a travel expert and consumer advocate, told CBS News.",
      "Sarah Silbert, a strategist at the flight search engine Points Path, said the clothing guideline isn't enforceable and isn't likely to shift traveler behavior.",
      "\"It's more of a soft nudge about travel etiquette,\" she told CBS News. \"Given how cramped and stressful flying can be for most people now, it's easy to see why a message about 'dressing up' will draw pushback.\"",
      "Travelers' interpretations may also vary significantly, experts added.",
      "\"Do I imagine anyone would be able to agree on what the dress code is? No,\" Daniel Green, co-founder of Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News. He added that he doesn't think there should be a dress code for travelers, either.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I think this is just a well-intentioned messaging campaign about behaving well in public that will likely have no practical or tangible implications for people,\" he said.",
      "Changes in air travel",
      "The rise in unruly passengers stems from several issues, including alcohol, drugs and mental health issues, as well as stress from dealing with crowded airports and problems like flight delays, according to Transport Security International, a travel publication.",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of the flight-deals site Going.com, noted that the \"golden age of travel\" was hardly golden for most Americans. Airfare was so expensive that flying was largely limited to the wealthy. Because flying is more affordable today, air travel has become a more democratized experience, he added.",
      "\"Many more people are traveling today. You see people from all walks of life getting on planes, and this campaign harkens back to a time when air travel was only for the elite,\" he told CBS News.",
      "He also objects to the notion that the \"golden age\" of flying provided a better passenger experience than today's flights.",
      "\"There are many ways in which it was an objectively worse experience. The flights took longer, they didn't have Wi-Fi, and there was cigarette smoke wafting through cabins,\" he said.",
      "Even so, he said he doubts the Transportation Department's civility push will inspire anyone to start dressing to the nines.",
      "\"If you think it's a good thing that most of society today can afford to buy tickets and travel, then you have to accept that people are going to behave how they're going to behave,\" Keyes said. \"I don't think I would want to live in a society that had dress recommendations to be on an airplane.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 09:06:36 -0500",
    "summary": "After FTC settlement, eligible Amazon Prime customers will automatically receive refunds between Nov. 12 and Dec. 24.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon has started issuing payments to eligible Prime members as part of a $2.5 billion settlement over federal allegations that it misled customers.",
      "The online retailer\u00a0agreed to the payouts in September\u00a0to resolve a 2023 Federal Trade Commission\u00a0lawsuit that accused Amazon of misleading customers into enrolling in Prime and making it hard for them to cancel their membership.",
      "Under the settlement, Amazon agreed to offer $1.5 billion in refunds to customers. However, the e-commerce company neither admitted nor denied the FTC's allegations. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time, the company said that \"Amazon and our executives have always followed the law.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Amazon refund, including how to determine if you qualify for the payment.",
      "When are payments going out?",
      "Amazon is issuing settlement refunds to eligible Prime Members, starting with automatic payments issued between Nov. 12 and Dec. 24 (see below for more details on how payments are being made).",
      "\"Our settlement required Amazon to pay those people who clearly qualify without them having to do anything,\" Christopher Bissex, deputy director of public affairs at the FTC, told CBS News. \"So those people are getting the automatic payments.\"",
      "Prime members who don't receive an automatic refund can submit a claim starting on Dec. 24. Those customers will receive a notice about filing a claim between Dec. 24 and Jan. 23, according to Bissex.",
      "How do I know if I qualify?",
      "Only customers who signed up for Amazon Prime between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, are eligible to receive a refund.",
      "Customers qualify for an automatic payment if they signed up for Prime or unsuccessfully tried to cancel their membership through Amazon's \"challenged enrollment flow,\" defined as \"any version of the Universal Prime Decision Page, the Shipping Option Select Page, Prime Video enrollment flow, or the Single Page Checkout,\" according to a September\u00a0court order.",
      "The FTC also said these customers must have used no more than three \"Amazon Prime Benefits\" in a 12-month period.",
      "How do I get my payment?",
      "Eligible customers will get a refund by PayPal or Venmo, which they must accept within 15 days, according to the FTC. Those who prefer a check should ignore the PayPal or Venmo refund.",
      "\"Once you do not claim the PayPal or Venmo payment, Amazon will mail you a check to your default shipping address listed on your Prime subscription,\" the FTC said on its website. \"If you get a check, please cash it within 60 days.\"",
      "How much money will I receive?",
      "Eligible Prime customers could receive up to $51, according to the FTC.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 A vintage blue VW bus that became an unlikely symbol of resilience after it survived a California wildfire made its public debut this week, shiny and like-new after Volkswagen spent months restoring the damaged vehicle.",
      "The bus went viral in January when an Associated Press photographer captured it looking surprisingly unharmed by the deadly Palisades Fire, a spot of blue and white dwarfed by the charred remains of a Malibu neighborhood. Volkswagen saw the accompanying AP story and reached out to the owner, Megan Weinraub. Upon closer inspection, VW technicians discovered that while the bus had survived, it had smoke damage and blistered paint, rust and a window busted by the heat.",
      "In its restoration, the 1977 Type 2 Microbus named Azul - Spanish for the color blue - again brought people together as technicians consulted the broader community of VW enthusiasts in a shared mission to revive what was a quirky middle-aged vehicle.",
      "\"It melted and Volkswagen saved it,\" Weinraub said Thursday at the LA Auto Show, standing with the bus's previous owner, Preston Martin. \"It was a giant relief because it wasn't my first priority with everything going on.\"",
      "While Weinraub calls the microbus \"Azul,\" it became known as the \"Magic bus\" on social media, CBS News Los Angeles points out.",
      "\"I was lucky and grateful to have the opportunity for them to restore it because I wouldn't have been able to restore it myself,\" she told the station.",
      "Weintraub and Martin still can't believe the bus they wrote off as a goner is now ready to take them on another surfing adventure. The last time they saw the pre-burned Azul was two days before the Palisades Fire broke out, when they parked the bus near Weinraub's apartment after surfing.",
      "Mark J. Terrill, the AP photographer who captured the original image, was on hand when Weinraub and Martin saw the bus for the first time after its restoration in late October.",
      "Volkswagen hauled the microbus to its Oxnard facility west of Los Angeles where it houses historic VW vehicles. Vehicle technicians Farlan Robertson and Gunnar Wynarski sourced hard-to-find parts, got creative and reached out to a lot of people.",
      "\"At the bottom of it it was to try to take the vehicle that everyone else saw and do what we could to improve upon it, but not change it,\" said Robertson, \"to actually have it come out and be the revived, resurrected vehicle returned to its former glory.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Treasury Department analysis indicates that new U.S. sanctions on Russian oil producers have sent prices there tumbling, choking off a key revenue source that Russia has used to fund its war in Ukraine, the department said.",
      "One key benchmark for Russian oil prices \u2014 Urals crude \u2014 had fallen by at least 21% since a set of new sanctions were announced last month, a Treasury official said Thursday. The official also pointed to a decrease in the amount of oil departing from Russia to unknown destinations and said transaction volume has decreased.",
      "The sanctions, announced Oct. 22, target Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft. They represent the first direct actions against Russia of the second Trump administration and some of the most aggressive since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Since the announcement, nearly a dozen major Indian and Chinese purchasers of Russian oil have stated intentions to pause their purchases of Russian oil deliveries for December, Treasury has said.",
      "A November 17 memo from the Treasury's Sanctions Economic Analysis Division assessed that the \"sanctions on Russian energy firms Lukoil and Rosneft are having their intended effect of dampening Russian revenues by lowering the price of Russian oil and therefore the country's ability to fund its war effort against Ukraine.\"",
      "The memo said that several grades of Russian oil are trading at multi-year lows, and are \"well below all other international prices.\"",
      "The memo also indicated that sanctions are \"likely to have a long-term negative impact on the quantity of Russian oil sold.\"",
      "The sanctions set a Friday, Nov. 21, deadline for companies to wind down dealings with Rosneft and Lukoil. Nearly three dozen entities are petitioning Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control for additional time to wind down operations, which would take them beyond the original deadline. That is not unusual, as companies work to comply with U.S. sanctions.",
      "Treasury has issued some extensions already for certain transactions involving Lukoil's retail service stations and contracts for the sale of the firm's international assets until Dec. 13. A separate waiver for deals pertaining to Lukoil's entities in Bulgaria was extended through April 29, according to a CBS review of the licenses.",
      "A Treasury official also said Thursday that many Chinese and Indian entities \u2014 including banks and refineries \u2014 are conscious of the sanctions and are \"risk averse, do recognize the importance of the relationships with the West, and are moving to comply.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month the sanctions on Russia's largest oil companies were driven by President Vladimir Putin's \"refusal to end this senseless war.\" Treasury said the companies have helped to \"fund the Kremlin's war machine.\"",
      "Last month on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" Bessent told moderator Margaret Brennan that the latest actions could cut Russia's oil revenue 20% or 30%. A Treasury official said the impacts are still being assessed, but that \"it is clear that there will be revenue impacts\" from the sanctions.",
      "The oil price plunge comes as President Trump presses Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire. At various points, he has expressed frustration with the leaders of both countries.",

      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:10:43 -0500",
    "summary": "The government's latest jobs data could affect whether Federal Reserve officials continue their push to ease borrowing costs.",
    "story": [
      "Just a few weeks ago, a December interest rate cut was viewed as practically a done deal by many economists. Now, with fresh government data showing solid U.S.\u00a0job growth in September, many forecasters think the Federal Reserve is likely to hold off lowering borrowing costs when policy makers meet next month.",
      "The probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut now stands at 22%, down from a likelihood of 97% as of mid-October, according to economists polled by financial data company FactSet. CME Fedwatch, a tool that forecasts rate cuts based on changes in the 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices, gives slightly better odds of a reduction, at about 41%.",
      "Translation: Wall Street economists and traders alike expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged at its next two-day meeting on Dec. 9-10. That would amount to a pause in the central bank's recent move to lower lending rates, coming after two consecutive cuts in September and October.",
      "The shift in expectations for future Fed rate cuts follows a six-week blackout in federal economic data because of the\u00a0government shutdown, a hiatus that hindered the central bank's ability to assess key economic trends. Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that a December rate cut wasn't a \"foregone conclusion,\" pointing to signs that the job market remains on firm ground.",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark federal funds rate \u2014 or what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 if officials conclude that the job market and broader economic growth are in danger of stalling. But Thursday's jobs data showed that employers continued to hire at a healthy clip in September.",
      "\"Given that today's numbers were not a bad as feared, in conjunction with hawkish statements from the Fed recently, it does appear that the Fed will skip a cut in December,\" Preston Caldwell, chief U.S. economist at Morningstar, said in an email.",
      "He added, \"But with the negative trend in labor markets remaining in place, we'd expect the Fed to resume cutting in their next meeting in January 2026, if they don't cut this December.\"",
      "The federal funds rate is currently sitting in a range of 3.75% to 4%.",
      "A move by the Fed to dial back rate cuts in 2026 could keep borrowing costs for homes and cars elevated. Pricier mortgages and auto loans are also reinforcing the feeling among many Americans, reflected in sentiment polls, that the cost of living remains too high.",
      "Mixed economic picture",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment in check. The central bank cited the slowing labor market when it twice trimmed borrowing costs this fall.",
      "But the latest payroll gains released Thursday showed that employers hired 119,000 people in September \u2014 more than double what most economists had forecast. The nation's unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4%, the highest level since October of 2021. The increase in the jobless rate suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, marking a pickup after previous employment data had shown a slowdown in hiring. The report marks the first official job tally since the\u00a0government shutdown ended last week, ending a six-week blackout on labor data.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 50,000 jobs in September, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose 4.4% in September, up from 4.3% in August and the highest level since Oct. 2021. With robust job growth in September, that suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",
      "The Labor Department also revised job growth down for July and August by a combined 33,000, a sign that hiring during those months was weaker than previously reported.",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest boost in jobs, with 43,000 hires in September. The federal workforce, meanwhile, lost 3,000 jobs that month.",
      "Investment advisor firm Capital Economics estimates 150,000 federal workers will drop off the government's payroll in the fourth quarter this year, mainly due to the end of the Trump administration's deferred resignation programs.",
      "The job market has been losing momentum for much of this year, with previous employment reports indicating a slowdown in hiring. At the same time, employers have been announcing layoffs in recent months, leading to the worst October for job reductions in 22 years, according to\u00a0outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Verizon said it would lay off 13,000 employees on Thursday. That follows major recent job cuts by\u00a0Target, Amazon, UPS\u00a0and other major companies.",

      "Although job growth has weakened, \"it is not collapsing,\" added Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "The hiring numbers will shape Federal Reserve officials' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their next meeting in December. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment firm B. Riley Financial, thinks the odds of a rate cut have \"diminished significantly\" given there will not be a full October employment report and the November report won't be issued until after the Fed meets in December.",
      "Ashworth expects the Fed to delay its next rate cut until January. The probability of a rate cut now stands at 22%, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Delayed employment reports",
      "The September jobs report, originally slated for Oct. 3, was pushed back by the government shutdown that ended on Nov. 12. The delay means it offers a belated snapshot of the labor market just before federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1.",
      "On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it won't publish the full October employment report, which was originally slated for release on Nov. 7. Instead, the agency will fold select October data into the November report, which is set for release on Dec. 16.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 10:22:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Government documents show that federal regulators rarely warn plans that their networks of health providers are so skimpy they violate legal requirements.",
    "story": [
      "Along with the occasional aches and pains, growing older can bring surprise setbacks and serious diseases. Longtime relationships with doctors people trust often make even bad news more tolerable. Losing that support \u2014 especially during a health crisis \u2014 can be terrifying. That's why little-known federal requirements are supposed to protect people with privately run Medicare Advantage coverage when contract disputes lead their health care providers and insurers to part ways.",
      "But government documents obtained by KFF Health News show the agency overseeing Medicare Advantage does little to enforce long-standing rules intended to ensure about 35 million plan members can see doctors in the first place.",
      "In response to a Freedom of Information Act request covering the past decade, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services produced letters it sent to only five insurers from 2016 to 2022 after seven of their plans failed to meet provider network adequacy requirements \u2014 lapses that could, in some cases, harm patient care.",
      "Agency officials said some plans lacked enough primary care clinicians, specialists, or hospitals, according to the letters. And they warned that failure to meet the requirements could result in a freeze on marketing and enrollment, fines, or closure of the plan.",
      "CMS declined to detail why it found so few plans with network violations over the 10 years. \"The number of identified violations reflects the outcomes of targeted reviews, not a comprehensive audit of all plans in all years,\" said Catherine Howden, a CMS spokesperson.",
      "Officials in states with Advantage network violations say CMS didn't notify them, including directors of the government-funded State Health Insurance Assistance Program, which helps people navigate Medicare.",
      "\"It's hard for me to believe that only seven Medicare Advantage plans violated network rules,\" said David Lipschutz, a co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group. \"We often hear from folks \u2014 particularly in more rural areas \u2014 who have to travel significant distances in order to find contracted providers.\"",
      "Medicare Advantage is an increasingly popular alternative to the government-run Medicare program, which covers adults 65 and older and some people with disabilities. Of the 63 million Americans who were eligible to join Advantage plans instead of traditional Medicare, 54% did so for this year. The plans usually offer lower out-of-pocket costs and extra benefits, like coverage for vision, dental, and hearing care, but typically require their members to stick to select networks of doctors, hospitals, and other providers. Last year, the federal government paid Advantage plans an estimated $494 billion to care for patients.",
      "Traditional Medicare, by comparison, has no network and is accepted by nearly all doctors and hospitals in the nation.",
      "Conflicts between Medicare Advantage plans and the doctors, hospitals, and other providers that serve their members are common. Just this year, at least 38 hospital systems serving all or parts of 23 states have cut ties with at least 11 Advantage plans after failing to agree on payment and other issues, according to a review of news releases and press reports. Over the past three years, separations between Advantage plans and health systems have increased 66%, said FTI Consulting, which tracks reports of the disputes.",
      "After March, Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are generally locked into their plans for the year until the annual open enrollment period happening now through Dec. 7, for coverage beginning Jan. 1. But hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, and other health providers can leave plans anytime.",
      "When providers and insurers separate, Advantage members can lose access to longtime doctors or preferred hospitals in the middle of the year. In response, CMS sometimes gives Advantage customers a little-known escape hatch called a \"special enrollment period\" to change plans or enroll in traditional Medicare midyear.",
      "How CMS decides who gets an SEP is a mystery even to well-versed state insurance regulators and U.S. senators who oversee federal health programs. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) cited previous KFF Health News reporting on Medicare Advantage in an Oct. 30 letter asking CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz for an explanation.",
      "\"Despite the serious impacts of SEPs on enrollees and the market, the process of SEP determinations is opaque, leaving enrollees and state regulators in the dark,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Seniors deserve to know their Medicare plan isn't going to pull the rug out from under them halfway through the year,\" Wyden told KFF Health News.",
      "\"Help us\"",
      "Oz spoke to Medicare Advantage insurers Oct. 15 at a conference organized by the Better Medicare Alliance, a trade group, and encouraged them to help CMS police fraud in the program.",
      "\"Be our early-warning system,\" he told them. \"Tell us about problems you're witnessing. Help us figure out better ways of addressing it.\"",
      "When he finished speaking, he took a seat in the audience next to the president and chief executive of the group, Mary Beth Donahue, and smiled for photos.",
      "In six letters KFF Health News obtained, CMS officials told five insurers that their network adequacy violations could affect Advantage members' access to care. Five letters listed the number or types of medical specialists or facilities missing from the networks. In three cases, CMS noted that plans could request exceptions to the rules but didn't. In one letter, CMS requested the plan allow members to receive out-of-network care at no additional cost. Four letters required specific steps to address deficiencies, including submitting evidence that more clinicians were added to networks.",
      "Three letters required a \"corrective action plan,\" set deadlines for fixing problems, and warned that failure to comply with the rules could result in enrollment and marketing suspensions, fines, or forced plan closure. The other three letters were a \"notice of non-compliance,\" which urged insurers to comply with legal requirements.",
      "Although CMS regards the letters as the first step in its enforcement process, the agency did not provide information about whether these violations were resolved or if they resulted in penalties.",
      "The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a group created by Congress to monitor the program, said in a June 2024 report that \"CMS has the authority to impose intermediate sanctions or civil monetary penalties for noncompliance with network adequacy standards, but it has never done so.\"",
      "One of the network adequacy violation letters went to Vitality Health Plan of California in November 2020. That came after five hospitals and 13 nursing homes in one county and four hospitals in another all left the insurer's network, according to the letter from Timothy Roe, then-director of CMS' Division of Compliance, Surveillance, and Marketing. Two months before sending its letter, CMS granted Vitality plan members a special enrollment period.",
      "Beneficiaries welcomed the opportunity, said Marcelo Espiritu, program manager of the Santa Clara County office of California's Health Insurance Counseling & Advocacy Program. But Espiritu didn't know at the time that Vitality's depleted network violated CMS requirements, which Roe said put \"the health of Vitality's beneficiaries at risk.\"",
      "\"By not having enough network providers, beneficiaries may not be able to receive necessary services timely, or at all,\" Roe wrote.",
      "That's information patients need to know, Espiritu said.",
      "\"People would not be able to receive promised benefits and there would be delays in care and a lot of frustration in trying to find a new plan,\" he said. \"We would certainly warn people about the plan and remove it from our materials.\"",
      "Representatives from Commonwealth Care Alliance, which acquired Vitality in 2022, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Network minimums",
      "Federal law requires Medicare Advantage plans to include in their networks a minimum of 29 types of health care providers and 14 kinds of facilities that members can access within certain distances and travel times. The rules, which vary depending on a county's population and density, also limit how long patients should wait for appointments. The agency checks compliance every three years, or more often if it receives complaints.",
      "Networks can vary widely even within a county because the provider minimums apply to the insurer, not each plan it sells, according to a report from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. The company can offer the same network to members of multiple plans in one or more counties or create a separate network for each plan.",
      "In Arizona's Maricopa County, KFF researchers found, UnitedHealthcare offered 12 plans with 12 different networks in 2022. Depending on the plan, the company's customers had access to 37% to 61% of the physicians in the area available to traditional Medicare enrollees.",
      "In early 2016, CMS allowed 900 people in an Advantage plan in Illinois run by Harmony, then a WellCare subsidiary, to leave after the Christie Clinic, a large medical practice, left its provider network. The WellCare plan continued to operate without the clinic. But in June 2016, CMS told the plan in one of the letters KFF Health News obtained that losing the Christie Clinic meant the remaining provider network violated federal requirements.",
      "It was \"a significant network change with substantial enrollee impact,\" the letter said.",
      "Claudia Lennhoff, executive director at Champaign County Health Care Consumers, a government-funded Medicare counseling service that helped the WellCare members, said her group didn't know about the letter at the time.",
      "\"Not disclosing such information is a violation of trust,\" Lennhoff said. \"It could lead someone to make a decision that will be harmful to them, or that they will deeply regret.\"",
      "Centene Corp. bought WellCare in 2020, and representatives for the St. Louis-based company declined to comment on events that occurred before the acquisition.",
      "Two violation letters KFF Health News obtained from CMS went to Provider Partners Health Plan of Ohio in 2019 and 2022. The Ohio Department of Insurance was unaware of the violations, spokesperson Todd Walker said. He said CMS also did not notify the Ohio Senior Health Insurance Information Program, the state's free counseling service.",
      "Rick Grindrod, CEO and president of Provider Partners Health Plans, which is based in Maryland, said that after CMS reviewed its 2019 network, \"we proactively reduced our service area and deferred enrollment in the plan until 2021.\"",
      "But Grindrod said the plan enrolled only a small number of members in one county in 2021 and decided to withdraw from the Ohio market entirely at the end of that year.",
      "After Provider Partners withdrew from Ohio, CMS sent it another letter in March 2022 saying its network in 2021 had gaps in four counties for four types of providers and facilities. CMS asked the plan to comply with network rules by adding more providers.",
      "\"We believe CMS' network adequacy standards are generally clear and appropriate for ensuring beneficiary access,\" Grindrod said. \"While the standards are not difficult to understand, as a provider-sponsored plan with a small footprint, we sometimes face challenges securing contracts with large systems that prioritize larger Medicare Advantage plans.\"",
      "In 2021, CMS also sent a violation letter to North Carolina's Liberty Advantage. CMS didn't tell the state's free counseling service, the Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program, about the letter, said its director, Melinda Munden.",
      "Liberty representatives did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "CMS sent a letter in 2016 to CareSource about network deficiencies in some of its Medicare Advantage plans sold in Kentucky and Indiana. The agency asked the company to fix the problems, including by reimbursing any members billed for services from doctors who were not in the plans' networks.",
      "\"In response to the 2016 violations, we promptly implemented a Corrective Action Plan, which included a thorough review of our provider network to ensure adequacy standards were met,\" said Vicki McDonald, a CareSource spokesperson. \"CMS approved our plan, and no further action was required.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

    "story": [
      "Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Wednesday he is resigning from the board of OpenAI and leaving a number of other roles after last week's release of emails between him and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI,\" Summers said in a statement.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company and look forward to following their progress,\" he said.",
      "On Wednesday night, Summers went on leave from teaching at Harvard University, with his spokesperson, Steven Goldberg, saying in a statement: \"Mr. Summers has decided it's in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review. His co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester.\" A Harvard spokesperson said Summers \"communicated his decision\" to the university.",
      "Summers said earlier this week that he will be stepping back from \"public commitments\" after dozens of messages between him and Epstein were included in a trove of documents from Epstein's estate that was released by the House Oversight Committee last week.",

      "Summers joined the OpenAI board in 2023.",
      "The emails showed Summers and Epstein communicated regularly during the last years of Epstein's life, even as the accused sex trafficker's public infamy and notoriety grew. Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",
      "The exchanges between Summers and Epstein include one in which they appeared to banter about a woman Summers knew in London, with Epstein seeming to offer him advice.",
      "There is no evidence of illegal conduct on the part of Summers.",
      "Summers, who served as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration, was a key economic adviser in the Obama administration. The former president of Harvard University, Summers was teaching two classes at the school.",
      "In a statement on Wednesday, Harvard said it is \"conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\"",
      "On Tuesday, both the House and Senate voted overwhelmingly to require the Justice Department to release its files related to Epstein, sending the bill to President Trump's desk. Mr. Trump called on the Justice Department last week to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton and other high-profile Democrats.",

    "story": [
      "Nvidia's third-quarter financial results on Wednesday surpassed analyst expectations, signaling that demand for its artificial intelligence chips remains robust amid investor concerns about an AI bubble.",
      "The chipmaker reported earnings of $31.9 billion on record revenue of $57 billion for the third quarter. Revenue for the period surged 22% from the previous quarter and 62% from a year ago. Its earnings per share were $1.30. The Santa Clara, Calif., company had been expected to earn $1.26 per share on revenue of $54.9 billion for the quarter, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "\"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday, referring to the company's proprietary superchips that power large language models.",
      "\"Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference \u2014 each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast \u2014 with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once,\" Huang added.",
      "Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The company's shares, which have jumped 39% this year, rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading to $193.80.",
      "\"This is a huge print and guidance from Nvidia that should reignite the bullish tech trade into year-end,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, adding that he thinks \"fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated.",
      "In October, the chipmaker became the first publicly listed company worth $5 trillion, with its shares buoyed by Wall Street expectations of surging demand.",
      "Rational exuberance?",
      "In recent weeks, some investors have expressed caution about the hype surrounding AI and whether the soaring market value of companies linked to the technology is warranted. Despite the promise of AI, most companies that are implementing AI have yet to see a measurable increase in productivity or profits, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Nvidia earnings are such an important event both because of the weighting that the stock has in the major equity indices and because it is ground zero for the entire Artificial Intelligence build out,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "The rapid construction of data centers across the U.S. has boosted demand for Nvidia's chips. Data center investment, which includes spending on AI research and development, has become the largest contributor to U.S. growth this year, according to S&P Global.",
      "The S&P 500's 15% gain this year has been driven largely by big tech companies with AI investments. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 accounts for 37% of the index's total value,\u00a0according\u00a0to Morningstar.",
      "\"Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure build out was a bubble, and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was, Zaccarelli said. \"But in the meantime, the largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable, and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real.\"",
      "China hurdle",
      "Nvidia reported robust demand for its chips despite being blocked from the vital Chinese market because of U.S. export restrictions as the two nations compete on AI.",
      "In an earnings call with analysts, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Collete Kress on Wednesday said the company is \"disappointed\" it can't ship products to China.",
      "\"To establish a sustainable leadership and position in AI computing, America must win the support of every developer and be the platform of choice for every commercial business, including those in China,\" she said, adding that Nvidia will continue to push for access to the Chinese market.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 17:27:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Although inflation has eased, many Americans say they still feel squeezed financially. Here are five areas where households are feeling the pinch.",
    "story": [
      "Although inflation across the U.S. is far cooler than in the post-pandemic years, millions of Americans say they still feel the pinch of rising prices, struggle to pay the bills and express concern about their financial prospects.",
      "Price increases are nowhere near the level reached in June of 2022, when the Consumer Price Index hit a 40-year high of 9.1%. Yet many people feel squeezed by the cost of simple daily necessities, including the ability to afford healthy food, and by long-term increases in the cost of essentials such as housing and health care.",
      "This affordability crisis is rooted in a combination of both longstanding economic issues dating back decades and more recent developments. For instance, housing costs have surged partly due to a lack of available homes, a result of cutbacks in construction following the Great Recession, while more recently steep new U.S. tariffs have fueled inflation.",
      "Inflation and the economy now rank as Americans' top national concerns, according to an October CBS News poll.",
      "\"Everything is going up in price very quickly,\" said Jeremy Tolbert, a 47-year-old web developer in Lawrence, Kansas.",
      "With his family's monthly health care premiums set to rise 18% to $2,600 next year, he's planning to cut back in other areas. \"Our food budget is going to go down \u2014 we're not talking about eating beans and rice, but going from a comfortable middle-class lifestyle to eating how we did when we first got out of college,\" Tolbert said.",
      "Here are five key categories of spending that many Americans are struggling to afford.",
      "Food",
      "Almost half of Americans say it's harder to afford groceries today than it was a year ago, according to a September survey\u00a0by Axios and the Harris Poll. Only 19% said food prices are cheaper than a year earlier, with roughly a third seeing no change.",
      "Growth in food prices has eased considerably, although it is still rising, with the latest CPI report showing grocery prices rose 2.7% in September on an annual basis, a sharp contrast to the\u00a011.4% increase in 2022. Overall, however, food prices as of September were more than 18% higher than in January of 2022, according to the CBS News price tracker.",
      "Shoppers don't assess food costs the same way economists do. They focus on their day-to-day spending \u2014 which keeps climbing \u2014 and compare their out-of-pocket spending today with what they paid several years ago,\u00a0according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "In other words, people's experience of inflation and how they measure it in their daily lives may not mesh with official economic measures that paint a more optimistic picture.",
      "Meanwhile, other recent signals underscore the difficulty many Americans have simply putting food on the table. Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to data from Purdue University's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "In New York City, for example, 40% of local families can't afford their weekly food costs, according to new data from charitable organization Robin Hood and Columbia University.",
      "Housing",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",
      "The data backs that up, with a homebuyer today needing to earn $121,400 a year to afford a typical home, meaning that their monthly costs would remain below 30% of their annual income, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The average American earns about $84,000 a year, highlighting the considerable gap between incomes and home prices.",
      "Several forces have pushed housing costs higher. The rate of home construction plunged after the 2008-09 financial crisis, leading to a shortfall in housing inventory. Meeting today's demand for housing would require building as many as 4 million additional homes beyond current construction levels, Goldman Sachs estimates.",
      "The low interest rates that prevailed during the pandemic, when homebuyers could secure mortgages below 3%, sparked a buying rush that sent prices soaring. Even with a slight cooling this year, homes are selling for about 25% above their 2019 levels, while mortgage rates have more than doubled since their pandemic lows.",
      "Child care",
      "The challenge of affording child care is another pain point for many families. In 2024, the average annual cost of care for one child around the U.S. topped $13,000, up 30% from 2020, according to Child Care Aware America, a nonprofit group.",
      "Families with a single child can end up paying between roughly 9% and 16% of their median income on full-time day care,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Labor. That means parents are often spending more on child care than they do on other expenses, such as groceries or even rent, data shows.",
      "Gina Monroe, a 42-year-old mom based in Massapequa, New York, said the financial strain of child care has made her and her husband think twice about having another child. She started sending her 2-year-old son to day care in September and pays around $450 a week.",
      "\"Nothing's getting any cheaper,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Child care costs have surged partly because there aren't enough early education workers to support the number of children who need care, according to experts. The industry also pays meager wages, adding to the challenges of recruiting new workers, said Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families.",
      "Health care",
      "Americans are also getting socked by rising health care costs, ranging from higher insurance premiums to out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-pays. The increase in medical costs stems largely from the emergence of more expensive treatments, such as the popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs, as well as an aging population that requires more care, according to consulting firm Mercer.",
      "The cost of health care was at the center of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, with Democratic lawmakers pushing to extend a tax credit to defray the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The shutdown ended without an agreement to extend the subsidies, which means low- and middle-income households that previously qualified for the tax credits would likely see their ACA premiums rise from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "Employees who get their insurance through employer-based plans are likely to see their health care costs rise as much as 7% for their 2026 plans, according to Mercer.",
      "Electricity and utility costs",
      "Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utility costs, up 12% since last year, according to a new\u00a0report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.",
      "The surge stems from a succession of rate hikes across the U.S, as electricity demand outstrips supply. In 2025 alone, more than 124 million Americans are expected to see some sort of rate increase in their energy bill, a recent PowerLines\u00a0report\u00a0found.",
      "Even if you do your best to shut off every light, some fixed costs are unavoidable, such as the so-called \"delivery charge,\" or what a utility charges to send electricity from a power plant to a home, said Rodrigues of the National Parents Union.",
      "The energy burden falls most acutely on low- and middle-income families, who spend between 6% and 10% of their income on energy, or three to five times that of higher-income households, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Nov 2025 10:45:53 -0500",
    "summary": "In some metro areas, child care expenses amount to more than double what families spend on rent, LendingTree found.",
    "story": [
      "As child care costs soar, many Americans today find themselves paying more for a caregiver than they do for their monthly rent, according to a new analysis.",
      "Child care costs for parents with two kids exceed rental costs in 85 of the country's largest metro areas, personal finance site\u00a0LendingTree found. In Omaha, Neb., Milwaukee, Wis., and Buffalo, N.Y., which have the highest child care costs in the country relative to local rents, families with an infant and a 4-year-old under care on average pay more than double the cost of their rent.",
      "Families around the U.S. pay an average of $1,282 for full-time infant care, still below the average monthly cost to rent a two-bedroom unit, LendingTree's data shows. Families with two children, on the other hand, spend an average of $2,252 per month on child care.",
      "LendingTree, which determined how child care costs stack up against rent in 100 cities. compiled its findings using data from nonprofit group Child Care Aware of America and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Exorbitant child care costs are contributing to what amounts to a crisis of affordability for many Americans, who also face rising food, housing,\u00a0energy and\u00a0health care costs. A\u00a0survey\u00a0of roughly 3,000 people released this week by Brigham Young University and Deseret News found that 7 in 10 respondents said that raising children is unaffordable, a sentiment that has surged over the last decade.",
      "One parent facing a child care crunch is New York City resident Gina Monroe, who started sending her son to day care in September.",
      "\"Having to have a household with both parents working and a grandmother that was getting too old to take care of a two-year-old, you don't have a choice,\" she told CBS News.",
      "The 42-year-old said she pays $450 a week to send her son to a day care center on nearby Long Island. That's less than her monthly mortgage payment of $3,200, but still represents one of her family's biggest expenses, she said.",
      "The financial strain of everyday life in the U.S., especially following the fierce inflation that erupted during the pandemic, has emerged as a political flashpoint this year.",
      "For example, the Trump administration has in recent weeks floated several ideas aimed at easing costs for Americans, including proposals for a\u00a0$2,000 tariff rebate check\u00a0and a 50-year mortgage. The administration also last week\u00a0announced tariff exemptions on some popular grocery store staples, including bananas, beef and coffee, as Americans continue to battle elevated food costs.",
      "Incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani also made issues around affordability the centerpiece of his campaign, urging city officials to establish free child care for children ages 6 weeks to 5 years old.",
      "Why are child care costs soaring?",
      "Child care expenses have been rising steadily for years, and show little sign of relenting. From 2020 to 2024, costs rose nearly 30%, data from the nonprofit group Child Care Aware shows.",
      "The main driver for that surge, according to experts: a shortage of early education workers and available places at daycare centers, relative to the enormous demand for such services from families around the U.S.",
      "To that end, Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, pointed to what he described as \"child care deserts\" in some regions, where parents face a dearth of acceptable options. These are most common in low-income rural areas, which have difficulty recruiting and retaining a qualified workforce, a 2023 government report found.",
      "Where high-quality child care is in short supply, the owners can charge a premium given they face little competition, Schulz noted.",
      "Many households also don't have the benefit of having nearby family members who can help with child care responsibilities, Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families, told CBS News.",
      "\"What we actually need are policies that recognize the modern realities of working families and what the true cost of raising children in America actually is right now,\" she said.",

      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",

      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",

      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

      "\"Stocks are extending their losses so far on [Tuesday] as sentiment stays downbeat and investors continue to dial back on tech exposure,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a research note.",
      "What Nvidia does matters disproportionately to investors because it's the most influential stock on Wall Street. It can almost single-handedly steer the direction of the S&P 500 on some days because of its immense size, after fervent demand for its AI chips helped it briefly top $5 trillion in total value. The S&P 500 sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:27:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age is changing next year, affecting when the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers can collect 100% of their benefits.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security's so-called \"full retirement age\" \u2014 the age when people can start collecting all of their earned benefits \u2014 is about to hit a new threshold, a change that will affect Americans born in 1960 or later.",
      "The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security is calculated using a worker's birth year, while their monthly benefits are based on the number of years they've worked and their income over that period. People may claim Social Security as early as age 62, but doing so permanently reduces their monthly benefit by about 30% compared with waiting until hitting their FRA.",
      "Starting in 2026, Social Security's full retirement age is set to make its final scheduled increase, marking the last step-up in age enacted under a\u00a01983 congressional reform\u00a0designed to shore up the program's finances. Before that overhaul, people could claim their FRA benefits at 65, but the law gradually pushed that age higher, culminating in the change that takes effect in 2026.",
      "Since 2021, the FRA has been rising by two months each year. It now stands at 66 years and 10 months for people born in 1959. Next year brings the final step in that schedule, when the FRA will reach 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later.",
      "With the FRA hitting 67, people born in 1960 won't qualify for their full benefits until 2027, rather than 2026. (You can check your own full-benefit age by entering your birthdate into this Social Security calculator.)",
      "The increase in the FRA will first impact the youngest baby boomers, or those born between 1960-1964, followed by Generation X, which spans 1965 to 1980. The change comes as many workers report feeling financially unprepared for retirement, with only about four in 10 Americans saying they're on track to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement,\u00a0according\u00a0to recent research from Vanguard.",
      "\"Raising the retirement age is an effective cut in lifetime benefits for younger baby boomers, members of Gen X and all the generations after,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the advocacy group National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, in an email to CBS News.",
      "While the increase in the full retirement age shouldn't come as a surprise given it was enacted 43 years ago, it doesn't guarantee older workers will be any more prepared financially for retirement, he added.",
      "\"Having time to plan, however, does not mean they have been able to put aside more for retirement, considering the stagnation of real wages and the rising cost of college tuition, home prices and other key living expenses,\" Richtman said.",
      "Retirement expectations versus reality",
      "There's also a longstanding gap between the age at which people expect to stop working and their real-world experiences, which can add to the financial strain of funding retirement. Many Americans believe they'll retire at age 65, but the median retirement age in the U.S. is in fact 62.",
      "Nearly six in 10 retirees say they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned, according to research published last year by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. An October survey from the same group found that most middle-class retirees \u2014 people with annual household incomes between $50,000 and $199,999 \u2014 stopped working earlier than they envisioned because of employment issues, such as losing their jobs, or poor health.",
      "That gap between expectations and reality may explain recent research that found 44% of Americans said they plan to claim Social Security before they\u00a0reach their full retirement age, which would result in lower monthly benefits.",
      "Some Americans also flle for Social Security before reaching their FRA out of a belief it makes more sense to bank more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower monthly amount.",
      "Transamerica also found that nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore the conventional financial advice of\u00a0waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, which locks in a 24% boost to a retiree's FRA payments.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Kennedy Center president Ric Grenell are clashing over the Kennedy Center's spending and operations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Kennedy Center president Ric Grenell and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island are clashing over the center's spending and operations records, after Trump allies were appointed to key roles at the Kennedy Center earlier this year, and President Trump was elected chairman of the board.",
      "In a letter to Grenell, Whitehouse said that under Grenell's stewardship, \"The Center is being looted to the tune of millions of dollars in foregone revenue, cancelled programming, unpaid use of its facilities, and wasteful spending on luxury restaurants and hotels.\" He called it \"an unprecedented pattern of self-dealing, favoritism, and waste.\"",
      "At one point, Whitehouse alleged that the Kennedy Center had let FIFA use the space for free, waiving its rental fee. On Friday, the center told the\u00a0Associated Press that it would actually receive $7.4 million in connection with the FIFA event.",
      "Grenell posted a long letter on X that responded to Whitehouse's accusations, point by point: \".@SenWhitehouse just stepped in it,\" Grenell wrote. \"He attacked the Kennedy Center with outrageous claims. So we responded with the facts.\"",
      "Grenell said when he arrived at the Kennedy Center, it was \"paying a bloated staff with our future debt reserves account,\" but \"today, and for the first time in decades, we have a balanced budget at the Kennedy Center.\"",
      "Grenell also denied the center has \"cancelled shows,\" but instead said that he has \"installed a break-even policy for programming\" and rentals. Grenell said that if ticket sales won't cover a program, it won't be confirmed unless the cost shortfall is covered by a sponsor or donor.",
      "Whitehouse, citing records his committee staff obtained about the center, accused the former acting director of national intelligence of using the center as a \"playground for the president of the United States and his allies\" and requested a slew of records from Grenell regarding the Kennedy Center's financial management.",
      "Whitehouse is the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has oversight responsibility for the Kennedy Center and authorizes its federal funding. Since Democrats are in the minority in the Senate, Whitehouse is only able to request information from Grenell. Only Republicans have subpoena power. It remains to be seen whether Grenell will provide any more information to Whitehouse, beyond his social media post.",
      "He asked for material on the Kennedy Center's financial management and ethics, a description of the process for selecting contractors and consultants, reimbursement policies, and information about audit protocols.",
      "Rental fee for FIFA?",
      "Whitehouse, in his letter, accused the Kennedy Center of offering FIFA \"free and exclusive use of the Kennedy Center.\"",
      "The Washington Post previously reported the center in August had waived a rental fee in the range of $5 million for FIFA, which will be using the Kennedy Center from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12 to host its 2026 World Cup draw. The Post noted that it wouldn't be the first time that a venue waived a rental fee for the draw, but it would be unusual for the Kennedy Center, since it usually has a crowded schedule at that time of year.",
      "Grenell said that FIFA \"has given us several million dollars, in addition to paying all of the expenses for this event in lieu of a rental fee.\"",
      "On Friday, the Kennedy Center told the Associated Press that it would be paid $7.4 million to host the FIFA draw, including a $2.4 million donation from the World Cup organizer and another $5 million in sponsorship opportunities.",
      "Contracts offered \"for your personal friends?\"",
      "Whitehouse also accused Grenell of offering \"contracts for your personal friends,\" and asked him for information about expenditures or contracts that have benefited people personally associated with Mr. Trump or with Kennedy Center leadership. He also asked Grenell to provide a justification for each contract.",
      "Grenell mentioned three people in his response, though he did not specifically say that he was responding to this question: Jeff Halperin, who was hired for multimedia work and whose work Grenell praised; a fundraiser named Lisa Dale, credited by Grenell with raising over $117 million; and an editor, researcher and writer who was a colleague of Grenell's when he was the ambassador to Germany in Mr. Trump's first administration. Grenell did not name the former colleague, but he said that the cost of his work curating an exhibit was completely covered by a donor.",
      "$10,000 spent on food and beverage for personal use?",
      "Whitehouse also accused Grenell of spending more than $10,000 over several months on \"private lunches, dinners and alcohol purchases unrelated to fundraising or development purposes,\" including on \"champagne service.\"",
      "Grenell said that all of the food and beverage costs Whitehouse cited were \"for donor-based events.\" He said fundraising expenses last year were much higher \u2014 $9.3 million.",
      "$27,000 for Watergate Hotel stays for new hires, associates?",
      "Whitehouse also said Grenell charged the center over $27,000 between April and July for \"new hires and your associates\" at the Watergate Hotel.",
      "Grenell, replied that it's \"customary\" for new employees to stay at the Watergate Hotel, which is next door to the Kennedy Center, and he countered that Watergate Hotel expenses for 2024 were much higher, totaling $878,000.",
      "The Kennedy Center receives government funding in addition to private funding. Federal funding goes to operations, security, maintenance and capital repairs. It received over $40 million in federal funds last year.",
      "The Trump administration became involved in the center's leadership earlier this year, and multiple Trump allies, including Grenell, were appointed to its board by Mr. Trump.",
      "Next month, Mr. Trump will host the Kennedy Center Honors \u2014 which recognize performing art professionals for their lifetime achievements \u2014 airing on CBS.",

      "The president wrote on his Truth Social platform that he was \"terminating effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said, without providing evidence, that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State.\"",
      "He also accused Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, without proof, of overseeing a state that had become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\"",
      "\"Send them back to where they came from,\" he said. \"It's OVER!\"",

      "The president did not provide further details on the move.",
      "TPS is a federal program that allows migrants from unstable countries to live and work legally in the U.S.",
      "Somalia's TPS designation runs through March 17, 2026,\u00a0according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency that is part of the Department of Homeland Security. As of March 31, there are 705 Somali immigrants in the U.S. approved for TPS, according to\u00a0Congress.gov.

    "story": [
      "Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced on X Friday she will resign from Congress early next year, after a weekslong falling-out with President Trump and much of her party.",
      "Her last day will be Jan. 5, 2026, Greene said.",
      "In a statement, the hard-right congresswoman expressed frustration with her party and with the change of pace in Congress, writing that GOP leadership had refused to work on addressing health care costs, and bills that she drafted on immigration and other issues had sat \"collecting dust.\" She said the \"legislature has been mostly sidelined.\"",
      "She also pointed to her dramatic break with Mr. Trump. The president pulled his support from Greene last week, calling her \"wacky\" and a \"traitor\" after she criticized Republicans' handling of several issues. She has claimed that Mr. Trump was set off by her push to disclose records related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which the president previously opposed before endorsing and later signing a bill to release the records this week.",
      "\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene wrote, saying her \"self worth is not defined by a man, but instead by God.\"",
      "On Mr. Trump's threat to back a primary challenger in her deep-red district, Greene said: \"I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family way too much, and do not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will lose the midterms.\"",
      "\"It's all so absurd and completely unserious,\" she said. \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement posted to X, Georgia GOP Chairman Josh McKoon called Greene a \"tireless fighter.\"",
      "\"While her decision to step down from Congress effective January 5 comes as a surprise amid recent challenges, her legacy as a bold voice for the grassroots will endure,\" he said.",
      "If Greene's resignation leaves her seat vacant, it could tighten the GOP's already razor-thin margin in the House until it's filled with a special election. Under Georgia state law, the governor must issue a writ of special election within 10 days of a House vacancy, and the election is required to be held 30 days after that, according to the\u00a0National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Greene's political status has been upended over the last month-and-a-half. She has broken with a president she defended for years and clashed with her party's top congressional leaders, drawing plaudits from Democratic lawmakers who once voted to take away her committee assignments due to conspiratorial comments.",
      "It began during the government shutdown, which was driven in part by Democrats' push to extend a set of expiring health insurance tax credits in exchange for their votes to fund federal agencies. Republican leadership had argued the government should reopen before negotiating on health care.",
      "Greene publicly lashed out at her party, accusing leadership of failing to come up with a plan to prevent the massive health insurance premium increases that many families could face next year if the tax credits aren't extended. She also criticized Speaker Mike Johnson for keeping the House out of session for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "Asked by CBS News if he found any surprise GOP allies during the shutdown fight, the top House Democrat, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, answered: \"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "Greene has also criticized the Trump administration for focusing on foreign policy rather than affordability issues at home.",
      "And her stance on the Epstein files had conflicted with Mr. Trump's. Greene and three other House Republicans joined with Democrats to force a vote on a bill ordering the release of government documents on Epstein, elevating an issue that animates many Trump allies, but one the president has long cast as a distraction by Democrats and \"stupid\" Republicans.",
      "Greene called Mr. Trump's position on the issue \"a huge miscalculation\" in an interview last week with \"CBS Mornings,\" arguing that the president has nothing to hide. Mr. Trump eventually came out in favor of the bill, which passed the House and Senate nearly unanimously this week and was signed into law on Wednesday.",
      "In a Truth Social post last week, the president said Greene \"has gone Far Left,\" and wrote that \"all I see 'Wacky' Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" He argued that she was upset because he discouraged her from running in next year's closely contested Georgia Senate race.",
      "Greene, meanwhile, has cast her break with the GOP and the president as a product of her commitment to the \"America First\" agenda widely associated with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"If I am cast aside by MAGA Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can't even relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well,\" she wrote in Friday's statement.",

The two politicians agree on very little, and they've lobbed attacks at each other for months, with Mr. Trump calling Mamdani a \"100% communist lunatic\" and Mamdani describing himself as \"Donald Trump's worst nightmare.\"",
      "But instead, the two men seemed to hit it off. In a surreal 30-minute Oval Office appearance, Mr. Trump lavished Mamdani with praise, calling him \"very rational\" and predicting he could do \"really great\" things for their shared hometown. Mamdani, standing beside Mr. Trump, steered clear of criticizing the president \u2014 sometimes with an assist from Mr. Trump himself \u2014 and pledged to work with the administration on cost-of-living issues.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor\"",
      "Mr. Trump was unceasingly optimistic about Mamdani, saying that during a private one-on-one meeting before their public appearance, the two men agreed on more than he expected. He pointed to Mamdani's focus on affordability and stated desire to build more housing.",
      "\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\" the president said. \"The better he does, the happier I am.\"",
      "\"I think he is going to surprise some conservative people\"",
      "Days before the election, Mr. Trump had encouraged people to vote for Mamdani's chief rival, Democratic governor-turned-independent Andrew Cuomo.",
      "But on Friday, the president said: \"I feel very confident that he can do a very good job\u2026I think he is going to surprise some conservative people, actually. And some very liberal people, he won't surprise them because they already like him.\"",
      "\"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him\"",
      "For months, Mr. Trump has flirted with cutting off federal financial support to New York City if Mamdani wins, suggesting it would be a waste.",
      "After their meeting, Mr. Trump didn't fully back away from the threat, but said it was unlikely.",
      "\"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,\" Mr. Trump said. \"A big help. Because I want New York City to be great. Look, I love New York City, it's where I come from, I spent a lot of years there. ... I think this mayor could do some things that are going to be really great.\"",
      "Does Mamdani think Trump is a fascist? \"That's okay, you can just say yes,\" president says",
      "At various points, reporters pressed Mamdani on whether he stands by his prior attacks on Mr. Trump \u2014\u00a0 and the president helped him dodge.",
      "One reporter asked Mamdani if he believes Mr. Trump is a \"fascist.\" As the incoming mayor began to answer, the president laughed and cut him off.",
      "\"That's okay, you can just say yes,\" Mr. Trump interjected, patting Mamdani on the arm. \"That's easier. It's easier than explaining it. I don't mind.\"",
      "Earlier in the meeting, Mamdani was asked if he still believes Mr. Trump is a \"despot.\"",
      "Said Mr. Trump: \"I've been called much worse than a despot, so it's not that insulting. I think he'll change his mind after we get to working together.\"",
      "\"He's got views that [are] a little out there, but who knows\"",
      "The president also deflected when asked about his claim that Mamdani is a \"communist.\"",
      "Said Mr. Trump: \"He's got views that [are] a little out there, but who knows. I mean, we're going to see what works.\"",
      "\"He's going to change, also. We all change. I changed a lot,\" the president continued.",
      "Mamdani describes himself as a democratic socialist, not a communist. He stood by that label on Friday.",
      "Trump: Mamdani isn't a \"jihadist,\" he's \"very rational\"",
      "Earlier this month, GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik \u2014 a candidate for governor of New York \u2014 called Mamdani an \"Antisemite Jihadist Communist.\"",
      "Asked if he agrees that Mamdani is a \"jihadist,\" Mr. Trump said no.",
      "\"I met with a man who's a very rational person. I met with a man who really wants to see New York be great again,\" the president continued.",
      "\"I would feel very, very comfortable being in New York\"",
      "Mr. Trump \u2014 a Queens native whose primary residence is now in Florida \u2014 said he'd feel comfortable moving back to New York City under Mamdani's leadership.",
      "\"I would feel very, very comfortable being in New York, and I think much more so after the meeting,\" he said.",
      "The pair's views on crime and immigration enforcement came up repeatedly on Friday. The president expressed confidence in Mamdani: He said he believes the mayor-elect cares about public safety, and praised Mamdani for choosing to retain\u00a0New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.",
      "\"That's a good sign,\" the president said.",
      "Trump: \"A lot of my voters actually voted for him, and I'm okay with that\"",
      "Mamdani pointed out that Mr. Trump's vote share in New York City jumped last year, which he attributed mostly to worries about affordability. And the mayor-elect noted that he swept up some Trump voters, which the president appreciated.",
      "\"He said a lot of my voters actually voted for him, and I'm okay with that,\" the president said.",
      "\"I think he's different than your typical guy\"",
      "Mr. Trump, for his part, praised Mamdani for the former state legislator's unexpected come-from-behind victory in the Democratic primary.",
      "\"He came out of nowhere,\" said the president. \"I watched. I said, 'Who is this guy?'\"",
      "Left unmentioned were the parallels with Mr. Trump's own insurgent victory in the 2016 Republican primary.",
      "Asked why Mamdani has drawn so much enthusiasm, Mr. Trump said: \"I think he's different than your typical guy, runs, wins, becomes mayor maybe and nothing exciting.\"",
      "At another point, Mr. Trump called being mayor a \"big deal,\" saying, \"one of the things I would've loved to be someday is the mayor of New York City.\"",

    "summary": "Texas asked the Supreme Court on Friday to halt a court order that threw out the state's redrawn House maps in time for next month's candidate filing deadline \u2014 arguing the new maps were driven by politics, not race.",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court on Friday temporarily halted\u00a0a lower court order\u00a0that threw out Texas' redrawn congressional maps in time for next month's candidate filing deadline \u2014 as the state and its legal opponents square off on whether the maps were driven by politics or race.",
      "Lawyers for Texas had asked the court earlier Friday to issue a stay and effectively let Texas return \u2014 at least for now \u2014 to the maps it passed over the summer, which redrew five Democratic House seats to make them more GOP-friendly.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito granted the state's request for an administrative stay, which means the lower court ruling is now on hold until the Supreme Court takes further action.",
      "Texas is asking the high court to stay the lower court ruling on a longer-term basis by Dec. 1, noting that\u00a0the deadline\u00a0for candidates to file for next year's primary elections is Dec. 8. He directed the plaintiffs who sued Texas to file their response by Monday afternoon.",
      "The state's redistricting push set of a\u00a0nationwide effort to redraw House maps ahead of next year's midterms, with California shifting five congressional districts to the left, and Missouri and North Carolina each shifting a seat to the right. President Trump has pushed other GOP-led states to take similar steps.",
      "But earlier this week, a panel of federal judges blocked Texas from using its new maps in a 2-1 ruling. The court's opinion, penned by Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, sided with plaintiffs who argued the map was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The lower court pointed to a majority-White Democratic district that it said should have changed more if the process was driven purely by politics, not race.\u00a0It also argued that some state officials, like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, seemed to move in response to a letter by a top Justice Department official warning them to redraw four existing districts that the federal government viewed as illegal \"coalition\" districts, where non-Hispanic White voters are in the minority, but no racial group has a majority.",
      "In Friday's request to the Supreme Court, the state of Texas pushed back on these arguments, asserting that the redistricting process was entirely partisan and wasn't motivated by race.",
      "\"From the start, everyone recognized that the purpose of Texas's redistricting effort was Republican political advantage,\" the state wrote, quoting several elected Democrats who criticized the new maps on political grounds.",
      "Texas said the lower court ruling \"erroneously rests on speculation and inferences of bad faith.\" And it said the state GOP's chief mapmaker worked with data on partisanship rather than race.",
      "In some cases, the state of Texas cited a dissent from the lower court ruling written by Judge Jerry Smith. The Reagan appointee drew headlines earlier this week for his fiery opinion, which used the phrase \"I dissent\" 16 times, called Brown an \"unskilled magician,\" said the majority opinion would deserve an \"F\" on a law school exam and accused the other judges of improperly leaving him out of the process.",
      "The State of Texas also argued the lower court ruling could cause \"chaos\" since it was issued during the candidate filing period for next year's races.",

      "Abortion is again illegal in North Dakota after the state's Supreme Court on Friday couldn't muster the required majority to uphold a judge's ruling that struck down the state's ban last year.",
      "The 2023 law makes it a felony crime for anyone to perform an abortion, though it specifically protects patients from prosecution. Doctors could be prosecuted and penalized by as much as five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.",
      "Three justices agreed that the ban is unconstitutionally vague under the state constitution. The other two justices said the law is not unconstitutional.",
      "The state constitution requires at least four of the five justices to agree for a law to be found unconstitutional, a high bar. Not enough members of the court joined together to affirm the lower court ruling.",
      "In his opinion, Justice Jerod Tufte said the natural rights guaranteed by the state constitution in 1889 do not extend to abortion rights. He also said the law \"provides adequate and fair warning to those attempting to comply.\"",
      "North Dakota Republican Attorney Drew Wrigley welcomed the ruling, saying, \"The Supreme Court has upheld this important pro-life legislation, enacted by the people's Legislature. The Attorney General's office has the solemn responsibility of defending the laws of North Dakota, and today those laws have been upheld.\"",
      "Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who introduced the 2023 legislation that became the law banning abortion, said she is \"thrilled and grateful that two justices that are highly respected saw the truth of the matter, that this is fully constitutional for the mother and for the unborn child and thereafter for that sake.\"",
      "Attorneys for the challengers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The ruling means access to abortion in North Dakota will be outlawed. Even after a judge had earlier struck down the ban last year, the only scenarios for a patient to obtain an abortion in North Dakota had been for life- or health-preserving reasons in a hospital.",
      "The only abortion provider relocated in 2022 from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota.",
      "Justice Daniel Crothers, one of the three judges to vote against the ban, wrote that the district court decision wasn't wrong.",
      "\"The vagueness in the law relates to when an abortion can be performed to preserve the life and health of the mother,\" Crothers wrote. \"After striking this invalid provision, the remaining portions of the law would be inoperable.\"",
      "North Dakota's newly confirmed ban prohibits the performance of an abortion as a felony crime. The only exceptions are for rape or incest in the first six weeks \u2014 before many women know they are pregnant \u2014 and to prevent the mother's death or a \"serious health risk\" to her.",
      "North Dakota joins 12 other states enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy. Another four bar it at or around six weeks gestational age.",
      "Judge Bruce Romanick had struck down the ban the state Legislature passed in 2023, less than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to the state-level bans, largely turning the abortion battle to state courts and legislatures.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coast-guard-guidance-nooses-swastikas-hate-symbols/",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 18:25:53 -0500",
    "summary": "A Coast Guard personnel directive updated language identifying symbols of racial or religious hatred, setting off a political firestorm this week.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard is scrambling to clarify proposed internal policy changes that appeared to loosen how the service branch handles the conduct within its ranks involving hate symbols including nooses, swastikas, and other extremist symbols \u2014 touching off a political firestorm inside the nation's smallest military branch after the Space Force.",
      "The controversy centers on a little-noticed personnel directive signed on Nov. 13 by Rear Admiral Charles Fosse, the assistant commandant for personnel, following a report by the Washington Post. The document, titled \"Harassing Behavior Prevention, Response and Accountability,\" contained a provision that proposed replacing longstanding language that explicitly identified swastikas, nooses, Confederate iconography and other symbols of racial or religious hatred as \"incidents of hatred and prejudice.\"",
      "Instead, the Coast Guard's new policy recast those same images as \"potentially divisive,\" a subtle but consequential shift that alarmed lawmakers and civil rights groups when it was first reported this week.",
      "What did the original policy actually change?",
      "The internal guidance that ignited the controversy introduced a few changes. The Coast Guard eliminated the term \"hate incident.\" Instead, conduct previously handled under that category was referred to as harassment \u2014 and only when a specific victim could be identified.",
      "The guidance also raised the threshold for disciplinary action by specifying that public displays of extremist symbols would constitute misconduct only if they could be shown to harm \"good order and discipline, unit cohesion, command climate, morale or mission effectiveness.\"",
      "Further, the policy also allowed symbols \"widely identified with oppression or hatred\" to be displayed in private or non-public settings, including military housing. The policy removed gender identity from the list of protected characteristics altogether, aligning the Coast Guard with Mr. Trump's January executive order barring transgender service.",
      "It also required that harassment be \"severe or pervasive\" and judged by a \"reasonable person.\" And it went out of its way to note that hazing \u2014 even when it involves physical force \u2014 can serve \"a proper military or other governmental purpose,\" a framing that echoes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's push to cultivate a tougher \"warrior ethos.\"",
      "What was the response?",
      "For years, Coast Guard policy has drawn a bright line on extremist symbols, stating unequivocally that items like nooses and swastikas \"have no place in the Coast Guard.\" The discovery that the service intended to downgrade them to \"potentially divisive\" immediately raised alarms on Capitol Hill.",
      "Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois said she met with the Coast Guard's acting commandant, Adm. Kevin Lunday, to express her concerns and was reassured that the policy would be clarified.",
      "\"He came by the office and assured us that there is an across-the-board prohibition on hate symbols, including swastikas and nooses,\" Underwood remarked in a video statement.",
      "Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington said in a statement, Thursday, that \"lynching is a federal hate crime. The world defeated the Nazis in 1945. The debate on these symbols is over.\" He added, \"Coast Guard: be better.\"",
      "By removing the \"hate incident\" designation, the Coast Guard appeared to create a narrower pathway for removing racist or extremist imagery from operational facilities, barracks and other training environments. Its new timeline for reporting \u2014 requiring victims to come forward within 45 days \u2014 also raised eyebrows over concerns it might deter reporting and make enforcement harder.",
      "In January, President Trump abruptly removed Adm. Linda Fagan as commandant just a day after taking office, placing Coast Guard leadership under scrutiny.",
      "What is the Coast Guard saying now?",
      "In response to the uproar, Lunday issued a forceful statement just hours after the policy became public, asserting that \"any display, use or promotion of symbols like nooses and swastikas will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished.\"",
      "Later that night, the service released an additional memo declaring that \"divisive or hate symbols and flags are prohibited\" at Coast Guard workplaces \u2014 an even firmer posture. The Coast Guard insisted the new memo was not a reversal but rather a clarification meant to counter \"misinformation\" and reaffirm the service's longstanding stance against extremist imagery.",
      "Still, leadership has not explained why earlier guidance explicitly permitted private displays or eliminated the \"hate incident\" language altogether.",
      "How do harassment cases work under the new framework?",
      "Even with the late clarifications, the underlying mechanics of the directive remain changed in significant ways. Because the term \"hate incident\" has been retired, displays of extremist symbols are not automatically categorized as harassment, and commanders will have to determine whether a specific victim exists and whether the conduct meets the now higher bar of being \"severe or pervasive.\"",
      "Investigations and punishment will use a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard \u2014 higher than before \u2014 and leaders evaluating an incident must consider how a hypothetical \"reasonable person\" would interpret any alleged misconduct.",
      "The directive does reinforce that any public displays of the Confederate battle flag remain prohibited, except in rare instances of historical or artistic contexts. And although victims have 45 days to file a harassment report, commanders must notify their chain of command within 48 hours if an incident sparks potential interest from the media or Congress.",
      "The Coast Guard occupies a unique middle ground \u2014 subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice but operating under the Department of Homeland Security rather than the Defense Department. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been outspoken in his intent to roll back what he views as \"woke\" personnel policies, including diversity initiatives and certain extremism-prevention measures.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/comey-seeks-dismissal-grand-jury-indictment-errors/",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 18:08:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Comey's lawyers said in a filing that errors in the grand jury process \"reflect the reckless and ill-conceived nature of this prosecution.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former FBI Director James Comey is seeking to dismiss the criminal case against him because of what he claims were \"fundamental errors\" in the grand-jury process and interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's handling of the indictment.",
      "Comey's filing, submitted to the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Friday, reflects information revealed during a court proceeding earlier this week, during which federal prosecutors said that the grand jury that indicted Comey on two criminal counts did not vote on the operative indictment.",
      "Defense lawyers instead said that the grand jury rejected the only indictment that Halligan presented to it, and argued that the government's attempt to prosecute Comey without a \"valid\" indictment violates his Fifth Amendment rights.",
      "In addition to questioning the validity of the operative indictment, which charges Comey with one count of lying to Congress and one count of obstructing a congressional proceeding, defense lawyers argued that the case should be dismissed because of alleged misconduct by Halligan before the grand jury.",
      "Halligan, who was appointed interim U.S. attorney in late September, mere days before Comey was indicted, was the only prosecutor who presented the case against Comey before the grand jury, and only she signed the indictment. Comey has pleaded not guilty to both counts.",
      "\"Those errors reflect the reckless and ill-conceived nature of this prosecution: A president intent on prosecuting Mr. Comey before the statute of limitations expired directed the appointment of a White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, as interim U.S. Attorney, and she then rushed to secure an indictment while flagrantly violating basic grand jury rules in the process,\" Comey's lawyers wrote in their bid to dismiss the case. \"Those grand jury errors warrant dismissal twice over.\"",
      "Questions about the proceedings before the grand jury gained steam Monday when a federal magistrate judge identified what he said was a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in its handling of the case against the ex-FBI director.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick found that during Halligan's presentation to the grand jury, the former White House aide made two statements that \"on their face appear to be fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the integrity of the grand jury process.\"",
      "Halligan worked as a former insurance lawyer before joining Mr. Trump in the White House for his second term. She had no prosecutorial experience when she was tapped to lead the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Grand jury transcripts are typically secret, but U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick reviewed them as part of a separate hearing on the grand-jury material in Comey's case and whether it should be handed over to the defense.",
      "Fitzpatrick said one statement Halligan made to the grand jury \"suggests\" that Comey does not have a constitutional right to not testify at trial. The second remark from Halligan suggested that the grand jury \"did not have to rely on only the record before them\" and that there was \"more evidence \u2014 perhaps better evidence\" that the Justice Department had that would be used at trial, the judge said.",
      "In a statement, a Justice Department official said that \"when the grand jury transcript is read in full \u2014 as federal judicial ethics require \u2014 it shows that U.S. Attorney Halligan's statements were entirely proper. Selectively quoting half-sentences cannot create impropriety where none exists.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick also raised concerns with the evidence the Justice Department used in its grand jury presentation, finding that much of the material used was seized by the FBI in an earlier probe into Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University and friend of Comey's who was investigated during the first Trump administration for allegedly leaking to the media. The investigation was closed in 2021 and no charges were filed.",
      "Fitzpatrick said the materials seized from Richman were the \"cornerstone\" of Halligan's presentation to the grand jury that voted to indict Comey, and found that the Justice Department may have used information that was collected but outside of the scope of the initial Richman search warrants, as well as potentially privileged information, during the grand-jury proceedings in Comey's case.",
      "The FBI, Fitzpatrick said, \"chose to rummage through\" the material it seized more than five years ago again this summer when it began investigating Comey, and \"inexplicably, the government elected not to seek a new warrant for the 2025 search\" of Richman's devices, \"even though the 2025 investigation was focused on a different person, was exploring a fundamentally different legal theory, and was predicated on an entirely different set of criminal offenses.\"",
      "A Justice Department official said \"the Government remains committed to following the law, respecting grand-jury secrecy, and ensuring that judicial decisions rest on facts \u2014 not assumptions. The magistrate judge's order does not meet that standard.\"",
      "During a hearing Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, who is presiding over Comey's case, the judge repeatedly questioned federal prosecutors about the validity of the operative indictment and the events surrounding the grand-jury proceedings on Sept. 25.",
      "Documents made public in Comey's case show that the grand jury was initially presented with a three-count indictment, but rejected one of the counts and voted to indict him on the two others.",
      "Tyler Lemons, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the judge that after the grand-jury coordinator informed the U.S. attorney's office about the outcome of the vote, a second indictment was drafted to remove the rejected count and list only the two approved by the grand jury.",
      "But the admission prompted Nachmanoff to question whether the grand jurors had ever been presented with and voted on the second two-count indictment, or whether it was given straight to a U.S. magistrate judge who was presiding over the return of the indictment.",
      "Lemons said the two-count indictment was given straight to the judge, and argued it was not a \"new\" indictment. Instead, he said it had been edited only to reflect the grand jury's decision to charge Comey with lying to Congress and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.",
      "Nachmanoff then asked if the second indictment was never shown to the entire grand jury. The prosecutor said that was correct. Halligan separately told the judge that only the foreperson for the grand jury and another grand juror were in the courtroom when the indictment was presented to the magistrate judge. That assertion was also backed up in a court filing Wednesday, when the Justice Department said that the \"corrected indictment\" with only the two counts marked was presented to the grand jury foreperson and deputy foreperson.",
      "Comey's lawyers seized on that admission, and argued during the hearing that the operative indictment was never presented to the grand jury and never voted on.",
      "\"There is no indictment that Mr. Comey is facing,\" Michael Dreeben, one of his attorneys, told the judge.",
      "Prosecutors attempted to clear up confusion about the proceedings and, pointing to the transcript of proceedings when the indictment was returned, wrote in a filing\u00a0Thursday that the foreperson told the court that the grand jury voted on the two-count indictment.",
      "\"The complete record eliminates any doubt: The foreperson confirmed the vote. The Court acknowledged the vote. The Court docketed the two-count true bill as the operative indictment. Only Count One lacked concurrence; Counts Two and Three were true-billed by at least twelve jurors,\" they said.",
      "But in their latest bid to dismiss the charges related to the alleged grand-jury issues, Comey's lawyers argued that \"there is no record of the grand jury seeing the new indictment \u2014 let alone voting on it.\" Prosecutors' \"late-breaking\" effort to correct the record \"cannot save the putative indictment,\" they continued.",
      "Their filing, defense lawyers said, \"contradicts numerous other representations that the government has made to this Court. And it rests on an erroneous overreading of an ambiguous exchange between the grand jury foreperson and the magistrate judge.\"",
      "The topic of the hearing earlier this week was Comey's effort to dismiss the indictment on the basis that his prosecution is vindictive and selective. Nachmanoff has yet to rule on that motion. Comey is also seeking to have the charges tossed out on the grounds that Halligan was unlawfully appointed interim U.S. attorney. A different judge is weighing that request and has said she intends to rule before Thanksgiving.",

    "story": [
      "As New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani wrapped up his high-stakes meeting with President Trump Friday, the president said\u00a0the two had a great conversation\u00a0centered on the future of New York City.",
      "The two leaders spent half an hour answering questions from reporters in the Oval Office and highlighting some surprising areas of agreement.",
      "Here are the top four takeaways from the meeting.",
      "The meeting was surprisingly cordial",
      "Mr. Trump and Mamdani have spent months criticizing each other. For two people who appeared, going into the meeting, to be at such loggerheads, the conviviality the two displayed, cracking jokes and offering friendly pats with one another, was surprising.",
      "They joked about past names they've called one another. At one point, Mr. Trump responded when Mamdani was asked about having called the president a \"despot\" and \"fascist.\"",
      "\"I've been called much worse than a despot,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think he'll change his mind once he gets to know me.\"",
      "During the meeting, Mr. Trump clapped Mamdani on the shoulder in a friendly gesture. At one point, Mr. Trump told reporters Mamdani could end up being the best mayor New York has ever seen.",
      "\"I just want to congratulate [him], I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor, and the better he does, the happier I am,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The two pledged to work together",
      "Mamdani and Mr. Trump, who both have roots in Queens, said repeatedly they look forward to working together.",
      "\"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,\" Mr. Trump said. \"A big help, because I want New York City to be great.\"",
      "The two appeared to bury the hatchet, abandoning the name-calling and divisive rhetoric.",
      "Mamdani seemed to relish his first test of diplomacy on the national stage, smiling and laughing as the two spoke about common ground.",
      "\"When I spoke to New Yorkers who had voted for the president last November on Hillside Avenue and Fordham Road, I heard, again and again, two major reasons. One, was that they wanted an end to forever wars. They wanted an end to taxpayer dollars we had funding violations of human rights, and they wanted to address the cost of living crisis. And I appreciated the chance to discuss both of those things,\" Mamdani said.",
      "\"He said a lot of my voters actually voted for him, and I'm OK with that,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously threatened to pull federal funding if Mamdani won. He said Friday he and Mamdani are aligned on many issues, like keeping New York City safe.",
      "\"So, we're going to work together. We're going to make sure that if there are horrible people, that we want to get them out,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He wants to have a safe New York. Ultimately, a safe New York is going to be a great New York.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he'd feel comfortable living in New York under a Mamdani administration.",
      "Mamdani got good advice",
      "Before the meeting, Mamdani spoke by phone with Gov. Kathy Hochul, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.",
      "Based on the outcome of the meeting, Mamdani got some good advice.",
      "\"I think that [Mamdani] went there knowing that he had to make a friend of Donald Trump for this reason: he can't get his agenda passed if he has troops marching down Fifth Avenue, or if he has to deal with more ICE agents,\" CBS News New York's political reporter Marcia Kramer said. \"He can't do his budget if he's going to have a huge chunk in it caused by a loss of federal funds. So he knew he had to make him his friend. And I think he did that, and I think that the advice probably that made the most sense to him came from Gov. Hochul. Because the governor had tried repeatedly to get along with the president, and I think she gave him some tips on how to do it.\"",
      "Kramer added that both Mr. Trump and Mamdani \"had a lot riding on this meeting.\"",
      "\"[President Trump] doesn't need a fight with the mayor of New York City, who has the media spotlight, not only in New York City, but the international media spotlight. This is not something President Trump wants,\" Kramer said. \"And besides, let's remember this. This is his hometown. He may be living in Florida. This is his hometown. He has a lot of real estate interests here. And if Mr. Mamdani does not succeed as mayor, it's going to hurt the president in his pocketbook.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he wanted to be mayor himself",
      "A surprising moment was when Mr. Trump admitted that being mayor of New York is a \"big deal.\"",
      "\"I always said, one of the things I would've loved to be someday, is the mayor of New York City, \" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Kramer pointed out that the president is term-limited, but he could run for mayor in New York City at the end of his term.",

      "The outcome of the meeting could be hugely consequential for the future of New York City. There's a lot on the line -- from\u00a0funding for infrastructure projects, to setting parameters around\u00a0immigration enforcement and, perhaps most importantly, Mamdani needs federal security clearance to be briefed on terror threats and other law enforcement activity.",
      "The mayor-elected shared a photo on social media Friday morning that appeared to show him on board a plane to D.C.",
      "\"I will work with him on any agenda that benefits New Yorkers\"",
      "The high stakes meeting comes\u00a0after months of public hostility\u00a0between the two men. Mr. Trump sharply\u00a0criticized Mamdani during the mayoral campaign, even threatening to arrest and deport him, and has falsely labeled him a \"communist,\" when he's a democratic socialist.",
      "Mamdani, in turn, accused Mr. Trump of acting like an authoritarian and promised to challenge what he calls federal overreach.",
      "The mayor-elect, who vowed to \"Trump-proof\" the city\u00a0on election night, said he reached out to the president to\u00a0set up the sit-down\u00a0meeting.",
      "\"I have many disagreements with the president, and I believe that we should be relentless and pursue all avenues and all meetings that could make our city affordable for every single New Yorker,\" Mamdani\u00a0told reporters Thursday. \"I intend to make it clear to President Trump that I will work with him on any agenda that benefits New Yorkers.\"",
      "He says he plans to focus on the issue of affordability Friday, including federal funding for housing and transit, the future of New York's status as a sanctuary city and the president's threat to withhold certain federal grants unless the city complies with new immigration enforcement tactics.",
      "\"I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than 8.5 million people who call this city home,\" Mamdani said Thursday.",
      "Can they find common ground?",
      "The White House called the meeting an opportunity for \"clarity and cooperation.\" Press secretary Karoline Leavitt seemed to indicate Thursday that Mr. Trump still had reservations about the 34-year-old mayor-elect.",
      "\"I think it speaks volumes that we have a communist coming to the White House, because that's who the Democrat party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up territory and swear off NATO membership.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war\u00a0\u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official.",
      "The 28-point plan is the most recent working document offered by the administration, reflecting feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, the White House official said. It still remains unclear whether both sides will agree to it; diplomatic conversations are ongoing and further changes are being negotiated, according to multiple sources.",
      "While some European governments were aware the U.S. was working on a proposal, they were not involved in drafting it,\u00a0according to European officials contacted by CBS News.",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "The plan was also presented to a senior member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, Rustem Umerov, a White House official said. Umerov confirmed on\u00a0X\u00a0that he was party to the talks on a technical level but said, \"I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure.\"",
      "On Thursday, Zelenskyy met with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in Kyiv, and was presented with what he later characterized in a post on X as \"points of a plan to end the war \u2014 [America's] vision.\" Zelenskyy said he outlined Ukraine's key principles, and the two sides agreed to continue working on the plan's provisions. A White House official told CBS News that Driscoll had two hours of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including 45 minutes of direct talks with Zelenskyy, which they described as \"productive.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS News: \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after 5 years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"",
      "Here's how the proposed plan would work:",
      "Immediate ceasefire",
      "The plan says a ceasefire would take effect immediately if both sides agree to the deal.",
      "Ukraine expected to give up its eastern regions",
      "As written, the plan would allow Russia to hold onto much of the Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies \u2014 and take over some Ukrainian-held areas.",
      "The plan calls for the Ukrainian oblasts of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to be recognized by the U.S. and others as de facto Russian territory. Crimea was fully annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Russian military has occupied most of Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 collectively known as the Donbas \u2014 since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine were first occupied by Russian-aligned forces in 2014.",
      "Crucially, parts of Donetsk that are still under Ukrainian control would also be ceded to Russia, according to the proposal, but would be deemed a neutral buffer zone with no Russian military presence.",
      "The conflict would be frozen at the existing front lines in two other Ukrainian oblasts \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhia \u2014 effectively allowing Russia to hold onto cities like Mariupol and retain a land connection to Crimea.",
      "Those terms could prove to be a sticking point for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has long refused to give up any new territory or recognize Russian control over Crimea, instead calling for the war to be paused on the existing conflict lines.",
      "Ukraine must cap its military size",
      "The proposal also calls for Ukraine to cap the size of its military at 600,000 people.",
      "Zelensky said in January that the country's military numbered 880,000, according to the Kyiv Independent. Six years earlier, it had roughly 250,000 troops, the Atlantic Council said.",
      "No to NATO membership \u2014 but Ukraine can join the EU",
      "Under the plan, Ukraine would be barred from joining NATO.",
      "The country would be expected to modify its constitution to specify that it will not join the 32-nation bloc, a change of course since the country's NATO aspirations are currently enshrined in its constitution. Ukraine has pursued NATO membership for years, a status that would require the United States and other members to come to the country's defense if it's attacked again.",
      "And NATO is expected to agree not to accept Ukraine into the alliance. In 2008, its member states issued a declaration agreeing that Ukraine would become a member of NATO at some point in the future, but it did not set out a timeline.",
      "The plan also calls for NATO to agree not to send troops to Ukraine \u2014 possibly scuttling any postwar security deal that involves placing allied troops on Ukrainian soil.",
      "Another point in the plan says Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand any further \u2014 a favorable point for Russia, which has long chafed at the alliance's post-Cold War expansions. Sweden and Finland are the alliance's newest members, joining in 2024 and 2023, respectively, partly in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "NATO's longstanding position is that it has an \"open door policy,\" and decisions to admit new countries are made by its members, not any other countries.",
      "But the plan does specify that Ukraine has a right to join the European Union, and that it would get access to the European market in the meantime. Russia has long been wary of further economic and political integration between Ukraine and Europe.",
      "A U.S. guarantee",
      "The plan lays out a security guarantee if Russia reinvades Ukraine, calling for a \"decisive coordinated military response\" and the reinstatement of sanctions on Russia. Other benefits from the agreement, including recognition of new Russian territory, would be called off as well. The plan does not specify what type of military response Russia would face.",
      "The guarantee would be terminated if Ukraine invades Russia, or if it launches missiles at Moscow or St. Petersburg.",
      "Ukrainian elections",
      "Ukraine would be expected to hold elections in 100 days. Ukraine had elections scheduled for early 2024, but they were delayed due to the war. Zelenskyy won the presidency in 2019.",
      "Economic plan for Ukraine, Russian sanctions lifted",
      "The plan calls for a recovery plan for Ukraine, whose economy has been devastated by a yearslong Russian invasion and aerial bombardment. That includes reconstruction of Ukrainian cities, a development fund to boost Ukraine's tech industry and investments in mining and gas.",
      "Some $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be invested in Ukraine, with the U.S. leading that effort. Europe would contribute an additional $100 billion.",
      "The plan also calls for negotiations on lifting the hefty sanctions that Russia has faced since the invasion began, choking it off from much of the global economy. The sanctions would be lifted in stages, according to the framework. And frozen Russian assets beyond $100 billion would be plowed into a joint U.S.-Russia investment fund.",
      "The overall plan would be monitored and enforced by a Peace Council, to be chaired by President Trump.",
      "Other points in the plan include a Russia-NATO security dialogue, a joint U.S.-Russia security working group and a non-aggression pact between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. It would also extend U.S.-Russia arms control treaties, require Ukraine to be a non-nuclear state and bar Russia from blocking Ukraine from using the key Dnipro river for commercial purposes.",
      "All civilian detainees taken during the war would be returned, including children, and both sides in the conflict would be granted amnesty for their conduct during the war. And both countries would be expected to adopt educational programs to discourage racial prejudice.",
      "The plan also calls for a return of Russia to the Group of Eight, a grouping of powerful countries that kicked Russia out after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.",
      "Leavitt said in her statement: \"As the Trump Administration has clearly said, any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe, and Russia to ensure the end of the war, in addition to financial opportunities for Ukraine to rebuild, and for Russia to rejoin the global economy, to benefit the people in both countries.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has called Zohran Mamdani \"my little communist mayor,\" while Mamdani has vowed to \"Trump-proof\" New York City.",
    "story": [
      "Update: President Trump and Mayor-elect Mamdani struck a positive tone in their meeting. Read the latest here. Our earlier story is below.",
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has called Zohran Mamdani \"my little communist mayor.\" Mamdani has vowed to \"Trump-proof\" New York City. On Friday, after months of heated rhetoric on both sides, the president and the mayor-elect of the nation's biggest city were\u00a0set to meet for the first time at the White House.",
      "Mamdani, a democratic socialist, doesn't have much in common politically with the Republican president. But he called the meeting \"an opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers\" and said he plans to discuss economic security and public safety.",
      "\"I'll be ready for whatever happens,\" Mamdani said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday, \"President Trump is willing to meet with anyone and talk to anyone and to try to do what's right on behalf of the American people.\"",
      "Mamdani used similar language, saying his team reached out to set up the meeting \"because I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than 8.5 million people who call this city home.\"",
      "But often, their words for each other have been more combative.",
      "Mr. Trump, who grew up in Queens and built his business career in New York City, has decried the incoming mayor as \"a communist lunatic.\" Mamdani has blasted the president's immigration raids and economic policies.",
      "Here's a sampling of what the two men have said about each other:",
      "Trump has leaned into calling Mamdani a \"communist\"",
      "The president has repeatedly referred to Mamdani, a self-identifying democratic socialist, as a communist. He's called him \"my little communist mayor\" and a \"communist lunatic.\"",
      "\"Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We've had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0posted in June.",
      "\"I don't know what it is, but we have to win the midterms otherwise all of the things that we've done, so many of them are going to be taken away by the radical left lunatics,\" the president said ahead of Election Day. \"I mean, we're going to end up with a communist mayor in New York, can you believe it, a communist? Remember, I would always say we will not have a socialist elected in our country.\"",
      "Trump has suggested Mamdani, a naturalized citizen, may be in the country illegally",
      "President Trump \u2014 who spent years promoting \"birther\" conspiracies about President Obama \u2014 has suggested that Mamdani isn't in the country legally, despite Mamdani being a naturalized U.S. citizen. Mamdani was born in Uganda and moved to New York City with his family at age 7. He gained citizenship in 2018.",
      "\"A lot of people are saying he's here illegally,\" he said of Mamdani this summer. \"We're going to look at everything.\"",
      "The president has also floated the possibility of arresting Mamdani if he tries to keep U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from arresting and deporting people. If that happens, the president said, \"Well then, we'll have to arrest him.\"",
      "Trump has threatened to pull federal funding from New York City",
      "Before Mamdani's election, Mr. Trump urged New Yorkers to vote for his rival, former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and threatened to pull federal funding from New York City if Mamdani were mayor.",
      "\"If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home,\" said Mr. Trump, who spent most of his life in New York before changing his primary residency to Florida in 2019.",
      "The Trump administration's efforts to pull federal funding for projects in blue cities and states during the government shutdown has been met with resistance in court.",
      "But after Mamdani won, the president sounded like he might take a different approach.",
      "\"We'll help them,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We want New York to be successful. We'll help them a little bit, maybe.\"",
      "Trump said Jews who vote for Mamdani are \"stupid\"",
      "The president said during the campaign that any Jews who vote for Mamdani are \"stupid\" because of Mamdani's\u00a0positions on Israel and support for Palestinian statehood.",
      "\"Any Jewish person that votes for Zohran Mamdani, a proven and self professed JEW HATER, is a stupid person!!!\" the president wrote.",
      "Mamdani has said his views were often misrepresented. \"And frankly, I think much of it has to do with that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election,\" he said during the last debate.",
      "Trump said \"Mamdani, or whatever the hell his name is\"",
      "Speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami on Nov. 5, Mr. Trump brought up Mamdani while talking about the subject of transgender athletes.",
      "\"How about the weightlifting? 218 pounds by a woman, that's a lot to lift over your head. 218 pounds, or whatever, was the record. A man beat the record by 100 pounds. It stood for, like, 17 years or something. A man beat the record by 100 pounds. He was a failed male weightlifter, but as a female, he did very well,\" Trump said, mimicking a weightlifter. \"People are crazy.\"",
      "\"And Mamdani, whatever the hell his name is, in New York. He thinks it's wonderful to have men playing in women's sports,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mamdani has said he's ready to challenge Trump",
      "On the campaign trail, Mamdani was highly critical of the president's immigration crackdown. He's also suggested the president and his administration are looking out for the rich.",
      "During his victory speech, Mamdani spoke directly to the president: \"Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!\" he said to a cheering crowd.",
      "\"If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him,\" Mamdani said.",
      "Mamdani said he won't be intimidated by the president.",
      "\"His threats are inevitable,\" Mamdani said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" the morning after his victory. \"This has nothing to do with safety, it has to do with intimidation.\"",
      "Mamdani has also made the argument that Mr. Trump's policies have made life more expensive for New Yorkers.",
      "\"The Trump administration continues to find new ways to raise costs on all of us,\" he said.",
      "Mamdani criticized \"transphobic bigotry\" from Trump administration",
      "After current New York Mayor Eric Adams suggested revising school bathroom policies, Mamdani tweeted, \"Awful and dangerous to hear the Mayor echo the transphobic bigotry coming from the Trump administration.\"",
      "\"It's completely at odds with the values of our city,\" he added.",
      "Mamdani said Trump wants to have him \"arrested, stripped of my citizenship, put in a detention camp and deported\"",
      "In a social media post in July, Mamdani said Mr. Trump \"just threatened to have me arrested, stripped of my citizenship, put in a detention camp and deported\" over Mamdani's objections to Mr. Trump's deportation policies.",
      "\"His statements don't just represent an attack on our democracy but an attempt to send a message to every New Yorker who refuses to hide in the shadows: if you speak up, they will come for you,\" Mamdani wrote. \"We will not accept this intimidation.\"",
      "Mamdani said he'll work with Trump on any agenda item that benefits New Yorkers",
      "Mamdani says he'll work with the president on any agenda item that benefits New York City residents.",
      "\"I intend to make it clear to President Trump that I will work on any agenda that benefits New Yorkers,\" he said in a press availability. \"If an agenda hurts New Yorkers, I will also be the first to say so.\"",

    "summary": "Only 776 air traffic controllers and techs with perfect attendance during the government shutdown will get $10,000 bonuses while nearly 20,000 others will be left out, the FAA says.",
    "story": [
      "Only 776 air traffic controllers and technicians who had perfect attendance during the government shutdown will receive $10,000 bonuses while nearly 20,000 other workers will be left out, the Federal Aviation Administration announced Thursday.",
      "A number of controllers started calling out of work as the shutdown dragged on longer than a month and they dealt with the financial pressure of working without a paycheck. Some of them got side jobs, but others simply couldn't afford the child care or gas they needed to work. Their absences forced delays at airports across the country and led the government to order airlines to cut some of their flights at 40 busy airports.",
      "President Trump suggested the bonuses for those who have stayed on the job in a social media post, but he also suggested that controllers who missed work should have their pay docked. FAA officials haven't publicly announced plans to penalize controllers.",
      "Thousands of FAA technicians also had to work during the shutdown to maintain the equipment that air traffic controllers rely on. At least 6,600 technicians were expected to work throughout the shutdown but more than 3,000 others were subject to be recalled to work.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the bonuses acknowledged the dedication of these few workers who never missed a shift during the 43-day shutdown. In a post on X he described it as \"Santa's coming to town a little early.\"",
      "\"These patriotic men and women never missed a beat and kept the flying public safe throughout the shutdown,\" Duffy said in his formal announcement.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association union said only 311 of its more than 10,000 members will receive the bonuses. The union said these workers with perfect attendance deserve recognition but so do the others.",
      "\"We are concerned that thousands of air traffic controllers who consistently reported for duty during the shutdown, ensuring the safe transport of passengers and cargo across the nation, while working without pay and uncertain of when they would receive compensation, were excluded from this recognition. More than 311 of these dedicated professionals were instrumental in keeping America moving,\" the union said in a statement.",
      "The Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union said the thousands of technicians it represents worked hard to keep the aging computer and radar systems controllers use operating during the shutdown and they should all be recognized - not just the 423 getting bonuses.",
      "\"It took many hands to ensure that not one delay during the historic 43-day shutdown was attributed to equipment or system failures,\" the union said in a statement.",
      "Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington State questioned why all the controllers and others who worked to keep flights moving during during the shutdown won't get bonuses.",
      "\"For the Trump administration to not give a bonus to every single one of these hardworking women and men is wrong; they all deserve a bonus and back pay,\" said Larsen, the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee.",
      "The controllers union said they hope to work with Duffy to find a way to recognize all the other air traffic controllers who worked during the shutdown.",
      "Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that any TSA officers who went \"above and beyond\" while working without pay would get $10,000 bonuses but she never specified how many will qualify beyond the handful of checks she handed out to officers at a news conference.",
      "The FAA was already critically short on air traffic controllers before the shutdown. Duffy had been working to boost controller hiring and streamline the years of training required in the hope of eliminating the shortage over the next several years.",
      "Duffy has said that some students and controllers quit and more experienced controllers retired during the shutdown. Many controllers already work 10-hour shifts six days a week because the FAA is so short on staffing.",
      "As more controllers missed work, the FAA ordered airlines to cut flights to relieve pressure on the system. Duffy said repeatedly that FAA safety experts became worried as the absences grew because of reports from pilots concerned about controllers' responses and a number of runway incursions.   FAA lifts emergency order that slashed flights at 40 major U.S. airportsSince the shutdown ended, controller staffing has improved significantly and airlines were allowed to resume normal operations this week.",

And what we found, actually, is that 1 in 10 New Yorkers who voted for Trump ended up voting for our campaign, and they did so because they're looking for leaders to actually deliver on the cost of living crisis,\" Mamdani said.",
      "\"An opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers\"",
      "CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer asked Mamdani how he feels heading into the White House meeting. He told reporters he's not concerned and views it as an opportunity.",
      "\"This is an opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers, and it's a case that reflects what New Yorkers are having to live through at this time,\" he told Kramer.",
      "He pointed to 1 in 4 New Yorkers living in poverty and 1 in 5 struggling to afford the $2.90 bus fare.",
      "\"New Yorkers for whom the daily acts of live are becoming increasingly harder to afford,\" he continued. \"And that's an opportunity I have to make the case to President Trump, to the White House, as to what it means to have to suffer through this affordability crisis and what it means to make it even more difficult to do so.\"",
      "Mamdani was asked whether he expects to face any negativity from the president or from other lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Mr. Trump has been a vocal critic of the democratic socialist, previously calling him a \"communist\" and threatening to withhold federal funding.",
      "\"Being a New Yorker means that you're prepared for all situations, all kinds of comments, all kinds of commentary,\" Mamdani replied Thursday. \"At the end of it, the focus has to be, what's the case that you're making, why are you there? And for me, it's not about myself, it's not about a relationship with an individual, it's about a relationship between New York City and the White House, the president, the federal administration.\"",
      "It's important the two strike up a relationship for a number of reasons, Kramer reported. It's not only about federal aid or threats from White House border czar Tom Homan to send more ICE agents into the city. Mamdani will need a federal security clearance in order to be briefed on terror threats and other law enforcement matters, and the president could hold the key to that.",
      "CBS News New York asked Mamdani's team if he planned to meet with other lawmakers in Washington and were told we'll find out Friday.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has tried to forge a working relationship with the president even though they have major policy disagreements, says she thinks the two men will be able to find some common ground.",
      "\"Let's get the Gateway Tunnel finished. Let's work on our subway system, money that we need here in the city. And also just the conversation about how it is not necessary to send in the National Guard because crime is going down dramatically,\" Hochul said.",
      "\"We have a communist coming to the White House\"",
      "\"It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House, because that's who the Democrat party elected mayor of the largest city in the country,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. \"I think it's very telling, but I also think it speaks to the fact that President Trump is willing to meet with anyone, and talk to anyone, and to try to do what's right on behalf of the American people, whether they live in blue states or red states or blue cities, and in a city that's becoming much more left than I think the president ever anticipated in his many years of living in New York itself.\"",
      "Leavitt was asked whether Mamdani could convince the president not to cut off funding New York City, as he has threatened.",
      "\"We'll see how the meeting goes tomorrow, and I'll let for the president speak for himself,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Mamdani on disagreements with Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch",
      "The mayor-elect's remarks followed Wednesday's announcement that NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch has agreed to stay on\u00a0as leader of the police department.",
      "\"Every commissioner should be a fierce advocate for those that work for their department or their agency, and I look forward to ensuring that that is the case across the entirety of my administration \u2014 where, when I have a meeting with the commissioners, I know that they are bringing forth the concerns of those that they work with, those they represent, so we can make sure we are actually addressing them,\" Mamdani told reporters Thursday.",
      "He added any disagreements they may have \"are actually signs of a healthy relationship.\"",
      "\"Too often mayors and leaders are looking to surround themselves with people who are characterized by the quickness with which they can say yes, as opposed to the quickness with which they can tell you their honest opinion,\" he said.",

      "Hours after federal judges blocked Texas from using its newly drawn congressional map, state leaders filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The redrawn map sparked a nationwide redistricting battle and is part of President Trump's efforts to preserve a Republican majority in the House of Representatives in next year's midterm elections.",
      "The Tuesday ruling came in a 2-1 vote by a three-judge panel. It dealt a blow to Republicans while Democrats celebrated it.",
      "That's because under the newly drawn map approved by Republicans, who stood to gain five congressional seats in Texas, the Democrats were facing a game of political musical chairs -- some were set to retire or primary each other. Now, that may not have to happen.",
      "\"Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map,\" which is illegal, the two federal judges who voted to block the map said in the ruling.",
      "They also cited a U.S. Department of Justice letter to Gov. Greg Abbott from July about four coalition districts made up of Blacks and Latinos that include the 33rd Congressional District in North Texas, represented by Democrat Marc Veasey.",
      "\"DOJ threatened legal action if Texas didn't immediately dismantle and redraw these districts, a threat based on their racial makeup. Notably, the DOJ letter targeted only majority non-white districts,\" the judges' ruling said. \"Any mention of majority white districts, which DOJ presumably would have also targeted if its aims were partisan rather than racial, was conspicuously absent.\"",
      "There was no initial word on what the third judge on the panel said in dissenting.",
      "Abbott slams judge's \"erroneous\" decision",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Abbott slammed the judges' decision, calling it \"clearly erroneous\" and saying it \"undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict. The State of Texas will swiftly appeal to the United States Supreme Court.\"",
      "The state filed its appeal to the highest court late Tuesday afternoon.",
      "CBS News Texas spoke with Democratic members of Congress from North Texas who praised the ruling.",
      "\"I totally agree with the court,\" said Rep. Julie Johnson, D-Farmers Branch. \"You know, what the Republicans and Greg Abbott did in Texas, to seeking to disenfranchise voters of color was egregious, and the court clearly agreed with that. This opinion is sharp, and it is clear, and it is concise.\"",
      "Veasey, whose district covers Fort Worth, said, \"I feel like we're on good legal grounds here. So, I feel confident, but, you know, I'm going to be again cautiously optimistic in watching what the Supreme Court says.\"",
      "\"I've always made it clear that this was racial, and I know that some people want to run away from the race element, but the law protects it. We know that our Constitution recognizes and protects it,\" said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Dallas.",
      "Texas Republicans criticize judges' decision",
      "CBS News Texas also spoke with Republicans Tuesday night who called the judges' decision wrong and said they are putting their faith in the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Aaron Reitz, a GOP candidate for Texas attorney general, said, \"My view is similar to Gov. Abbott's and Attorney General Paxton, who have criticized the decision because, in fact, race was not used to draw these lines. Only politics was used, which is the appropriate standard.\"",
      "Another candidate for attorney general, State Senator Mayes Middleton, R-Galveston, said it was a partisan map.",
      "\"Quite simply, this is a partisan map that draws more Republican seats and that's why we're going to win,\" said Middleton. \"That is why we're going to be victorious in this appeal before the Supreme Court.\"",
      "As a result of the ruling, Rep. Johnson and Rep. Veasey said they will run for re-election in the districts they represent now.",
      "Crockett she said she still hasn't decided whether to run for re-election in her district in Dallas or if she is going to run statewide for U.S. Senate. She said she is waiting for polling to come back and that she hopes to make a decision by Thanksgiving.",
      "The key, Crockett said, is if the polling shows she can beat a Republican candidate in the general election next November.",
      "\"At the end of the day, if the numbers are strong that I am our best shot, then it's bigger than my district, it's bigger than the state of Texas,\" said Crockett. \"This is about the country because we know if we can change the Senate map in this country, then that's where we start to get wins.\"",
      "Crockett said the only way she or another Democrat can win is if they attract new voters, people who haven't gone to the polls before, and not simply by attracting Republicans who cross the political aisle.",

    "summary": "Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees without input from relevant agency staffers.",
    "story": [
      "A page of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website was changed to include a false claim about autism and vaccines. Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees inside the Department of Health and Human Services without input from relevant agency staffers.",
      "The page about vaccines and autism formerly said that \"no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and Autism spectrum disorder.\" The website has now been changed to say, \"'Vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim\" \u2014 a statement the Autism Science Foundation calls \"misinformation\" that \"actually contradicts the best available science.\" The CDC page also falsely claims that studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have \"been ignored by health authorities.\"",
      "Previously, changes have only occurred in consultation with subject matter experts at the agency's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and its National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The CDC sources told CBS News political appointees at HHS devised the change and instructed an employee inside the office of acting CDC Director Jim O'Neil to make it.",
      "Autism is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. It presents with a wide range of symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills. The National Institutes of Health has committed hundreds of millions of dollars a year to studying the condition and trying to understand how and why it develops.",
      "The debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism has its roots in a 1998 study that was\u00a0found to be fraudulent\u00a0and has been retracted. Since then, \"independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people,\" said American Academy of Pediatrics president Susan Kressly in a statement decrying the website change.",
      "\"We are at a very dangerous moment for the health of America's children,\" said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a news briefing on Thursday.",
      "Research has found no evidence of increased rates of autism among those who are vaccinated compared to those who are not. Vaccines also undergo intensive safety testing. Research shows that genetics play a role in autism diagnoses. The NIH says some possible risk factors for autism include prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or low birth weight, certain maternal health conditions, or parents conceiving at an older age.",
      "\"There is overwhelming evidence that vaccines do not cause autism,\" said Dr. Mandy Cohen, a former CDC director. \"This change to CDC language undermines the agency's scientific integrity, damaging its credibility on vaccines and other health recommendations. Most concerning, it risks endangering children by driving down vaccination rates and leaving kids vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.\"",
      "In a statement, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said, \"This is a common-sense update that brings CDC's website in line with our commitment to transparency and gold standard science.",
      "\"As the updated page explains, the claim that 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not supported by comprehensive evidence, as studies to date have not definitively ruled out potential associations. Some research suggesting possible biologic mechanisms has been ignored or dismissed by public health agencies, and HHS is committed to finding a definitive answer,\" Nixon said.",
      "Leading autism advocacy groups dispute that.",
      "The Autism Science Foundation\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0it was \"appalled\" by the change to the CDC's website, and highlighted the decades of research into the topic. Alison Singer, the co-founder and president of the ASF, said that while researchers \"can't do a scientific study to show that something does not cause something else,\" there are a \"mountain of studies that we have exonerating vaccines as a cause of autism.\"",
      "\"I think the question of whether vaccines causes autism is one that science can answer, and science has answered it,\" Singer said in Thursday's news briefing.",
      "A subhead saying that \"Vaccines do not cause autism\" remains on the CDC website with an asterisk next to it. The bottom of the page explains that the header remains in place because of an agreement with Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who is the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and backed HHS\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0during his confirmation hearings. Cassidy said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he supported Kennedy in part because of \"serious commitments\" from the Trump administration, but did not specify what those were.",
      "\"I'm a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Cassidy wrote on social media on Thursday afternoon. \"What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.\"",
      "Cassidy highlighted recent outbreaks of whooping cough and measles. He also called for more research into \"the real causes of autism,\" and criticized\u00a0HHS funding\u00a0cuts.",
      "\"Redirecting attention to factors we definitely know DO NOT cause autism denies families the answers they deserve,\" Cassidy wrote.",
      "Other health agency pages with information about autism and vaccines had not been changed as of early Thursday afternoon.",
      "Kennedy has previously pushed the\u00a0discredited claim\u00a0that routine\u00a0childhood shots\u00a0cause autism. President Trump has also falsely suggested vaccines could be to blame for autism rates. Both expressed concern about rising rates of\u00a0autism diagnoses, which appear to be driven by a variety of factors including\u00a0increased awareness\u00a0and changes in how the condition is diagnosed.",
      "O'Leary said he feared the website changes would \"scare parents and further stigmatize\" people with autism.",
      "\"We have been dealing with these falsehoods for many years. They are not new. We have been promoting the science, and we're going to continue to do that, as are the other professional societies,\" he said. \"The problem is now it's coming from, these falsehoods are coming for our federal government.\"",
      "Experts have previously raised concerns about Kennedy reviving debunked theories about the cause of autism. In April, Kennedy announced the CDC would conduct a \"massive testing and research effort\" to find out what causes the disorder, and hired David Geier, a man who repeatedly claimed a link between vaccines and autism, to lead the effort. Kennedy said the work would be completed by September, though other health officials later pushed the timeline.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers, an infectious disease physician and former CDC official, said that the website change showed scientists \"who in the past carefully vetted scientific information have been pushed aside.\"",
      "The \"CDC should be a data-driven agency based on science and not ideology, but when you take the scientists out of the process you get rhetoric that can harm families,\" said former CDC chief science and medical officer Dr. Debra Houry, who lresigned from the agency earlier this year.",

      "\"But this isn't about any one of us,\" the statement said. \"This isn't about politics. This is about who we are as Americans. Every American must unite and condemn the President's calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity.\"",
      "Slotkin posted a\u00a0video response, saying, \"I would hope that people of all backgrounds \u2014 Democrat, Republican, Independent \u2014 would agree that threatening death for people you disagree with is beyond the pale of who we are as Americans.\"",
      "\"I refuse to be intimidated out of defending the country I love,\" she said.",
      "Houlahan said\u00a0in an interview, \"This is the president of the United States calling for the death of a member of Congress, six members of Congress, and that is a different brand of political violence and political retribution.\"",
      "Schumer told reporters at the Capitol that he asked for special Capitol Police protection for Senators Slotkin and Kelly.",
      "He said \"every American, regardless of party,\" should condemn the president's words \"immediately and without qualification,\" adding, \"if we don't draw a line here, there is no line left to draw.\"",
      "\"He must be condemned forcefully, loudly and without excuses, before someone takes his words as permission to do the unthinkable,\" Schumer said. \"Anything less enables the flames of hatred to grow and spread.\"",
      "Democratic leaders in the House likewise condemned what they called the \"disgusting and dangerous death threats against Members of Congress,\" calling on Republicans to do the same. The Democrats said they have been in contact with the House Sergeant at Arms and the United States Capitol Police to \"ensure the safety of these Members and their families.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said in a joint statement.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson initially declined to criticize the president's remarks, telling reporters it's \"wildly inappropriate\" for lawmakers to encourage members of the military to disobey orders.",
      "\"We have got to raise the bar in Congress, this is out of control,\" said Johnson, a Louisiana Republican.",
      "Johnson said the president was \"defining the crime of sedition\" with his comments.",
      "But he was asked again later in the day about Mr. Trump's comments and replied that \"the words that the president chose are not the ones that I would use, okay?\"",
      "\"Obviously, I don't think that these are crimes punishable by death or any of that,\" Johnson continued, and he said of Mr. Trump, \"Sometimes he uses heated rhetoric.\" Referring to the Democratic lawmakers in the video, he said, \"Do any of you agree that that's appropriate, that they should be telling young members of the military to defy orders?\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, too, was asked whether the president wants to execute members of Congress.",
      "\"No,\" Leavitt said. \"Let's be clear about what the president is responding to, because many in this room want to talk about the president's response, but not what brought the president to responding in this way. You have sitting members of the United States Congress who conspired together to orchestrate a video message to members of the United States military, to active-duty servicemembers, to members of the national security apparatus, encouraging them to defy the president's lawful orders. The sanctity of our military rests on the chain of command.\"",

    "story": [
      "Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.",
      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is proposing new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, as President Trump seeks to expand U.S. oil production.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration announced new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades on Thursday, as President Trump seeks to expand U.S. oil production, advancing a project that critics say could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.",
      "The oil industry has been seeking access to new offshore areas, including off Southern California and Florida, as a way to boost U.S. energy security and jobs. The federal government has not allowed drilling in federal waters in the eastern Gulf, which includes offshore Florida and part of offshore Alabama, since 1995, because of concerns about oil spills. California has some offshore oil rigs, but there has been no new leasing in federal waters since the mid-1980s.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is eyeing a 2028 presidential run and has emerged as a leading Trump critic, called the plan \"idiotic\" and \"reckless\" in a statement. The proposal is also likely to draw bipartisan opposition in Florida. Tourism and access to clean beaches are key parts of the economy in both states.",
      "The administration's plan proposes six offshore lease sales off the coast of California.",
      "It also calls for new drilling off the coast of Florida in areas at least 100 miles from that state's shore. The area targeted for leasing is adjacent to an area in the Central Gulf that already contains thousands of wells and hundreds of drilling platforms.",
      "The five-year plan also would compel more than 20 lease sales off the coast of Alaska, including a newly designated area known as the High Arctic, more than 200 miles offshore in the Arctic Ocean.",
      "CBS News reported earlier this month that the Trump administration was planning to hold offshore drilling auctions in several areas, including off the coasts of California, New England and the Carolinas. Plans viewed by CBS News called for lease sales off California as soon as 2027, and off Alaska as soon as next year.",
      "The energy industry has encouraged the Trump administration to expand offshore drilling. All offshore areas \"with the potential to generate jobs, new revenue and additional production to advance America's energy dominance should be considered for inclusion,\" the American Petroleum Institute and other groups said in a joint letter to the administration in June.",
      "Some Florida politicians have pushed back on offshore drilling plans. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican and Trump ally, helped persuade Trump administration officials to drop a similar offshore plan in 2018 when he was governor. Earlier this month, Scott and fellow Florida Republican Sen. Ashley Moody co-sponsored a bill to maintain a moratorium on offshore drilling in the state, which Mr. Trump signed in his first term.",
      "\"As Floridians, we know how vital our beautiful beaches and coastal waters are to our state's economy, environment and way of life,\" Scott said in a Nov. 3\u00a0statement\u00a0announcing the bill. \"I will always work to keep Florida's shores pristine and protect our natural treasures for generations to come.\"",
      "Newsom said in a statement Thursday: \"Trump's idiotic plan endangers our coastal economy and communities and hurts the well-being of Californians. This reckless attempt to sell out our coastline to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water.\"",
      "California has been a leader in restricting offshore oil drilling since the infamous 1969 Santa Barbara spill that helped spark the modern environmental movement. While there have been no new federal leases offered since the mid-1980s, drilling from existing platforms continues.",
      "Newsom expressed support for greater offshore controls after a 2021 spill off Huntington Beach and has backed a congressional effort to ban new offshore drilling on the West Coast.",
      "\"For decades, California has stood firm in our opposition to new offshore drilling, and nothing will change that,\" the governor said in his statement Thursday.",
      "A Texas-based company, with support from the Trump administration, is seeking to restart production in waters off Santa Barbara, California, damaged by a 2015 oil spill. The administration has hailed the plan by Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp. as the kind of project Mr. Trump wants to increase U.S. energy production as the federal government removes regulatory barriers.",
      "Since taking office for a second time in January, Mr. Trump has reversed former President Joe Biden's focus on climate change to pursue what he calls U.S. \"energy dominance\" in the global market. The president created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term reversing Biden's ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. A federal court later struck down Biden's order to withdraw 625 million acres of federal waters from oil development.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and canceled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.",
      "Democratic lawmakers, including California Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff and Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, warned that opening vast coastlines to new offshore drilling \"would devastate coastal economies, jeopardize our national security, ravage coastal ecosystems, and put millions of Americans' health and safety at risk.''",
      "Oil spills \"not only cause irreparable environmental damage, but also suppress the value of coastal homes, harm tourism economies and weaken coastal infrastructure,'' the lawmakers said in a letter signed by dozens of Democrats. One disastrous oil spill can cost taxpayers billions in lost revenue, cleanup costs and ecosystem restoration, they said.",
      "The League of Conservation Voters called Thursday's plan \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"This needless, reckless expansion of offshore drilling would jeopardize our coastal communities, public health, local economies, and the environment, while prolonging our dependence on fossil fuels and doing nothing to lower costs,\" America Fitzpatrick, the group's conservation program director, said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has received a draft plan aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, his office confirmed Thursday.",
      "It said in a statement that he had \"officially received a draft plan from the American side, which, according to the American side, could activate diplomacy.\" The statement went on to say \"it was agreed to work on the points of the plan in such a way as to bring the war to a dignified end.\"",
      "A senior White House official confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that President Trump was backing a 28-point plan drafted by envoy Steve Witkoff and an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war Russia started nearly four years ago with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it's not clear whether this plan is the one that Zelenskyy received.",
      "The plan, according to reports by Axios, the Financial Times and the New York Times, calls for Ukraine to abandon territory, give up some weapons and shrink its army, and while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the war must end, he reiterated that from Kyiv's perspective, \"there can be no reward for waging war.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's endorsement of the plan was first reported by NBC.",
      "Previously, Ukraine has agreed with the U.S. to a freezing of the battle lines where they stand as a starting point for negotiations, while also making clear that it needs security guarantees from Washington and its Western partners.",
      "Axios, citing a U.S. official, reported Monday that Witkoff was drafting a 28-point peace plan and had \"discussed it extensively\" with Kirill Dmitriev, an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Dmitriev said in an interview with Axios that he met with Witkoff and other Trump officials for three days in Miami in late October. He expressed optimism about the proposal, saying, \"We feel the Russian position is really being heard.\"",
      "Just days after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas in October, Dmitriev traveled to the U.S. to hold previously scheduled talks with Witkoff in an effort to continue to make progress on a proposal to end the war, as a senior U.S. official described it at the time.",
      "Dmitriev is under U.S. sanctions, which had to be waived for him to travel to Florida to meet with Witkoff.",
      "The White House official who spoke with CBS News on Thursday said Witkoff had been working on a proposal quietly for about a month, and said that he consulted with both the Russians and Ukrainians to take their feedback into account. The extent of those consultations with Ukraine was not clear from Kyiv's statement Thursday, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the same day that Witkoff and Rubio \"met with some of the Ukrainians just in the past week to discuss this very plan.\"",
      "Senior Ukrainian official Rustem Umerov was verbally briefed in Miami this week by Witkoff, a source familiar with the conversation told CBS News.",
      "Top European Union official Kaja Kallas, when asked Thursday if Europeans were involved in the process, responded, \"Not that I know of.\" She also reiterated a point that's consistently been made by Ukraine and its supporters that \"for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.\"",
      "Witkoff and Dmitriev have been talking for weeks about a proposal to end the war, gaming out ideas even as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury chief Scott Bessent criticized Russia, saying Moscow was not serious about ending the war.",
      "\"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X Wednesday. \"And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told CBS News Wednesday that he didn't have any announcements to share about a peace plan, but said it was an issue \"the president has continued to put at the forefront of our foreign policy goal.\"",
      "The recent U.S. sanctions appear to be taking a toll on Russia \u2014 a Treasury Department analysis Thursday indicates that the oil sanctions have sent prices there tumbling, choking off a key revenue source that Russia has used to fund its war in Ukraine. The U.S. gas sanctions against Russia go into effect Friday.",
      "Amid the U.S. diplomatic efforts \u2014 which include a visit to Kyiv this week by a delegation led by the U.S. Army secretary \u2014 Russian missiles have continued to pummel Ukraine.",
      "Rescuers were still searching on Thursday for victims of a devastating Russian strike on an apartment building in the western city of Ternopil that killed at least 26 people, including three children, according to Ukrainian authorities.",
      "Shrieking Russian missiles slammed into the building on Wednesday, burning at least 19 people to death in the apartments.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Trump's months-long deployment of thousands of National Guard forces to the streets of Washington, D.C., violates federal law.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who sued the federal government over the Guard deployment, arguing it exceeded the president's legal authority. But the judge stayed her ruling for 21 days to give the Trump administration a chance to appeal it.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson blasted the ruling, arguing that Mr. Trump has the authority to deploy Guard troops in the nation's capital. Jackson called Schwalb's lawsuit \"nothing more than another attempt \u2014 at the detriment of DC residents \u2014 to undermine the President's highly successful operations to stop violent crime in DC.\"",
      "In his own statement following the ruling, Schwalb said, \"Normalizing the use of military troops for domestic law enforcement sets a dangerous precedent, where the President can disregard states' independence and deploy troops wherever and whenever he wants \u2013 with no check on his military power. This unprecedented federal overreach is not normal, or legal. It is long past time to let the National Guard go home \u2013 to their everyday lives, their regular jobs, their families, and their children.\"",
      "Mr. Trump first ordered National Guard forces to D.C. in August, part of a broader crackdown on crime using a combination of Guard troops, federal law enforcement agents and local D.C. police who were briefly taken over by the federal government.",
      "Since then, Guard forces have been a common sight on the streets of the capital, especially in tourist-heavy areas, drawing pushback from some local officials. The deployment has been extended multiple times, and is currently set to run until at least February 2026.",
      "The president deployed the D.C. National Guard using his authority as commander in chief of the district's Guard forces \u2014 a unique arrangement as state-level Guard forces are usually controlled by governors. Several GOP-led states have also sent their own Guard troops to the city.",
      "In Thursday's ruling, Cobb said the president lacked the power to deploy the D.C. Guard for \"non-military, crime-deterrence missions in the absence of a request from the city's civil authorities.\" She said that, even though the president is the force's commander in chief, he doesn't have unlimited power to deploy the Guard as he sees fit.",
      "The federal government has argued the deployment is justified by a clause in D.C. local law that says the Guard's commanding general \"may order out any portion of the National Guard for such drills, inspections, parades, escort, or other duties\" \u2014 with the current deployment falling under the category of \"other duties.\" Cobb disputed that interpretation, writing that \"other duties\" appears to only cover military exercises.",
      "The Trump administration has also pointed to a local law that says the Guard can \"aid the civil authorities in the execution of the laws.\" But Cobb said that doesn't allow the government to \"unilaterally call upon the DCNG to assist the District with crime control,\" without a request from local officials.",
      "Separately, Cobb said federal law \"cannot support the out-of-state National Guards' operations in the District because there is no state-law basis for those Guards to travel to the District.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has dispatched National Guard forces to several other cities in recent months, often to protect federal agents and property during immigration crackdowns \u2014 drawing local pushback and mixed results in court.",
      "Members of the California National Guard were deployed to Los Angeles over the summer, despite opposition from Gov. Gavin Newsom. And hundreds of out-of-state National Guard forces were later sent to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, though many of those troops are set to return home, a Defense Department official confirmed to CBS News last weekend.",
      "The Trump administration has argued the deployments were justified because of tense protests against immigration agents, pointing to Title 10, a law that allows the Guard to be used when \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.\" Local officials have said the deployments are unnecessary and inappropriate, arguing that local police can handle the protests themselves.",
      "A panel of appeals court judges allowed Mr. Trump's Los Angeles deployment to go forward over the summer, following a lawsuit from Newsom, but a judge later found the troops had illegally engaged in civilian law enforcement. In Chicago and Portland, judges blocked\u00a0Guard forces from being deployed onto the streets, leaving them in a holding pattern for weeks.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he will designate Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally, marking a step up in defense ties between the United States and the Gulf monarchy.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the move at a black-tie dinner at the White House in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders signed a new strategic defense deal earlier in the day, and Mr. Trump said Monday the U.S. will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The designation could open the door to further collaboration between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. military, including easier access to U.S.-made military equipment. It's also a symbolic move: Mr. Trump said in brief remarks Tuesday evening that it would take \"our military cooperation to even greater heights.\"",
      "There are currently 20 major non-NATO allies, including other Middle Eastern countries like Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.",
      "\"A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries, and it will serve the highest interests of peace,\" Mr. Trump said during Tuesday's dinner.",
      "The U.S.'s close relationship with Saudi Arabia dates back eight decades, bookended by a meeting between King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud and former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser in 1945. The two countries have long cooperated on defense, and in recent decades, they have been bound together in part by a mutual rivalry with Iran.",
      "During Tuesday's meetings \u2014 marked by elaborate White House ceremonies and a military flyover \u2014 Mr. Trump pressed for even further military and economic cooperation with the Gulf state. The White House said\u00a0Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will buy hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and will partner with the U.S. on artificial intelligence and civil nuclear issues, while bin Salman pledged to invest nearly $1 trillion in the U.S., up from $600 billion.",
      "Members of Mr. Trump's family also have some business interests in the country. Mr. Trump insisted earlier Tuesday he has \"nothing to do\" with those deals, and \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "Still unclear is whether Saudi Arabia will sign onto the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic deals brokered by Mr. Trump between Israel and majority-Muslim states like the United Arab Emirates. Most of those agreements were inked during the president's first term, and Mr. Trump told \"60 Minutes\" he believes Saudi Arabia will also join.",
      "During an Oval Office event earlier Tuesday, bin Salman told reporters he wants to join the accords but needs to see a path toward a Palestinian state. Mr. Trump added that the two leaders \"had a very good talk on the Abraham Accords.\"",
      "But Saudi Arabia's human rights record makes it a controversial U.S. partner. American intelligence agencies concluded in 2021 that bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who regularly criticized the country's regime in the pages of The Washington Post.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday he believes bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing, and called Khashoggi \"extremely controversial.\" Bin Salman said it was \"really painful to hear\" about the killing.",

      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\"That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",

    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/moss-study-space-reproduce-earth/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:56:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",
      "In addition to surviving the 9-month period, the spores could still germinate after the experiment ended and scientists returned them back down to Earth, according to the study.",

    "story": [
      "NASA released close-up images on Wednesday of the rare interstellar comet that's making a single pass through the solar system.",
      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\"That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",

    "story": [
      "A woman has pleaded guilty to falsely reporting that her astronaut ex-wife committed a crime while deployed to the International Space Station.",
      "Summer Heather Worden, 50, told law enforcement in July 2019 that her former spouse had illegally accessed her bank account earlier that year while she was in space, according to a news release from the Department of Justice. Her wife, previously identified as astronaut\u00a0Anne McClain, was at the ISS from December 2018 to June 2019. It was the first allegation of a crime being committed in space.",
      "An investigation by NASA's Office of the Inspector General found that Worden had opened the bank account in April 2018 and that both she and McClain had access to it until January 2019, the Justice Department said. The investigation also found that Worden had regularly given McClain access to her bank records, including login credentials, from at least 2015, the news release said.",
      "McClain said in 2019 that she had accessed the bank account with Worden's permission, The New York Times reported. Worden, a former Air Force intelligence officer, disputed that claim and filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. A complaint filed to NASA's Office of Inspector General by Worden's family accused McClain of identity theft and improper access.",
      "McClain denied the allegations\u00a0on social media\u00a0and said that she and Worden had \"been going through a painful, personal separation that's now unfortunately in the media.\"",
      "Worden pleaded guilty to one count of lying to law enforcement on Nov. 13. She will be sentenced in February 2026. Worden faces up to 5 years in federal prison, as well as a maximum possible fine of $250,000, and remains on bond pending the hearing.",
      "McClain returned to the International Space Station in 2025. She participated in a spacewalk during the mission, years after she was set to take part in NASA's first all-female spacewalk, which was delayed at the last minute because there were not enough suits available after she requested a size adjustment.

    "summary": "The Sentinel-6B is the second of two satellites in a $1 billion program to monitor sea levels over a full decade.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched a joint NASA-European environmental research satellite early Monday, the second in an ongoing billion-dollar project to measure long-term changes in sea level, a key indicator of climate change.",
      "The first satellite, known as Sentinel-6 and named in honor of NASA climate researcher Michael Freilich, was launched in November 2020. The latest spacecraft, Sentinel-6B, was launched from California atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 12:21 a.m. EST.",
      "Both satellites are equipped with a sophisticated cloud-penetrating radar. By timing how long it takes beams to bounce back from the ocean 830 miles below, the Sentinel-6 satellites can track sea levels to an accuracy of about one inch while also measuring wave height and wind speeds.",
      "The project builds on earlier missions dating back to the early 1990s that have provided an uninterrupted stream of sea level data.",
      "That data indicates sea levels are slowly but surely rising, widely interpreted as evidence of global warming caused in large part by human industrial activity.",
      "But in keeping with recent Trump administration policies aimed at scaling back climate research and the interpretation of such data, NASA did not directly refer to \"climate change\" or \"global warming\" in a Sentinel-6B pre-launch briefing Saturday.",
      "In the press kit released by NASA for the first Sentinel 6 mission in 2020, the first item in a \"need to know list\" said the satellite would \"provide information that will help researchers understand how climate change is reshaping Earth's coastlines \u2014 and how fast this is happening.\"",
      "In the press kit for the Sentinel 6B mission launched Monday, NASA's first \"need to know\" item said simply that \"Sentinel-6B will contribute to a multi-decade dataset that is ... key to helping improve public safety, city planning and protecting commercial and defense interests.\"",
      "Karen St. Germain, director of NASA's Earth Science Division, did not directly mention climate change in the Saturday briefing, focusing instead on the practical importance of monitoring sea levels.",
      "\"Sentinel 6B is the latest in a line of missions stretching over three decades, keeping an uninterrupted watch over our planet's sea surface height, finding patterns and advancing our understanding of planet Earth,\" she said.",
      "She said the data provided by the Sentinel-6 satellites \"underpins navigation, search and rescue and industries like commercial fishing and shipping. These measurements form the basis for U.S. flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage sites and other assets along our shoreline.\"",
      "The data, she continued, will help scientists \"understand and predict coastal erosion and salt water encroachment into inland supplies of water that are used for agriculture, irrigation as well as municipal drinking water.\"",
      "Regardless of interpretation, the launch of Sentinel-6B went off without a hitch.",
      "After blasting off from launch complex 4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage powered the vehicle out of the dense lower atmosphere, separated and flew itself back to a landing pad at the California launch site.",
      "The upper stage then carried out two firings of its single engine before releasing the 2,600-pound Sentinel-6B into an 830-mile-high orbit tilted 66 degrees to the equator, the same orbit used by Sentinel-6A and earlier sea level-monitoring spacecraft.",
      "Taking 112 minutes to complete one orbit, the solar-powered satellite will fly over locations between 66 degrees north and south latitude, covering 90 percent of the world's oceans.",
      "Along with measuring sea levels, the new satellite will monitor temperature and humidity in the lower atmosphere as well as the higher-altitude stratosphere using an instrument that measures atmospheric effects on signals broadcast by navigation satellites.",
      "But the primary mission is monitoring Earth's changing sea levels.",
      "\"The dynamic balance that persisted before the industrial revolution has been upset by the almost instantaneous combustion of huge reserves of carbon as our society has developed,\" Craig Donlon, a European Space Agency project scientist, said before the first Sentinel-6 launch in 2020.",
      "\"We see evidence of this dramatic change in many different measurements ... but they all point the same direction: the Earth is warming. And the greatest indicator of this Earth system imbalance is sea level rise.\"",
      "The Sentinel-6 satellites are the result of a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "St. Germain said NASA's share of the cost for both Sentinel-6 satellites came to about $500 million. The Europeans contributed a similar amount.",

      "Nvidia's third-quarter financial results on Wednesday surpassed analyst expectations, signaling that demand for its artificial intelligence chips remains robust amid investor concerns about an AI bubble.",
      "The chipmaker reported earnings of $31.9 billion on record revenue of $57 billion for the third quarter. Revenue for the period surged 22% from the previous quarter and 62% from a year ago. Its earnings per share were $1.30. The Santa Clara, Calif., company had been expected to earn $1.26 per share on revenue of $54.9 billion for the quarter, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "\"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday, referring to the company's proprietary superchips that power large language models.",
      "\"Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference \u2014 each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast \u2014 with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once,\" Huang added.",
      "Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The company's shares, which have jumped 39% this year, rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading to $193.80.",
      "\"This is a huge print and guidance from Nvidia that should reignite the bullish tech trade into year-end,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, adding that he thinks \"fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated.",
      "In October, the chipmaker became the first publicly listed company worth $5 trillion, with its shares buoyed by Wall Street expectations of surging demand.",
      "Rational exuberance?",
      "In recent weeks, some investors have expressed caution about the hype surrounding AI and whether the soaring market value of companies linked to the technology is warranted. Despite the promise of AI, most companies that are implementing AI have yet to see a measurable increase in productivity or profits, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Nvidia earnings are such an important event both because of the weighting that the stock has in the major equity indices and because it is ground zero for the entire Artificial Intelligence build out,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "The rapid construction of data centers across the U.S. has boosted demand for Nvidia's chips. Data center investment, which includes spending on AI research and development, has become the largest contributor to U.S. growth this year, according to S&P Global.",
      "The S&P 500's 15% gain this year has been driven largely by big tech companies with AI investments. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 accounts for 37% of the index's total value,\u00a0according\u00a0to Morningstar.",
      "\"Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure build out was a bubble, and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was, Zaccarelli said. \"But in the meantime, the largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable, and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real.\"",
      "China hurdle",
      "Nvidia reported robust demand for its chips despite being blocked from the vital Chinese market because of U.S. export restrictions as the two nations compete on AI.",
      "In an earnings call with analysts, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Collete Kress on Wednesday said the company is \"disappointed\" it can't ship products to China.",

      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",

The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",

    "summary": "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Kennedy Center president Ric Grenell are clashing over the Kennedy Center's spending and operations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Kennedy Center president Ric Grenell and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island are clashing over the center's spending and operations records, after Trump allies were appointed to key roles at the Kennedy Center earlier this year, and President Trump was elected chairman of the board.",
      "In a letter to Grenell, Whitehouse said that under Grenell's stewardship, \"The Center is being looted to the tune of millions of dollars in foregone revenue, cancelled programming, unpaid use of its facilities, and wasteful spending on luxury restaurants and hotels.\" He called it \"an unprecedented pattern of self-dealing, favoritism, and waste.\"",
      "At one point, Whitehouse alleged that the Kennedy Center had let FIFA use the space for free, waiving its rental fee. On Friday, the center told the\u00a0Associated Press that it would actually receive $7.4 million in connection with the FIFA event.",
      "Grenell posted a long letter on X that responded to Whitehouse's accusations, point by point: \".@SenWhitehouse just stepped in it,\" Grenell wrote. \"He attacked the Kennedy Center with outrageous claims. So we responded with the facts.\"",
      "Grenell said when he arrived at the Kennedy Center, it was \"paying a bloated staff with our future debt reserves account,\" but \"today, and for the first time in decades, we have a balanced budget at the Kennedy Center.\"",
      "Grenell also denied the center has \"cancelled shows,\" but instead said that he has \"installed a break-even policy for programming\" and rentals. Grenell said that if ticket sales won't cover a program, it won't be confirmed unless the cost shortfall is covered by a sponsor or donor.",
      "Whitehouse, citing records his committee staff obtained about the center, accused the former acting director of national intelligence of using the center as a \"playground for the president of the United States and his allies\" and requested a slew of records from Grenell regarding the Kennedy Center's financial management.",
      "Whitehouse is the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has oversight responsibility for the Kennedy Center and authorizes its federal funding. Since Democrats are in the minority in the Senate, Whitehouse is only able to request information from Grenell. Only Republicans have subpoena power. It remains to be seen whether Grenell will provide any more information to Whitehouse, beyond his social media post.",
      "He asked for material on the Kennedy Center's financial management and ethics, a description of the process for selecting contractors and consultants, reimbursement policies, and information about audit protocols.",
      "Rental fee for FIFA?",
      "Whitehouse, in his letter, accused the Kennedy Center of offering FIFA \"free and exclusive use of the Kennedy Center.\"",
      "The Washington Post previously reported the center in August had waived a rental fee in the range of $5 million for FIFA, which will be using the Kennedy Center from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12 to host its 2026 World Cup draw. The Post noted that it wouldn't be the first time that a venue waived a rental fee for the draw, but it would be unusual for the Kennedy Center, since it usually has a crowded schedule at that time of year.",
      "Grenell said that FIFA \"has given us several million dollars, in addition to paying all of the expenses for this event in lieu of a rental fee.\"",
      "On Friday, the Kennedy Center told the Associated Press that it would be paid $7.4 million to host the FIFA draw, including a $2.4 million donation from the World Cup organizer and another $5 million in sponsorship opportunities.",
      "Contracts offered \"for your personal friends?\"",
      "Whitehouse also accused Grenell of offering \"contracts for your personal friends,\" and asked him for information about expenditures or contracts that have benefited people personally associated with Mr. Trump or with Kennedy Center leadership. He also asked Grenell to provide a justification for each contract.",
      "Grenell mentioned three people in his response, though he did not specifically say that he was responding to this question: Jeff Halperin, who was hired for multimedia work and whose work Grenell praised; a fundraiser named Lisa Dale, credited by Grenell with raising over $117 million; and an editor, researcher and writer who was a colleague of Grenell's when he was the ambassador to Germany in Mr. Trump's first administration. Grenell did not name the former colleague, but he said that the cost of his work curating an exhibit was completely covered by a donor.",
      "$10,000 spent on food and beverage for personal use?",
      "Whitehouse also accused Grenell of spending more than $10,000 over several months on \"private lunches, dinners and alcohol purchases unrelated to fundraising or development purposes,\" including on \"champagne service.\"",
      "Grenell said that all of the food and beverage costs Whitehouse cited were \"for donor-based events.\" He said fundraising expenses last year were much higher \u2014 $9.3 million.",
      "$27,000 for Watergate Hotel stays for new hires, associates?",
      "Whitehouse also said Grenell charged the center over $27,000 between April and July for \"new hires and your associates\" at the Watergate Hotel.",
      "Grenell, replied that it's \"customary\" for new employees to stay at the Watergate Hotel, which is next door to the Kennedy Center, and he countered that Watergate Hotel expenses for 2024 were much higher, totaling $878,000.",
      "The Kennedy Center receives government funding in addition to private funding. Federal funding goes to operations, security, maintenance and capital repairs. It received over $40 million in federal funds last year.",
      "The Trump administration became involved in the center's leadership earlier this year, and multiple Trump allies, including Grenell, were appointed to its board by Mr. Trump.",
      "Next month, Mr. Trump will host the Kennedy Center Honors \u2014 which recognize performing art professionals for their lifetime achievements \u2014 airing on CBS.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 20:09:23 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump and NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani have hurled attacks at each other for months \u2014 but on Friday, they seemed to hit it off.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's meeting with incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Friday was not expected to be warm and congenial. The two politicians agree on very little, and they've lobbed attacks at each other for months, with Mr. Trump calling Mamdani a \"100% communist lunatic\" and Mamdani describing himself as \"Donald Trump's worst nightmare.\"",
      "But instead, the two men seemed to hit it off. In a surreal 30-minute Oval Office appearance, Mr. Trump lavished Mamdani with praise, calling him \"very rational\" and predicting he could do \"really great\" things for their shared hometown. Mamdani, standing beside Mr. Trump, steered clear of criticizing the president \u2014 sometimes with an assist from Mr. Trump himself \u2014 and pledged to work with the administration on cost-of-living issues.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor\"",
      "Mr. Trump was unceasingly optimistic about Mamdani, saying that during a private one-on-one meeting before their public appearance, the two men agreed on more than he expected. He pointed to Mamdani's focus on affordability and stated desire to build more housing.",
      "\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\" the president said. \"The better he does, the happier I am.\"",
      "\"I think he is going to surprise some conservative people\"",
      "Days before the election, Mr. Trump had encouraged people to vote for Mamdani's chief rival, Democratic governor-turned-independent Andrew Cuomo.",
      "But on Friday, the president said: \"I feel very confident that he can do a very good job\u2026I think he is going to surprise some conservative people, actually. And some very liberal people, he won't surprise them because they already like him.\"",
      "\"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him\"",
      "For months, Mr. Trump has flirted with cutting off federal financial support to New York City if Mamdani wins, suggesting it would be a waste.",
      "After their meeting, Mr. Trump didn't fully back away from the threat, but said it was unlikely.",
      "\"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,\" Mr. Trump said. \"A big help. Because I want New York City to be great. Look, I love New York City, it's where I come from, I spent a lot of years there. ... I think this mayor could do some things that are going to be really great.\"",
      "Does Mamdani think Trump is a fascist? \"That's okay, you can just say yes,\" president says",
      "At various points, reporters pressed Mamdani on whether he stands by his prior attacks on Mr. Trump \u2014\u00a0 and the president helped him dodge.",
      "One reporter asked Mamdani if he believes Mr. Trump is a \"fascist.\" As the incoming mayor began to answer, the president laughed and cut him off.",
      "\"That's okay, you can just say yes,\" Mr. Trump interjected, patting Mamdani on the arm. \"That's easier. It's easier than explaining it. I don't mind.\"",
      "Earlier in the meeting, Mamdani was asked if he still believes Mr. Trump is a \"despot.\"",
      "Said Mr. Trump: \"I've been called much worse than a despot, so it's not that insulting. I think he'll change his mind after we get to working together.\"",
      "\"He's got views that [are] a little out there, but who knows\"",
      "The president also deflected when asked about his claim that Mamdani is a \"communist.\"",
      "Said Mr. Trump: \"He's got views that [are] a little out there, but who knows. I mean, we're going to see what works.\"",
      "\"He's going to change, also. We all change. I changed a lot,\" the president continued.",
      "Mamdani describes himself as a democratic socialist, not a communist. He stood by that label on Friday.",
      "Trump: Mamdani isn't a \"jihadist,\" he's \"very rational\"",
      "Earlier this month, GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik \u2014 a candidate for governor of New York \u2014 called Mamdani an \"Antisemite Jihadist Communist.\"",
      "Asked if he agrees that Mamdani is a \"jihadist,\" Mr. Trump said no.",
      "\"I met with a man who's a very rational person. I met with a man who really wants to see New York be great again,\" the president continued.",
      "\"I would feel very, very comfortable being in New York\"",
      "Mr. Trump \u2014 a Queens native whose primary residence is now in Florida \u2014 said he'd feel comfortable moving back to New York City under Mamdani's leadership.",
      "\"I would feel very, very comfortable being in New York, and I think much more so after the meeting,\" he said.",
      "The pair's views on crime and immigration enforcement came up repeatedly on Friday. The president expressed confidence in Mamdani: He said he believes the mayor-elect cares about public safety, and praised Mamdani for choosing to retain\u00a0New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.",
      "\"That's a good sign,\" the president said.",
      "Trump: \"A lot of my voters actually voted for him, and I'm okay with that\"",
      "Mamdani pointed out that Mr. Trump's vote share in New York City jumped last year, which he attributed mostly to worries about affordability. And the mayor-elect noted that he swept up some Trump voters, which the president appreciated.",
      "\"He said a lot of my voters actually voted for him, and I'm okay with that,\" the president said.",
      "\"I think he's different than your typical guy\"",
      "Mr. Trump, for his part, praised Mamdani for the former state legislator's unexpected come-from-behind victory in the Democratic primary.",
      "\"He came out of nowhere,\" said the president. \"I watched. I said, 'Who is this guy?'\"",
      "Left unmentioned were the parallels with Mr. Trump's own insurgent victory in the 2016 Republican primary.",
      "Asked why Mamdani has drawn so much enthusiasm, Mr. Trump said: \"I think he's different than your typical guy, runs, wins, becomes mayor maybe and nothing exciting.\"",
      "At another point, Mr. Trump called being mayor a \"big deal,\" saying, \"one of the things I would've loved to be someday is the mayor of New York City.\"",

    "summary": "Texas asked the Supreme Court on Friday to halt a court order that threw out the state's redrawn House maps in time for next month's candidate filing deadline \u2014 arguing the new maps were driven by politics, not race.",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court on Friday temporarily halted\u00a0a lower court order\u00a0that threw out Texas' redrawn congressional maps in time for next month's candidate filing deadline \u2014 as the state and its legal opponents square off on whether the maps were driven by politics or race.",
      "Lawyers for Texas had asked the court earlier Friday to issue a stay and effectively let Texas return \u2014 at least for now \u2014 to the maps it passed over the summer, which redrew five Democratic House seats to make them more GOP-friendly.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito granted the state's request for an administrative stay, which means the lower court ruling is now on hold until the Supreme Court takes further action.",
      "Texas is asking the high court to stay the lower court ruling on a longer-term basis by Dec. 1, noting that\u00a0the deadline\u00a0for candidates to file for next year's primary elections is Dec. 8. He directed the plaintiffs who sued Texas to file their response by Monday afternoon.",
      "The state's redistricting push set of a\u00a0nationwide effort to redraw House maps ahead of next year's midterms, with California shifting five congressional districts to the left, and Missouri and North Carolina each shifting a seat to the right. President Trump has pushed other GOP-led states to take similar steps.",
      "But earlier this week, a panel of federal judges blocked Texas from using its new maps in a 2-1 ruling. The court's opinion, penned by Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, sided with plaintiffs who argued the map was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The lower court pointed to a majority-White Democratic district that it said should have changed more if the process was driven purely by politics, not race.\u00a0It also argued that some state officials, like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, seemed to move in response to a letter by a top Justice Department official warning them to redraw four existing districts that the federal government viewed as illegal \"coalition\" districts, where non-Hispanic White voters are in the minority, but no racial group has a majority.",
      "In Friday's request to the Supreme Court, the state of Texas pushed back on these arguments, asserting that the redistricting process was entirely partisan and wasn't motivated by race.",
      "\"From the start, everyone recognized that the purpose of Texas's redistricting effort was Republican political advantage,\" the state wrote, quoting several elected Democrats who criticized the new maps on political grounds.",
      "Texas said the lower court ruling \"erroneously rests on speculation and inferences of bad faith.\" And it said the state GOP's chief mapmaker worked with data on partisanship rather than race.",
      "In some cases, the state of Texas cited a dissent from the lower court ruling written by Judge Jerry Smith. The Reagan appointee drew headlines earlier this week for his fiery opinion, which used the phrase \"I dissent\" 16 times, called Brown an \"unskilled magician,\" said the majority opinion would deserve an \"F\" on a law school exam and accused the other judges of improperly leaving him out of the process.",
      "The State of Texas also argued the lower court ruling could cause \"chaos\" since it was issued during the candidate filing period for next year's races.",

      "Abortion is again illegal in North Dakota after the state's Supreme Court on Friday couldn't muster the required majority to uphold a judge's ruling that struck down the state's ban last year.",
      "The 2023 law makes it a felony crime for anyone to perform an abortion, though it specifically protects patients from prosecution. Doctors could be prosecuted and penalized by as much as five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.",
      "Three justices agreed that the ban is unconstitutionally vague under the state constitution. The other two justices said the law is not unconstitutional.",
      "The state constitution requires at least four of the five justices to agree for a law to be found unconstitutional, a high bar. Not enough members of the court joined together to affirm the lower court ruling.",
      "In his opinion, Justice Jerod Tufte said the natural rights guaranteed by the state constitution in 1889 do not extend to abortion rights. He also said the law \"provides adequate and fair warning to those attempting to comply.\"",
      "North Dakota Republican Attorney Drew Wrigley welcomed the ruling, saying, \"The Supreme Court has upheld this important pro-life legislation, enacted by the people's Legislature. The Attorney General's office has the solemn responsibility of defending the laws of North Dakota, and today those laws have been upheld.\"",
      "Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who introduced the 2023 legislation that became the law banning abortion, said she is \"thrilled and grateful that two justices that are highly respected saw the truth of the matter, that this is fully constitutional for the mother and for the unborn child and thereafter for that sake.\"",
      "Attorneys for the challengers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The ruling means access to abortion in North Dakota will be outlawed. Even after a judge had earlier struck down the ban last year, the only scenarios for a patient to obtain an abortion in North Dakota had been for life- or health-preserving reasons in a hospital.",
      "The only abortion provider relocated in 2022 from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota.",
      "Justice Daniel Crothers, one of the three judges to vote against the ban, wrote that the district court decision wasn't wrong.",
      "\"The vagueness in the law relates to when an abortion can be performed to preserve the life and health of the mother,\" Crothers wrote. \"After striking this invalid provision, the remaining portions of the law would be inoperable.\"",
      "North Dakota's newly confirmed ban prohibits the performance of an abortion as a felony crime. The only exceptions are for rape or incest in the first six weeks \u2014 before many women know they are pregnant \u2014 and to prevent the mother's death or a \"serious health risk\" to her.",
      "North Dakota joins 12 other states enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy. Another four bar it at or around six weeks gestational age.",
      "Judge Bruce Romanick had struck down the ban the state Legislature passed in 2023, less than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to the state-level bans, largely turning the abortion battle to state courts and legislatures.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coast-guard-guidance-nooses-swastikas-hate-symbols/",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 18:25:53 -0500",
    "summary": "A Coast Guard personnel directive updated language identifying symbols of racial or religious hatred, setting off a political firestorm this week.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard is scrambling to clarify proposed internal policy changes that appeared to loosen how the service branch handles the conduct within its ranks involving hate symbols including nooses, swastikas, and other extremist symbols \u2014 touching off a political firestorm inside the nation's smallest military branch after the Space Force.",
      "The controversy centers on a little-noticed personnel directive signed on Nov. 13 by Rear Admiral Charles Fosse, the assistant commandant for personnel, following a report by the Washington Post. The document, titled \"Harassing Behavior Prevention, Response and Accountability,\" contained a provision that proposed replacing longstanding language that explicitly identified swastikas, nooses, Confederate iconography and other symbols of racial or religious hatred as \"incidents of hatred and prejudice.\"",
      "Instead, the Coast Guard's new policy recast those same images as \"potentially divisive,\" a subtle but consequential shift that alarmed lawmakers and civil rights groups when it was first reported this week.",
      "What did the original policy actually change?",
      "The internal guidance that ignited the controversy introduced a few changes. The Coast Guard eliminated the term \"hate incident.\" Instead, conduct previously handled under that category was referred to as harassment \u2014 and only when a specific victim could be identified.",
      "The guidance also raised the threshold for disciplinary action by specifying that public displays of extremist symbols would constitute misconduct only if they could be shown to harm \"good order and discipline, unit cohesion, command climate, morale or mission effectiveness.\"",
      "Further, the policy also allowed symbols \"widely identified with oppression or hatred\" to be displayed in private or non-public settings, including military housing. The policy removed gender identity from the list of protected characteristics altogether, aligning the Coast Guard with Mr. Trump's January executive order barring transgender service.",
      "It also required that harassment be \"severe or pervasive\" and judged by a \"reasonable person.\" And it went out of its way to note that hazing \u2014 even when it involves physical force \u2014 can serve \"a proper military or other governmental purpose,\" a framing that echoes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's push to cultivate a tougher \"warrior ethos.\"",
      "What was the response?",
      "For years, Coast Guard policy has drawn a bright line on extremist symbols, stating unequivocally that items like nooses and swastikas \"have no place in the Coast Guard.\" The discovery that the service intended to downgrade them to \"potentially divisive\" immediately raised alarms on Capitol Hill.",
      "Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois said she met with the Coast Guard's acting commandant, Adm. Kevin Lunday, to express her concerns and was reassured that the policy would be clarified.",
      "\"He came by the office and assured us that there is an across-the-board prohibition on hate symbols, including swastikas and nooses,\" Underwood remarked in a video statement.",
      "Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington said in a statement, Thursday, that \"lynching is a federal hate crime. The world defeated the Nazis in 1945. The debate on these symbols is over.\" He added, \"Coast Guard: be better.\"",
      "By removing the \"hate incident\" designation, the Coast Guard appeared to create a narrower pathway for removing racist or extremist imagery from operational facilities, barracks and other training environments. Its new timeline for reporting \u2014 requiring victims to come forward within 45 days \u2014 also raised eyebrows over concerns it might deter reporting and make enforcement harder.",
      "In January, President Trump abruptly removed Adm. Linda Fagan as commandant just a day after taking office, placing Coast Guard leadership under scrutiny.",
      "What is the Coast Guard saying now?",
      "In response to the uproar, Lunday issued a forceful statement just hours after the policy became public, asserting that \"any display, use or promotion of symbols like nooses and swastikas will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished.\"",
      "Later that night, the service released an additional memo declaring that \"divisive or hate symbols and flags are prohibited\" at Coast Guard workplaces \u2014 an even firmer posture. The Coast Guard insisted the new memo was not a reversal but rather a clarification meant to counter \"misinformation\" and reaffirm the service's longstanding stance against extremist imagery.",
      "Still, leadership has not explained why earlier guidance explicitly permitted private displays or eliminated the \"hate incident\" language altogether.",
      "How do harassment cases work under the new framework?",
      "Even with the late clarifications, the underlying mechanics of the directive remain changed in significant ways.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/comey-seeks-dismissal-grand-jury-indictment-errors/",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 18:08:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Comey's lawyers said in a filing that errors in the grand jury process \"reflect the reckless and ill-conceived nature of this prosecution.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former FBI Director James Comey is seeking to dismiss the criminal case against him because of what he claims were \"fundamental errors\" in the grand-jury process and interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's handling of the indictment.",
      "Comey's filing, submitted to the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Friday, reflects information revealed during a court proceeding earlier this week, during which federal prosecutors said that the grand jury that indicted Comey on two criminal counts did not vote on the operative indictment.",
      "Defense lawyers instead said that the grand jury rejected the only indictment that Halligan presented to it, and argued that the government's attempt to prosecute Comey without a \"valid\" indictment violates his Fifth Amendment rights.",
      "In addition to questioning the validity of the operative indictment, which charges Comey with one count of lying to Congress and one count of obstructing a congressional proceeding, defense lawyers argued that the case should be dismissed because of alleged misconduct by Halligan before the grand jury.",
      "Halligan, who was appointed interim U.S. attorney in late September, mere days before Comey was indicted, was the only prosecutor who presented the case against Comey before the grand jury, and only she signed the indictment. Comey has pleaded not guilty to both counts.",
      "\"Those errors reflect the reckless and ill-conceived nature of this prosecution: A president intent on prosecuting Mr. Comey before the statute of limitations expired directed the appointment of a White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, as interim U.S. Attorney, and she then rushed to secure an indictment while flagrantly violating basic grand jury rules in the process,\" Comey's lawyers wrote in their bid to dismiss the case. \"Those grand jury errors warrant dismissal twice over.\"",
      "Questions about the proceedings before the grand jury gained steam Monday when a federal magistrate judge identified what he said was a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in its handling of the case against the ex-FBI director.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick found that during Halligan's presentation to the grand jury, the former White House aide made two statements that \"on their face appear to be fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the integrity of the grand jury process.\"",
      "Halligan worked as a former insurance lawyer before joining Mr. Trump in the White House for his second term. She had no prosecutorial experience when she was tapped to lead the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Grand jury transcripts are typically secret, but U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick reviewed them as part of a separate hearing on the grand-jury material in Comey's case and whether it should be handed over to the defense.",
      "Fitzpatrick said one statement Halligan made to the grand jury \"suggests\" that Comey does not have a constitutional right to not testify at trial. The second remark from Halligan suggested that the grand jury \"did not have to rely on only the record before them\" and that there was \"more evidence \u2014 perhaps better evidence\" that the Justice Department had that would be used at trial, the judge said.",
      "In a statement, a Justice Department official said that \"when the grand jury transcript is read in full \u2014 as federal judicial ethics require \u2014 it shows that U.S. Attorney Halligan's statements were entirely proper. Selectively quoting half-sentences cannot create impropriety where none exists.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick also raised concerns with the evidence the Justice Department used in its grand jury presentation, finding that much of the material used was seized by the FBI in an earlier probe into Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University and friend of Comey's who was investigated during the first Trump administration for allegedly leaking to the media. The investigation was closed in 2021 and no charges were filed.",
      "Fitzpatrick said the materials seized from Richman were the \"cornerstone\" of Halligan's presentation to the grand jury that voted to indict Comey, and found that the Justice Department may have used information that was collected but outside of the scope of the initial Richman search warrants, as well as potentially privileged information, during the grand-jury proceedings in Comey's case.",
      "The FBI, Fitzpatrick said, \"chose to rummage through\" the material it seized more than five years ago again this summer when it began investigating Comey, and \"inexplicably, the government elected not to seek a new warrant for the 2025 search\" of Richman's devices, \"even though the 2025 investigation was focused on a different person, was exploring a fundamentally different legal theory, and was predicated on an entirely different set of criminal offenses.\"",
      "A Justice Department official said \"the Government remains committed to following the law, respecting grand-jury secrecy, and ensuring that judicial decisions rest on facts \u2014 not assumptions. The magistrate judge's order does not meet that standard.\"",
      "During a hearing Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, who is presiding over Comey's case, the judge repeatedly questioned federal prosecutors about the validity of the operative indictment and the events surrounding the grand-jury proceedings on Sept. 25.",
      "Documents made public in Comey's case show that the grand jury was initially presented with a three-count indictment, but rejected one of the counts and voted to indict him on the two others.",
      "Tyler Lemons, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the judge that after the grand-jury coordinator informed the U.S. attorney's office about the outcome of the vote, a second indictment was drafted to remove the rejected count and list only the two approved by the grand jury.",
      "But the admission prompted Nachmanoff to question whether the grand jurors had ever been presented with and voted on the second two-count indictment, or whether it was given straight to a U.S. magistrate judge who was presiding over the return of the indictment.",
      "Lemons said the two-count indictment was given straight to the judge, and argued it was not a \"new\" indictment. Instead, he said it had been edited only to reflect the grand jury's decision to charge Comey with lying to Congress and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.",
      "Nachmanoff then asked if the second indictment was never shown to the entire grand jury. The prosecutor said that was correct. Halligan separately told the judge that only the foreperson for the grand jury and another grand juror were in the courtroom when the indictment was presented to the magistrate judge. That assertion was also backed up in a court filing Wednesday, when the Justice Department said that the \"corrected indictment\" with only the two counts marked was presented to the grand jury foreperson and deputy foreperson.",
      "Comey's lawyers seized on that admission, and argued during the hearing that the operative indictment was never presented to the grand jury and never voted on.",
      "\"There is no indictment that Mr. Comey is facing,\" Michael Dreeben, one of his attorneys, told the judge.",
      "Prosecutors attempted to clear up confusion about the proceedings and, pointing to the transcript of proceedings when the indictment was returned, wrote in a filing\u00a0Thursday that the foreperson told the court that the grand jury voted on the two-count indictment.",
      "\"The complete record eliminates any doubt: The foreperson confirmed the vote. The Court acknowledged the vote. The Court docketed the two-count true bill as the operative indictment. Only Count One lacked concurrence; Counts Two and Three were true-billed by at least twelve jurors,\" they said.",
      "But in their latest bid to dismiss the charges related to the alleged grand-jury issues, Comey's lawyers argued that \"there is no record of the grand jury seeing the new indictment \u2014 let alone voting on it.\" Prosecutors' \"late-breaking\" effort to correct the record \"cannot save the putative indictment,\" they continued.",
      "Their filing, defense lawyers said, \"contradicts numerous other representations that the government has made to this Court. And it rests on an erroneous overreading of an ambiguous exchange between the grand jury foreperson and the magistrate judge.\"",
      "The topic of the hearing earlier this week was Comey's effort to dismiss the indictment on the basis that his prosecution is vindictive and selective. Nachmanoff has yet to rule on that motion. Comey is also seeking to have the charges tossed out on the grounds that Halligan was unlawfully appointed interim U.S. attorney. A different judge is weighing that request and has said she intends to rule before Thanksgiving.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transportation-department-female-crash-test-dummy-thor/",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 16:23:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The new dummy, known as THOR-05F, contains female-specific proportions, according\u200b to the Transportation Department.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation introduced a new female crash dummy as it seeks to step up safety for women, who face a higher injury risk in car crashes than men.",
      "The U.S. government has used a dummy model for decades that is based almost entirely on male proportions.",
      "The new dummy, known as THOR-05F, is more human-like and contains female-specific proportions, according to the Transportation Department. The new model could potentially replace the Hybrid III dummy, which has previously been utilized for crash testing.",
      "\"Advances in technology now make it possible to more accurately account for the biological differences between male and female anatomy in crash testing,\" the Department of Transportation said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a head-on crash, and they are 17% more likely to be killed in a car crash, than men.",
      "Transportation officials will consider using the new dummy in the government's vehicle crash test five-star ratings once a final rule is adopted, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday in a news release.",
      "The department also noted that THOR-05F will be available to manufacturers to build models and to the automotive industry, which can begin testing the model in their vehicles.",
      "The road to THOR-05F",
      "The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man.",
      "The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "But the change is not guaranteed to happen. Some American automakers have been skeptical and a group representing auto insurers has already said it thinks the current crash test dummies are fine.",
      "The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said.",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn, a law student at New York University, started lobbying members of Congress to pass a law requiring the new female dummy after surviving a 2019 crash in Ireland in which her seat belt slid off her hips and ruptured her intestines. She welcomed Duffy's support but said she won't celebrate until NHTSA incorporates the new model into its testing \u2014 a step that has been delayed numerous times.",
      "\"I fear that with this announcement everybody will throw up their hands and say we've won,\" Kuhn said Friday. \"But we are far from crossing the finish line.\"",
      "Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Despite Duffy's announcement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, continues to advocate for the current line of dummies used to represent women and has seen dramatic improvements in safety as a result, spokesperson Joe Young said.",
      "\"Certainly, we are going to continue to monitor the new tools and perhaps do some additional research,\" Young said. \"But for now, our researchers are content and confident that the dummies we're using are doing a good job.\"",
      "Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements, but developments have been slow.",
      "U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement.",
      "\"Any progress here is good because there's simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,\" Duckworth said.",
      "Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor.",
      "\"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 15:07:52 -0500",
    "summary": "Bitcoin has erased all of its 2025 gains and is on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022. Here's what experts say about the decline.",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin continued to slide on Friday, extending a weeks-long slump that has wiped out nearly $800 billion in value since the cryptocurrency hit its 2025 peak last month. The downturn has stripped away all of bitcoin's gains this year \u2014 and raised questions about where it might go from here.",
      "Since closing at almost $125,000 on Oct. 6, its highest price this year, bitcoin has shed about one-third of its value. On Friday, bitcoin sank below $82,000 before rebounding slightly to $83,509 before noon EDT, according to CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator.",
      "The cryptocurrency, which is trading at its lowest level since April, is now on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022, when a spate of corporate collapses sparked turbulence in the crypto sector, Bloomberg\u00a0reported\u00a0Friday.",
      "The precipitous drop comes as Wall Street grapples with unease over whether there's a bubble in artificial technology and tech stocks, prompting a shift away from assets that are viewed as carrying more risk, analysts say. Investors are also cautious given signs of weakness in the labor market, and the outlook for the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision next month, with more economists now expecting the Fed to hold off on cutting rates.",
      "\"The future is uncertain. It almost feels like it's moving back to the question: do I even want to hold [bitcoin] in this environment?\" said Thomas Chen, the CEO of cryptocurrency company Function, in an email.",
      "Why is Bitcoin falling?",
      "Concerns about an AI bubble can translate into turbulence for cryptocurrencies because tech stocks tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, experts noted.",
      "\"When tech sneezes, it's natural to expect Bitcoin to catch a cold,\" noted Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, in an email.",
      "Aside from pulling back from riskier assets, some investors may be selling bitcoin to cover margin calls. Coinbase, for example, now offers \"perpetual futures,\" a product that lets traders use up to 10-to-1 leverage on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",
      "Leveraged positions can force investors to sell because borrowing amplifies every price move \u2014 for both gains and losses. Even a small drop in the underlying asset can lead to an outsized loss on a leveraged trade. But if an asset tumbles and the investor can't meet the margin requirements, the trading platform may automatically liquidate the position, which leads to more selling and downward pressure on its price.",
      "\"When traders borrow heavily to magnify positions, any reversal triggers liquidations that accelerate the move,\" Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, a financial advisory organization, said in an email.",
      "Large declines in bitcoin's price aren't unusual, and the cryptocurrency has always rebounded, experts noted.",
      "Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, said in a Tuesday email that bitcoin has historically experienced around five corrections of 20-30% or more during bull markets, adding that the issues may represent \"temporary headwinds\" as some investors could view lower crypto prices as a buying opportunity.",

    "summary": "The agency's \"Golden Age of Travel\" campaign aims to restore civility to air travel. Experts say they have doubts.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Wednesday unveiled a campaign aimed at bringing more civility to air travel, urging Americans to dress \"with respect\" and remember simple courtesies like saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" to flight attendants. Travel experts say they're skeptical it will make much difference.",
      "The new plan \u2014 called \"The Golden Age of Travel Starts With You\"\u00a0\u2014 is meant to \"jumpstart a nationwide conversation around how we can all restore courtesy and class to air travel,\" the agency said.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is rolling out the civility campaign in part as a response to what the agency called a record rise in unruly passenger incidents, including altercations with other travelers and airline staff. The issue isn't new, with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration data showing that incidents with unruly passengers peaked in 2021, although reports remain roughly double their pre-pandemic level.",
      "The Transportation Department didn't define what it meant by \"dressing with respect.\" In a Wednesday social media post, Duffy wrote, \"Dress up to go to the airport, help a stranger out, and be in a good mood.\"",
      "Duffy said he's encouraging air travelers to ask themselves the following five questions to ensure civility:",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?Are you dressing with respect?Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?",
      "Are you dressing with respect?",
      "Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?",
      "Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?",
      "Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Can dressing better improve economy class?",
      "Travel experts are skeptical that the Transportation Department's call to dress up for the airport will result in meaningful changes. Most travelers now prize comfort over formality, especially given the typically tight seating in economy and the likelihood of delays.",
      "In response to Duffy's social media post, some users chimed in with their own ideas \u2014 from widening cramped economy seats to making security checkpoints friendlier for travelers. While some agreed that a little more civility would be welcome, others noted that comfortable clothes make flying more tolerable in such tight quarters.",
      "A few decades ago, when Americans typically dressed up to fly, the travel experience looked a whole lot different.",
      "\"Economy class was actually nice. Now, everyone is wedged together on planes,\" Chris Elliott, a travel expert and consumer advocate, told CBS News.",
      "Sarah Silbert, a strategist at the flight search engine Points Path, said the clothing guideline isn't enforceable and isn't likely to shift traveler behavior.",
      "\"It's more of a soft nudge about travel etiquette,\" she told CBS News. \"Given how cramped and stressful flying can be for most people now, it's easy to see why a message about 'dressing up' will draw pushback.\"",
      "Travelers' interpretations may also vary significantly, experts added.",
      "\"Do I imagine anyone would be able to agree on what the dress code is? No,\" Daniel Green, co-founder of Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News. He added that he doesn't think there should be a dress code for travelers, either.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I think this is just a well-intentioned messaging campaign about behaving well in public that will likely have no practical or tangible implications for people,\" he said.",
      "Changes in air travel",
      "The rise in unruly passengers stems from several issues, including alcohol, drugs and mental health issues, as well as stress from dealing with crowded airports and problems like flight delays, according to Transport Security International, a travel publication.",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of the flight-deals site Going.com, noted that the \"golden age of travel\" was hardly golden for most Americans. Airfare was so expensive that flying was largely limited to the wealthy. Because flying is more affordable today, air travel has become a more democratized experience, he added.",
      "\"Many more people are traveling today. You see people from all walks of life getting on planes, and this campaign harkens back to a time when air travel was only for the elite,\" he told CBS News.",
      "He also objects to the notion that the \"golden age\" of flying provided a better passenger experience than today's flights.",
      "\"There are many ways in which it was an objectively worse experience. The flights took longer, they didn't have Wi-Fi, and there was cigarette smoke wafting through cabins,\" he said.",
      "Even so, he said he doubts the Transportation Department's civility push will inspire anyone to start dressing to the nines.",
      "\"If you think it's a good thing that most of society today can afford to buy tickets and travel, then you have to accept that people are going to behave how they're going to behave,\" Keyes said. \"I don't think I would want to live in a society that had dress recommendations to be on an airplane.\"",

      "Mamdani used similar language, saying his team reached out to set up the meeting \"because I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than 8.5 million people who call this city home.\"",
      "But often, their words for each other have been more combative.",
      "Mr. Trump, who grew up in Queens and built his business career in New York City, has decried the incoming mayor as \"a communist lunatic.\" Mamdani has blasted the president's immigration raids and economic policies.",
      "Here's a sampling of what the two men have said about each other:",
      "Trump has leaned into calling Mamdani a \"communist\"",
      "The president has repeatedly referred to Mamdani, a self-identifying democratic socialist, as a communist. He's called him \"my little communist mayor\" and a \"communist lunatic.\"",
      "\"Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We've had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0posted in June.",
      "\"I don't know what it is, but we have to win the midterms otherwise all of the things that we've done, so many of them are going to be taken away by the radical left lunatics,\" the president said ahead of Election Day. \"I mean, we're going to end up with a communist mayor in New York, can you believe it, a communist? Remember, I would always say we will not have a socialist elected in our country.\"",
      "Trump has suggested Mamdani, a naturalized citizen, may be in the country illegally",
      "President Trump \u2014 who spent years promoting \"birther\" conspiracies about President Obama \u2014 has suggested that Mamdani isn't in the country legally, despite Mamdani being a naturalized U.S. citizen. Mamdani was born in Uganda and moved to New York City with his family at age 7. He gained citizenship in 2018.",
      "\"A lot of people are saying he's here illegally,\" he said of Mamdani this summer. \"We're going to look at everything.\"",
      "The president has also floated the possibility of arresting Mamdani if he tries to keep U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from arresting and deporting people. If that happens, the president said, \"Well then, we'll have to arrest him.\"",
      "Trump has threatened to pull federal funding from New York City",
      "Before Mamdani's election, Mr. Trump urged New Yorkers to vote for his rival, former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and threatened to pull federal funding from New York City if Mamdani were mayor.",
      "\"If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home,\" said Mr. Trump, who spent most of his life in New York before changing his primary residency to Florida in 2019.",
      "The Trump administration's efforts to pull federal funding for projects in blue cities and states during the government shutdown has been met with resistance in court.",
      "But after Mamdani won, the president sounded like he might take a different approach.",
      "\"We'll help them,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We want New York to be successful. We'll help them a little bit, maybe.\"",
      "Trump said Jews who vote for Mamdani are \"stupid\"",
      "The president said during the campaign that any Jews who vote for Mamdani are \"stupid\" because of Mamdani's\u00a0positions on Israel and support for Palestinian statehood.",
      "\"Any Jewish person that votes for Zohran Mamdani, a proven and self professed JEW HATER, is a stupid person!!!\" the president wrote.",
      "Mamdani has said his views were often misrepresented. \"And frankly, I think much of it has to do with that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election,\" he said during the last debate.",
      "Trump said \"Mamdani, or whatever the hell his name is\"",
      "Speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami on Nov. 5, Mr. Trump brought up Mamdani while talking about the subject of transgender athletes.",
      "\"How about the weightlifting? 218 pounds by a woman, that's a lot to lift over your head. 218 pounds, or whatever, was the record. A man beat the record by 100 pounds. It stood for, like, 17 years or something. A man beat the record by 100 pounds. He was a failed male weightlifter, but as a female, he did very well,\" Trump said, mimicking a weightlifter. \"People are crazy.\"",
      "\"And Mamdani, whatever the hell his name is, in New York. He thinks it's wonderful to have men playing in women's sports,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mamdani has said he's ready to challenge Trump",
      "On the campaign trail, Mamdani was highly critical of the president's immigration crackdown. He's also suggested the president and his administration are looking out for the rich.",
      "During his victory speech, Mamdani spoke directly to the president: \"Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!\" he said to a cheering crowd.",
      "\"If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him,\" Mamdani said.",
      "Mamdani said he won't be intimidated by the president.",
      "\"His threats are inevitable,\" Mamdani said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" the morning after his victory. \"This has nothing to do with safety, it has to do with intimidation.\"",
      "Mamdani has also made the argument that Mr. Trump's policies have made life more expensive for New Yorkers.",
      "\"The Trump administration continues to find new ways to raise costs on all of us,\" he said.",
      "Mamdani criticized \"transphobic bigotry\" from Trump administration",
      "After current New York Mayor Eric Adams suggested revising school bathroom policies, Mamdani tweeted, \"Awful and dangerous to hear the Mayor echo the transphobic bigotry coming from the Trump administration.\"",
      "\"It's completely at odds with the values of our city,\" he added.",
      "Mamdani said Trump wants to have him \"arrested, stripped of my citizenship, put in a detention camp and deported\"",
      "In a social media post in July, Mamdani said Mr. Trump \"just threatened to have me arrested, stripped of my citizenship, put in a detention camp and deported\" over Mamdani's objections to Mr. Trump's deportation policies.",
      "\"His statements don't just represent an attack on our democracy but an attempt to send a message to every New Yorker who refuses to hide in the shadows: if you speak up, they will come for you,\" Mamdani wrote. \"We will not accept this intimidation.\"",
      "Mamdani said he'll work with Trump on any agenda item that benefits New Yorkers",
      "Mamdani says he'll work with the president on any agenda item that benefits New York City residents.",

      "Amazon has started issuing payments to eligible Prime members as part of a $2.5 billion settlement over federal allegations that it misled customers.",
      "The online retailer\u00a0agreed to the payouts in September\u00a0to resolve a 2023 Federal Trade Commission\u00a0lawsuit that accused Amazon of misleading customers into enrolling in Prime and making it hard for them to cancel their membership.",
      "Under the settlement, Amazon agreed to offer $1.5 billion in refunds to customers. However, the e-commerce company neither admitted nor denied the FTC's allegations. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time, the company said that \"Amazon and our executives have always followed the law.\"",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 A vintage blue VW bus that became an unlikely symbol of resilience after it survived a California wildfire made its public debut this week, shiny and like-new after Volkswagen spent months restoring the damaged vehicle.",
      "The bus went viral in January when an Associated Press photographer captured it looking surprisingly unharmed by the deadly Palisades Fire, a spot of blue and white dwarfed by the charred remains of a Malibu neighborhood. Volkswagen saw the accompanying AP story and reached out to the owner, Megan Weinraub. Upon closer inspection, VW technicians discovered that while the bus had survived, it had smoke damage and blistered paint, rust and a window busted by the heat.",
      "In its restoration, the 1977 Type 2 Microbus named Azul - Spanish for the color blue - again brought people together as technicians consulted the broader community of VW enthusiasts in a shared mission to revive what was a quirky middle-aged vehicle.",
      "\"It melted and Volkswagen saved it,\" Weinraub said Thursday at the LA Auto Show, standing with the bus's previous owner, Preston Martin. \"It was a giant relief because it wasn't my first priority with everything going on.\"",
      "While Weinraub calls the microbus \"Azul,\" it became known as the \"Magic bus\" on social media, CBS News Los Angeles points out.",
      "\"I was lucky and grateful to have the opportunity for them to restore it because I wouldn't have been able to restore it myself,\" she told the station.",
      "Weintraub and Martin still can't believe the bus they wrote off as a goner is now ready to take them on another surfing adventure. The last time they saw the pre-burned Azul was two days before the Palisades Fire broke out, when they parked the bus near Weinraub's apartment after surfing.",
      "Mark J. Terrill, the AP photographer who captured the original image, was on hand when Weinraub and Martin saw the bus for the first time after its restoration in late October.",
      "Volkswagen hauled the microbus to its Oxnard facility west of Los Angeles where it houses historic VW vehicles. Vehicle technicians Farlan Robertson and Gunnar Wynarski sourced hard-to-find parts, got creative and reached out to a lot of people.",
      "\"At the bottom of it it was to try to take the vehicle that everyone else saw and do what we could to improve upon it, but not change it,\" said Robertson, \"to actually have it come out and be the revived, resurrected vehicle returned to its former glory.\"",

    "story": [
      "Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.",
      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The bust, in the port outside of Peru's capital, Lima, led to the arrest of three men tied to a transnational criminal network involved in illegal fishing and wildlife smuggling, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. authorities have assisted the Peruvian government in seizing an estimated 10,000 individual shark fins destined for China \u2014 one of the largest wildlife trafficking operations in Latin American history.",
      "The bust, on Nov. 10 at an industrial port outside of Lima, led to the arrest of three men tied to a transnational criminal network involved in illegal fishing and wildlife smuggling, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "The cruelty behind the shark fin trade is well-documented. Shark finning often involves slicing fins off live sharks and discarding the mutilated animals back into the ocean, where they die from blood loss, suffocation or predation. The practice is banned in many countries but persists due to weak enforcement and high profits.",
      "Shark fins are prized in Chinese cuisine, particularly for shark fin soup, which is associated with status and celebration, according to the nonprofit Shark Stewards. It's a dish that can sell for $100 a bowl and continues to drive a lucrative black market.",
      "Despite growing awareness and some regulatory crackdowns, the global demand for shark fins remains strong. The United Nations estimates the illegal wildlife trade generates up to\u00a0$20 billion annually, rivaling the drug and arms trades in scale and sophistication.",
      "\"The billion-dollar fin and meat trade is driving the extinction of iconic shark and ray species. Now, more than ever, critical action must be taken before it's too late,\" Luke Warwick, director of Shark and Ray Conservation for the Wildlife Conservation Society, told CBS News.",
      "The operation was led by Peru's Organized Crime Investigation Division of the Environmental. The fins, valued at more than $11.2 million, were sourced from threatened species including blue sharks, pelagic thresher sharks and common thresher sharks.",
      "Authorities say the criminal network purchased fins from Ecuadorian fishermen and laundered them through falsified documents claiming the catch originated in Peruvian waters. Once dried and stored in Callao, Peru, outside Lima, the fins were prepared for export to China.",
      "\"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in close partnership with the Peruvian National Police, is taking decisive action to dismantle the illegal shark fin trade. Together, we are committed to protecting sharks, and preserving the health of our oceans, for future generations,\" Doug Ault, assistant director of the office of\u00a0law enforcement at the USFWS, told CBS News.",
      "Sharks play a critical role in maintaining healthy marine ecosystems. As apex predators, their decline can trigger cascading effects, including the collapse of coral reefs and fisheries. Many shark species reproduce slowly, making them especially vulnerable to overexploitation.",
      "While the bust marks a significant victory for law enforcement, it also highlights the scale of the challenge. The black market for wildlife products continues to thrive, driven by international demand, corruption and limited oversight, according to the\u00a0U.N.\u00a0For now, the 9.3 tons of fins seized in Peru represent a stark reminder of the global cost of environmental crime.",

    "story": [
      "The handling of the federal investigation into Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California is being reviewed by Justice Department investigators, three sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "A Republican congressional candidate who lives in California, Christine Bish, submitted a tip to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, alleging fraud in Schiff's mortgage documentation. She told CBS News that she was questioned by federal officials Thursday and was asked about Bill Pulte. He's the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and was appointed to the position by President Trump. Pulte referred Schiff to the Justice Department in May for investigation over alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "Schiff has denied any wrongdoing, and on Thursday declined to comment when asked about Pulte.",
      "Bish said the officials \"weren't asking me about Schiff \u2014 they were asking me about other people who were investigating Schiff.\"",
      "In addition to Schiff, Pulte recently referred California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell to the Justice Department for investigation over alleged tax and mortgage fraud and has leveled similar accusations against several other officials, including New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.",
      "Bish said federal officials also wanted to know if she had ever met Pulte or Ed Martin, who is the Justice Department's pardon attorney and also the director of its Weaponization Working Group.",
      "\"That's what they're looking for, is that, and any communication that I've had with them,\" Bish said. She told CBS News she has not communicated with either of them.",
      "Bish was at the Greenbelt, Maryland, federal courthouse Thursday and spoke with reporters. She said was not under oath when she spoke with federal officials.",
      "Two other sources familiar with the matter said there is a review underway into how Pulte and Martin have handled the investigation of Schiff.",
      "A copy of a subpoena shared by Bish said she has been asked to provide \"documentation and communications\" she referenced in her interviews with federal agents about Schiff. Specifically, the subpoena said Bish was to provide information about \"any person or persons claiming to be William Pulte,\" any person or persons claiming to be working at the direction of Pulte\" and \"anyone claiming to be working for or at the direction\" of the Justice Department and Ed Martin, who is working on the investigation into Schiff.",

    "summary": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says U.S. peace plan forces Ukraine to choose between losing \"dignity\" or \"a key partner.\"",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that he has spoken with the leaders of France, the U.K. and Germany about a proposed 28-point peace plan from the Trump administration to end Russia's war in Ukraine. He said the leaders \"value the efforts of the United States, President Trump, and his team aimed at ending this war.\"",
      "In a separate video posted on social media Friday, Zelenskyy said, \"Ukraine may find itself facing a very difficult choice: Either loss of dignity, or the risk of losing a key partner. Either a difficult 28 points, or an extremely difficult winter.\"",
      "A Ukrainian official said Zelenskyy also discussed the peace plan with Vice President JD Vance on Friday.",
      "President Trump said in a radio interview that he wants an answer from Zelenskyy on his 28-point plan by Thursday, which is Thanksgiving, but says an extension is possible to finalize terms.",
      "\"I've had a lot of deadlines, but if things are working well, you tend to extend the deadlines,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview on the Brian Kilmeade Show on Fox News Radio. \"But Thursday is it \u2014 we think an appropriate time.\"",
      "Later Friday, Mr. Trump told reporters \"we have a plan\" to address the Russia-Ukraine war, but Zelenskyy still needs to approve it. The president said of the Ukrainian leader, \"at some point he's going to have to accept something.\"",
      "\"He'll have to like it, and if he doesn't like it, then they should just keep fighting, I guess,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Among its provisions, the plan would require Ukraine to give up a large swath of its eastern territory, limit the size of its military, and be barred from ever joining NATO \u2014 points favorable to demands previously made by Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday that the U.S. 28-point plan had not been discussed with Russia in detail.",
      "Putin, who appeared on camera on Friday, said Russia had received the text of the 28-point plan \"through existing channels of communication with the U.S. administration.\"",
      "\"I believe it could too form the basis for a final peace settlement,\" he said. \"But this text is not being discussed with us in any substantive way. And I can assume why. I believe the reason is the same: the U.S. administration has so far been unable to secure the consent of the Ukrainian side. Ukraine is against it.\"",
      "European Union ambassadors met with the Ukrainian ambassador in Washington Friday, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. They discussed the current situation between Russia and Ukraine and recent events, including phone conversations between Zelenskyy and Vance, the Chancellor of Germany and Mr. Trump, as well as between European leaders.",
      "Army Secretary Dan Driscoll separately met with 31 ambassadors of European nations on Friday and discussed U.S. intentions, the urgency and momentum the U.S. has achieved, said Col. Dave Butler, a U.S. military spokesman. He took questions after giving a statement, Butler disclosed.",
      "Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and war has raged there ever since.",
      "Some European governments were aware that the U.S. was working on a proposal, but were not involved in drafting it, European officials contacted by CBS News said. As of Thursday, officials said European governments had not been briefed on the plan's contents.",
      "\"We are working on the document prepared by the American side. This must be a plan that ensures a real and dignified peace,\" Zelenskyy said on social media Friday after his call with French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.",
      "\"We are coordinating closely to make sure that the principled stances are taken into account,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that the leaders \"coordinated the next steps and agreed that our teams will work together at the corresponding levels.\"",
      "In a prior social media post late Thursday, Zelenskyy said he had spoken about the plan with a \"high-level delegation\" from the U.S.",
      "\"The American side presented its proposals \u2014 the points of a plan to end the war \u2014 their vision. From the first days of the war, we have upheld one very simple position: Ukraine needs peace. A real peace \u2014 one that will not be broken by a third invasion. A dignified peace \u2014 with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty, and the dignity of the Ukrainian people. And it is exactly such terms that we must secure. I outlined our key principles. And we agreed that our teams will work on these proposals to ensure it's all genuine,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said he expected to speak with President Trump in the coming days.",
      "\"We are fully aware that America's strength and America's support can truly bring peace closer, and we do not want to lose that,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We are also aware that Russia has no real desire for peace \u2014 otherwise they would not have started this war.\"",
      "A German government statement released Friday after the phone call between Zelenskyy, Macron, Starmer and Merz said the four European leaders \"welcomed the United States' efforts to end the war in Ukraine. In particular, they welcomed the commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and the willingness to provide Ukraine with robust security guarantees.\"",
      "The German statement said the leaders \"pledged to continue pursuing the goal of safeguarding vital European and Ukrainian interests in the long term. This includes, among other things, ensuring that the Line of Contact serves as the starting point for any understanding and that the Ukrainian armed forces remain capable of effectively defending Ukraine's sovereignty.\"",
      "The leaders agreed that any plan affecting the EU, European countries or NATO \"requires the approval of European partners or a consensus among the allies,\" the German statement said.",

      "A grizzly bear attacked a group of students and teachers on Thursday in a remote community on British Columbia's Central Coast, injuring several people, according to the school, police and conservation officials.",

CBS News also reached out to the British Columbia emergency service but did not receive a response.",
      "The B.C Conservation Officer Service put out a statement urging residents to stay away from the forest and river area near the site until further notice. The agency said efforts to locate and capture the bear continued on Friday.",
      "The Nuxalk Nation chief, Samuel Schooner, said in a Facebook post that the \"aggressive bear\" in the area is still on the loose. He warned people not to look for it and to stay indoors.",
      "\"There has been a bear incident near 4 Mile. For the safety of all, please stay indoors, off the highway near the administration office, and off all trails,\" the chief said.",
      "The conservation service said the students and teachers had stopped along a trail near the river when a grizzly bear emerged from the forest and attacked.",
      "\"Multiple teachers physically intervened, using bear spray and a bear banger, to drive the bear away,\" the agency said.",
      "Veronica Schooner said her 10-year-old son Alvarez was in the class and was \"traumatized\" and \"in shock\" after the attack, The Canadian Press reported.",
      "\"He was running for his life,\" she said, adding that the bear got so close, \"he even felt its fur.\"",
      "She told the news outlet a lot of people tried to stop the attack but one male teacher \"got the whole brunt of it.\"",
      "Acwsalcta School, an independent First Nation school in the Nuxalk Nation in Bella Coola, said in a Facebook post that the incident involved the school's community members and that the school will be closed on Friday due to the bear attack.",
      "\"Our thoughts and heartfelt prayers are with the student and staff member who were injured,\" the school wrote. \"...We also extend our care to all students who witnessed or were affected by the event; no one handles events like this alone, and we are committed to providing the emotional support and resources needed in the days and weeks ahead.\"",

    "summary": "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up territory and swear off NATO membership.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war\u00a0\u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official.",
      "The 28-point plan is the most recent working document offered by the administration, reflecting feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, the White House official said. It still remains unclear whether both sides will agree to it; diplomatic conversations are ongoing and further changes are being negotiated, according to multiple sources.",
      "While some European governments were aware the U.S. was working on a proposal, they were not involved in drafting it,\u00a0according to European officials contacted by CBS News.",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "The plan was also presented to a senior member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, Rustem Umerov, a White House official said. Umerov confirmed on\u00a0X\u00a0that he was party to the talks on a technical level but said, \"I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure.\"",
      "On Thursday, Zelenskyy met with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in Kyiv, and was presented with what he later characterized in a post on X as \"points of a plan to end the war \u2014 [America's] vision.\" Zelenskyy said he outlined Ukraine's key principles, and the two sides agreed to continue working on the plan's provisions. A White House official told CBS News that Driscoll had two hours of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including 45 minutes of direct talks with Zelenskyy, which they described as \"productive.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS News: \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after 5 years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"",
      "Here's how the proposed plan would work:",
      "Immediate ceasefire",
      "The plan says a ceasefire would take effect immediately if both sides agree to the deal.",
      "Ukraine expected to give up its eastern regions",
      "As written, the plan would allow Russia to hold onto much of the Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies \u2014 and take over some Ukrainian-held areas.",
      "The plan calls for the Ukrainian oblasts of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to be recognized by the U.S. and others as de facto Russian territory. Crimea was fully annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Russian military has occupied most of Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 collectively known as the Donbas \u2014 since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine were first occupied by Russian-aligned forces in 2014.",
      "Crucially, parts of Donetsk that are still under Ukrainian control would also be ceded to Russia, according to the proposal, but would be deemed a neutral buffer zone with no Russian military presence.",
      "The conflict would be frozen at the existing front lines in two other Ukrainian oblasts \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhia \u2014 effectively allowing Russia to hold onto cities like Mariupol and retain a land connection to Crimea.",
      "Those terms could prove to be a sticking point for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has long refused to give up any new territory or recognize Russian control over Crimea, instead calling for the war to be paused on the existing conflict lines.",
      "Ukraine must cap its military size",
      "The proposal also calls for Ukraine to cap the size of its military at 600,000 people.",
      "Zelensky said in January that the country's military numbered 880,000, according to the Kyiv Independent. Six years earlier, it had roughly 250,000 troops, the Atlantic Council said.",
      "No to NATO membership \u2014 but Ukraine can join the EU",
      "Under the plan, Ukraine would be barred from joining NATO.",
      "The country would be expected to modify its constitution to specify that it will not join the 32-nation bloc, a change of course since the country's NATO aspirations are currently enshrined in its constitution. Ukraine has pursued NATO membership for years, a status that would require the United States and other members to come to the country's defense if it's attacked again.",
      "And NATO is expected to agree not to accept Ukraine into the alliance. In 2008, its member states issued a declaration agreeing that Ukraine would become a member of NATO at some point in the future, but it did not set out a timeline.",
      "The plan also calls for NATO to agree not to send troops to Ukraine \u2014 possibly scuttling any postwar security deal that involves placing allied troops on Ukrainian soil.",
      "Another point in the plan says Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand any further \u2014 a favorable point for Russia, which has long chafed at the alliance's post-Cold War expansions. Sweden and Finland are the alliance's newest members, joining in 2024 and 2023, respectively, partly in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "NATO's longstanding position is that it has an \"open door policy,\" and decisions to admit new countries are made by its members, not any other countries.",
      "But the plan does specify that Ukraine has a right to join the European Union, and that it would get access to the European market in the meantime. Russia has long been wary of further economic and political integration between Ukraine and Europe.",
      "A U.S. guarantee",
      "The plan lays out a security guarantee if Russia reinvades Ukraine, calling for a \"decisive coordinated military response\" and the reinstatement of sanctions on Russia. Other benefits from the agreement, including recognition of new Russian territory, would be called off as well. The plan does not specify what type of military response Russia would face.",
      "The guarantee would be terminated if Ukraine invades Russia, or if it launches missiles at Moscow or St. Petersburg.",
      "Ukrainian elections",
      "Ukraine would be expected to hold elections in 100 days. Ukraine had elections scheduled for early 2024, but they were delayed due to the war. Zelenskyy won the presidency in 2019.",
      "Economic plan for Ukraine, Russian sanctions lifted",
      "The plan calls for a recovery plan for Ukraine, whose economy has been devastated by a yearslong Russian invasion and aerial bombardment. That includes reconstruction of Ukrainian cities, a development fund to boost Ukraine's tech industry and investments in mining and gas.",
      "Some $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be invested in Ukraine, with the U.S. leading that effort. Europe would contribute an additional $100 billion.",
      "The plan also calls for negotiations on lifting the hefty sanctions that Russia has faced since the invasion began, choking it off from much of the global economy. The sanctions would be lifted in stages, according to the framework. And frozen Russian assets beyond $100 billion would be plowed into a joint U.S.-Russia investment fund.",
      "The overall plan would be monitored and enforced by a Peace Council, to be chaired by President Trump.",
      "Other points in the plan include a Russia-NATO security dialogue, a joint U.S.-Russia security working group and a non-aggression pact between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. It would also extend U.S.-Russia arms control treaties, require Ukraine to be a non-nuclear state and bar Russia from blocking Ukraine from using the key Dnipro river for commercial purposes.",
      "All civilian detainees taken during the war would be returned, including children, and both sides in the conflict would be granted amnesty for their conduct during the war. And both countries would be expected to adopt educational programs to discourage racial prejudice.",
      "The plan also calls for a return of Russia to the Group of Eight, a grouping of powerful countries that kicked Russia out after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.",
      "Leavitt said in her statement: \"As the Trump Administration has clearly said, any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe, and Russia to ensure the end of the war, in addition to financial opportunities for Ukraine to rebuild, and for Russia to rejoin the global economy, to benefit the people in both countries.\"",

    "story": [
      "Nobel laureate and Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado will be considered a \"fugitive\" if she emerges from hiding to collect the honor in Norway, Venezuela's attorney general told Agence France-Presse on Thursday.",
      "Machado has expressed interest in attending the ceremony, which will be held in Oslo on December 10.",
      "\"By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive,\" Attorney General Tarek William Saab told the AFP. Saab added that Machado is accused of \"acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism,\" and noted that she is under investigation for her support of the United States' deployment of military forces in the Caribbean.",
      "Machado was awarded the 2025\u00a0Nobel Peace Prize\u00a0last month for \"her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.\" The Nobel Committee called Machado a \"key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided\" and \"a brave and committed champion of peace.\" It was Venezuela's first Nobel Prize.",
      "Known as Venezuela's \"Iron Lady,\" the 58-year-old Machado has spent more than two decades leading a massive political movement challenging the country's authoritarian leaders. She has been in hiding in Venezuela since the country's 2024 election.",
      "Venezuela has been ruled by an autocratic regime for decades and is currently led by President Nicolas Maduro, whose election in 2024 was widely dismissed as non-democratic. His leadership is not recognized by many nations, including the United States. Instead, the U.S. recognized Senator Edmundo Gonzalez, an opposition politician backed by Machado, as the legitimate winner of the election. Gonzalez has since left Venezuela.",
      "The Trump administration has accused Maduro of working with drug smuggling gangs, and tensions have only grown amid strikes on alleged drug boats and U.S. military assets being moved into the Caribbean.",
      "Machado has supported the efforts, calling the increased military pressure a \"necessary measure\" toward the \"restoration of popular sovereignty in Venezuela.\"",
      "Machado told CBS News\u00a0in an exclusive interview last month that she believed winning the Nobel would give her \"a lot of protection\" from the Maduro regime.",

    "story": [
      "Armed men attacked a Catholic boarding school in northwestern region of Nigeria and abducted several schoolchildren and staff early Friday. It's the latest\u00a0in a spate of abductions in Africa's most populous country and came just days after 25 schoolgirls were kidnapped in a neighboring state. The latest abduction comes as the country is facing scrutiny from the Trump administration amid ongoing concern about violence against Christians in the West African nation.",
      "The attack and abductions took place at St. Mary's School in Niger State. Local officials did not disclose the number of students and staff abducted, nor who might be responsible for the attack. Local Nigerian broadcaster Arise TV said 52 schoolchildren were taken.",
      "Nigerian police officials said the abductions took place in the early hours of Friday and that military and security forces have since been deployed to the community. They described St. Mary's as a secondary school that serves children between the ages of in 12 and 17.",
      "The secretary to the Niger state government, Abubakar Usman, said in a statement that the incident occurred despite prior intelligence warning of heightened threats.",
      "\"Regrettably, St. Mary's School proceeded to reopen and resume academic activities without notifying or seeking clearance from the State Government, thereby exposing pupils and the staff to avoidable risk,\" the statement said.",
      "The abductions took place days after gunmen on Monday attacked a high school and abducted 25 schoolgirls in the neighboring Kebbi state, in Maga, around 105 miles from Papiri. One of the girls later escaped and is safe, the school's principal said.",
      "Nigerian President Bola Tinubu earlier this week postponed his trip to this weekend's Group of 20 summit after promising to intensify rescue efforts.",
      "\"I am heartbroken by the abduction of our daughters in Kebbi and the painful loss of Brigadier General Musa Uba and the brave soldiers who fell in Borno. Their families, and the families of the kidnapped schoolgirls, are in my prayers,\" Tinubu said in a social media post Wednesday. \"I have directed the security agencies to act swiftly and bring the girls back to Kebbi State.\"",
      "Nigeria was recently thrust into the spotlight after President Trump singled the country out, stating that Christians are being persecuted \u2014 an allegation that the Nigerian government rejected.",
      "\"If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, \"guns-a-blazing,\" to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities. I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action,\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth social post earlier this month.",
      "Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar rejected Mr. Trump's claims in a post on X earlier this month, saying \"Nigeria is a God-fearing country where we respect faith, tolerance, diversity, and inclusion.\"",
      "In October, Mr. Trump designated Nigeria as a \"Country of Particular Concern\" in a list of countries that the State Department says have violated religion freedom.",
      "Earlier this week, Tinubu sent his national security adviser and a wider Nigerian delegation to Washington to meet with Trump administration officials and U.S. lawmakers, the Reuters news agency reported Friday.",
      "The White House is considering sanctions and Pentagon engagement on counterterrorism as part of a plan to place pressure on Abuja to better protect Christian communities and religious freedom, a senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters Thursday.",
      "No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks in Niger and Kebbi states, but analysts and locals say gangs often target schools, travelers and remote villagers in kidnappings for ransom. Authorities say the gunmen are mostly former herders who have taken up arms against farming communities after clashes between them over strained resources.",
      "Abductions have come to define the insecurity prevailing in Africa's most populous nation and the painful consequences.",
      "At least 1,500 students have been abducted in the region since Boko Haram jihadi extremists seized 276 Chibok schoolgirls more than a decade ago. But bandits are also active in the region, and analysts say gangs often target schools to gain attention.",
      "Analysts and residents blame the insecurity on a failure to prosecute known attackers and the rampant corruption that limits weapons supplies to security forces while ensuring a steady supply to the gangs.",
      "A satellite view shows the school compound, rectangular in shape, surrounded by a wall and attached to an adjoining primary school, with over 50 classroom and dormitory buildings. It is located on the outskirts of the town of Aguara, near the main Yelwa-Mokwa road.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 09:16:39 -0500",
    "summary": "When researchers carefully lifted the lid, they uncovered a complete skeleton surrounded by dozens of artifacts.",
    "story": [
      "A remarkably well-preserved Roman sarcophagus has been unearthed in Hungary's capital, offering a rare window into the life of the young woman inside and the world she inhabited around 1,700 years ago.",
      "The sarcophagus was untouched by looters and sealed for centuries. It was found with its stone lid fixed in place, secured by metal clamps and molten lead. When researchers carefully lifted the lid, they uncovered a complete skeleton surrounded by dozens of artifacts.",
      "\"The peculiarity of the finding is that it was a hermetically sealed sarcophagus. It was not disturbed previously, so it was intact,\" said Gabriella F\u00e9nyes, the excavation's lead archaeologist.",
      "Archaeologists with the Budapest History Museum discovered the limestone coffin during a large-scale excavation in \u00d3buda, a northern district of the city that once formed part of Aquincum, a bustling Roman settlement on the Danube frontier.",
      "The coffin lay among the ruins of abandoned houses in a quarter of Aquincum vacated in the 3rd century and later repurposed as a burial ground. Nearby, researchers uncovered a Roman aqueduct and eight simpler graves, but none approaching the richness or pristine condition of the sealed tomb.",
      "Keeping with Roman funerary customs, the sarcophagus held an array of objects: two completely intact glass vessels, bronze figures and 140 coins. A bone hair pin, a piece of amber jewelry and traces of gold-threaded fabric, along with the size of the skeleton, point to the grave belonging to a young woman.",
      "The objects, F\u00e9nyes said, were \"items given to the deceased by her relatives for her eternal journey.\"",
      "\"The deceased was buried very carefully by her relatives. They must have really loved who they buried here,\" she said.",
      "Anthropologists are now examining the young woman's remains, which is expected to reveal more about her age, health and origins. But even now, the grave's placement and abundance of artifacts offer strong clues.",
      "The sarcophagus and its contents \"definitely make it stand out,\" said Gergely Kosty\u00e1l, a Roman-period specialist and coleader of the project. \"This probably means that the deceased was well-to-do or of a higher social status.\"",
      "\"It is truly rare to find a sarcophagus like this, untouched and never used before, because in the fourth century it was common to reuse earlier sarcophagi,\" he added. \"It is quite clear that this sarcophagus was made specifically for the deceased.\"",
      "Excavators also removed a layer of mud roughly 4 centimeters, or 1.5 inches, thick from inside the coffin that F\u00e9nyes hoped could contain more treasures.",
      "Pictures showed golden jewelry found at the site, as well as a glass flask, a glass jar and other intact items after they were collected. Images also showed archaeologists examining the skull of the woman, alongside other remains. Other pictures showed workers lifting the lid of the sarcophagus using heavy machinery, after securing it.",
      "For F\u00e9nyes, the discovery of the Roman sarcophagus is not only of scientific significance, but an emotionally resonant insight into the devotion displayed by people in an ancient time.",
      "\"I was very touched by the care and expression of love that we were able to get a glimpse of,\" she said. \"Even now, I shudder to think how painful it must have been for the people at that time to bury this young lady.\"",

      "A cannon, three coins and a porcelain cup were among the first objects Colombian scientists recovered from the depths of the Caribbean Sea where the mythical Spanish galleon San Jos\u00e9 sank in 1708 after being attacked by an English fleet, authorities said Thursday.",
      "The recovery is part of a scientific investigation that the government authorized last year to study the wreckage and the causes of the sinking. Colombian researchers located the galleon in 2015, leading to legal and diplomatic disputes. Its exact location is a state secret.",
      "Dubbed the \"holy grail of shipwrecks,\" the ship is believed to hold 11 million gold and silver coins, emeralds and other precious cargo from Spanish-controlled colonies, which could be worth billions of dollars if ever recovered.",
      "President Gustavo Petro's government has said that the purpose of the deep-water expedition is research and not the treasure's seizure.",
      "Colombia's culture ministry said in a statement Thursday that the cannon, coins and porcelain cup will undergo a conservation process at a lab dedicated to the expedition.",
      "The wreckage is almost 2,000 feet deep in the sea.",
      "\"This historic event demonstrates the strengthening of the Colombian State's technical, professional, and technological capabilities to protect and promote Underwater Cultural Heritage, as part of Colombian identity and history,\" Yannai Kadamani Fonrodona, Minister of Cultures, Arts, and Knowledge, said in a statement.",
      "The ship has been the subject of a legal battle in the United States, Colombia and Spain over who owns the rights to the sunken treasure.",
      "Colombia is in arbitration litigation with Sea Search Armada, a group of U.S. investors, for the economic rights of the San Jos\u00e9. The firm claims $10 billion corresponding to what they assume is worth 50% of the galleon treasure that they claim to have discovered in 1982.",
      "Earlier this year, researchers analyzed intricately designed gold coins found near the\u00a0wreck, confirming they are indeed from the iconic San Jose. The coins feature depictions of castles, lions and crosses on the front and the \"Crowned Pillars of Hercules\" above ocean waves on the back, according to a new study published in the journal\u00a0Antiquity.",
      "In 2024, Colombian authorities said one remotely operated vehicle surveyed the wreck, uncovering\u00a0numerous artifacts, including an anchor, jugs and glass bottles.",
      "The Colombian government announced last year it would begin extractions from the ship off its Caribbean coast, using multiple remotely operated vehicles. The ship's exact location has been kept secret to protect the storied wreck from potential treasure hunters.",
      "Since its discovery, multiple parties have laid claim to the shipwreck, including Colombia, Spain and Indigenous Qhara Qhara Bolivians who claim the treasures on board were stolen from them. The wreck has also been claimed by U.S.-based salvage company Sea Search Armada, which says it first discovered the wreck more than 40 years ago.",
      "The cause of the San Jose's sinking has also been debated. British documents indicate that the ship did not explode,\u00a0according to Colombia's government, but Spanish reports suggest the ship was blown up in battle.",
      "Either way, the ship \u2014 laden with chests of emeralds and about 200 tons of gold \u2014 sank with most of its crew while heading back from the New World to Spain on June 7, 1708.",
      "Among the artifacts spotted by deep-sea cameras so far are an anchor and cargo such as jugs and glass bottles, cast iron cannons, porcelain pieces, pottery and objects apparently made of gold.",
      "Investigators also recovered samples of the sediment accumulated in the ship over the years, which will be analyzed to \"better understand the causes of the shipwreck,\" said Alhena Caicedo, director of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History (ICANH).",
      "In May 2024, Colombia\u00a0declared the site\u00a0of the shipwreck a \"protected archeological area.\"",

      "A CBS News crew on Thursday was flown out by helicopter with the Italian military to HMS Prince of Wales, a British aircraft carrier deployed in the Mediterranean Sea, where there are 26 American-made F-35 fighter jets.",
      "The military exercise, Neptune Strike, brings the U.S. together with nine of its allies \u2014 including the United Kingdom, Greece, Poland and Turkey \u2014 practicing long-range strikes on NATO's eastern flank, hitting training grounds close to Russia.",
      "The focus of the exercise is to defend critical waterways like the Mediterranean, which connects Europe with Africa and the Middle East, and carries about 30% of the world's oil traffic, according to the United Nations.",
      "The exercise comes as Russia tests the U.S.-led alliance with frequent incursions into NATO airspace using drones and fighter jets.",
      "\"I see those activities as intended to stress the alliance,\" Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, head of U.S. European Command and NATO Supreme Allied commander Europe, told CBS News.",
      "Grynkewich, a four-star general in charge of about 80,000 U.S. troops, has said that NATO needs to be prepared to fight concurrent conflicts with Russia and China by 2027.",
      "\"Of course, we don't hope for that outcome, but you want to be ready for any contingency,\" Grynkewich told CBS News, adding that war with one or both of the two superpowers is \"absolutely not\" inevitable.",
      "\"Our main goal is to deter that conflict from ever happening,\" Grynkewich said.",
      "While the U.S. has taken part in previous iterations of the military exercise, this year's U.S. footprint was smaller as allied nations are pressed by the Trump administration to put more into European defense. Going back to his first term, Mr. Trump has repeatedly pushed for NATO members to boost their defense spending to at least 5% of their respective GDPs.",
      "The Pentagon also announced last month that it was reducing the number of U.S. troops deployed in Eastern Europe.",
      "That said, B-52s from the U.S. Air Force's Bomber Task Force were deployed for this year's exercise.",
      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has drawn it into a military quagmire, costing hundreds of thousands of lives.",
      "\"The war in Ukraine has taught us that now, more than ever, the NATO alliance is incredibly important,\" said Lt. Col. Mike Carty, a British fighter pilot and squadron commander in the Royal Air Force.",
      "Carty said NATO is watching and learning from what is happening in Ukraine.",
      "\"An element of that was designed to destabilize Europe, and destabilize NATO,\" Carty said of Russia's invasion.",
      "But Carty argues that the attack \"has had the opposite effect.\"",
      "Grynkewich told CBS News that NATO is ready to fight a war today if it has to, but that readiness is the best deterrent for any adversary.",

    "story": [
      "A 1940 self-portrait by famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo sold Thursday for $54.7 million at a New York art auction, becoming the top sale price for a work by any female artist.",
      "The painting of Kahlo asleep in a bed \u2014 titled \"El sue\u00f1o (La cama)\" or in English, \"The Dream (The Bed)\" \u2014 surpassed the record held by Georgia O'Keeffe's \"Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1,\" which sold for $44.4 million in 2014.",
      "The sale at Sotheby's also topped Kahlo's own auction record for a work by a Latin American artist. The 1949 painting \"Diego and I,\" depicting the artist and her husband, muralist Diego Rivera, went for $34.9 million in 2021. Her paintings are reported to have sold privately for even more.",
      "Thursday's auction for the painting drew bids from two collectors over 5 minutes before selling \u2014 at more than 1,000 times the price it sold for 45 years ago, according to Sotheby's.",
      "\"When this painting sold at Sotheby's in 1980 for $51,000, few could have imagined it returning 45 years later to command $55 million. This record-breaking result shows just how far we have come, not only in our appreciation of Frida Kahlo's genius, but in the recognition of women artists at the very highest level of the market,\" Anna Di Stasi, head of Latin American art at Sotheby's, said in a news release. \"In El sue\u00f1o, Kahlo confronts her own fragility, yet what emerges is a portrait of extraordinary resilience and strength. It is an enduring testament to one of the most admired and sought-after artists of our time.\"",
      "The self-portrait is among the few Kahlo pieces that have remained in private hands outside Mexico, where her body of work has been declared an artistic monument. Her works in both public and private collections within the country cannot be sold abroad or destroyed.",
      "The painting comes from a private collection, whose owner has not been disclosed, and is legally eligible for international sale. Some art historians have scrutinized the sale for cultural reasons, while others have raised concern that the painting \u2014 last exhibited publicly in the late 1990s \u2014 could again disappear from public view after the auction. It has already been requested for upcoming exhibitions in cities including New York, London and Brussels.",
      "The buyer's identity was not disclosed.",
      "The piece depicts Kahlo asleep in a wooden, colonial-style bed that floats in the clouds. She is draped in a golden blanket and entangled in crawling vines and leaves. Above the bed lies a skeleton figure wrapped in dynamite.",
      "Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.",
      "During the years Kahlo was confined to her bed, she came to view it as a bridge between worlds as she explored her mortality.",
      "The painting was the star of a sale of more than 100 surrealist works by artists including Salvador Dal\u00ed, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning.",
      "Kahlo resisted being labeled a surrealist, a style of art that's dreamlike and centers on a fascination with the unconscious mind.",
      "\"I never painted dreams,\" she once said. \"I painted my own reality.\"",
      "In its catalog note, Sotheby's said the painting \"offers a spectral meditation on the porous boundary between sleep and death.\"",
      "\"The suspended skeleton is often interpreted as a visualization of her anxiety about dying in her sleep, a fear all too plausible for an artist whose daily existence was shaped by chronic pain and past trauma,\" the catalog notes.",

    "summary": "Kyiv said it plans to \"work on points of the plan.\" it received from the U.S. that's aimed at restarting diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has received a draft plan aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, his office confirmed Thursday.",
      "It said in a statement that he had \"officially received a draft plan from the American side, which, according to the American side, could activate diplomacy.\" The statement went on to say \"it was agreed to work on the points of the plan in such a way as to bring the war to a dignified end.\"",
      "A senior White House official confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that President Trump was backing a 28-point plan drafted by envoy Steve Witkoff and an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war Russia started nearly four years ago with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it's not clear whether this plan is the one that Zelenskyy received.",
      "The plan, according to reports by Axios, the Financial Times and the New York Times, calls for Ukraine to abandon territory, give up some weapons and shrink its army, and while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the war must end, he reiterated that from Kyiv's perspective, \"there can be no reward for waging war.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's endorsement of the plan was first reported by NBC.",
      "Previously, Ukraine has agreed with the U.S. to a freezing of the battle lines where they stand as a starting point for negotiations, while also making clear that it needs security guarantees from Washington and its Western partners.",
      "Axios, citing a U.S. official, reported Monday that Witkoff was drafting a 28-point peace plan and had \"discussed it extensively\" with Kirill Dmitriev, an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Dmitriev said in an interview with Axios that he met with Witkoff and other Trump officials for three days in Miami in late October. He expressed optimism about the proposal, saying, \"We feel the Russian position is really being heard.\"",
      "Just days after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas in October, Dmitriev traveled to the U.S. to hold previously scheduled talks with Witkoff in an effort to continue to make progress on a proposal to end the war, as a senior U.S. official described it at the time.",
      "Dmitriev is under U.S. sanctions, which had to be waived for him to travel to Florida to meet with Witkoff.",
      "The White House official who spoke with CBS News on Thursday said Witkoff had been working on a proposal quietly for about a month, and said that he consulted with both the Russians and Ukrainians to take their feedback into account. The extent of those consultations with Ukraine was not clear from Kyiv's statement Thursday, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the same day that Witkoff and Rubio \"met with some of the Ukrainians just in the past week to discuss this very plan.\"",
      "Senior Ukrainian official Rustem Umerov was verbally briefed in Miami this week by Witkoff, a source familiar with the conversation told CBS News.",
      "Top European Union official Kaja Kallas, when asked Thursday if Europeans were involved in the process, responded, \"Not that I know of.\" She also reiterated a point that's consistently been made by Ukraine and its supporters that \"for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.\"",
      "Witkoff and Dmitriev have been talking for weeks about a proposal to end the war, gaming out ideas even as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury chief Scott Bessent criticized Russia, saying Moscow was not serious about ending the war.",
      "\"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X Wednesday. \"And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told CBS News Wednesday that he didn't have any announcements to share about a peace plan, but said it was an issue \"the president has continued to put at the forefront of our foreign policy goal.\"",
      "The recent U.S. sanctions appear to be taking a toll on Russia \u2014 a Treasury Department analysis Thursday indicates that the oil sanctions have sent prices there tumbling, choking off a key revenue source that Russia has used to fund its war in Ukraine. The U.S. gas sanctions against Russia go into effect Friday.",
      "Amid the U.S. diplomatic efforts \u2014 which include a visit to Kyiv this week by a delegation led by the U.S. Army secretary \u2014 Russian missiles have continued to pummel Ukraine.",
      "Rescuers were still searching on Thursday for victims of a devastating Russian strike on an apartment building in the western city of Ternopil that killed at least 26 people, including three children, according to Ukrainian authorities.",
      "Shrieking Russian missiles slammed into the building on Wednesday, burning at least 19 people to death in the apartments.",

      "Justice Department officials allege that the four conspired to illegally export advanced Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, to China through Malaysia and Thailand.",

      "They allegedly received nearly $4 million from China to help finance the export scheme, the department said.",
      "Some 400 Nvidia A100 GPUs were exported to China between October 2024 and January 2025 in two shipments, the department said, and two other shipments were \"disrupted by law enforcement and therefore not completed.\"",
      "The Justice Department said that despite knowing licenses were required to export the items to China, none of the defendants sought or obtained a license for any of the exports.",
      "The Justice Department said China is seeking cutting-edge U.S. technology to further its goal of becoming the world leader in AI by 2030.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/peru-shark-fins-seized-major-wildlife-trafficking-bust/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The bust, in the port outside of Peru's capital, Lima, led to the arrest of three men tied to a transnational criminal network involved in illegal fishing and wildlife smuggling, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. authorities have assisted the Peruvian government in seizing an estimated 10,000 individual shark fins destined for China \u2014 one of the largest wildlife trafficking operations in Latin American history.",
      "The bust, on Nov. 10 at an industrial port outside of Lima, led to the arrest of three men tied to a transnational criminal network involved in illegal fishing and wildlife smuggling, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "The cruelty behind the shark fin trade is well-documented. Shark finning often involves slicing fins off live sharks and discarding the mutilated animals back into the ocean, where they die from blood loss, suffocation or predation. The practice is banned in many countries but persists due to weak enforcement and high profits.",
      "Shark fins are prized in Chinese cuisine, particularly for shark fin soup, which is associated with status and celebration, according to the nonprofit Shark Stewards. It's a dish that can sell for $100 a bowl and continues to drive a lucrative black market.",
      "Despite growing awareness and some regulatory crackdowns, the global demand for shark fins remains strong. The United Nations estimates the illegal wildlife trade generates up to\u00a0$20 billion annually, rivaling the drug and arms trades in scale and sophistication.",
      "\"The billion-dollar fin and meat trade is driving the extinction of iconic shark and ray species. Now, more than ever, critical action must be taken before it's too late,\" Luke Warwick, director of Shark and Ray Conservation for the Wildlife Conservation Society, told CBS News.",
      "The operation was led by Peru's Organized Crime Investigation Division of the Environmental. The fins, valued at more than $11.2 million, were sourced from threatened species including blue sharks, pelagic thresher sharks and common thresher sharks.",
      "Authorities say the criminal network purchased fins from Ecuadorian fishermen and laundered them through falsified documents claiming the catch originated in Peruvian waters. Once dried and stored in Callao, Peru, outside Lima, the fins were prepared for export to China.",
      "\"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in close partnership with the Peruvian National Police, is taking decisive action to dismantle the illegal shark fin trade. Together, we are committed to protecting sharks, and preserving the health of our oceans, for future generations,\" Doug Ault, assistant director of the office of\u00a0law enforcement at the USFWS, told CBS News.",
      "Sharks play a critical role in maintaining healthy marine ecosystems. As apex predators, their decline can trigger cascading effects, including the collapse of coral reefs and fisheries. Many shark species reproduce slowly, making them especially vulnerable to overexploitation.",
      "While the bust marks a significant victory for law enforcement, it also highlights the scale of the challenge. The black market for wildlife products continues to thrive, driven by international demand, corruption and limited oversight, according to the\u00a0U.N.\u00a0For now, the 9.3 tons of fins seized in Peru represent a stark reminder of the global cost of environmental crime.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:54:37 -0500",
    "summary": "A web of undersea cables connects our lives and our global economy. As U.S. adversaries are accused of sabotage, they're proving to be targets of choice.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Over 95% percent of the world's internet traffic and voice and communication data flows through a vast network of fiber optic cables laid across the floors of oceans and seas. The cables are faster, more reliable and cheaper data carriers than alternatives such as satellites, and they have become indispensable to modern life.",
      "They are the veins and arteries that link our deeply interconnected world, transmitting data for everything from sensitive government and military information and text messages between friends, to trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions every day, underpinning the global economy.",
      "But our reliance on these undersea cables is a vulnerability, and one that rogue actors have allegedly already tried to exploit, including some adversaries of the United States.",
      "Russia has been accused recently by America's NATO allies of increasing \"hybrid warfare\" against Europe, and analysts say it has shown a clear interest in targeting things like undersea infrastructure.",
      "\"That's quite explicitly a part of Russian thinking regarding modern warfare,\" said Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, in an interview with CBS News earlier this year.",
      "He said that sabotaging \"critical nodes on which society functions\u2026 [has been] illustrated in real time in the last few years.\"",
      "Since President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has regularly conducted military strikes against Ukrainian energy and transport facilities. But beyond the battlefield, Russia has also been accused of targeting the infrastructure \u2014 including undersea cables \u2014 that's vital to other countries, including many of the United States' NATO allies.",
      "\"The sabotage events, they are a new phenomenon,\" Gabrielius Landsbergis, the former foreign minister of Lithuania, told CBS News. \"They are directly associated with this later stage of Russia's militarization and aggressive action \u2014 not just against Ukraine, but also against the West.\"",
      "Russia has denied allegations of interfering with undersea cables and called accusations it has carried out acts of sabotage in Europe \"Russophobia.\"",
      "What is happening in the Baltic Sea?",
      "The Baltic Sea is a nearly enclosed body of water surrounded by eight NATO countries and Russia.",
      "Relatively few undersea cables connect some of the Baltic NATO members, such as Lithuania, to the rest of Europe and the wider world.",
      "\"Baltic states are, you know, not entirely an island, but pretty much so,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"That means that for us [Baltic states] to connect to the Western infrastructure, it's a rather difficult task. So most of our connections, a big part of our connections, go through the Baltic Sea.\"",
      "The Baltic Sea is relatively shallow, meaning ships only need to drag their anchors along the bottom to cause potentially serious damage to cables. That increases the possibility of accidental damage, but also lends plausible deniability to malign actors who would like to carry out sabotage operations there.",
      "And Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of vessels, with hazy registration and insurance documentation that allows it to continue transporting oil and other energy products around the world despite Western sanctions imposed over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has increased its plausible deniability.",
      "When Finland and Sweden joined NATO, many in the West hoped the Baltic Sea would effectively become a \"NATO lake.\" Over the last few years, there have been several incidents of alleged Russian sabotage of underwater cables in the sea.",
      "\"It is clearly a spike,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"We have never seen almost any incidents during the last, I don't know, 20 years, and suddenly after [Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine] started, they're basically recurring every month.\"",
      "Targeting the \"anthropogenic shell of modern society\"",
      "RUSI's Kaushal said the apparent sabotage operations in the Baltic are an example of the hybrid warfare tactics being increasingly adopted by U.S. adversaries.",
      "\"Ever since the 90's and early 2000's, the Russians have talked about how the so-called anthropogenic shell of modern society \u2014 basically the fragile infrastructure on which it depends \u2014 is its Achilles heel,\" he told CBS News earlier this year. \"Attacks on undersea cables are one major part of that, along with missile attacks (like on infrastructure in Ukraine) and cyberattacks.\"",
      "Landsbergis told CBS News that he believes Russia's objective in disrupting undersea cables is to intimidate local populations, as well as to \"test the reactions \u2014 you know, how do politicians react? How do militaries react? Whether there is a response or not.\"",
      "With the Trump administration pushing hard for its European NATO allies to rely less on the U.S. for their security, \"it's not the question about how we see NATO, but it's the question how Putin sees NATO,\" Landsbergis told CBS News.",
      "He said without a firm, unified response to the sabotage, Putin could determine \"NATO is not the alliance that it has been before Trump,\" and that could lead the Russian autocrat to \"say, OK, maybe this is the time that I intend to test it.\"",
      "What is NATO doing about it?",
      "At the start of this year, NATO launched \"Baltic Sentry,\" a new operation \"to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure.\"",
      "\"By working together with all Allies, we will do what it takes to ensure the safety and security not only of our critical infrastructure but of all that we hold dear,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a statement announcing Baltic Sentry in January.",
      "The operation involves maritime patrols, aircraft and naval drones, as well as national surveillance assets, according to NATO. The Alliance said it would also work with industry to improve the resilience of undersea cables.",
      "Sweden, another country that shares a Baltic coastline with Russia, broke with its centuries-old policy of military non-alignment and became NATO's newest member last year, in direct response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "It staged military exercises earlier this month to practice countering covert espionage and sabotage missions carried out by adversaries in the Baltic Sea.",
      "\"We're not at peace, but not at war,\" Swedish submarine flotilla Commander Paula Wallenburg told CBS News during the exercise.",
      "Wallenburg said the current circumstances look \"pretty close to\" those seen during the Cold War, when the nuclear-armed U.S. and then-Soviet Union tested each other's resolve in a face off that never quite turned into a full-scale military conflict.",
      "\"It's a very serious situation when it comes to security here in this area,\" she said.",
      "Below is a look at some recent incidents in the Baltic Sea in which Russia-linked vessels have been alleged to have been involved in damaging, or seen loitering around, undersea cables.",
      "Case study: Eagle S",
      "On Christmas Day 2024, an electricity cable and four telecommunications cables linking Finland and Estonia suffered unplanned outages, reducing the two countries' interconnectivity. Finland's National Bureau of Investigation later discovered a 60-mile drag mark near the Estlink 2 cable.",
      "The Eagle S, a crude oil tanker sailing under the flag of the Cook Islands and officially registered to a UAE company, left Russia's Baltic port of Ust-Luga on the morning of the outages, with its destination listed as Turkey, according to ship tracking data from MarineTraffic.",
      "The ship sailed over one of the Estlink submarine cables in the Gulf of Finland around the time a power failure was reported by the country's electric grid operators.",
      "The ship's anchor was later discovered near the point where the drag mark ended.",
      "Finnish border guards detained the ship and its crew, led by a Georgian national.",
      "The Eagle S was released to international waters in March, but Finland pursued criminal charges against the crew. The case was dismissed in October, when the court ruled prosecutors had failed to prove intent, but prosecutors said they would appeal.",
      "Case study: Two Russian trawlers tracked in area when Svalbard cable cut",
      "In February 2022, Norwegian police told local media they believed \"human impact\" was to blame for damage to one of a pair of undersea telecommunications cables connecting the country's mainland with its northern archipelago of Svalbard a month earlier.",
      "Space Norway, which operates the Svalbard Undersea Cable System, told CBS News the two cables \u2014 which were laid as a redundant pair in the event one suffered damage \u2014 are the world's northernmost subsea cable systems.",
      "Space Norway said it detected an outage in the Greenland Sea on Jan, 7.",
      "The damage occurred in an area where the cables descend steeply from a depth of 980 feet to nearly 9,000 feet, the operator told CBS News.",
      "Generally, the cables are buried approximately six feet deep, although there may be variations due to the nature of the seabed, the state-owned company explained, while declining to go into detail about the seabed conditions where the damaged cables were buried.",
      "There was never a loss of service for users in Svalbard, a Space Norway spokesperson said, and the investigation into the cut was eventually closed due to a lack of evidence.",
      "But a report from Norway's public broadcaster NRK and open-source information showed Russian fishing trawlers made more than a dozen passes over the area before the damage occurred.",
      "Other evidence of \"hybrid warfare\"",
      "This week, Poland's top diplomat accused Russia of carrying out an \"act of state terror\" by blowing up a railway line over the weekend.",
      "\"It was an act of not only subversion, as happened before, but an act of state terror as its clear intention was to cause human casualties,\" Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski said.",
      "Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said two Ukrainian citizens believed to have been working with Russia's secret services were suspected of carrying out the attack, which he called an \"unprecedented act of sabotage.\"",
      "The explosion took place on a rail line linking the Polish capital, Warsaw, to Ukraine, and Polish officials said it was used to transport aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia dismissed allegations that it was involved in the explosion, calling them \"Russophobia.\"",
      "\"The latest sabotage in Poland that could have become a mass casualty event brings even more heightened dimension to the debate,\" Landsbergis told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"Imagine if there would be 100 casualties \u2014 would we be still talking about hybrid? Or we would drop the hybrid and just call it war and ask for Article 5?\" Landsbergis said, referring to the mutual-defense agreement among NATO members. \"The question points to a fact that Russians are pushing the escalation lines even further, forcing us to ask ourselves: Aren't we at war already?\"",
      "The incident came amid a spate of airspace violations, including some near airports and military bases, in Western European nations, usually involving unidentified drones, but also, in at least two instances, Russian warplanes.",
      "Holly  Williams\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",
      "In addition to surviving the 9-month period, the spores could still germinate after the experiment ended and scientists returned them back down to Earth, according to the study.",

    "story": [
      "A Russian sailor died and two others were being treated for suspected poisoning on Wednesday following a toxic leak inside a tanker just off Istanbul, local authorities said.",
      "Officials were alerted to the emergency aboard the Panama-flagged tanker \"Swanlake\" at 5:30 pm when the vessel was several miles from Istanbul's Asian coastline, the governor's office said in a statement.",
      "\"The incident is believed to have been caused by a leak in the vessel's cold tank. One crew member died and two others were poisoned and are under observation,\" it said.",
      "A cold tank is a refrigerated storage section inside a tanker, which is normally heavily insulated. It was not clear what this particular vessel was carrying.",
      "\"Efforts are under way to evacuate the 10 crew members and two injured individuals on board the ship,\" it added.",
      "The sailor's death came on the same day that local Turkish media reported that a forensic report into the deaths of four members of a Turkish-German family on holiday in Istanbul revealed they were likely exposed to chemicals.",
      "The family, who traveled from Germany to Turkey's largest city for a vacation, fell ill last week after eating several popular street food dishes in the waterside neighborhood of Ortakoy, at the foot of a bridge spanning the Bosphorus.",
      "Turkish prosecutors launched an investigation initially focusing on suspected food poisoning.",
      "Eleven people have been detained in connection with the incident.",
      "Quoting investigators,\u00a0Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper said\u00a0a substance was sprayed in a room on the ground floor of the hotel to combat a bed bug infestation, which may have reached the family's room on the first floor through a bathroom vent. Police collected samples from sheets, pillows, water bottles and blankets before sealing the building, the newspaper reported.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 08:57:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers recorded a record-breaking wind gust as Hurricane Melissa lashed the Caribbean in late October.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa's wind gusts reached a record-breaking speed shortly before the storm made landfall in the Caribbean last month, according to data recorded during the deadly event.",
      "The data was collected when a NOAA Hurricane Hunter airplane dropped a fleet of weather instruments into the raging storm, according to a news release from the U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research. The devices, called dropsondes, have small parachutes attached and between two and four readings per second before falling into the ocean.",
      "Dropsondes are the only devices that can record information on pressure, temperature, humidity and wind at once. The data is used in forecasts and weather warnings, including emergency alerts.",
      "\"When you're looking at a category 4 or 5 hurricane, you're not going to have an airplane flying that close to the surface \u2013 that would be totally unsafe \u2013 but you need to know what is happening near sea level because that's where people and property are most affected,\" said NSF NCAR engineer Terry Hock, who manages the Dropsonde program, in the news release. \"The dropsonde gets you information you can't get any other way and that's why it's been around for decades.\"",
      "One dropsonde used during Hurricane Melissa clocked a wind gust of 252 miles per hour shortly before falling into the ocean.",
      "NOAA researchers contacted the NSF NCAR to confirm that it was the highest wind speed ever recorded by a dropsonde.",
      "\"NOAA looped us in when they saw the high wind speed and asked, 'Are these numbers any good?'\" said Holger V\u00f6mel, an NSF NCAR senior scientist who works with the organization's Dropsonde Program.",
      "To verify the data, V\u00f6mel and other researchers reviewed the numbers with a quality control software. They also confirmed that the reported 252 mile wind gust would have been physically possible, and that it tracked with the hurricane's behavior, as well as previous storm patterns. The review confirmed that the wind gust measurement was accurate.",
      "The previous fastest wind gust recorded by a dropsonde was in 2010, when Typhoon Megi unleashed a 248 mile per hour blast while over the western Pacific Ocean. During Hurricane Katrina, researchers thought they had recorded an even stronger gust, but the data had substantial issues, the NSF NCAR said.",
      "\"They have pilots and researchers literally putting their lives on the line to get these measurements. They're the heroes, and it's a privilege we get to play a role in making sure the measurements they acquire are accurate,\" V\u00f6mel said.",
      "Hurricane Melissa inflicted catastrophic damage in the Caribbean in late October. It made landfall in Jamaica as a Category 5 storm before progressing towards Cuba, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Dozens of people, mostly in Jamaica and Haiti, were killed in the storm.",

    "summary": "As Australia's world-first ban on under-16s using social media looms, Meta becomes the first big tech firm to warn young users to save their info and sign off.",
    "story": [
      "Melbourne, Australia\u00a0\u2014 Technology giant Meta on Thursday began sending thousands of young Australians a two-week warning to downland their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram and Threads before a world-first social media ban on accounts of children younger than 16 takes effect.",
      "The Australian government announced two weeks ago that the three Meta platforms plus Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders younger than 16, beginning Dec. 10.",
      "California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4.",
      "\"We will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta said young users could also use the notice period to update their contact information \"so we can get in touch and help them regain access once they turn 16.\"",
      "Meta has estimated there are 350,000 Australians aged 13-to-15 on Instagram and 150,000 in that age bracket on Facebook. Australia's population is 28 million.",
      "Account holders 16-years-old and older who were mistakenly given notice that they would be excluded can contact Yoti Age Verification and verify their age by providing government-issued identity documents or a \"video selfie,\" Meta said.",
      "Terry Flew, co-director of Sydney University's Center for AI, Trust and Governance, said such facial-recognition technology had a failure rate of at least 5%.",
      "\"In the absence of a government-mandated ID system, we're always looking at second-best solutions around these things,\" Flew told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "The government has warned platforms that demanding that all account holders prove they are older than 15 would be an unreasonable response to the new age restrictions. The government maintains the platforms already had sufficient data about many account holders to ascertain they were not young children.",
      "Social media companies will face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars (about $33 million) if they are found to be failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Meta's vice president and global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said she would prefer that app stores including Apple App Store and Google Play collect the age information when a user signs up and verifies they are at least 16 years old for app operators such as Facebook and Instagram.",
      "\"We believe a better approach is required: a standard, more accurate, and privacy-preserving system, such as OS/app store-level age verification,\" Davis said in a statement.",
      "\"This combined with our investments in ongoing efforts to assure age \u2026 offers a more comprehensive protection for young people online,\" she added.",
      "Dany Elachi, founder of the parents' group Heaps Up Alliance that lobbied for the social media age restriction, said parents should start helping their children plan on how they will spend the hours currently absorbed by social media.",
      "He was critical of the government's only announcing on the complete list of platforms that will become age-restricted on Nov. 5.",
      "\"There are aspects of the legislation that we're not entirely supportive of, but the principle that children under the age of 16 are better off in the real world, that's something we advocated for and are in favor of,\" Elachi said. \"When everybody misses out, nobody misses out. That's the theory. Certainly we expect that it would play out that way. We hope parents are going to be very positive about this and try to help their children see all the potential possibilities that are now open to them.\"",
      "There was significant resistance to the legislation last year, however, including from some children's advocacy groups.",
      "Mat Tinkler, CEO of Save the Children Australia, said\u00a0in a statement\u00a0a year ago, when the ban was approved by Australian lawmakers, that while he welcomed the government's efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than a blanket ban.",
      "He said the government should \"instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits.\"",
      "The\u00a0Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, also expressed \"serious reservations\" over the law before it was approved, saying last year that there were \"less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies.\"",

      "\"The defendant stands accused of running a global enterprise that pumped massive quantities of cocaine, fentanyl, and methamphetamine into our communities and laundered millions in narcotics proceeds,\" U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement. \"His return to the United States is a major step in dismantling a network that has fueled addiction, violence, and death.\"",
      "Zhang's criminal organization operated out of Mexico going back at least to 2016 and laundered its drug proceeds through shell companies created in the U.S. using false social security numbers and other fraudulent documents, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "Officials identified more than 100 shell companies tied to Zhang's organization that were used to launder at least $77 million in narcotics proceeds, they said.",
      "Mexican authorities captured Zhang in Mexico City in October 2024 at the request of the U.S. government, but a judge granted him house arrest and he escaped the home where he was being held under military guard.

      "NASA released close-up images on Wednesday of the rare interstellar comet that's making a single pass through the solar system.",
      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun.

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he will designate Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally, marking a step up in defense ties between the United States and the Gulf monarchy.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the move at a black-tie dinner at the White House in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders signed a new strategic defense deal earlier in the day, and Mr. Trump said Monday the U.S. will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The designation could open the door to further collaboration between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. military, including easier access to U.S.-made military equipment. It's also a symbolic move: Mr. Trump said in brief remarks Tuesday evening that it would take \"our military cooperation to even greater heights.\"",
      "There are currently 20 major non-NATO allies, including other Middle Eastern countries like Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.",
      "\"A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries, and it will serve the highest interests of peace,\" Mr. Trump said during Tuesday's dinner.",
      "The U.S.'s close relationship with Saudi Arabia dates back eight decades, bookended by a meeting between King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud and former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser in 1945. The two countries have long cooperated on defense, and in recent decades, they have been bound together in part by a mutual rivalry with Iran.",
      "During Tuesday's meetings \u2014 marked by elaborate White House ceremonies and a military flyover \u2014 Mr. Trump pressed for even further military and economic cooperation with the Gulf state. The White House said\u00a0Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will buy hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and will partner with the U.S. on artificial intelligence and civil nuclear issues, while bin Salman pledged to invest nearly $1 trillion in the U.S., up from $600 billion.",
      "Members of Mr. Trump's family also have some business interests in the country. Mr. Trump insisted earlier Tuesday he has \"nothing to do\" with those deals, and \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "Still unclear is whether Saudi Arabia will sign onto the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic deals brokered by Mr. Trump between Israel and majority-Muslim states like the United Arab Emirates. Most of those agreements were inked during the president's first term, and Mr. Trump told \"60 Minutes\" he believes Saudi Arabia will also join.",
      "During an Oval Office event earlier Tuesday, bin Salman told reporters he wants to join the accords but needs to see a path toward a Palestinian state. Mr. Trump added that the two leaders \"had a very good talk on the Abraham Accords.\"",
      "But Saudi Arabia's human rights record makes it a controversial U.S. partner. American intelligence agencies concluded in 2021 that bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who regularly criticized the country's regime in the pages of The Washington Post.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday he believes bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing, and called Khashoggi \"extremely controversial.\" Bin Salman said it was \"really painful to hear\" about the killing.",

      "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the major questions surrounding the government shutdown on 'The Big Weekend Show.'",
      "It\u2019s not going to get any better.",
      "The government closed down for a record 43 days this fall. And if you thought you\u2019d seen the worst of Congress, it truly won\u2019t get any better when the majority of the federal government could shut down in the wee hours of January 31st.",
      "That\u2019s right. Lawmakers have yet to address the very issues which sparked this year\u2019s astonishing shutdown. Some of those are legislative. Some are policy related. And the biggest problems are political.",
      "Frankly, the political ones may be the most challenging.",

      "A view of the U.S. Capitol Building at sunset on Jan. 30, 2025\u00a0 (Emma Woodhead/Fox News Digital)",
      "Included in the interim bill to reopen the government were three bills to fund major sections of the federal government through September 30, 2027 \u2013 the end of the current fiscal year. Congress adopted three of the 12 appropriations bills which run the government every year. Those are Legislative Branch for Congress, Military Construction/VA for military building programs, and the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Agriculture. Even though that\u2019s three of the 12 annual spending bills, it\u2019s not anywhere close to a \"quarter\" of all spending which Congress appropriates annually. More than half of all Congressionally-controlled spending goes to the Pentagon alone. So the House and Senate must pass all nine of the remaining nine annual bills in order to avoid a repeat of this fall at 12:00:01 on Saturday, January 31.",
      "That is a tall order. But leading appropriators from both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol say there\u2019s been marked progress on these bills. Still, syncing everything up in a little more than two months \u2013 with Congress now out of session again this week and slated to be out for Christmas and New Year\u2019s \u2013 strikes some as doom date with destiny. Keep in mind that Congress did not stay in session in late July and August to tackle some of those same bills. One wonders why anything will be different now.",

Imagine how tough that bill will be this time, with both sides sparring over policies dictated by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about vaccines and other controversial health statements. That\u2019s to say nothing of the core issue which prompted Democrats to oppose funding the government in September: an extension of Obamacare health subsidies.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., is now promising a vote related to an extension of those tax credits to defray spiking health care cost premiums. But no one knows what that package will look like. Some Republicans, like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Ga., are now embracing the subsidies. She\u2019s now retiring in January. Other Republicans are looking at ways to reform the program. Democrats might balk at that. And still other conservatives are using this as an opportunity to possibly torpedo Obamacare \u2013 the bane of their existence since 2009.",
      "That could be the grandest political irony of all. Imagine a world where Republicans tried from 2009 through 2017 to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2013 yet stumbled at every turn. Then in 2025, Democrats refused to vote to fund the government in an effort to prop up Obamacare \u2013 and that\u2019s finally what unwound the program.",

But Democrats think they could be within striking distance if they hold the seats of retiring Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., would have to win reelection in a competitive state. Democrats would then need to flip the seat of retiring Sen.

      "\"Crooks was on that website and looked at images related to women who work out ... a lot. That was his interest, and so we are sharing this with you to show that just because he was on a website that has a voluminous amount of terrible information on it, there is no investigative fact to back up a connection between Thomas Crooks and a portion of the website that had the \u2018furry\u2019 on it.\"",

      "Bolton was indicted last month on 18 criminal charges stemming from his alleged retention and transmission of classified and sensitive materials during Trump's first term, including national defense information.",
      "Authorities have accused him of sending more than 1,000 \"diary-like\" updates to his wife and daughter between 2018 and 2019 via emails and texts, including classified information from intelligence briefings and meetings with foreign officials.",
      "The pre-trial hearing in Bolton's case on Friday was largely a procedural one, centered on next steps for both parties to review the breadth of discovery materials Bolton is accused of illegally retaining and transmitting.",
      "If nothing else, it underscored the fact that Bolton's trial is unlikely to take place for quite some time. The deadlines that both parties agreed to will put discovery in the case well into 2026, with a status conference in the case scheduled for October of next year. A trial date has not yet been set.",

      "\"How many documents are in play here? Frankly, most of this should have been done before the indictment,\" Chuang noted. \"Even assuming that couldn\u2019t be completed, I still can\u2019t understand why it would take seven months.\"",
      "In response, prosecutors noted that they still need to sort through some 1,000 pages of single-space documents obtained from Bolton's home, and reiterated they have set \"aggressive deadlines\" for the intelligence community to review the documents.",
      "Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in response that there are as many as three electronic devices that they haven't \"even started the process\" of reviewing, and which all must be reviewed by the filter team.",

      "President Donald Trump said the Democratic senators\u2019 viral video urging service members to \"refuse illegal orders\" should be \"punishable by death,\" intensifying outrage across the political spectrum \u2014 and confusion about what that advice could actually mean under federal law.",
      "While the lawmakers behind the video \u2014 led by Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and joined by Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and several Democratic House veterans and intelligence officers \u2014 framed the appeal as a defense of the Constitution, military legal codes make clear that refusing orders, even ones a service member personally believes are unlawful, can carry devastating penalties.",
      "\"You can\u2019t expect a sailor to overrule Washington lawyers,\" Rachel VanLandingham, a retired Air Force JAG and professor at Southwestern Law School, told Fox News Digital. \"That\u2019s why it\u2019s unfair to put the burden on the military instead of on policymakers.\"",
      "Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), a set of laws that governs all members of the U.S. armed forces, obedience to orders is not optional \u2014 except in the narrowest of cases where the illegality is \"manifest,\" or unmistakably obvious. In practice, that distinction means most troops risk punishment if they refuse a command before a court or superior authority has ruled it unlawful.",
      "DANGEROUS WAR GAMES: TELLING SERVICEMEMBERS TO RESIST TRUMP INVITES PURE CHAOS",
      "The UCMJ\u2019s Article 90 states that any service member who \"willfully disobeys a lawful command\" of a superior officer can face up to five years\u2019 confinement, loss of all pay and allowances and dishonorable discharge. If the offense occurs in wartime, the punishment can be death or any lesser penalty a court-martial decides.",
      "While the lawmakers behind the video \u00a0framed the appeal as a defense of the Constitution, military legal codes make clear that refusing orders can still carry devastating penalties.\u00a0 (Reuters)",
      "Article 92 \u2014 \"Failure to obey order or regulation\" \u2014 adds that disobeying any lawful order or regulation may also result in a court-martial, with punishments including forfeiture of pay, reduction in rank and up to two years\u2019 confinement. Those provisions, military lawyers say, are the backbone of discipline and chain of command \u2014 the very system the senators\u2019 video appears to challenge.",
      "The law leaves little room for mere good intentions.",
      "\"There is no duty to obey an illegal order, but a subordinate who disobeys based on that belief takes immense risk of conviction by court-martial unless he or she can prove the order was truly illegal,\" said Texas Tech law professor Geoffrey Corn, director of the university\u2019s Center for Military Law and Policy.",
      "The opposite mistake can be just as destructive. Under Article 77, service members who carry out an illegal order can be punished as \"principals,\" meaning they share the same criminal liability as the commander who gave the order.",
      "That principle \u2014 established after World War II \u2014 rejects the idea that \"just following orders\" is a defense.",
      "GRAHAM DEMANDS DEMOCRATS EXPLAIN 'REFUSE ILLEGAL ORDERS' MESSAGE TO TROOPS",
      "If an order violates the Constitution, the law of armed conflict or the rights of U.S. citizens, obedience offers no protection. A service member who follows such a directive could face prosecution for war crimes or dereliction of duty under Article 134, the UCMJ\u2019s broad \"general article\" covering conduct that discredits the armed forces.",
      "Military law sets an extremely narrow standard for refusing an order: it must be manifestly unlawful \u2014 so clearly illegal that \"a person of ordinary sense and understanding\" would recognize it as a crime on its face. Examples include commands to kill civilians, torture detainees or overthrow the government.",
      "By contrast, orders to deploy troops, enforce federal authority, or carry out presidential directives are presumed lawful unless specifically prohibited by statute or court ruling.",
      "\"There\u2019s a presumption that military orders are lawful,\" said Victor Hansen, a former Army judge advocate general (JAG) officer and professor at New England Law Boston. \"A defense only exists if the order is manifestly unlawful \u2014 something clearly criminal, like an order to kill a prisoner of war. That\u2019s where the duty to disobey applies.\"",
      "Hansen said service members aren\u2019t in a position to interpret the legality of a president\u2019s decisions on deployments or strikes. \"If a soldier came to me after seeing that video, I\u2019d tell them: Do nothing different than you\u2019re already doing,\" he said. \"It\u2019s not your job to second-guess the politics behind a decision to use force.\"",
      "The one-minute \"Don\u2019t Give Up the Ship\" video tells military and intelligence personnel, \"You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders.\" It never defines which orders qualify \u2014 even as the same lawmakers push legislation limiting Trump\u2019s ability to deploy National Guard units or conduct anti-narcoterrorism strikes abroad.",
      "Conservatives quickly accused the group of encouraging insubordination.",
      "Secretary of War Pete Hegseth responded on X: \"Stage 4 TDS,\" referring to what supporters of the president call \"Trump derangement syndrome.\"",
      "Inside the Pentagon, officials have long cautioned that calls for troops to interpret legality themselves can undermine civilian control of the military \u2014 a bedrock of American constitutional order. Current regulations instruct service members to seek immediate legal guidance through their chain of command or the Judge Advocate General\u2019s office before refusing a directive, except in cases of clear criminality.",

      "In 1968, U.S. troops massacred hundreds of unarmed civilians in the Vietnamese village of My Lai, a crime their commanders initially tried to conceal. When the killings came to light, 1st Lt.

      "Decades later, the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal in Iraq revealed another breakdown of command responsibility. Reservists at a U.S. detention facility humiliated and assaulted detainees under what they believed were authorized interrogation practices.",
      "Eleven soldiers were court-martialed, while senior officials escaped prosecution \u2014 a stark reminder, military lawyers say, of how ambiguous orders and weak oversight can still lead troops into criminal acts.",
      "VanLandingham called the video \"careless and dangerous,\" saying it misrepresents how limited the legal duty to refuse orders actually is.",
      "\"Service members are under no legal obligation to follow unlawful orders,\" she said. \"But the universe of orders that are so manifestly or patently unlawful that a soldier of ordinary understanding would recognize them as such is very small \u2014 that\u2019s by design. The military depends on obedience.\"",
      "She said that principle, born out of the Nuremberg trials after the Holocaust, remains the foundation of modern military law \u2014 a reminder that obedience can never excuse crimes \"so patently unlawful that any person of ordinary understanding would recognize them as such.\"",
      "VanLandingham said the standard becomes even murkier in modern conflicts, citing U.S. strikes on suspected narcotrafficker boats in the Caribbean and off Venezuela. Those missions, she said, may be unlawful as a matter of international law but would not appear manifestly unlawful to troops ordered to carry them out.\" (Secretary of War via X)",

      "\"Don\u2019t go after the troops,\" VanLandingham said. \"Go after the policymakers who issue unlawful orders. Congress should be reining in the executive, not telling privates and lieutenants to decide what\u2019s legal.\"",

At the same time, the move is already sparking backlash from neighbors who worry about more noise and safety risks and being turned into a test site for AI-guided aircraft without a real say. If Archer can win over regulators, investors and the communities living just beyond the fence line, this step could make the future of urban flight feel much closer, for better or worse.",

    "summary": "Fake AI apps disguised as &quot;ChatGPT&quot; and &quot;DALL\u00b7E&quot; are flooding app stores with dangerous malware that steals data and monitors users without detection.",
    "story": [
      "\u2018The CyberGuy\u2019 Kurt Knutsson joins \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend\u2019 to discuss the potential effects of artificial intelligence software like ChatGPT on the brain.",
      "App stores are supposed to be reliable and free of malware or fake apps, but that's far from the truth. For every legitimate application that solves a real problem, there are dozens of knockoffs waiting to exploit brand recognition and user trust. We've seen it happen with games, productivity tools and entertainment apps. Now, artificial intelligence has become the latest battleground for digital impostors.",
      "The AI boom has created an unprecedented gold rush in mobile app development, and opportunistic actors are cashing in. AI-related mobile apps collectively account for billions of downloads, and that massive user base has attracted a new wave of clones. They pose as popular apps like ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E, but in reality, they conceal sophisticated spyware capable of stealing data and monitoring users.",

      "OPENAI ACCUSES NY TIMES OF WANTING TO INVADE MILLIONS OF USERS' PRIVACY IN PAPER'S LAWSUIT AGAINST TECH GIANT",
      "Fake AI apps pose as trusted tools like ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E while secretly stealing user data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the fake AI apps",
      "The fake apps flooding app stores exist on a spectrum of harm, and understanding that range is crucial before you download any AI tools. Take the \"DALL\u00b7E 3 AI Image Generator\" found on Aptoide. It presents itself as an OpenAI product, complete with branding that mimics the real thing. When you open it, you see a loading screen that looks like an AI model generating an image. But nothing is actually being generated.",
      "Network analysis by Appknox showed the app connects only to advertising and analytics services. There's no AI functionality, just an illusion designed to collect your data for monetization.",
      "Then there are apps like WhatsApp Plus, which are far more dangerous. Disguised as an upgraded version of Meta's messenger, this app hides a complete malware framework capable of surveillance, credential theft and persistent background execution. It's signed with a fake certificate instead of WhatsApp's legitimate key and uses a tool often used by malware authors to encrypt malicious code.",
      "Once installed, it silently requests extensive permissions, including access to your contacts, SMS, call logs, device accounts and messages. These permissions allow it to intercept one-time passwords, scrape your address book and impersonate you in chats. Hidden libraries keep the code running even after you close the app. Network logs show it uses domain fronting to disguise its traffic behind Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud endpoints.",
      "Not every clone is malicious. Some apps identify themselves as unofficial interfaces and connect directly to real APIs. The problem is that you often can't tell the difference between a harmless wrapper and a malicious impersonator until it's too late.",
      "Clones hide spyware that can access messages, passwords and contacts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Users and businesses are equally at risk",
      "The impact of fake AI apps goes far beyond frustrated users. For enterprises, these clones pose a direct threat to brand reputation, compliance and data security.",
      "When a malicious app steals credentials while using your brand's identity, customers don't just lose data but also lose trust. Research shows customers stop buying from a brand after a major breach. The average cost of a data breach now stands at 4.45 million dollars, according to IBM's 2025 report. In regulated sectors like finance and healthcare, such breaches can lead to violations of GDPR, HIPAA and PCI-DSS, with fines reaching up to 4% of global turnover.",
      "These impostors harm both users and brands, leading to costly data breaches and lost trust. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8 steps to protect yourself from fake AI apps",
      "While the threat landscape continues to evolve, there are practical measures you can take to protect yourself from malicious clones and impersonators.",
      "A quality mobile security solution can detect and block malicious apps before they cause damage. Modern antivirus programs scan apps for suspicious behavior, unauthorized permissions and known malware signatures. This first line of defense is especially important as fake apps become more sophisticated in hiding their true intentions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Apps like WhatsApp Plus specifically target credentials and can intercept passwords typed directly into fake interfaces. A password manager autofills credentials only on legitimate sites and apps, making it significantly harder for impostors to capture your login information through phishing or fake app interfaces.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Given that malicious clones can steal personal information, intercept SMS verification codes and even impersonate users in chats, identity theft protection provides an additional safety net. These services monitor for unauthorized use of your personal information and can alert you if your identity is being misused across various platforms and services.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "While some sophisticated malware can intercept SMS codes,\u00a02FA still adds a critical layer of security. Use authenticator apps rather than SMS when possible, as they're harder to compromise. Even if a fake app captures your password, 2FA makes it significantly more difficult for attackers to access your accounts.",
      "Security patches often address vulnerabilities that malicious apps exploit. Regular updates to your operating system and legitimate apps ensure you have the latest protections against known threats. Enable automatic updates when possible to stay protected without having to remember manual checks.",
      "Stick to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store rather than third-party marketplaces. While fake apps can still appear on official platforms, these stores have security review processes and are more responsive to removing malicious applications once they're identified. Third-party app stores often have minimal or no security vetting.",
      "Check the developer name carefully. Official ChatGPT apps come from OpenAI, not random developers with similar names. Look at the number of downloads, read recent reviews and be suspicious of apps with few ratings or reviews that seem generic. Legitimate AI tools from major companies will have verified developer badges and millions of downloads.",
      "Even if you avoid downloading fake apps, your personal information may already be circulating on data broker sites that scammers rely on. These brokers collect and sell details like your name, phone number, home address and app usage data, information that cybercriminals can use to craft convincing phishing messages or impersonate you.",
      "A trusted data removal service scans hundreds of broker databases and automatically submits removal requests on your behalf. Regularly removing your data helps reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for malicious actors and fake app networks to target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The AI boom has driven massive innovation, but it has also opened new attack surfaces built on brand trust. As adoption grows across mobile platforms, enterprises must secure not only their own apps but also track how their brand appears across hundreds of app stores worldwide. In a market where billions of AI app downloads have happened, the clones aren't coming. They're already here, hiding behind familiar logos and polished interfaces.",

At first, I thought it was just a way for a guy to sell more reports, but after thinking about it for a while, it seems like it could be a great way to harvest credit card numbers, etc. I have not been a victim of this, but in the course of selling a car recently, I had several instances of this. There are several warning signs: \u2018Will you accept cash?\u2019 Questions indicating they have not read the ad. Offering more than the ad asks for. Short nonsensical first contact.

      "It sounds harmless, even reassuring. But the scam hinges on getting you to click that link.

      "The new uninstall button rolls out",
      "Google is rolling out version 48.8 of the Play Store, and it introduces a new \u2018Uninstall\u2019 button right on each app's listing. You can now remove an app from any of your devices directly from your main phone. This eliminates the need to pick up each device and remove the app one by one.

      "If confirmed, Phippsaksla would join a long list of meteorites identified by earlier missions, including Curiosity\u2019s \"Lebanon\" and \"Cacao\" finds, as well as metallic fragments spotted by Opportunity and Spirit. NASA said each discovery has helped scientists better understand how meteorites interact with the Martian surface over time.",

      "The holiday season is the happiest and riskiest time of year to be online. As millions of us gear up for Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, scammers do the same.",
      "Every year, they target holiday shoppers with fake websites, \"too-good-to-be-true\" deals and scam emails that look identical to legitimate retailers. But here's the part most people miss: scammers don't just rely on luck. They already have your personal data before you even click \"add to cart.\"",
      "From leaked email addresses to exposed phone numbers and home addresses, your personal information is being bought and sold by data brokers, companies that collect and resell detailed profiles about you. Those profiles are exactly what scammers use to send realistic \"order confirmations,\" fake delivery alerts and \"urgent payment\" texts during this holiday period and beyond.",

      "Scammers ramp up fake websites and emails during the holiday shopping rush. (iStock)",
      "Why scammers love the holiday season",
      "November through December is a goldmine for cybercriminals. According to the CISA, reports of online shopping scams spike during this time of year and vary in their approaches. The reason? We let our guard down when we're rushed, distracted or excited by a deal. Staying alert during the holiday season can help you avoid data exposure and financial losses. Here are some of the most common scams you should be aware of.",
      "The surge of promotions during the holiday season is the perfect time for \"phantom stores\" to thrive. It's a fraudulent store that mimics the interface and products of a well-known brand. Once you purchase from such a website, you'll never receive your order as the store doesn't actually exist.",
      "Real-world example: Fake IKEA websites appeared with URLs spelled \"ikeaa-sale.com\" and \"ikea-blackfriday.shop,\" mimicking the official ikea.com interface with copied product images, logos and discount banners.",
      "They lured shoppers with huge discounts and clearance offers to steal credit card data. Eventually, they were reported and taken down, but the damage has been done.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Always check the URL of the store you shop at and only click links from the store's official website or social media.",
      "According to recent research, some of the most popular shopping apps like Temu are selling your location data to third parties. It's no surprise that you might receive fake delivery texts.",
      "Your leaked data fuels realistic \"order\" and \"delivery\" scams online. (iStock)",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "Real-world example: Temu is a popular app for scammers to mimic. They can easily find your contact information and order details to text \"Your order couldn't be delivered.\" Each text contains a phishing link that can install malware on your device or steal your personal information. That's why Temu warns its users about the couriers they partner with.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Make sure the texts you receive come from a legit courier service and double-check it on the store's website.",
      "Some scammers use sophisticated phishing tactics to lure victims. They engineer emails from well-known brands, use an urgent tone, place malicious links and urge you to click on your order status. In reality, there is no order status \u2013 they're stealing your data.",
      "Real-world example: Amazon is one of the biggest online retailers worldwide, and that makes the brand easy to mimic. Scammers send emails on behalf of Amazon to try to steal customers' personal data because it's highly likely that their victims have used Amazon, making it less suspicious. However, phishing emails have some telltale signs you can look out for.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Never click on any suspicious links and always check the sender's contact information.",
      "When you shop online, you should be aware of the data you share, including your contact information, shopping habits, credit card details and more. All stores collect some type of data about you. However, some companies collect more than you think.",
      "Real-world example: The infamous Target controversy in 2012 revealed how big retailers use data analysis to predict your shopping behavior. The company collected shopping data and managed to produce a predictive model for soon-to-be mothers.",
      "They sent out brochures with baby clothes, vouchers for baby formula and more before the customers even knew they were pregnant. Thankfully, modern shopping looks a bit different. You can opt out of certain data collection and exercise your right to remove personal information from websites that collect it.",

      "THE TRUTH BEHIND THOSE MYSTERIOUS SHIPMENT EMAILS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "How scammers find you",
      "Imagine you're browsing for gifts online. Within minutes, your activity generates data points \u2013 device info, IP address, browsing habits that feed into online databases. At the same time, data brokers already have your full profile: age, income, address history, family members and even shopping behavior. These profiles are sold to marketers and often leak into criminal databases.",
      "That's why scam calls, texts and emails often feel so \"real.\" They use your name, the right retailer, even your city. They're not guessing. They've bought your digital footprint.",
      "The \"holiday cleanup\" your data needs",
      "Most people clear their browser cookies or delete old emails to \"stay private.\" But that's like locking your front door while leaving all your personal documents on the lawn.",
      "If you want to stop scammers from targeting you this holiday season, you need to remove your personal data from the source, the data broker databases that feed these scams.",
      "That's where a data removal service comes in. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A major national security debate is unfolding, and it affects more than government networks. It touches your home, your devices and the Wi-Fi your family uses every day. The Commerce Department has proposed blocking new sales of TP-Link products after a months-long review into the company\u2019s ties to China, citing a growing TP-Link security risk.",
      "Multiple agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security and War, supported that proposal. They believe the company\u2019s connections could expose American networks to foreign influence.",
      "Security experts warn that foreign-backed hackers have targeted home and office routers for years. These devices often act as silent steppingstones that help attackers move deeper into sensitive systems. When compromised, they can expose everything connected to them, including computers, smart home gear, military devices used on base and more.",
      "This potential ban would be one of the biggest consumer tech actions in U.S. history. It comes as lawmakers raise fresh alarms about Chinese-made cameras, routers and connected home products sold on military exchanges and in homes across the country.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "CHINESE HACKERS BREACH US NUCLEAR SECURITY AGENCY IN CYBERATTACK OPERATION, OFFICIALS SAY",
      "The proposed TP-Link ban stems from growing concerns that foreign-linked routers and cameras could expose American homes and networks to outside influence. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why military families are even more vulnerable",
      "Lawmakers from both parties say military households face extra risk. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who leads a bipartisan group of 23 lawmakers, warns that TP-Link cameras and networking devices sold on Army, Navy and Air Force exchange sites could expose sensitive footage from base housing and dorms. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, echoed that concern, saying these devices could act as a backdoor for Chinese intelligence to collect information on service members and their families. Even when products appear out of stock, officials worry they remain popular in military communities.",
      "These lawmakers say Chinese laws could force companies to share data or push hidden software changes that weaken U.S. networks. They argue that this creates a real risk for households on or near military installations. While TP-Link disputes every allegation and states that it stores U.S. data inside America, lawmakers want a deeper investigation.",
      "\"China will use any way to infiltrate us, and we must ensure they cannot access our homeland or military bases,\" said Ernst. \"High-tech security cameras sending video and audio directly back to Beijing must be treated like the grave threat that they are. We have seen this playbook from China before, with Huawei Technologies, and need the Trump administration to investigate and determine if TP-Link is a Trojan horse compromising our national security.\"",
      "10M AMERICANS HIT IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR DATA BREACH",
      "How Congress is responding to TP-Link security risks",
      "Ernst is pressing the Commerce Department to finish its investigation by Nov. 30. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, says TP-Link could give the Chinese government access to American networks and wants faster action. Their concerns reflect past decisions involving Huawei and Kaspersky, which lost access to the U.S. market due to national security risks.",
      "Congressional leaders say foreign-made smart home devices sold on military bases should face strict scrutiny. They see routers, cameras and other connected home gear as critical targets in a time when cyberthreats continue to grow.",
      "We reached out to TP-Link Systems Inc., and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"TP-Link Systems Inc. (TP-Link), an American company based in California, refutes the claims in this letter. This letter repeats false and misleading media reports and attacks that have been thoroughly debunked.\"",
      "\"TP-Link emphatically objects to any allegation it is tied to the Communist Party of China, dependent on the Chinese government, or otherwise subject to interference under Chinese national security laws,\" the TP-Link spokesperson said. \"The company is not controlled by any government, foreign or domestic. TP-Link has split from and has no affiliation with the China-based TP-LINK Technologies Co. Ltd., which is separately owned and operated.",
      "Lawmakers warn that TP-Link devices sold on military bases may put service members and their families at greater risk, especially inside base housing. (John Moore/Getty Images)",
      "\"This letter has nothing to do with security and everything to do with a competitor trying to remove TP-Link Systems\u2019 products from the marketplace. The \u2018open source information\u2019 the members reference is actually a manufactured echo chamber of false and misleading attacks that the media has parroted over the past year. Instead of directly engaging with TP-Link Systems, these members essentially pressed \u2018copy and paste\u2019 on unsubstantiated claims about our American company.",
      "\"TP-Link has not been contacted by policymakers to discuss the alleged concerns, but if we were to meet with them, they would learn that TP-Link has located its core security functions and data infrastructure in the United States. U.S. user data is securely stored on Amazon Web Services infrastructure in Virginia, under the full control of the company\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "\"TP-Link Systems currently holds a very small share of the U.S. security camera market, representing approximately 3% of the consumer market segment according to Circana checkout data. The company has virtually no business presence in the enterprise segment. Additionally, TP-Link Systems' router market share in the U.S. has been inaccurately reported as being much higher than it actually is. Recent market research from Dell\u2019Oro Group, Inc., found that TP-Link Systems' market share of residential Wi-Fi router sales in North America is under 10%.",
      "\"TP-Link does not enable foreign surveillance of U.S. networks or users. The company\u2019s operations are built to prevent potential attempts to subvert its business by outside influence. TP-Link\u2019s substantial security investments cover its entire product portfolio, including security cameras and routers.",

      "Hyundai AutoEver America discovered on March 1, 2025, that hackers had compromised its systems. Investigators found the intrusion began on February 22 and continued until March 2.",
      "Hyundai AutoEver America (HAEA) provides IT services for Hyundai Motor America, including systems that support employee operations and certain connected-vehicle technologies. While the company works across Hyundai's broader ecosystem, this incident did not involve customer or driver data.",
      "According to the statement provided to CyberGuy, the breach was limited to employment-related information tied to Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. The company confirmed that about 2,000 current and former employees were notified of the incident in late October. HAEA said it immediately alerted law enforcement and hired outside cybersecurity experts to assess the damage.",

      "Cybercriminals targeted Hyundai AutoEver America\u2019s systems, exposing sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why this Hyundai AutoEver America breach matters",
      "The exposed data reportedly includes names, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers, making this breach far more serious than one involving passwords alone. Experts warn that these details can be used for long-term identity theft and financial fraud. Because Social Security numbers cannot easily be changed, criminals have more time to create fake identities, open fraudulent accounts and launch targeted phishing attacks long after the initial breach.",
      "Experts warn that stolen Social Security and driver\u2019s license information could be used for identity theft and fraud. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Who was affected in the Hyundai AutoEver America data incident",
      "AEA manages select IT systems tied to Hyundai Motor America's employee operations, along with broader technology functions for Hyundai and Genesis across North America. Its role includes supporting connected-vehicle infrastructure and dealership systems.",
      "According to the company, this incident was limited to employment-related data and primarily affected approximately 2,000 current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. No customer information or Bluelink driver details were exposed. While some filings reference sensitive data types such as Social Security numbers or driver's license information, the incident did not involve Hyundai customers or the millions of connected vehicles HAEA supports.",
      "Earlier reports suggested that 2.7 million individuals were affected, but Hyundai says that figure is unrelated to the breach. Instead, 2.7 million is the estimated number of connected vehicles that Hyundai AutoEver America helps support across North America. None of that consumer or vehicle data was accessed.",
      "GENESIS PREVIEWS G70 SPORTS SEDAN WITH NEW YORK CONCEPT",
      "Hyundai also clarified that the United States has about 850 Hyundai dealerships and emphasized that the scope of this incident was narrow and contained.",
      "We reached out to HAEA for a comment, and a representative for the company provided CyberGuy with this statement:",
      "\"Hyundai AutoEver America, an IT vendor that manages certain Hyundai Motor America employee data systems, experienced an incident to that area of business that impacted employment-related data and primarily affected current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. Approximately 2,000 primarily current and former employees were notified of the incident. The 2.7 million figure that is cited in many media articles has no relation to the actual security incident. The 2.7 million figure represents the alleged total number of connected vehicles that may be supported by Hyundai AutoEver America across North America. No Hyundai consumer data was exposed, and no Hyundai Motor America customer information or Bluelink driver data was compromised.\"",

    "summary": "Washington court rules automated license plate reader images are public records, even when stored by vendors like Flock Safety, setting precedent for transparency.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A Skagit County Superior Court judge ruled that images from Flock Safety automated license plate reader cameras in Stanwood and Sedro-Woolley qualify as public records under Washington's Public Records Act.",
      "Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski said the images are \"not exempt from disclosure\" and explained that an agency does not need to physically hold a record for it to fall under the law.",
      "The request that led to the ruling",
      "The case began when Washington resident Jose Rodriguez asked Stanwood for one hour of Flock camera images. That request prompted Stanwood and neighboring Sedro-Woolley to ask the court to declare that vendor-stored data did not count as public records.",

      "Judge Neidzwski rejected that argument. She said the cities' ALPR images support a government purpose and meet the definition of a public record.",
      "SEATTLE ELECTS DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST KATIE WILSON AS MAYOR",
      "Flock Safety cameras use AI to capture license plate images in real time, tracking vehicles as they move through neighborhoods. (Flock Safety)",
      "However, Rodriguez will not receive the specific images he sought. The city had already allowed the footage to auto-delete after 30 days, and it expired before the ruling.",
      "We reached out to Flock Safety, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"The Court merely declined to exempt these records from disclosure under Washington's extremely broad public records law. Nothing changed in the status quo in Washington as a result of this ruling \u2014 these records were covered by the law before the ruling, and remain so following the ruling. Unfortunately, some individuals in Washington have abused the breadth of the public records law to extort significant settlements from Washington communities for technical violations of the disclosure requirements, which we cannot believe is the intent of the law. We are supporting efforts to enact a legislative fix to this situation, which is costing Washington communities tens of thousands of dollars to stave off frivolous lawsuits.\"",
      "The Washington court ruling marks a major step toward transparency in how police collect and store surveillance data. (Flock Safety)",
      "Why the decision matters for transparency",
      "Flock's automated license plate reader cameras capture multiple still images of passing vehicles along with time, location and license plate information. Cities use the system to assist law enforcement with investigations, relying on stored images to identify vehicles connected to crimes or alerts.",
      "The court's ruling raises broader questions about how local agencies manage these images once they're created. By finding that the images qualify as public records, the decision forces cities to examine how long they retain this data, how it is stored and who may request access under state law.",
      "Privacy advocates say the ruling highlights the need for clear policies around retention and transparency, while law enforcement groups argue that access rules must still protect ongoing investigations.",
      "AI DASHCAMS ENHANCE TRUCKER SAFETY WHILE RAISING PRIVACY CONCERNS",
      "The debate continues as communities weigh the balance between public safety, privacy and the right to know what\u2019s being recorded. (Flock Safety)",
      "How this ruling impacts privacy and surveillance",
      "For years, cities and police agencies have argued that data stored by third-party vendors falls outside public records laws. They often make this claim even when the data documents activity on public roads. The Washington ruling did not settle broader questions about surveillance, but it rejected the idea that Flock camera images are exempt simply because a vendor stores them. This decision exposes a growing tension between how agencies use surveillance tools and what the public can access under state law.",
      "Beryl Lipton of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to defending digital privacy, free expression and transparency in technology, told Cyberguy,\u00a0\"The use of third-party vendors for surveillance and data storage is widespread and growing across the country, and allowing this to undermine the public\u2019s right to know is very dangerous. The government's primary obligation should be to its constituents, which includes protecting their rights under public records laws, not to the private vendors that they choose to employ while conducting mass surveillance. Whether an agency stores images and information on their own devices or on the private server of a vendor should not affect the appropriate disclosure of these records under public records laws. If the use of these devices makes it too difficult for a city to comply with the law, then the response should not be to circumvent the laws they find inconvenient, but rather it should be to only use vendors that won\u2019t get in the way of a city\u2019s ability to fulfill its responsibilities to their citizenry. Otherwise, they should not use these tools at all.\"",
      "What this means for you",
      "If your town uses Flock or other automated license plate readers, this ruling shows how Washington courts may handle future records requests. It confirms that ALPR images can count as public records, even when a vendor stores the data.",
      "The debate over privacy and safety continues. Supporters say public access builds trust and oversight. Critics worry that releasing vehicle data could expose sensitive details without strong safeguards or redactions.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This ruling shows how courts may handle data from automated license plate readers. It also reveals how much vehicle information cities collect. As a result, it raises new questions about who should access these records. In addition, the decision may guide future transparency debates in Washington. However, it will also spark fresh conversations about how surveillance tools fit within state records laws.",

      "Security expert Xavier Mertens first spotted the campaign, confirming that the same kind of scheme was seen earlier this year. According to BleepingComputer, these fake TikTok videos show short PowerShell commands and instruct viewers to run them as administrators to \"activate\" or \"fix\" their programs.",

      "This campaign uses what experts call a ClickFix attack. It's a social engineering trick that makes victims feel they're following legitimate tech instructions. The instructions seem quick and simple: run one short command and get instant access to premium software.",
      "But instead of activating anything, the PowerShell command connects to a remote domain named slmgr[.]win, which downloads harmful executables from Cloudflare-hosted pages. The main file, updater.exe, is a variant of the Aura Stealer malware. Once inside the system, it hunts for your credentials and sends them back to the attacker.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) can take a serious toll on families, not only emotionally but financially, especially when every cycle comes with new bills and no clear sense of what the full journey might cost. Gaia Family aims to change that by removing the guesswork around pricing with a blend of tech and AI-driven forecasting.",
      "Instead of worrying about unpredictable costs, couples pay a fixed upfront price or monthly installments that cover their planned IVF treatment, medications, embryo transfers and built-in protections if cycles or transfers aren't successful. It gives families a clearer path forward and support that lasts through the entire process.",

      "Artificial intelligence is giving hopeful parents more clarity about their chances over multiple IVF cycles, helping them plan their journey with clearer expectations instead of guesswork. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Gaia Family was born",
      "Gaia Family was founded by Nader AlSalim, a former Goldman Sachs executive who knew the IVF struggle firsthand. After spending over $50,000 across five IVF rounds in multiple countries, he and his wife finally had a son. The experience left him frustrated by how little clarity the system offered and how emotionally draining the process could be.",
      "He saw that most fertility systems were built around procedures, not people. His goal with Gaia Family was to build something different, a program that uses data to empower families instead of leaving them to navigate uncertainty and mounting debt. That personal experience became the foundation of Gaia Family's mission to bring agency, transparency and compassion to fertility care.",

      "Gaia Family gives families one fixed IVF price with built-in protection and full support every step of the way. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Choose your clinic:\u00a0Gaia partners with more than 100 fertility clinics across the U.S.Get your personalized quote: Your doctor designs your treatment plan, and Gaia uses it to calculate your fixed cost upfront.Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",

      "Get your personalized quote: Your doctor designs your treatment plan, and Gaia uses it to calculate your fixed cost upfront.",
      "Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",
      "If a cycle doesn't result in viable embryos, Gaia's built-in protection covers another attempt, helping families try again without financial shock. Once you have viable embryos, your Gaia Plan allows you unlimited frozen embryo transfers (usually $5,000 each) at no extra cost until you have a baby. And, if none of those transfers result in a live birth, then Gaia will give you money toward another cycle. Plus, you have the option of including all of your PGT-A testing and your medication for a fixed cost, so you have even more protection throughout your journey. AlSalim, tells CyberGuy the company's mission goes beyond technology.",
      "\"At Gaia Family, we're using AI not to replace the human element of fertility care, but to bring more confidence to it,\" AlSalim said. \"Fertility treatment can feel like a game of chance \u2014 our technology helps turn it into a guided, informed journey. By analyzing millions of data points, we can forecast the most effective and affordable pathway for each individual, so patients can make decisions grounded in data rather than uncertainty. Ultimately, it's about giving hopeful parents more agency, transparency and peace of mind in one of the most emotional experiences of their lives.\"",
      "SKIN DNA BREAKTHROUGH COULD LET 60-YEAR-OLD WOMEN HAVE GENETICALLY RELATED KIDS",
      "For many couples, this combination of data and compassion is transforming uncertainty into confidence and renewed hope. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Gaia Family's model matters",
      "IVF in the United States can cost as much as $30,000 per cycle, and most couples need several tries. Each failed attempt adds more bills and stress. Gaia Family's fixed-cost model gives families financial predictability while keeping them emotionally supported. It also encourages clinics to focus on outcomes rather than repeated treatments.",
      "This approach is transforming how people view fertility care. Instead of relying on luck, families can benefit from AI insights to make better decisions. While it may not lower the medical costs yet, it changes how couples experience one of life's most emotional challenges, turning fear into informed planning and despair into hope. Gaia removes the spiraling costs, making couples' outcomes so much more cost-efficient.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are thinking about IVF or egg freezing, Gaia Family's model could make your path more manageable. It provides upfront transparency about costs, protection against financial loss and a data-driven forecast of success. It helps you make decisions based on evidence rather than guesswork.",
      "Still, while AI can analyze data patterns, it cannot alter biology. Factors like age, health and genetics continue to shape outcomes. Even so, Gaia Family's system gives couples a sense of control that traditional fertility care rarely provides by serving everyone, with no eligibility criteria in terms of age or health factors. Knowing that your finances are protected can ease stress and allow you to focus on what matters most: building your family.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Gaia Family is blending AI and empathy to rewrite how fertility care works. It replaces uncertainty with insight and transforms risk into reassurance. For many, it's not just about technology, it's about restoring hope and fairness to one of life's most personal journeys.",

      "Lemkin said the timing of that alert was a turning point. \"",
      "The active genocide alert is very concerning. It made us realize the horrible agenda of the Institute,\" he said. \"Merely days after Israelis were killed, raped, tortured and taken hostage and with no action yet taken by Israel to defend itself, the alert was issued.

Similar letters came from rabbis Yitzchak Lasry and Tal Peretz, along with additional submissions from Rabbis Dana, Ovadia and Tobali.",
      "\"In terms of rabbis taking a position, I think this is extremely important,\" Lemkin said. \"If an organization uses Raphael's name to distort or invert his legacy, religious and moral leaders have a duty to defend historical truth. \u2026 When a revered public figure\u2019s name such as Raphael, is misused, it becomes a form of false witness, which, as I understand it, is contrary to Jewish law and ethics.\"",

      "\"While it has never been its official policy, over the last few decades, Europeans took for granted the American umbrella and the inconceivability of war to both largely minimize any defense burden they share, as well as placed themselves as some sort of moral conscience lording over the world that ranged into pacifism and impossible moral perfection. It is a good thing that they are now forced to start soberly thinking about their defense and what that might entail.\"",

The fact that Germany, before Britain and France, seemed to appreciate the threat that it faces and the resulting need to stand up a more robust defense, is symbolic of that shift eastward.\"",
      "According to Wurmser, \"Symbolically, Germany\u2019s actions represent a realization that is long overdue, but is not yet universally understood. That what happened in February 2022, as well as what is happening in the Middle East against Israel, are only localized versions of a much larger, dangerous, and potentially deadly global competition that is led by several nations in opposition to western civilization.\"",

      "The warm encounter between the two stands in stark contrast to how they treated each other in the run-up to this month\u2019s mayoral election. Trump cast Mamdani, a democratic socialist, as a \u201ccommunist\u201d and issued a last-minute endorsement to his main opponent in the race, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

      "How the redistricting fight has scrambled dozens of midterm campaigns across the country",
      "The national redistricting battle has cast a long shadow over the race for control of Congress next year \u2014 not only fundamentally reshaping the battlefield, but also creating a domino effect that\u2019s pushing candidates into new seats, ushering longtime lawmakers to the exits and exposing deep political rifts in state parties across the country.",
      "The fight is still playing out across courtrooms, back rooms and President Donald Trump\u2019s social media accounts, as Republicans and Democrats tinker with district lines. Developments like this week\u2019s federal court ruling blocking the new Texas maps from going into effect \u2014 leaving the ultimate decision to the Supreme Court \u2014 also show how much remains to be determined in the redistricting fight.",
      "Texas: The map Texas enacted over the summer adds more Republicans to the battleground districts represented by Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, while redrawing two districts in Houston and Dallas in a way that will likely force incumbent Democrats into primaries against each other. It also split Austin to create one deep-blue seat and one additional Republican-leaning seat that stretches toward San Antonio. The Supreme Court\u2019s eventual decision will have a significant impact on a spate of races, starting with whether Austin-area Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett decides to retire.",
      "There\u2019s also the question of whether the winner of January\u2019s special election to succeed the late Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner will have to immediately run against a longtime Democratic incumbent, and how Democratic Reps. Marc Veasey, Julie Johnson and Jasmine Crockett handle a potentially significant redraw in North Texas that could leave one of them out of a job. The redistricting plan already has Crockett weighing a Senate bid.",
      "California: The Democratic-drawn map voters approved earlier this month  has similar potential to upend the Republican caucus in the state. The districts represented by GOP Reps. Doug LaMalfa, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, Ken Calvert and David Valadao are becoming significantly more vulnerable to being flipped by Democrats, according to an analysis from the University of Virginia Center for Politics.",
      "One early bit of fallout: Calvert\u2019s decision to seek re-election in a nearby district currently represented by fellow Republican Rep. Young Kim, which will likely trigger an expensive primary between two prominent incumbents. In an early show of force, Kim has already announced plans to spend more than $3 million on ads ahead of the 2026 primary.",
      "Utah: A court decision to enact a new map over the protests of Republicans created a new blue seat in the Salt Lake City area \u2014 one that could spark a primary focused on ideology as well as electability, an unusual position for Utah\u2019s Democratic minority.",

      "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Friday temporarily permitted Texas to use Republicans' redrawn congressional map that a federal court blocked earlier this week.",
      "Alito's order comes after Texas asked the high court to intervene following a ruling from a panel of federal judges on Tuesday that barred the state from using new district lines designed to help Republicans pick up an additional five House seats in next year's midterm elections.",
      "The lower court's ruling, signed by Judge Jeffrey Brown \u2014 a nominee of President Donald Trump \u2014 had ordered Texas to use a previous map that was drawn in 2021 instead, after finding that \"substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.\"",
      "The administrative stay is a temporary ruling that allows Texas to continue to use its new map for now, as the Supreme Court reviews the case.",
      "The Supreme Court ordered the civil rights advocacy groups that challenged the map to file a response by 5 p.m. on Monday. The filing deadline for candidates in Texas ahead of the March primary is Dec. 8.",
      "The district court\u2019s decision dealt a significant setback for Trump, who has urged Republicans in Texas and around the country to enact new maps to help shore up the party's narrow House majority.",
      "While congressional maps are typically reassessed at the start of each decade, when new census data is available, Texas' redrawn map triggered a national mid-cycle redistricting battle between both parties. Republicans in Missouri and North Carolina also passed new maps this year to boost their party, while Trump is continuing to pressure GOP lawmakers in Indiana to do the same.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 20:26:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump has turned to a new economic indicator in his push to convince Americans that the economy is strong: the number of people getting federal food benefits.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has recently turned to a new economic indicator in his push to convince Americans that his policies are boosting the economy: the number of people receiving federal food benefits.",
      "\u201cIn nine months, we\u2019ve lifted over 600,000 Americans off food stamps,\u201d he said Tuesday at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington.",
      "A few days earlier, Trump cited the figure at the McDonald\u2019s Impact Summit, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s really because we really have a strong economy.\u201d And last month, he also highlighted the number at a gathering of business executives in South Korea.",
      "But a deeper dive into the data paints a more complex picture. Even though fewer people are receiving federal food assistance, lower-wage workers continue to face a slowing job market and persistent inflation cutting into their wage growth, researchers and economists said. At the same time, food banks say they have been seeing growing demand, suggesting a continued struggle among people to be able to put food on the table.",
      "Data on the number of people receiving food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, often referred to as food stamps, is available only through June, and figures from that month are still subject to revisions, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. But comparing the number of people receiving food assistance in January \u2014 when Trump came into office \u2014 to June shows a decline of 800,000 enrollees, or around 2%, which the White House attributed to his policies.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s proven economic formula of tax cuts, deregulation, and unleashing American energy has cooled inflation, raised real wages, and promoted growth,\u201d White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, more than 800,000 Americans have been lifted off of SNAP thanks to this President\u2019s successful policies.\u201d",
      "Seasonal variations in SNAP enrollment",
      "Over the long term, the number of people receiving SNAP benefits tends to track the level of poverty in the country since fewer people are eligible for the benefits as their incomes rise, researchers and economists said.",
      "But, they warned, comparing monthly changes in the number of SNAP recipients over a relatively short period of time can be misleading. For instance, there was a similar drop in SNAP recipients during the first six months of 2023 \u2014 a time when Trump was attacking then-President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the economy.",
      "There are often monthly fluctuations in how many people receive SNAP benefits based on a number of factors outside of the trajectory of the economy, such as seasonal hiring, changes to eligibility and natural disasters. Hurricane Helene, for instance, caused a spike in SNAP enrollment in North Carolina and Georgia last fall, and SNAP enrollment in those states remained above their pre-Helene levels into early this year.",
      "\u201cThe number of people participating has tracked the number of people in poverty, and that does, in general, track economic conditions,\u201d said Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cBut there are other factors, like what share of eligible people participate, how well states do at enrolling people, changes in eligibility rules, and whether there was a recent natural disaster.\u201d",
      "When comparing the average number of SNAP recipients over the first six months of this year to the same period last year, there has been a slight increase. On a monthly year-over-year basis, SNAP enrollment in May was relatively unchanged from a year earlier and down by about 300,000 in June to around 41.6 million, according to USDA figures.",
      "Slowing job market",
      "U.S. economic growth did pick up during the spring, compared to the start of the year, driven by an uptick in consumer spending and a rush of companies importing goods ahead of Trump\u2019s new tariffs. But the job market has been slowing in recent months and unemployment has been ticking higher.",
      "Employers added jobs at a relatively healthy clip in September, but there were job losses in industries relied on by lower-wage workers, such as manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, according to data released Thursday. The unemployment rate in September ticked up to 4.4%, the highest level in nearly four years.",
      "Lower-wage workers have also seen a slowdown in their wage growth; pay for the bottom quarter of earners increased 3.7% in July, compared to an increase of 4.7% for the highest earners, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.",
      "\u201cThe economy is spinning on mud trying to get traction,\u201d said Ismael Cid-Martinez, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, whose research focuses on income inequality.  \u201cI would struggle to find any signs to write home about to signify that this is a labor market that\u2019s stronger than the one that we saw over the last five years.\u201d",
      "Recent polls have shown voters increasingly concerned about the economy and Trump\u2019s handling of it. In an NBC News poll earlier this month, 63% of respondents said Trump had fallen short of expectations regarding the economy. In a Fox News poll released this week, 76% of voters said they viewed the economy negatively \u2014 worse than the 70% who said the same of Biden at the end of his term.",
      "Food banks said they have seen few signs of food insecurity waning. Feeding America, the country\u2019s largest hunger organization, said that in the first six months of the year, as many as 80% of the food banks it serves reported seeing an increase in demand.",
      "Even if more Americans do see their incomes increase and are no longer eligible for SNAP benefits, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are no longer struggling to put food on the table, said Linda Nageotte, president and chief operating officer for Feeding America. About 37% of people whom Feeding America serves earn too much to qualify for SNAP benefits, but still need to rely on a local food pantry, she said.",
      "A family of four needs to earn less than $3,483 a month to qualify for assistance. If a recipient's income goes over the limit, even by just a small amount \u2014 because their hours increased slightly or they got a small raise \u2014 they can lose hundreds of dollars in benefits.",
      "\u201cYou may be making $10 more than what is eligible, so you\u2019re really not able to cover all your basic necessities, but you also aren\u2019t able to get the help that you need from our nation\u2019s leading support service for folks facing food insecurity,\u201d Nageotte said. \u201cWe call that the benefits cliff, and it is a significant challenge that many, many people experiencing food insecurity are facing.\u201d",
      "Stricter SNAP eligibility",
      "In the coming months, fewer people are projected to be eligible for SNAP benefits, which could drive down the number of enrollees by the millions \u2014  even if they don\u2019t see an increase in their income.",
      "Starting this month, the Trump administration began putting sweeping new work requirements in place, which were enacted under the tax bill passed over the summer that Republicans dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Under that legislation, all adults under the age of 65 must now work, volunteer or go to school a minimum of 20 hours a week in order to qualify for benefits for more than three months unless they have a child under the age of 14 or qualify for a disability exemption.",
      "Under the provisions, 2.4 million people could lose SNAP benefits in an average month over the next decade, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "\u201cJust be candid, it feels like a very scary moment of where we are and what\u2019s coming versus a narrative of an economy doing good,\u201d said Sara Bleich, a professor of public health policy at Harvard University. \u201cThere\u2019s basically a tidal wave of loss that\u2019s coming because people are going to be kicked off SNAP by the millions and the charitable food network and the states cannot make up for the shortfall. So, people are just going to be at a loss, and they are not going to have a way to make ends meet.\u201d"

      "But her role in the investigation into the slaying of Tim Mumbrue and Tanna Togstad led to an outcome she never could have imagined: three years ago, authorities concluded that her cousin, not her now-deceased father, fatally stabbed the couple on March 21, 1992.",
      "For more on the case, tune in to \"Raising the Dead\" on \"Dateline\" at 9 ET/8 CT tonight.",
      "Just as head-spinning, that cousin, Tony Haase, was acquitted in the murders earlier this year. During a nearly monthlong trial, Haase\u2019s lawyers made the case that the evidence pointed at Heather Thiel\u2019s dead father, Jeff Thiel.",
      "For Heather Thiel, who is 40 and works at a group home for mentally ill adults, the whiplash of the last three years left her questioning longstanding beliefs and wrestling with a familiar feeling.",
      "\u201cI wish there was a definite answer,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I feel like we still don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d",
      "Fixated on murder",
      "On March 11, 1995, Jeff Thiel pointed a shotgun at a law enforcement officer after he was pulled over in a traffic stop. The officer retreated to his car, and Jeff Thiel, who\u2019d worked in the maintenance department of an iron foundry in a rural community east of Green Bay, escaped, Haase\u2019s defense attorney said at trial.",
      "He blew through a roadblock and fled the state, said the attorney, John Birdsall.",
      "Nearly three months later, in a hotel room in Washington state, Jeff Thiel died by suicide, according to his daughter. He was 44.",
      "Heather Thiel, who was 11 when her mother told her the news, can still recall her response:",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018When\u2019s the party?\u2019\u201d",
      "Heather Thiel described her father as a scary and abusive parent who killed neighborhood pets and would casually \u2014 and routinely \u2014 threaten to shoot her mother. Her mom, Marie Stanchik, also believed her ex-husband was a killer. In an interview with authorities three years ago, she recalled how his \u201cultimate dream was to kill somebody.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe used to tell me that all the time,\u201d Stanchik said, according to audio of the interview. \u201cHe\u2019s had a gun in my face and said if I ever call the cops on him, he\u2019s gonna use it.\u201d",
      "Jeff Thiel also had a thing for knives, said Heather Thiel, who has memories of him sitting in a recliner with sharpening tools and blades. Because he worked at a foundry, she said she came to believe he easily could have brought a murder weapon to work with him and melted it down.",
      "And there was this comment, which she said her father made the day Togstad and Mumbrue were killed: \u201cIt\u2019s funny how you can get away with murder these days.\u201d",
      "A suspect from the start",
      "The murders were brutal. They were found in the bedroom of Togstad\u2019s farmhouse. Mumbrue, 34, was stabbed 27 times, according to a forensic pathologist who testified at Haase\u2019s trial. His throat had been cut. Togstad, 23, had been stabbed once in the chest and appeared to have been sexually assaulted.",
      "Even Togstad\u2019s dog, a terrier named Scruffy, was fatally stabbed.",
      "According to one of the original detectives who investigated the case, authorities focused on Jeff Thiel as a possible suspect early on.",
      "\u201cWith his background and build and strength, he was certainly a person that we had to go after,\u201d said Al Kraeger, who retired from the Waupaca County Sheriff\u2019s Department six years ago.",
      "But physical evidence soon cleared those suspicions for law enforcement, said Capt. Nick Traeger of the Waupaca County Sheriff\u2019s Department. In 1996, just as DNA was revolutionizing forensic sciences, an analysis eliminated Jeff Thiel as the person who sexually assaulted Togstad, Traeger told \u201cDateline.\u201d",
      "A blood sample taken from the clothes he was wearing at the time of his suicide did not match semen found on Togstad, the captain said.",
      "Heather Thiel said she knew none of this. And as the years passed and no arrests were made, she said she would tell anyone who would listen that her father was probably responsible for the murders.",
      "In 2010, she saw a billboard authorities had put up seeking information about the killings and called the listed phone number.",
      "According to a law enforcement summary of the interview that followed, Heather Thiel told investigators about her father\u2019s habit of killing animals and his casual comments about murder. She told them that he\u2019d wanted to be with Togstad and had an obsession with knives. And she told them that he\u2019d taken his own life after fleeing from law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI had spent my whole life thinking my dad did this and maybe I\u2019d get answers,\u201d Heather Thiel said. \u201cBut then, literally nothing came of it.\u201d",
      "One of the investigators who interviewed Heather Thiel, Mike Sasse of the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation, said that they did nothing with her information because he already knew that DNA had eliminated Jeff Thiel as a suspect years earlier.",
      "\u201cNow, could he have been a peripheral character\u201d in the murders? Sasse added. \u201cAt that time, yes, he could have been.\u201d",
      "A confession from a night in a 'drunken stupor'",
      "More than a decade passed and still, there were no arrests.",
      "Then, on April 8, 2022, Heather Thiel found herself speaking to law enforcement \u2014 again. This time, her mother was present for the interview, according to a case report from the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation. Authorities were interested in obtaining their DNA and learning about the family\u2019s allegations against Jeff Thiel, the report states.",
      "During the interview, Heather Thiel said she raised the same concerns that she\u2019d detailed for Sasse in 2010. She provided a buccal swab, she said, as well as access to a family tree she\u2019d been developing on a genealogy site.",
      "\u201cShe turned on her profile, and it was like the Christmas tree lit up,\u201d said Traeger, one of the investigators who interviewed her.",
      "The mystery DNA obtained from the crime scene did not match Jeff Thiel, Traeger said, but it did match someone else in the family \u2014 Heather Thiel\u2019s cousin, Tony Haase, a father of four with no criminal record who worked at the same iron foundry as Jeff Thiel.",
      "Authorities confirmed the link by surreptitiously collecting Haase\u2019s DNA from a pen during a traffic stop, Traeger said.",
      "During interviews with authorities, Haase, 54, denied that he had anything to do with the murders. When one of the officers told him that his DNA was found at the crime scene, he said: \u201cI still don\u2019t buy it,\u201d a video of the interview shows.",
      "But as investigators continued to press Haase, he admitted that over the years he\u2019d had \u201clittle clicks\u201d \u2014 or memories \u2014 that made him wonder if he\u2019d been involved in the killings. He said he remembered a barbell in the house \u2014 crime scene photos showed one in the bedroom \u2014 then leaving the house and vomiting outside, according to the video.",
      "In an interview at the sheriff\u2019s office, investigators said this latter detail was a natural human response following an extreme event.",
      "Haase described how his father had been killed in an accident while racing snowmobiles with Togstad\u2019s father, and how on the night the couple was killed, he was drunk and all he could think about was the accident.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t go there to hurt nobody,\u201d he told investigators. \u201cI honestly can tell you that I don\u2019t know what started, what happened, what started it all.\u201d",
      "Asked why it took so long for him to acknowledge what he\u2019d done, Haase said: \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want it to sound like I had this planned.\u201d",
      "On Aug. 11, 2022, Haase was arrested for the murders of Togstad and Mumbrue. A probable cause affidavit filed in Waupaca Circuit Court said that at the time of the killings he\u2019d been in a \u201cdrunken stupor.\u201d",
      "Doubt surrounds murder trial",
      "Heather Thiel was shocked. She didn\u2019t know her cousin well but said he didn\u2019t seem to have a mean bone in his body.",
      "The arrest also prompted some self-reflection.",
      "\u201cI was like, how could I have had it wrong?\u201d she said. \u201cIf I was wrong about my dad and it was actually my cousin \u2014 well, sorry, you should pay for what you did.\u201d",
      "Jeff Thiel, however, continued to loom over the case as Haase\u2019s trial approached.",
      "In a pretrial hearing in May, Haase\u2019s attorneys said that because Jeff Thiel\u2019s genetic profile had not been excluded from all of the blood evidence gathered at the crime scene, they should be able to argue at trial that he was still a possible suspect in the murders.",
      "Prosecutors objected, but the judge sided with the defense, a transcript shows. So the state asked to exhume Jeff Thiel\u2019s remains to carry out additional DNA testing \u2014 a process that Waupaca County District Attorney Kat Turner said would allow them to exclude him from physical evidence gathered at the scene.",
      "In June, Jeff Thiel\u2019s remains were disinterred from a Waupaca County cemetery.",
      "\u201cThe DNA analyst worked on nothing but that until he had the analysis complete,\u201d Turner told \u201cDateline.\u201d \u201cAnd again, excluded Jeff Thiel from all of the blood evidence that was available.\u201d",
      "In the pretrial proceedings, Haase\u2019s lawyers sought to bar that evidence because they said they didn\u2019t have time to prepare a response before trial, which was scheduled to start two weeks later. Prosecutors again objected, Turner said, but the judge ruled that if the trial started as scheduled, the state would be prohibited from presenting any DNA evidence related to Jeff Thiel.",
      "Instead of delaying the trial and challenging the ruling \u2014 a process that could have taken years, Turner said \u2014 the prosecution forged ahead. Turner said that decision was made after consulting with victims\u2019 families and weighing the challenge of trying an old case in which investigators and scientists were becoming sick or dying.",
      "'Somebody who has no conscience'",
      "Haase\u2019s trial began in July in a Waupaca County courthouse. His attorneys argued that Haase\u2019s confession had been coerced \u2014 investigators planted false memories in an hourslong interrogation \u2014 and they said the male DNA found on Togstad\u2019s body had been degraded by years of testing and storage.",
      "As evidence of Jeff Thiel\u2019s involvement in the murders, attorney John Birdsall cited an apparent motive \u2014 Tanna had rejected Jeff Thiel\u2019s advances \u2014 and he linked Jeff Thiel\u2019s habit of killing pets to Scruffy\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cThis was killed by somebody who has no conscience, who has absolutely no problem killing anything in its path,\u201d he said in his closing argument. \u201cThat\u2019s Jeff.\u201d",
      "Amy Ohtani, the assistant attorney general who also prosecuted the case, described the defense\u2019s strategy as an effort to \u201cweave together a fantasy to keep you from paying attention to the actual evidence.\u201d The DNA had been properly collected, preserved and tested, she said in her closing argument, and the idea that Haase\u2019s admissions were false was a \u201cdistraction.\u201d",
      "Jeff Thiel, she said, was the \u201cperfect scapegoat.\u201d",
      "At trial, she said, he\u2019d been described by family members as an \u201cabsolutely terrible person\u201d \u2014 but wasn\u2019t there to defend himself and there was no evidence actually linking him to the crime.",
      "\u201cJeff Thiel sounds like he was a terrible guy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean he killed Tim and Tanna.\u201d",
      "On the fourth day of deliberations, the jury acquitted Haase of the murders.",
      "For his cousin, that decision was the right one. Heather Thiel had come to doubt the forensics that excluded her father from the murders and linked her cousin to them, she said, and she believed Haase had been coerced into making a false confession.",
      "Although the trial produced no definitive answers, Heather Thiel said, the proceedings prompted her to return to a long-held position about who killed Mumbrue and Togstad.",
      "\u201cUntil proven otherwise, I will always believe it\u2019s my dad,\u201d she said."

      "The baby girl was born into the pant leg of Congious\u2019 beige uniform on May 17, 2020, in the Tarrant County, Texas, jail. The newborn struggled to breathe. The umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck \u2014 a common problem often resolved with a quick unraveling by a doctor\u2019s hands.",
      "But no one was there to help. Congious\u2019 daughter, named Zenorah, died days later.",
      "Horrific scenes like this are unfolding in jails across the country, according to a yearlong investigation from Bloomberg Law and NBC News that reveals systemic failures. Pregnant women are locked up, often for petty crimes, and say their cries for help go ignored. They are miscarrying or giving birth in excruciating pain into cell toilets or on filthy jail floors. Newborns are suffering infections and long-lasting health issues, their mothers say. Some babies die.",
      "These catastrophes are largely hidden from public view. To bring them to light, this investigation relied on thousands of pages of legal complaints, depositions, police reports, medical and jail records, and body camera and surveillance video. Reporters interviewed more than 60 people including a dozen formerly incarcerated women. Among the tragedies:",

      "In California, a correctional officer stopped at a Starbucks while driving a woman in premature labor to the hospital, she said. The baby died.",
      "\u201cTo deprive someone of that kind of basic access to health care in this country is unfathomable,\u201d said Dr. Theresa Cheng, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of California San Francisco who works with incarcerated patients and reviewed Bloomberg Law and NBC News\u2019 findings.",
      "In a first-of-its-kind analysis of federal civil rights lawsuits from 2017 to 2024, reporters found at least 54 pregnant women or their families have alleged severe mistreatment or medical neglect in jails. And it keeps happening: In September, a Texas woman said she gave birth in her Johnson County Jail cell hours after alerting staff she was in labor.",
      "\u201cWhat it shows,\u201d Cheng said, \u201cis we don\u2019t see these people as human beings.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a long history in medicine of not believing women in distress. Yet pregnant women in jail often face another obstacle: They say they are presumed to be unfit mothers. That bias can lead correctional workers to dismiss their medical complaints and regard them with doubt or contempt.",
      "\u201cWhen staff see their patients as inmates and not as patients and as mothers, this is the result,\u201d said Julia Yoo, a lawyer who has represented incarcerated women for 20 years and is a past president of the National Police Accountability Project, which fights abuses in jails.",
      "\u201cThe value of human life in prison and jail is worth less \u2014 including for these children, because of who their parents are,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are born with a stigma or they are not even born at all because they are viewed as not worthy of life.\u201d",
      "While this investigation offers the most detailed look at the issue to date, experts on incarcerated women\u2019s health said its tally from civil rights cases is a considerable undercount. There is no comprehensive data on pregnancies in jail, even when a baby dies, because the federal government does not require it. At least 22 states said they don\u2019t track pregnancy outcomes in jail. And filing a lawsuit can be costly and challenging.",
      "Most of the women in these cases were arrested on low-level charges that included probation violations, theft and drug possession. They were housed in jails, largely intended for short-term detention as criminal cases unfold, not prisons, which are for punishment after a conviction. Many could have made it to a hospital if they had been able to afford bail; some said they faced fees as low as $125.",
      "Their babies paid the price.",
      "Alyssia Moulton was arrested on suspicion of shoplifting trash bags at a Walmart in August 2023 and taken to Montgomery County Jail in Tennessee. Her son was born into the toilet of her cell, landing in dirty water, she said, as he struggled to take his first breath. He hit his head on the metal seat and contracted blood and eye infections.",
      "Moulton was withdrawing from opioids when she was arrested. The standard of care for pregnant women is treatment with medications such as methadone to avoid complications like preterm labor. A nurse said that Moulton had refused detox medication, but Moulton said in a lawsuit she wasn\u2019t offered any. At least six other women alleged they, too, were deprived of withdrawal treatment while jailed.",
      "Moulton said she begged to go to the hospital when labor pains began, but staff offered her only water and Tylenol.",
      "\u201cIt was hell,\u201d Moulton said in an April interview. \u201cNobody believed me.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Montgomery County Jail said it provides obstetric care and does not plan for women to give birth inside the facility. Moulton sued the jail\u2019s medical provider, Southern Health Partners, which denied the allegations but agreed to a confidential settlement this fall.",
      "Moulton is now sober, and her son, who recently celebrated his second birthday, is one of 21 babies who survived out of the 54 cases reviewed. Twelve suffered infections, diseases or birth defects that mothers believe could have been prevented, the investigation found.",
      "Six women delivered babies who were born alive but died within days. Six endured stillbirths. Sixteen had miscarriages. Four survived ectopic pregnancies, which can be fatal. Some women required liters of blood transfusions after hemorrhaging for days. Some can never have children again. Two women died.",
      "There\u2019s no way to be certain whether these pregnancy complications occurred because of a woman\u2019s time behind bars. About 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. Stillbirths occur in about 1 out of 175 births.",
      "But unsanitary conditions and limited access to prenatal care, medical providers and critical medication are factors that can affect a healthy birth or contribute to preterm labor.",
      "About half of the lawsuits were settled, according to court documents and interviews, with payouts ranging from $200,000 into the millions. Many were dismissed, sometimes because a judge ruled that they did not meet the legal bar of proving \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d by jail or medical staff. Several cases are still pending.",
      "Most of the jails and health care companies that were sued did not respond to questions. In court filings, they generally denied wrongdoing, defending the care they provided. Some said the women had misstated facts, or they pointed to mothers\u2019 drug use or limited prenatal care before being jailed.",
      "There is a solution to this crisis, offered not just by women\u2019s health advocates but also by some law enforcement officials: Fewer pregnant women should be jailed, particularly for nonviolent offenses.",
      "Some states have taken steps in this direction. Illinois, Maryland and Tennessee  have adopted laws that allow shorter sentences or alternatives to jail for pregnant women. In Virginia, a new law makes it easier for pregnant women to be released on bail.",
      "But such reforms remain rare.",
      "\u201cThere is no excuse or reason for a woman to have to give birth by herself without any help,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California Democrat who sponsored a bill that sought to improve health care for pregnant women behind bars.",
      "She called Bloomberg Law and NBC News\u2019 findings \u201cshocking and horrifying\u201d and said she plans to reintroduce the Pregnant Women in Custody Act, which stalled in a fractured Congress in 2023.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s malfeasance,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are akin to human rights violations.\u201d",
      "The call to police",
      "The night Chasity Congious got pregnant in the summer of 2019, she was out with friends, \u201chaving a good time, growing up,\u201d she said. She had her nicest outfit on and met someone in a hotel room she thought she would like to marry.",
      "Congious has schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder and developmental disabilities. She was sick of being called \u201cslow\u201d and yearned for a chance to be like other 20-somethings.",
      "She lived in Fort Worth with her mother, Kim Hammond, a crisis intervention therapist, and shared a room with her younger sister, where butterfly decals adorned the walls and stuffed animals lined her bed. A self-proclaimed \u201cgirly girl,\u201d Congious filled her wardrobe with pink and liked dancing to hip-hop and gospel music.",
      "\u201cI wanted to start a new life,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m somebody, too. I get a chance in this world, right?\u201d"

      "The \"Wicked: For Good\" soundtrack is finally here, and with it comes the official cast recordings of two songs that are brand new to the musical.",
      "\"No Place Like Home,\" sung by Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, and \"The Girl in the Bubble,\" by Ariana Grande's Glinda, were written specifically for \"Wicked's\" sequel film \u2014 an addition director Jon M. Chu calls \"really natural.\"",
      "\"We needed it in the story and how we wanted to really dive into each character,\" he says in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "Both songs were written by the original composer and lyricist for \"Wicked,\" Stephen Schwartz, and both are ballads. In \"No Place Like Home,\" Elphaba tries to get the animals to change their minds about fleeing Oz. Then later in the film, \"The Girl in the Bubble\" narrates Glinda's decision between taking a stand or remaining complicit in the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and Madame Morrible's (Michelle Yeoh) witch hunt of Elphaba.",
      "Below, read the lyrics to \"Wicked: For Good's\" new songs and find out what each reveals about the film's leading ladies.",
      "'No Place Like Home'",
      "\"No Place Like Home\" is the third song in \"Wicked: For Good\" and it serves to establish what Elphaba's rebellion against the Wizard looks like in Oz. In addition to disrupting the construction of the Yellow Brick Road, she tries to prevent the animals, who are being captured and stripped of their rights, from leaving Oz, arguing in the film's chorus, \"There's no place like home.\"",
      "Erivo tells TODAY.com that she and Schwartz spoke about how to make those lines from \"The Wizard of Oz\" \u2014 which are repeated when Dorothy clicks the heels of her ruby slippers to try and leave Oz and return to Kansas \u2014\u00a0\"make sense for Elphaba's story.\"",
      "\"If those are the words that I was going to say, 'No Place Like Home,' the iconic words, it had to count,\" Erivo says. \"I had to make sure that saying them meant something.\"",
      "Dana Fox, who co-wrote the screenplay of \"Wicked: For Good\" with Winnie Holzman, calls the song a \"beautiful anthem.\"",
      "\"What's so powerful about it, weirdly, is first of all the idea that, how do you love a place that doesn't seem to love you back, feels so deep and profound right now,\" Fox says. \"That's tough to watch right now.\"",
      "And adding to that heartbreak, the \"extraordinary anthem\" doesn't work.",
      "\"The animals don't stay. She can't convince them,\" Fox explains. \"The truth is they're probably right to leave. At that moment, they are doing what's best for them, what is the safest choice for them.\"",
      "'No Place Like Home' Lyrics",
      "Why do I love this place",
      "That\u2019s never loved me?",
      "A place that seems to be devolving",
      "And even wanting to?",
      "But Oz is more than just a place",
      "It\u2019s a promise, an idea",
      "And I want to help make it come true",
      "Why should a land have so much meaning",
      "When dark times befall it?",
      "It\u2019s only land, made of dirt and rock and loam",
      "It\u2019s just a place that\u2019s familiar",
      "And \u201chome's\u201d just what we call it",
      "But there\u2019s no place like home",
      "Don\u2019t we all know",

      "When you feel you can\u2019t fight anymore",
      "Just tell yours\u0435lf",
      "There\u2019s no place lik\u0435 home",
      "When you feel it\u2019s not worth fighting for",
      "Compel yourself",
      "Because there\u2019s no place like home",
      "When you want to leave",
      "Discouraged and resigned",
      "That\u2019s what they want you to do",

      "There\u2019s no place like home",
      "'The Girl in the Bubble'",
      "\"The Girl in the Bubble\" comes in toward the end of \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "The film opens with Glinda quite literally receiving her own powers of flight via a mechanical pink bubble, part of her status as the figurehead \"Glinda the Good.\" She has been tasked with lifting Ozians' spirits amid the Wizard's campaign to paint Elphaba as a \"Wicked Witch\" terrorizing the land.",
      "Throughout the film, Glinda's ability to trust the Wizard and Madame Morrible is tested. After her fianc\u00e9, Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey), and Elphaba run away together on Glinda's wedding day, she helps draw Elphaba out of hiding by targeting her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode).",
      "But once Glinda realizes Madame Morrible was responsible for the twister that resulted in Nessarose's death, she's forced to look at her own complicity.",
      "\"The idea of 'The Girl in the Bubble' is really interesting because it could feel like a person talking about how they feel, or it could feel like a person making a decision,\" Fox says. \"Where we had to make sure it landed was somewhere where it felt like it was motivating her to do something different, instead of just, 'Oh I'm sad I'm the girl in the bubble.'\"",

      "\"We played around with it actually even in post (production),\" Fox reveals.",
      "The song, and Glinda's decision in the end to \"pop\" her bubble, can represent the culmination of her character arc.",
      "\"Part of deconstructing the fairy tale, which is sort of the point of 'Wicked' ... part of that was understanding not just what Elphaba was going through, but also what it means for somebody in a bubble of privilege, when the truth is coming out and when people, the powerless, are going through things,\" Chu says. \"At one point does someone who doesn't have to be affected by this, what kind of courage does it take to actually pop your own bubble and engage and help somebody else?\"",

    "story": [
      "Warning: This article contains spoilers for the ending of \u201cWicked: For Good.\u201d",
      "\u201cWicked: For Good\u201d brings fans the long-awaited finale to the film adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical. And a small change at the very, very end may signify a big change from the original story.",
      "Like the musical, the story ends with Glinda (Ariana Grande) and Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) forced to separate after belting out Act II\u2019s signature song, \u201cFor Good.\u201d Glinda, watching shadows through a cracked door, sees Elphaba melt after Dorothy throws a pail of water at her. Glinda escapes on horseback, shrouded in a black cape. (Yes, Glinda was the mysterious figure we saw escaping a castle in the very first scene of the first \u201cWicked\u201d movie.) She goes on to assume power in Oz as she mourns her best friend\u2019s death.",
      "Only Elphaba isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s hiding in a trapdoor, waiting for her beloved Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) to meet her before they leave for the Land Beyond Oz together.",
      "From there, viewers get a bit of a twist before the movie concludes. Here\u2019s what happens.",
      "How \u2018Wicked: For Good\u2019 Ends",
      "The stage version of \u201cWicked\u201d ends with Elphaba and Fiyero leaving Oz, and Glinda stepping into a position of power.",
      "But in \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d viewers see what happens to Glinda after she becomes Oz\u2019s leader. First, she officially declares the land welcome to all animals again.",
      "In the final scene, Glinda looks over the Emerald City as Elphaba and Fiyero trek through a desert to leave Oz. Elphaba looks back for a brief moment. Then Elphaba\u2019s book of spells, the Grimmerie, flutters to life before Glinda\u2019s eyes. Elphaba had given the book to Glinda before Elphaba\u2019s encounter with Dorothy.",
      "As established in the first film, the Grimmerie only opens for and can be read by a true witch, something that, as much as she tried \u2014  whether through begging Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) for sorcery lessons or twirling her practice wand \u2014 Glinda decidedly was not.",
      "So what does the Grimmerie opening mean?",
      "We asked the team behind \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d for their takes on the final scene. See what director Jon M. Chu and stars Cynthia Erivo, Jeff Goldblum and Jonathan Bailey had to say.",
      "How \u2018Wicked: For Good\u2019 Stars Interpret the Ending",
      "Chu declines to say \u201cexactly what (the ending) is\u201d by his intention.",
      "But he points to all the different interpretations of what the Grimmerie, \u201ca book of knowledge,\u201d could be, relative to both Glinda and Elphaba.",
      "\u201cWhether (Glinda) finally gets to be who she\u2019s meant to be, that she\u2019s not reliant on this image in this mirror,\u201d Chu says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be good.\u2019 She says, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to be good.\u2019",
      "\u201cJust the effort of trying to be who we\u2019re supposed to be opens and unlocks our unlimited possibilities,\u201d he adds.",
      "The spontaneous opening of the Grimmerie could also relate to the film\u2019s theme of pursuing the truth amid propaganda. By the end of the film, Elphaba\u2019s reputation as the Wicked Witch of the West as told in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is upended by political lies told by the nonmagical Wizard of Oz and, as actor Michelle Yeoh says, the true wicked witch, Madame Morrible. But while viewers know the truth, in the world of the movie, Ozians do not, after Elphaba tells Glinda not to clear her name.",
      "\u201cIt could also be, Cynthia could be Jesus giving us, the humans, this Bible and saying, you know the truth, now what are you going to do with it?\u201d Chu says.",
      "\u201cI think it is a challenge to us as the audience, whereas maybe movie one was more of an answer. This is more a question and challenge for us to see how we\u2019re going to tell our story to the next generation,\u201d he adds.",
      "Erivo says Elphaba leaving the Grimmerie behind represents her entrusting it to Glinda.",
      "\u201cI think Elphaba\u2019s powers exist independent of the Grimmerie, and because she has certain powers, she\u2019s able to read the Grimmerie. It\u2019s like she and Grimmerie have an intrinsic relationship, and so the Grimmerie answers to her,\u201d she explains.",
      "\u201cBut her leaving it behind and trusting it to Glinda essentially tells the Grimmerie, \u2018You\u2019re in new hands, trust this person,\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t mean Elphaba\u2019s lost her connection with the book. She says she believes Elphaba in fact can see the Grimmerie opening for Glinda.",
      "\u201cShe has visions, so I think she can see what happens, and she can feel it. And it opening means to her that, one, Glinda\u2019s made the right decision, and two, the Grimmerie trusts Glinda now, so everything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she says.",
      "But does Glinda know Elphaba is watching over her?",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba has something to do with it (opening), but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba\u2019s alive,\u201d Erivo says.",
      "As for Goldblum, who stars as the Wizard of Oz, he is curious what leaving the Grimmerie behind means for Elphaba\u2019s powers. He also wonders: Why couldn\u2019t Elphaba trust Glinda with the knowledge that they survived?",
      "\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t she trust that, \u2018Hey we\u2019re going to be OK, don\u2019t try to contact us ... Don\u2019t tell anybody that we faked it.\u2019 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Goldblum says. \u201cOr, is the loss that (Glinda) experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power. Her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she\u2019s ever had with Elphaba, does that trigger her ability to power?\u201d",
      "As for the opening of the Grimmerie, Goldblum says it\u2019s possible for Elphaba to \u201ctelepathically\u201d \u201ccommune\u201d with Glinda across space.",
      "\u201cDoes Glinda go, \u2018I don\u2019t think I did that. Are you out there somewhere. Are you OK?\u2019\u201d he adds. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s meant to be ambiguous.\u201d",
      "Like Goldblum, Bailey believes there\u2019s a chance the opening of the Grimmerie was Elphaba sending Glinda a message.",
      "\u201cI think that the answers always lie in the Grimmerie, and I do think it\u2019s particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive for someone ... (with) the absolute knowledge that she has no magic and that she has no power,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cTo see the Grimmerie come alive feels to me like a transference and a conversation between the two women.\u201d",
      "He believes this, even if it\u2019s not so literal of a conversation or message.",
      "\u201cAs we know with grief as well, those people do always exist in a different form, don\u2019t they? In a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together,\u201d he adds.",
      "Holzman, who wrote the book for \u201cWicked\u201d and co-wrote the screenplays for both films with writer Dana Fox, says the goal for the ending was to create a \u201cmystical moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith something mystical, it\u2019s not like the whole point is you know the answer, it\u2019s that it pulls something out of you, like a spiritual feeling,\u201d she says.",
      "One interpretation of the Grimmerie opening, Holzman says, has to do with the evolution of Glinda\u2019s character.",
      "\u201cShe was willing to let go ... of all the need to be admired in this empty way. And she was willing to be humble, to be a student, to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know everything,\u2019\u201d Holzman says.",
      "Fox adds that the moment Glinda \u201cearns\u201d the Grimmerie opening is when she admits her \u201cdeepest shame\u201d to Elphaba: that she can\u2019t read the Grimmerie and perform spells.",
      "\u201cShe wanted so much to be that magical creature who could make magic happen, and she\u2019s going to end up being that, but it\u2019s going to take hard work,\u201d Holzman says. \u201cAnd to me, the Grimmerie opening is like the Grimmerie saying, \u2018OK, you\u2019re ready.\u2019\u201d",
      "But the question remains: Does Elphaba know?",
      "\u201cI think the thing that really is up to interpretation that everyone should just talk about amongst themselves is, Does Elphaba know? Did she have anything to do with it? I think that is something that just everyone should decide for themselves,\u201d Fox says."

      "\u201cI don\u2019t care what artists say. I don\u2019t care what artists act like. I\u2019m going to tell you the real truth. There\u2019s not an artist in the world that didn\u2019t grow up watching the Grammys when they were a kid and walk in their bedrooms afterwards and rehearse their speech,\u201d he said. \u201cGod will take something that\u2019s either normal and make it extremely abnormal or he will take something that\u2019s already incredible and make it absolutely mesmerizing, and that\u2019s the case here.\u201d",
      "He said that now he gets to celebrate this achievement while in \u201cthe best headspace.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see all my friends in this category. But then I just see standing there is this album called \u2018Beautifully Broken,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cMan, if that doesn\u2019t represent what\u2019s happening in the world right now. I think more than ever\u2026 I think we can find beauty in what\u2019s happening. Win, lose or draw. Holy f---, dude, we won.\u201d",
      "He expressed his gratitude again to the Record Academy and said he wouldn\u2019t have accomplished anything without his faith.",
      "Before signing off, he encouraged his fans to mock his beardless face.",
      "\u201cI thought my chin went at least a half inch further than it actually went, f---. I didn\u2019t know. Failed science experiment, y\u2019all!\u201d he said.",
      "Jelly Roll uploaded the snippet of his newly shaven face to Instagram, too. Celebrity friends complimented him about his Grammy nominations beneath the post.",
      "Charlie Puth said, \u201cVery inspiring man.\u201d",
      "Country singer Carly Pearce echoed that sentiment, calling Jelly Roll \u201can inspiration.\u201d",

      "\u201cHey i love ninja turtles,\u201d a third wrote.",
      "This is the latest dramatic transformation Jelly Roll has shared with his fans. Over the past year, he has also opened up repeatedly about losing weight.",
      "While appearing on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d in April, he said his goal was to be under 250 pounds before explaining why losing weight is important to him.",
      "\u201cTo do all the fun stuff in life, you\u2019ve gotta be under 250,\u201d he told host Jimmy Kimmel before mentioning skydiving, riding a rollercoaster, riding a bull and wrestling an alligator. \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of things I want to do.\u201d",
      "He gave a progress update in August while giving a speech to the Tennessee Titans. \u201cI lost 200 pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cI told coach I\u2019m getting a contract if I lose another 50.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "After eight weeks of marriage, the cast of \"Married at First Sight\" reached the end of their romantic experiment in the Season 19 finale.",
      "During the action-packed episode, the five couples were tasked with deciding whether to stay married to the person they met for the first time at the altar \u2014 or go their separate ways.",
      "Following the finale, the entire Season 19 cast got together for a reunion special to share the current status of their relationships since filming wrapped a year and a half ago.",
      "Who ended up together and who got divorced? Here's a full recap.",
      "Jalyn and Josh",
      "How it started: After getting married at first sight, Jalyn and Josh quickly reached a level of comfort with each other. They embarked on the experiment alongside Jalyn's mother, Belynda, who married Chad at first sight.",
      "How it went: Over the course of eight weeks, the newlyweds encountered several highs and lows. They experienced trust issues when Josh claimed that he had unfollowed his ex-girlfriend on social media, but later revealed that he hadn't.",
      "The couple learned that they had a few key personality differences when Josh expressed how passionate he was about attending music festivals, namely Burning Man. Jalyn didn't share the same interest and wasn't sure that she'd feel comfortable attending the event. Josh was concerned that he would lose the sense of community he finds at Burning Man if his wife didn't support his passion.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: Going into decision day, Josh was feeling \u201cextremely thankful\u201d about his experience with Jalyn.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely had our ups and downs but I think we\u2019ve had far more ups and the downs have always brought us closer,\u201d he said.",
      "Josh acknowledged that he envisioned \"a great future\" with his wife and said decision day would \"take a part of me with it\" if Jalyn decided against continuing their marriage.",
      "Meanwhile, Jalyn opened up about her \"biggest reservations\" as she prepared for decision day, saying she and Josh are \"different people\" who are \"in two different lanes in a lot of ways.\"",
      "\"I feel like this is make or break for me. I think in the past anytime I saw a red flag, I ended the relationship but now I'm married and I don't know what you work through and what you don't. But I hope to feel confident and secure in my decision,\" she said.",
      "When decision time arrived, Both Jalyn and Josh decided to stay married and expressed confidence in the way they had addressed obstacles in their relationship so far.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion special, Jalyn revealed that she and Josh broke up three months before filming the reunion. They both had different versions of their breakup story, with Jalyn saying Josh broached the subject while they were on vacation.",
      "\"He looked at me and he said, 'I don't feel connected to you anymore. I want to break up,'\" she recalled.",
      "After agreeing to try to work things out, they went home and a few days later, Josh initiated the breakup again.",
      "Jalyn said she bent over backwards to channel her adventurous side and did attend Burning Man, along with several other music festivals, for Josh. In the end, however, he said she wasn't adventurous enough for him.",
      "Jalyn also claimed that Josh \"lied\" about many things in their relationship, such as telling her a female coworker was younger than he originally stated.",
      "Meghann and Derrek",
      "How it started: When Meghann and Derrek got married, the physical attraction was immediately present. The newlyweds shared a passion for healthy living and seemed to have a lot in common.",
      "How it went: Meghann and Derrek encountered a few issues throughout the experiment. For instance, Derrek thought Meghann was too defensive in their conversations, and she wanted him to be more vulnerable. They also had misaligned expectations on their household roles and duties.",
      "When Meghann discovered that she was pregnant, their relationship shifted for the better, with both of the newlyweds committing to their connection.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: On decision day, Derrek noted that Meghann's pregnancy added \"a whole other element\" to the experiment. Still, he was feeling confident going into the discussion.",
      "On her way to filming, Meghann reflected on the moment, saying, \"We have a lot of things that are gonna hit us, a lot of new things in the future that we're gonna have to figure out. And we need to really work through this.\"",
      "While sitting down with the relationship experts, the couple announced their pregnancy. When the big moment arrived, Derrek went first and shared his decision.",
      "\"You are extremely caring and compassionate and without any hesitation, 100% I want to stay married to you. I love you and I love your sense of humor. I love your pretty smile and your big blue eyes and I am really excited to start a family with you. I think you'll make an amazing mom and I'm just really excited for our future,\" he said.",
      "Meghann told her husband he makes her \"a better person\" and expressed her devotion to him.",
      "\"I am so excited to raise a child with you, so I am choosing to stay married to you because I can't imagine being away from you and I love you,\" she said.",
      "Are they still together? No. After agreeing to stay together in the season finale, the couple experienced a miscarriage. Despite Meghann's suggestion that they go to couples' therapy, they still struggled to communicate. One day, they had a fight and Derrek broke up with his wife over the phone then moved out.",
      "\"There's never a good time to do it. It's always going to be hard. I knew that this wasn't the right person for me. I had to be true to myself and be true to Meghann,\" Derrek said.",
      "Meghann offered her take on the breakup, saying, \"When he broke up with me, something in my head changed and I couldn't remember anything good from our relationship. I just remembered all the bad. And then I watched (the show) and then I remembered all the good and that was hard.\"",
      "Meghann said she doesn't see Derrek as a \"bad person,\" but said he didn't handle their breakup well.",
      "\"I wasn't happy. I don't think Meghann was happy,\" he said.",
      "Rhonda and Pat",
      "How it started: It didn't take long for chemistry to spark between Rhonda and Pat on their wedding day. The couple had plenty of fun at their reception and even jumped in the pool together. It was soon apparent that their fun-loving personalities were a good match.",
      "How it went: Once they started diving deeper in their relationship, Rhonda and Pat hit a few roadblocks. Rhonda told her husband she didn't feel like he was interested in hearing about her life since he regularly made the conversation about him. He was taken aback and tried to remedy the situation.",
      "Still, it was a consistent theme throughout the eight-week experiment for the newlyweds.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: While preparing to make his decision Pat admitted that he was feeling \"conflicted.\"",
      "\"Despite the disconnects and the challenges that Rhonda and I have had, we did make a deep connection. And I feel in my heart that I have established deep love for Rhonda,\" he said.",
      "While reflecting on the decision awaiting her, Rhonda said she wanted Pat to know that she \"really sincerely appreciated him and his commitment to this marriage.\"",
      "\"It's been hard but also it's been everything I think I could have ever hoped for,\" she said.",
      "When it came time to share their decisions, Rhonda said she suspected that Pat didn't want to stay married based on his closed off body language. He then explained that he ignored red flags in his first marriage and didn't want to do that this time around.",
      "\"I do not trust that I will be seen and heard as my authentic self,\" he said.",
      "Rhonda wasn't sure what he meant, so Pat explained that he had struggled hearing her repeatedly allege he didn't care about her.",
      "The relationship experts on hand encouraged the couple to talk through their issues. Rhonda apologized to Pat but said her emotional needs hadn't been met.",
      "\"I just think I've been really, really frustrated with you and my frustration pushes you away. And that's not my intention. I'm struggling on how to deal with it. So I would (like to) apologize for making you feel like I'm pushing you away,\" she said.",
      "Pat thanked his wife and said he went into the discussion not wanting to move forward, but was now thinking he may be \"being too rigid.\"",
      "Ultimately, Pat decided he wanted to continue to work on their marriage. Rhonda said she didn't feel \"as open or hopeful\" as she did going into the discussion, but wasn't ready to give up on their relationship.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion, Rhonda said she and Pat stayed together for nine months after decision day. At that point, Pat went to Europe for a month on his own. He did invite her to go, but she'd already taken a lot of time off from work and decided to stay home.",
      "When Pat returned home, Rhonda said she was \"on cloud nine\" for a period of 10 days. One day, she saw him listening to a meditation about anger and asked if he was angry that they hadn't slept together since he got home. He was, and at dinner that night he told Rhonda he was done with their relationship.",
      "During the reunion, Pat said he'd felt that way \"for quite some time.\" Rhonda then explained that he was \"very insecure\" and said \"that insecurity was a complete turnoff romantically.\"",
      "Rhonda suggested that Pat only wanted a wife, and not necessarily her, adding that he wanted physical intimacy that would turn into a romantic connection. However, she wanted a connection and said intimacy would be the icing on the cake.",
      "Belynda and Chad",
      "How it started: When Belynda and Chad got married, it was a slow burn at first. However, they both seemed committed to exploring their connection and shared some sweet moments as they got to know each other.",
      "How it went: Chad repeatedly expressed frustration with Belynda's dog sleeping in their bed throughout the experiment. He also grew tired of the filming schedule and said \"I don't give a f--- about this show\" during one heated moment. Still, the couple's connection grew over time.",
      "Before decision day, Belynda said she was doubtful that she'd want to stay married based on Chad's recent aggressive behavior.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: Belynda described her husband as \"kind, funny and sweet\" on decision day but admitted that her marriage had been \"a little exhausting at times.\"",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t want to lose my voice. I can\u2019t lose myself in a marriage and I feel like I need to remember that I\u2019m also there and that I also matter,\u201d she said.",
      "In a confessional interview, Chad said he wanted to be with his wife and couldn't \"imagine my life without Belynda.\"",
      "He also acknowledged that he had \"hurt\" his wife at times with his impatience and said he needed \"to find healthier ways to burn off some steam.\"",
      "When the moment to make a decision arrived, Chad went first, saying, \"I genuinely care about you and I believe you care about me. And I don't think there's anything we can't figure out as long as (we keep that in mind).\"",
      "Chad said he was willing to do \"whatever it takes\" to make their marriage work and asked if Belynda was willing to stay together.",
      "\"I mean, I think if anything, if I had a reason to walk away it would just be because we weren't working on it the way we committed and said we were going to. But I know that if we're working on it, we can get through it, so yes, I will stay married to you,\" she replied.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion special, Belynda and Chad announced that they were no longer married.",
      "They both recalled an incident with his cat and her dog after they returned home from decision day, saying Chad was triggered by the animals' behavior and his anxiety came out as he began to yell at Belynda, saying her dog wasn't trained.",
      "Belynda said the incident reminded her of a prior marriage when her ex-husband would yell. She decided to grab her things and left with the dog.",
      "While reflecting on their relationship, Belynda also said Chad's drinking issues were an obstacle for her to overcome.",
      "Brittany and Will",
      "How it started: Brittany and Will had a sweet connection after  they met for the first time at the altar. However, things were understandably a bit awkward at first.",
      "How it went: While getting to know each other, Brittany and Will struggled with communication issues. Brittany wanted her husband to open up and be more expressive with his emotions, but he was slow to show his vulnerable side.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: On decision day, Brittany was \"hopeful\" when she woke up. Then Will called her to say his answer was no. Still, they both showed up to the discussion to talk things out.",
      "Will arrived first and told the relationship experts he intended to leave his marriage.",
      "\"I think that throughout this, her not thinking I'm trying, her not thinking that I'm doing anything, her not feeling anything from what I'm doing, that was the theme,\" he said.",
      "Will went on to say that his wife \u201ctries to compare things to how she feels them\u201d and said \u201cif it\u2019s not how she feels, then it doesn't matter and it's not validated.\u201d",
      "When Brittany arrived, she apologized to her husband for not being able to \"express how important\" he was to her. She then called him \"the most kind, genuine, thoughtful person.\"",
      "\"I'm just so sorry if I haven't made you feel that way, if I haven't made you feel like you're important to me and your feelings are important to me, because they are,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm thankful that I was able to make you feel those things in those ways. I didn't know,\" Will replied.",
      "Will said he needed more time and walked away to gather his thoughts. When he returned, Will decided to give their marriage another try.",
      "\"Yes, I do want to be with you and I do want to continue this and I want to learn with you,\" he said.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion, Brittany revealed that she and Will hadn't spoken together since the show ended. She recalled how he went away for work for a week after the finale then ended things when he returned.",
      "Will shared his side of the story, saying he did \"adore\" Brittany and decided to stay with her in the heat of the moment since he didn't want to see her sad. However, she said she \"had an inkling\" that they would break up when he returned home."

    "story": [
      "Colleen Hoover says the legal saga involving \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni has been tough for her to process.",
      "Hoover is the author of the 2016 book that was the basis for the 2024 film of the same name. The movie has been tainted with controversy since late last year, when Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, in which she accuses him of sexual harassment on the set, as well as creating a smear campaign against her. Baldoni\u2019s $400 million countersuit against Lively and a defamation suit he filed against The New York Times was dismissed in June.",
      "The legal issues have cast a shadow over the movie, while Hoover told Elle magazine in a Nov. 20 article that the matter is \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cdisappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt feels like a circus,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen there are real people involved, with real feelings and emotions. This actually truly has impacted some of the actors\u2019 careers in huge ways. And I just find it all around sad.\u201d",
      "Hoover, who, according to Elle, was prepping to give a deposition at the time she spoke with the magazine, wants to avoid becoming part of the story herself.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just trying to stay removed from the negativity. I have my own story I could tell \u2026 but I don\u2019t want to bring attention to it, and I don\u2019t want to have to put someone else down to lift myself up. So I\u2019d rather just ignore it and let people think and say what they\u2019re going to say,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s so big at this point that there\u2019s nothing anyone can say to change whatever opinion people have of it, even though no one has the actual truth. Not even me.\u201d",
      "A New York judge on Oct. 31 formally ended Baldoni\u2019s countersuit against Lively and the Times when Baldoni and his legal team missed a deadline to file an amended complaint. Attorneys for Lively and Baldoni did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News at the time.",
      "Lively\u2019s lawsuit against Baldoni goes to trial in March 2026.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d centers on florist Lily Bloom (Lively), whose relationship with neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (Baldoni, who also directed the film) unfurls into domestic violence, following a pattern of abuse Lily witnessed by her father toward her mother.",
      "The basis of \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d was drawn from Hoover\u2019s mother\u2019s own experience. The author says the controversy takes away from what she has had to endure.",
      "\u201cThe book was inspired by her story, and now it gives us PTSD to think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel awful because I almost feel like she\u2019s gone through more with the aftermath of this film, more pain than she went through with my dad, just seeing the ugliness of it.\u201d",
      "The legal matter between Lively and Baldoni has also changed how Hoover feels about the book.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even recommend it anymore. I feel like (the lawsuit) has overshadowed it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m almost embarrassed to say I wrote it. When people ask what I do, I\u2019m just like, \u2018I\u2019m a writer. Please don\u2019t ask me what I wrote.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more time that passes, the easier everything gets for all of us,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it is sad, because I was very proud of that book. And I\u2019m still proud of it, but less publicly so. Maybe I need therapy, I don\u2019t know.\u201d"

      "Erivo spoke in an exclusive interview with Savannah Guthrie on TODAY on Nov. 20 about the potentially frightening moment when a man named Johnson Wen rushed at Grande at the event. Erivo pried Wen off Grande while costar Michelle Yeoh put her arms around Grande to pull her away from Wen.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t really thinking,\u201d Erivo said. \u201cI just wanted to make sure my friend was safe. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean us harm, but you never know with those things, and I wanted to make sure that she was OK. That was my first instinct.\u201d",

      "The man was identified as Wen, a social media influencer who has in the past stormed stage shows by performers like Katy Perry and The Weeknd. He described himself in a message to NBC News as a \u201cmega fan\u201d of Grande and said he was \u201chappy\u201d to meet her.",
      "Wen was sentenced on Nov. 17 to nine days in jail after pleading guilty to a charge of being a public nuisance.",
      "Grande\u2019s fans pointed out that she has been traumatized at previous events like the 2017 bombing of her concert in Manchester in which 22 people were killed.",
      "\u201cAfter all the trauma Ari has been through, this is beyond disrespectful,\u201d one person commented on a video of the moment posted on Instagram by Wen. \u201cNot just to her, but to the cast and to all the fans. It\u2019s literally infuriating. You should be ashamed.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "How do you solve the case of a college president being blackmailed if every member of the faculty is a suspect? You need a man on the inside. It also helps if that man is a former professor-turned private investigator.",
      "Created by Mike Shur and based the 2020 Chilean documentary \u201cThe Mole Agent,\u201d the Netflix comedic mystery \"Man on the Inside\" follows Charles Nieuwendyk (Ted Danson), an engineering professor who turns to solving mysteries.",
      "In Season 2, out Nov. 20, he investigates a cryptic blackmailer who is threatening Jack Berenger (Max Greenfield), the president of Wheeler College, and the proposed $400 million donation made by billionaire alumni Brad Vinick (Gary Cole).",
      "To complicate matters even further, the detective starts falling for one of his suspects, a vibrant music teacher named Mona (Mary Steenburgen).",
      "After Charles solved the case of a missing ruby necklace at Pacific View Retirement Community in Season 1, he finds himself in an investigative rut. Catching a man having an affair might be interesting the first time around, but after the ninth, Charles is ready to never encounter a cheating man again. That\u2019s why, when he hears about Berenger\u2019s case, he jumps at the chance to go undercover.",
      "As soon as Charles steps foot on the campus of Wheeler College, he assembles a long list of possible suspects, all of whom have a reason to detest the billionaire graduate who is known for flying his dog on a private jet every day from San Francisco to Aspen.",
      "While Charles is busy gathering evidence, his boss Julie (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) must seek help from a precarious source \u2014 who just also happens to be her estranged mother, Vanessa (Constance Marie).",
      "One theme that Shur wanted to examine in \u201cA Man on the Inside\u201d was the need for connection and how the dynamic relationship between adult children and their aging parents evolve over time.",
      "In Season 1, Charles grew distant from his daughter Emily (Mary Elizabeth Ellis) following the death of his wife.",
      "\u201cThey loved each other and were close, but drifted apart because of a tragedy that happened,\u201d Shur tells TODAY.com. Over the course of the first season, Charles learned how to communicate his shared grief with Emily.",
      "That same theme of familial reconciliation can be seen with Julie and her mother. Because Julie never discussed her personal life with Charles, Shur described how this new season was a chance for viewers to get to know Julie and her past.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason this woman is a private investigator,\u201d Shur says. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that she\u2019s so guarded and mistrustful of people \u2014 almost borderline paranoid. We thought, \u2018What if the story is her mom was a con artist and was arrested when she was a kid?\u2019 That explains a lot about that character. But then what if that woman is still in her life in a very tangential way? It was a wonderful story to tell about making amends with a parent.\u201d",
      "While Season 1 explored Charles\u2019 loneliness and heartache after his late wife\u2019s death, Season 2 adds a romantic twist for Charles. Who better to play a love interest opposite Danson than Steenburgen, his actual wife of 30 years?",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com, Danson shared how his character changed because of his newfound relationship with Mona.",
      "\u201cThe fact that you are willing to take a chance at something so vulnerable as opening your heart back up to another person takes courage,\u201d Danson says. \u201cA lot of times, people would rather not risk loss again. They play safe and rock back on their heels. It was exciting for me to play something that I believe is worth putting out in the world, which is to stay curious and go for it because life\u2019s not over.\u201d",
      "Steenburgen and Danson have been married for 30 years, but their characters only came together in their 70s. In one scene, Mona talks about how, at their age, both she and Charles have experienced terrific highs and terrible lows, but she\u2019s learned to not get stuck in the past or worry about the future. Instead, her goal is to capture the joy of the present.",

      "Mary steenburgen",
      "Steenburgen tells TODAY.com how age has helped her find those moments of bliss her character described.",
      "\u201cPart of it is that so much of my younger life was about other people,\u201d Steenburgen says. \u201cI was nurturing children. I was taking care of my parents. But now is a time where I\u2019ve gotten to grow as a person.\u201d",
      "Referencing Dylan Thomas\u2019 poem, \u201cDo not go gentle into that good night,\u201d Steenburgen adds that age isn\u2019t a time to \u201cslow down but live faster and harder.\"",

      "After several weeks of cutthroat competition, \"Squid Game: The Challenge\" just wrapped its sophomore season and declared a winner.",
      "The reality series, which is inspired by the scripted show \u201cSquid Game,\u201d tasks contestants with surviving the same challenges they witnessed in the original show. (Of course, players only pretend to die in the reality competition.)",
      "At the beginning of Season 2, 456 players embarked on a journey to win the $4.56 million prize. Along the way, they had to outlast each other in a series of high-stakes children\u2019s games.",
      "The Season 2 finale began on a high note for the five finalists \u2014 Dajah, Perla, Steven, Trinity and Vanessa \u2014 as they enjoyed a well-deserved gourmet dinner while dressed in their finale tuxedos. But the mood quickly shifted as a new game began.",
      "In a move no one saw coming, Trinity graciously sacrificed his own game to allow the other finalists to continue on in the competition. Then things got real. The remaining four contestants had to compete in a game of \"Red Light, Green Light\" with Young-hee, an animatronic doll from the show.",
      "Contestants were tasked with a race to the finish line, but they could only move after Young-hee said \"green light.\" Vanessa was eliminated first, followed by Steven.",
      "One of two people left, Dajah suffered an untimely injury while running. The motion triggered a response from Young-hee, and Dajah was eliminated, leaving Perla the last contestant standing.",
      "As she reflected on the gravity of the moment, Perla narrated her inner thoughts in a voiceover and said, \u201cI am the last woman standing. It\u2019s just me and the finish line. I had faith, I had strength and I had the luck. I am about to win \u2018Squid Game.\u2019\u201d",
      "Once Perla crossed the finish line, she dropped to her knees in joy and said, \"Thank you, God.\"",
      "In a confessional interview, Perla expressed her relief after winning.",
      "\"Now I can finally take care of my family. I can breathe now. Money is not gonna be a worry and that is just something I've never been used to. I just feel like the luckiest girl in the world right now to be honest,\" she said.",
      "After, Perla could be seen visiting her family and celebrating her big win.",
      "\"I always felt powerful, but now I'm like, 'I am powerful.' I am never doubting myself any longer. Like if I say I am gonna do something, I am gonna do it no matter what,\" she said in a voiceover. \"I am a force to be reckoned with.\"",
      "Perla Reflects on the 'Hardest Part' of 'Squid Game'",
      "Perla looked back on her time on \u201cSquid Game: The Challenge\u201d in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cI think the hardest part for me was obviously in (the) slides and ladders (game), not letting the full Bronx of me come out, and start cooking people verbally. I did a little bit of it, but not too much,\u201d she said, referencing one challenge that turned tense for the contestants.",
      "During the game, another contestant tried to make Perla feel guilty by reminding her she was playing for her son at home. The emotional manipulation didn't sit well with Perla.",
      "\"As an empath, it was really hard because obviously I do care that you have a dream and a reason to be here, but I think it\u2019s very unfair (to act that way). I have a lot of friends in the show that had kids and never threw it in anyone\u2019s face. So it was really tough,\" she said.",
      "Perla, who entered the competition with her brother, said she \"was already losing my mind\" after her sibling was eliminated.",
      "\"I was just like, this is the last thing I could hear,\" she said.",
      "Going into the competition, Perla wasn't quite prepared for how intense the experience would be.",
      "\"I knew that production plays games with you, like mental games in the dorms and setting these like little traps. But I think our season, it doubled and then we were constantly being like, 'Is this person doing that because of da da da da? Does he have a coin?'\" she said. \"So the mental games that they play with you in the dorms, it was actually even crazier to experience it than watching it from Season 1.\"",
      "What Will Perla Do With the Money?",
      "After witnessing Perla win the competition, the question on every viewer\u2019s mind is: What\u2019s she going to spend her earnings on?",
      "\u201cI will definitely buy my mom a house. That has been her dream since we all moved to America and it\u2019s really hard to get a house in America. So that would be No. 1,\" she said. \"And then, you know, get a boob job.\""

      "The docuseries, which premiered Nov. 17, explores Selena\u2019s love story with P\u00e9rez, who became a guitarist in her band.

      "P\u00e9rez successfully auditioned for a spot in Selena y Los Dinos in 1990, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "When P\u00e9rez, who was already a fan of the band, met Selena in person, he thought she was \u201cbeautiful and talented,\u201d he told  Entertainment Tonight in 2018. \u201cI\u2019m a shy person by nature, and there was something about her that was just able to pull me out,\u201d he said.",
      "The pair\u2019s relationship turned romantic after the band flew to Acapulco, Mexico. While there, P\u00e9rez felt a new closeness and chemistry with the \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom\u201d singer, he explained during a 2021 interview on the \u201cAnything for Selena\u201d podcast.",
      "When their plane began experiencing turbulence, Selena took P\u00e9rez\u2019s hand, he recalled. \u201c(I thought), maybe she was just being (a friend), she knows I\u2019m freaking out from the turbulence ... At the same time, I knew there were sparks,\u201d P\u00e9rez said.",
      "P\u00e9rez also recalled worrying about giving into his feelings. \u201cDude, she was like massaging my hand and there I am like, duh, I didn\u2019t know what to think. Add to that, we worked together,\u201d he said.",
      "When Did They Get Married?",
      "The couple initially kept their love affair a secret from Selena\u2019s father but they found it difficult to hide their joy.",
      "\u201cWe were in Laredo when we had our conversation about how we both felt the same way about each other. Selena had the biggest smile on her face when we were walking back to the bus afterward,\u201d P\u00e9rez told Texas Monthly in 2010. \u201cI\u2019m smiling right now just thinking about it. I wanted to tell her, \u2018Hey, quit smiling! You\u2019re going to give it away.\u2019 \u201d",
      "After Abraham Quintanilla found out about the couple\u2019s romance, he kicked P\u00e9rez out of the band despite Selena\u2019s protests.",
      "Selena and P\u00e9rez eloped on April 2, 1992 when Selena was 21, Texas Monthly reported. Abraham Quintanilla told the publication that after P\u00e9rez married his daughter, he \u201caccepted him as part of the family\u201d and allowed him to rejoin Selena\u2019s band. This was also confirmed in \u201cSelena y Los Dinos.\u201d",
      "Following the couple's marriage, Selena began mentioning in public her love for P\u00e9rez. When she accepted the award for female entertainer of the year at the 1993 Tejano Music Awards, she acknowledged their love in her speech.",

      "How Was Chris P\u00e9rez\u2019s Relationship With Selena\u2019s Family After Her Death?",
      "Years after Selena's death, tensions between P\u00e9rez and his father-in-law resurfaced in December 2010 when Abraham Quintanilla sued P\u00e9rez and the media production company Endemol Shine Latino to halt production of a planned Selena bioseries, NBC News reported at the time.",
      "The series was to be based on P\u00e9rez\u2019s 2012 memoir about his late wife, \u201cTo Selena with Love.\u201d",
      "Abraham Quintanilla\u2019s suit stated that his late daughter\u2019s estate, which he controlled, owns \u201call proprietary rights in the name, voice, signature, photograph, and likeness of Selena.\u201d",
      "It further stated, \u201cDefendant P\u00e9rez expressly agreed that he would not exploit any of the Entertainment Properties in any manner or medium, including, without limitation, by way of a book, television series, movie, or any other motion picture medium.\u201d",
      "Five years later, in September 2021, the pair filed a joint motion to dismiss the lawsuit, P\u00e9rez revealed.",
      "\u201cGood news! I have amicably resolved my legal dispute with the Quintanilla family,\u201d he tweeted at the time. \u201cNow that these issues are behind us, going forward, my hope, and the hope of the Quintanilla family, is for us to work together to continue to honor and celebrate the legacy of Selena.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez, who appears alongside Selena\u2019s family members in the \u201cSelena y Los Dinos\u201d docuseries, has remained close to his sister-in-law and former bandmate Suzette Quintanilla.",

      "\u201cLike everything, family has disagreements about certain things, but we\u2019re past that,\u201d Suzette Quintanilla told E! News this month during a joint interview with P\u00e9rez. \u201cI will always consider Chris family, and I know that he feels the same way about me, and that\u2019s it.\u201d",

      "P\u00e9rez told People in November 2025 that 30 years after his late wife's tragic death, she is always on his mind.",
      "\u201cI think about Selena every day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m making a decision, I can hear her in my head, like, \u2018I don\u2019t know \u2014 are you sure you wanna do that?\u2019",
      "The guitarist said the love he shared with Selena is still precious to him.",
      "\u201cAs time has gone on, you romanticize it even more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe love story is a big part of her legacy. My most prized possessions are her love letters.\u201d He reads one of her letters in \u201cSelena y Los Dinos.\u201d",
      "He added in his People interview that the pain of Selena\u2019s death still haunts him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Chris before all of that happened, and Chris after,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe\u2019s a part of both sides. I\u2019ve lived with her presence in thoughts and feelings and music. That\u2019s become my new normal. But I can\u2019t watch the end of the documentary about her death. It\u2019s just difficult.\u201d",
      "What Does Chris P\u00e9rez Say About Selena in \u2018Selena y Los Dinos\u2019?",
      "In the Netflix documentary, P\u00e9rez says he was \u201cstarstruck\u201d when he met Selena and her band.",
      "\u201cThe honest truth was I was just more taken aback by the power of the band and the music and the sound,\u201d he said, before touching on his early relationship with Selena. \u201cAt first, we didn\u2019t hang out too much. Selena was always either off with Suzette or her mom.\u201d",
      "He credited the long tour bus trips to them becoming friends.",
      "\u201cAnytime we were next to each other, it would just be me and her talking about music and movies and things like that,\u201d he said, admiring how it was \u201ccool seeing her being a normal person.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez also commented on Selena\u2019s \u201cvulnerable side,\u201d as well as spoke about their trip to Mexico as a band when he started to have stronger feelings for her.",
      "He recalled their first kiss, as well as when their bandmate Ricky Vela walked in on them. P\u00e9rez also said he was \u201cgenuinely in fear\u201d of Selena\u2019s father and what he would say.",
      "\u201cBut what we had going with each other, I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize that at all,\u201d he said.",
      "P\u00e9rez also reads a letter Selena wrote to him before they got married and recalls the moment her dad got upset with him when he found out about their relationship.",
      "Selena\u2019s widow also touches on the day he found out she died.",
      "\u201cI do miss her a lot. But today, I\u2019m very proud of what she represents and the small part that I might play in that story,\u201d he said."

      "The White House wants Kyiv to sign off on a \u201cframework\u201d to end the war in Ukraine based upon the U.S.-crafted 28-point peace plan by Thursday, according to three U.S. officials.",
      "Trump said in an interview on Brian Kilmeade's radio show Friday that the deadline is \"an appropriate time\" and said that he has no plans to lift U.S. sanctions on Russia while the administration waits for a response to the peace proposal. The president also suggested that Ukraine would \"lose in a short period of time.\"",
      "\"They're losing land,\" Trump said about Ukraine.",
      "At a gathering of reporters at the White House on Friday, Trump said that the plan is \"a way of getting peace\" that needs to be approved by Zelenskyy. \"He\u2019ll have to like it, and if he doesn\u2019t like it, then, you know, they should just keep fighting, I guess,\" Trump said.",
      "He added, \"Well, at some point he\u2019s going to have to accept something. You know he hasn\u2019t accepted. You remember right in the Oval Office, not so long ago, I said you don\u2019t have the cards.\"",
      "The U.S. communicated the Thursday deadline to the Ukrainian government, though the officials stressed this was more of a goal than a firm deadline.",
      "Negotiations to end the conflict are expected to be quite complex and will take more than a week to hash out, these officials acknowledged.",
      "On reports that the U.S. threatened to halt intelligence sharing and weapons supplies for Ukraine if the deal is rejected, a senior administration official said: \u201cIt was strongly implied to the Ukrainians that the United States expects them to agree to a peace deal. Any changes will be decided upon by the president himself.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is one of the most difficult moments in our history,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a somber 10-minute video addressed to the Ukrainian people.",
      "\u201cCurrently, the pressure on Ukraine is one of the hardest,\u201d he said. \u201cUkraine may now face a very difficult choice, either losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner, either the difficult 28 points, or a very difficult winter\u201d Zelenskyy added, urging the nation to stay united during what he said would be \"a very difficult, eventful\" week.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a more upbeat note, saying the plan could \u201cform the basis of a final peace settlement,\u201d though he said it had not been discussed \u201csubstantively\u201d with Russia.",

      "The stark warnings came as Ukraine and its allies raced to respond to the proposal that would grant Russia key demands at a moment of weakness for Kyiv.",
      "Zelenskyy later shared in a post on X that he spoke with Vice President JD Vance and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll for almost an hour Friday about the plan.",
      "\"We agreed to work together with the U.S. and Europe at the level of national security advisors to make the path to peace truly doable,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Ukraine has always respected and continues to respect U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s desire to put an end to the bloodshed, and we view every realistic proposal positively.\"",
      "The Kremlin maintained that it had not seen details of the plan, but urged Ukraine to make a \"responsible decision\" in light of mounting battlefield pressure.",

      "The sudden emergence of the plan has fueled unease across the continent, which fears a deal imposing major concessions on Ukraine could further embolden Russia.",
      "A senior U.S. official told NBC News that the plan was drawn up immediately following discussions with Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council. He \u201cagreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to President Zelenskyy,\u201d the official said.",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe and Russia.",
      "\u201cThis plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after five years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "Convicted Israeli spy Jonathan J. Pollard downplayed the controversy around his private meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, telling NBC News the visit was \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t done surreptitiously.\u201d",
      "The \u201cmain point\u201d of the meeting at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem in July, Pollard said, was to \u201cthank\u201d the ambassador for \u201chis efforts on my behalf during my incarceration.\u201d",
      "Pollard, a former American intelligence analyst, spent 30 years in prison on espionage charges after being found to have passed critical security documents to Israeli intelligence in the 1980s. Israel made Pollard a citizen during his lengthy prison term, and he moved there in 2020, five years after his release on probation.",
      "During Pollard\u2019s detention, Huckabee was among several pro-Israeli politicians who advocated for his release, arguing that the sentence was too severe for someone who had been spying for an ally.",
      "Pollard described his meeting as more of a social call and insisted the two didn\u2019t discuss politics or Gaza. But the meeting comes amid a growing list of episodes in which the ambassador, a fierce champion of Israel, has appeared to deviate from official White House policy as the Trump administration deepens its involvement in Middle East diplomacy and peacekeeping.",
      "The New York Times first revealed the meeting Thursday. In a statement, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem said the article \u201cis filled with inaccuracies\u201d and said Huckabee \u201chas meetings each day with numerous people and as a matter of general policy we don\u2019t comment as to the content of conversations.\u201d",
      "The embassy offered no further information and declined to offer a comment from the ambassador himself.",
      "\u201cThe White House was not aware of that meeting but the president stands by our ambassador,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "Pollard said the meeting was \u201ca simple story\u201d that \u201cgot far more complicated than it deserved.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News that he had arranged the visit simply by phoning up the ambassador\u2019s office. \u201cHe had nothing to hide and I had nothing to hide,\" Pollard said, adding that it was an \u201cintensely personal visit to thank him\u201d for his work while he was incarcerated.",
      "But there were questions across the political spectrum for Huckabee over his decision to meet the notorious spy, whose long imprisonment drove a wedge between the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a post on X that Huckabee should not have met with \u201ca convicted traitor,\u201d while former Fox News host Tucker Carlson said Huckabee\u2019s conduct was \u201cshocking behavior from a United States ambassador.\u201d",
      "But this isn\u2019t the first time that Huckabee, a two-time presidential candidate, former governor of Arkansas and self-described Christian Zionist, has ruffled feathers on policy.",
      "The ambassador told Israeli media in early September that the U.S. would not stop Israel from annexing the occupied West Bank. The White House and several senior administration officials have since made it clear that the U.S. would oppose such a move.",
      "Earlier this year, he told the Bloomberg news agency that the U.S. was no longer pursuing the goal of Palestinian statehood, which has long stood as a central feature of American diplomacy in the Middle East. A U.S.-backed plan for Gaza approved by the United Nations earlier this month restated support for a future \u201ccredible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\u201d",
      "Huckabee has regularly used the religiously loaded term \u201cJudea and Samaria\u201d to refer to the West Bank, the mostly Palestinian enclave that Israel has occupied since 1967. In 2008, he said that \u201cthere is no such thing as a Palestinian\u201d and that Palestinian nationhood is just a \u201cpolitical tool to try and force land away from Israel.\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC News on Sunday before news of the Pollard meeting broke, he downplayed talk of a rift with the White House and struck a decidedly more obedient tone.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t get to make the policy. I simply carry it out as an ambassador,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cI\u2019ve had some very strong opinions on it, but my job here is not to be the chemist making the medicine. My job is simply to be the pharmacist and dispense it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Teachers who were well prepared and well equipped may have ended a grizzly bear attack on their group of Canadian schoolchildren in British Columbia before it became deadly, authorities said Friday.",
      "Two people were critically injured, two were seriously injured, and seven others were treated at the scene Thursday afternoon, BC Emergency Health Services said in a statement.",
      "At a news conference Friday, Tamara Davidson, minister of environment and parks in the Canadian province, said that three children and one adult were seriously injured and remained hospitalized. Their relatives did not want to release the patients' latest conditions, she said.",
      "\"I want to recognize the teachers who took great risk to protect their students,\" she said. \"Their actions deserve our greatest respect and gratitude. They were well prepared, and they are the true heroes.\"",
      "Kevin Van Damme of the BC Conservation Officer Service said the teachers used bear spray and small noisemakers called bear bangers to repel the animal in the area of Bella Coola, the name of a small town and its underlying valley between the Coast Mountains and Queen Charlotte Sound.",
      "\"During a school outing, the group had stopped along a trail near the community where a single grizzly bear emerged from the forest and attacked,\" he said. \"Teachers put themselves in harm's way to protect the children. They definitely avoided worse injuries.\"",
      "Authorities were collecting evidence from the attack site to help identify and capture the bear, Van Damme said. In the meantime, residents and visitors in the area, known for outdoor activities, were told to stay indoors.",
      "\"I really need to stress how dangerous this situation is with this bear at large,\" Van Damme said, adding later during the news conference: \"I have not seen an attack like this \u2014 with a large group of people.\"",
      "He added that an incident involving more than a dozen people is \"extremely rare.\"",
      "The Nuxalk Nation of Indigenous people in the region asked everyone in the area to \"avoid all trails.\"",
      "The board and administration of Acwsalcta School, an independent institution run by the Nuxalk Nation in Bella Coola, said in a statement that school would remain closed Monday and that counseling would be available.",
      "Parent Veronica Schooner told The Associated Press that, among the many who tried to halt the attack, one teacher \u201cgot the whole brunt of it\u201d and was transported to a hospital.",
      "Schooner said her 10-year-old son Alvarez was in the class of fourth and fifth graders attacked by the bear and was close enough that \u201che even felt its fur.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe said that bear ran so close to him, but it was going after somebody else,\u201d Schooner said.",
      "She added that some children were hit with the bear spray.",
      "The British Columbia Assembly of First Nations, an umbrella organization for the 204 First Nations of Indigenous people in the province, said the attack should inspire reconsideration of measures to prevent such incidents.",
      "\"This event raises important questions about safety protocols, community preparedness and the respect for First Nations\u2019 knowledge in managing wildlife,\" the organization said in a statement that also expressed solidarity with the Nuxalk Nation.",
      "The B.C. Wildlife Federation, a nonprofit that works toward environmental preservation, said on Friday that a 2017 province ban on hunting grizzlies correlates to a rise in such attacks because the bears, plentiful in Bella Coola, have been freer to learn behavior dangerous to humans.",
      "Since the prohibition started, the federation said in a statement  Friday, the number of bear reports to the British Columbia Conservation Officer Service has doubled.",
      "\u201cWith no hunting pressure, grizzlies and humans will increasingly occupy the same spaces with inevitable consequences,\u201d BC Wildlife Federation Executive Director Jesse Zeman said.",
      "While the federation expressed hope the incident would lead to reconsideration of the hunting ban, Davidson, the province's parks minister, said it was too soon.",
      "\"This is an ongoing live situation where the bear is still at large and the community doesn't feel safe,\" she said. \"No considerations just yet.\"",
      "At the same time, Davidson said, her ministry hopes the families of those attacked experience \"healing and comfort in the coming days.\""

      "The 28 points, published by Axios and confirmed to NBC News as accurate by a source familiar with the matter who has seen different drafts of the plan, suggest that Russia would be granted even more Ukrainian territory than it already holds, and that Ukraine would have to limit the size of its army and agree to never join NATO.",
      "The White House insists that the plan is fair, and that it was drafted in consultation with both sides.",
      "Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, downplayed any involvement in preparing the plan during a recent visit to the U.S.",
      "Later on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that while Russian officials had not been sent text ahead of time, they had now received it and it could be the basis for a final resolution.",
      "The U.S. plan \u201clooks less like a genuine peace framework and more like a set of proposals that align predominantly with the interests of the Russian Federation,\u201d Victoria Podgorna, a lawmaker with  Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People political party, said in an interview. \u201cThe question is: Why these proposals seem to be based almost entirely on Russia\u2019s demands?\u201d",
      "Jessica Berlin, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, characterized the proposals as \u201cessentially the Kremlin\u2019s wish list\u201d that had been \u201camateurishly formulated.\u201d It would show that \u201cRussia can invade a sovereign nation\u201d and \u201cwalk away victorious with territorial gains, military concessions and sanctions relief,\u201d she added.",
      "Not everyone on the continent shares such a grim assessment.",
      "The plan says Ukraine would \u201creceive reliable security guarantees,\u201d a central European demand in any deal, and that if Russia invades again, there would be \u201ca decisive coordinated military response.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a starting point for something that could stop the killing, it has some promise,\u201d Mark Galeotti, the British-based director of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence, posted on X, acknowledging this would \u201cbe an unpopular opinion.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what is in the latest plan:",
      "Territorial concessions",

      "The competition was further plunged into disarray when two of its judges resigned, one of whom accused the organizers of rigging and threatened a lawsuit.",
      "It came as Miss Universe, which makes its revenue from licensing its broadcasting rights to various countries, has faced declining viewership in part from concerns over what some see as its objectification of women and declining relevance.",

      "The pageant is seldom devoid of controversy, with sexual harassment and rigging complaints almost every year. And this year was no exception.",
      "Nawat, the Thai national director, hectored Bosch for not following the promotional activities guidelines in a livestreamed sashing ceremony on Nov. 4 and called security when the Mexican delegate stood up for herself.",
      "Bosch refused to be silenced and walked out unbowed, joined by others, including last year\u2019s winner, Denmark\u2019s Victoria Kj\u00e6r Theilvig.",
      "\u201cWhat your director did is not respectful: he called me dumb,\u201d Bosch told Thai reporters then. \u201cIf it takes away your dignity, you need to go.\u201d",
      "The public embarrassment for the organizers was palpable, prompting Miss Universe\u2019s co-owner, Mexican businessman Ra\u00fal Rocha Cant\u00fa, to call out Nawat, saying he won\u2019t let contestants be \u201chumiliated.\u201d",

      "Hours later, another judge, former French soccer star Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, announced he was stepping down, citing \u201cunforeseen personal reasons.\u201d",

      "Meta announced Thursday that it will close the Instagram and Facebook accounts of Australian users under age 16 early next month as the country\u2019s landmark social media ban begins to take effect.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it had begun notifying affected users to download their contacts and memories before their accounts are deleted from its platforms, starting from Dec. 4, sparking concerns about potential privacy violations and shrinking spaces for young people.",
      "The world-first law comes as lawmakers across the globe wrestle with the impacts of teens\u2019 internet access, with the European Union also considering age restrictions on social media use, while the U.K. has imposed mandatory age checks for sites likely to contain adult content.",
      "Australia has earned a reputation for confrontations with Silicon Valley giants, with a past showdown forcing tech companies to pay for news content used on social media. The country has also weighed rules punishing tech giants for spreading misinformation, and has rejected calls for AI-friendly changes to copyright law.",
      "Meta said in a statement Thursday that it would kick off users it understands to be under the age of 16 using \u201cage assurance methods\u201d by Dec. 10, when Australia\u2019s new law comes into effect. Teenage users can have their access restored once they turn 16, the company said.",

      "The commission said Friday that its ban would include Amazon\u2019s Twitch, a streaming platform popular among gamers, but spare Pinterest.",

      "Users above 16 who are mistakenly affected can verify their age by uploading a government-issued ID or a video selfie, similar to the age check tools already rolled out in the U.K.",
      "Australian lawmakers cited the impact of excessive use on children\u2019s physical and mental health as they pushed through the law cutting off social media access to under-16s last year. A YouGov poll last year found that 77% of Australians supported the legislation.",
      "Under the ban, social media platforms bear sole responsibility for enforcement, with systemic failures punishable by fines of up to $33 million.",
      "About 96% of children ages 10 to 15 in Australia have used social media, according to a July report by the eSafety Commissioner. Nearly 350,000 Australian kids ages 13-15 use Instagram, official data showed.",
      "Earlier this month, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he is \u201cconfident\u201d that the ban will be \u201csuccessful,\u201d defending it as an \u201cappropriate government response\u201d to demands from parents rather than a top-down order.",

      "Signals such as a user\u2019s likes and interests \u201chelp the platform \u2018guess\u2019 a user\u2019s age, but they are never 100% accurate,\u201d Masood said, especially given that adolescents are the \u201chardest age group to estimate accurately,\u201d as their demographic cues are \u201cnot stable.\u201d",
      "Australian authorities have \u201cno transparent framework\u201d for auditing tech companies\u2019 age verification systems and there is a \u201creal risk of privacy violations,\u201d Masood said.",
      "Many teenagers will look for workarounds such as VPNs to set up accounts in other countries or will use borrowed accounts, said Faith Gordon, an associate professor at the Australian National University\u2019s School of Law.",
      "\u201cThe greater concern is that some teenagers may drift toward far less regulated corners of the internet, including encrypted networks or the dark web, simply to stay connected,\u201d Gordon said.",
      "\u201cThese spaces carry significantly higher risks, from exposure to harmful content to exploitation, and they are far harder for parents, educators and regulators to monitor and keep track of,\u201d she added.",

      "He added, \"We can impose further economic costs if Russia continues to ignore calls for a ceasefire. We will also continue to make weapons available for Ukraine\u2019s defense.\"",
      "But the swirling sense that the plan may resemble a Russian wish list threatened a nightmare scenario for Ukraine at a moment of particular peril, with its government mired in a corruption scandal and its military struggling to hold off damaging battlefield setbacks.",
      "Zelenskyy has come under intense pressure this week from his political opponents, who are extremely wary of any deal that would necessitate the country\u2019s capitulation.",

      "In Kyiv, the timing of the plan was viewed as no coincidence, the source close to the Ukrainian government said, most likely an attempt by the Kremlin to take full advantage at an acutely challenging time: Not only do the drones keep falling on its cities, but Russian forces also appear poised to overrun the strategic town of Pokrovsk, a key battlefield victory that could open up the rest of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas heartland to the Russian war machine \u2014 if it isn\u2019t dealt away under pressure from Washington.",
      "Meanwhile, Zelenskyy has been rocked by a $100 million corruption scandal implicating one of his close associates, senior government officials and the country\u2019s vital state-run energy company.

      "Ukrainian officials have little choice, in public at least, to be positive about U.S. efforts \u2014 Zelenskyy found that out the hard way through an Oval Office humiliation by Trump. Since then, a series of summits and meetings have seen Trump appear to waver between favoring Russia or Ukraine and then slipping back again.",
      "\u201cI have a good relationship with President Putin, but I\u2019m a little disappointed in President Putin right now. He knows that,\u201d Trump sad at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum on Wednesday.",

      "Indeed, it\u2019s not just Ukrainians who find the proposals alarming. Many European governments see the idea of ceding territory to Russia and placing future limits on Ukraine\u2019s capacity to defend itself as not only rewarding Putin\u2019s aggression, but also emboldening him to strike elsewhere in Europe.",
      "That\u2019s why the reported terms of Trump\u2019s plan create \u201can extremely dangerous international precedent,\u201d according to Danylo Metelskyi, the director of the Center of Social Transformations, a nongovernmental organization based in Kyiv. \u201cIf territories seized by force remain under the control of the aggressor state, it undermines the entire postwar global order.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s position in all of it doesn\u2019t appear to have changed at all: It is still demanding \u201cthe elimination of the root causes of this conflict,\u201d as Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday. That is: Ukraine should cede territory, weaken its military and promise never to join NATO.",
      "Russian officials have \u201cto navigate between their maximalist objectives\u201d and not risking Trump\u2019s \u201csupporting Ukraine more than ever,\u201d said longtime Moscow watcher James Nixey, an independent consultant based in England. \u201cSo it\u2019s tricky for the Russians, too. They don\u2019t know how far they can push \u2014 but they\u2019re sure as hell trying.\u201d",
      "The question now is: Will this \u201cgo the way of previous attempts at a peace process? Rejected by Ukraine and Europe,\u201d Nixey added. \u201cOr will the pressure \u2014 battlefield pressure, societal pressure, U.S. pressure \u2014 be too much for Ukraine and it has to de facto surrender? Because that is what this is.\u201d",

    "summary": "Kate, the Princess of Wales, gave a speech to business leaders and joined Prince William at the Royal Variety Performance after cancer and Prince Andrew scandal shook the royal family.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Shaken by a scandal that saw King Charles III heckled in the streets before banishing his brother, the British royal family finally has some good news: Princess Kate is back.",
      "Consistently rated one of Britain\u2019s most popular royals, Kate appears to have eased into a fuller return to public duties this week.",
      "She made her first in-person speech Monday since she shared her cancer diagnosis 18 months ago.",
      "\u201cThe love we feel in our earliest years fundamentally shapes who we become and how we thrive as adults,\u201d Kate said, addressing business leaders at the Future Workforce Summit in London about the importance of early childhood, a cause she has championed for years.",
      "\u201cLove is the first and most essential bond.\u201d",
      "The princess has made a growing number of public appearances since she announced this year that her cancer was in remission, but the speech appears to bring her back into the royal fold more permanently.",
      "\"Welcome back, Princess,\" beamed the Daily Telegraph front page.",
      "She drew more positive coverage after a further appearance Wednesday evening for one of the most joyful events on the royal calendar, the annual Royal Variety Performance, telling well-wishers it was \u201cso nice to be back\u201d at the event, according to British media.",
      "She returns after weeks of torrid headlines for the family, with the king stripping his brother Andrew of his princely title last month amid growing scrutiny over his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\u201cWhat you see and hear about Catherine is the monarchy doing the sort of work that it should be doing today,\u201d said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London, and specializes in the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "He told NBC News that the speech focusing on early childhood was a \u201cgood moment\u201d for the family, reflective of its role taking on \u201cinteresting but not directly political causes.\u201d",
      "The focus has been on anything but the family\u2019s normal load of public engagements and ribbon cutting in recent years as the royals have endured a stream of uncertainty and upheaval since Queen Elizabeth II's death in 2022.",
      "The royal family was shaken early last year by the announcement that Charles, then 75, had been diagnosed with cancer after just two years on the throne, for which he is still undergoing treatment.",
      "Relations with the media were then undercut by a damaging saga when Kate, then largely absent from the public eye, admitted having altered a family photo released by the palace. Weeks later, Kate announced her diagnosis and said she was undergoing chemotherapy.",
      "The king has also been working to heal a rift with his son Prince Harry, who stepped down from his royal duties in 2020. They met for a private tea in September, their first meeting in almost two years; William was not present.",
      "It was the king\u2019s younger brother Andrew who generated what Prescott called the first significant crisis of Charles\u2019 reign, with fresh revelations about his ties to Epstein last month spurring the king to strip his royal titles and eject him from his home in Windsor.",
      "Earlier this month, 16 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee wrote to ask the former prince, now Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, to cooperate with their inquiry into Epstein. Thursday is the deadline for Andrew to respond.",
      "Now, with Kate seemingly back on the royal front line, there appears to be an opportunity to refocus, royal observers said.",
      "\u201cThis was Kate\u2019s first speech in two years, and she looked very polished, very calm and confident, and she is clearly in a really good place,\u201d said Emily Nash, royal editor at HELLO! Magazine. \u201cWe can expect to see a lot more of this going forward.\u201d",
      "Kate regularly polls as one of the most popular members of the royal family.",
      "Her favorability rating stood at 73% in October, according to a poll by YouGov, just below that of her husband, Prince William, at 76%. The royal family in general had a 59% favorability rating.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that she\u2019s never put a foot wrong,\u201d Prescott said. A sense of affection and support for William after his mother, Princess Diana, died in a car crash extended to Kate after she married into the royal family and \u201cgave her a good platform from which to build,\u201d he added.",
      "Like the late queen, she is someone who takes her role as a member of the royal family very seriously and understands the concept of duty, Prescott said."

    "story": [
      "Two judges have resigned from the Miss Universe international beauty pageant, with one making accusations of rigging and considering a lawsuit as the annual competition nears its end in Bangkok.",
      "Omar Harfouch, a Lebanese-French composer, was the first to step down from the eight-member panel, saying Tuesday on Instagram that there had been a \u201csecret vote\u201d by people not on the official jury to preselect the top 30 contestants out of 136.",
      "On Wednesday, Harfouch said he was considering suing the Miss Universe Organization, which runs the competition, citing emotional trauma and reputational damage.",
      "\u201cI was misled and publicly used to give credibility to an election process that was already compromised,\u201d he said on Instagram, adding that a member of the unofficial group had a romantic relationship with one of the contestants.",
      "The Miss Universe Organization denied Harfouch\u2019s accusations, saying Tuesday on Instagram that there was no impromptu jury and that all competition evaluations continued to follow the organization\u2019s \u201cestablished, transparent, and supervised\u201d protocols.",
      "It said the group of people Harfouch was referring to was the official selection committee for a separate social impact initiative.",
      "The Miss Universe Organization did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A second judge, former French soccer star Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, also stepped down Tuesday, citing \u201cunforeseen personal reasons.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was a difficult decision, as I hold Miss Universe in the highest regard,\u201d he said on Instagram.",
      "The pageant, which began Nov. 5 and concludes Friday, also made headlines this month when several contestants walked out after Nawat Itsaragrisil, a Thai businessman who is co-owner of the Miss Universe Organization, chided Miss Mexico, F\u00e1tima Bosch, for not taking part in promotional activities.",
      "Nawat later apologized and was admonished by his fellow owner, Raul Rocha Cant\u00fa, who said he would not let contestants be \u201chumiliated.\u201d",
      "Miss Jamaica, Gabrielle Henry, is also recovering at a hospital after she fell offstage Wednesday during the preliminary evening gown round.",
      "Founded in 1952 by a California swimwear brand, Miss Universe quickly became a lucrative business, passing through the ownership of mostly male executives, including President Donald Trump, who owned the rights either in part or in full from 1996 until 2022.",
      "The competition, which generates most of its revenue from licensing regional broadcasting rights, was sold to Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, a Thai businesswoman, for $20 million in 2022.",
      "Over the years, Miss Universe has suffered from slumping viewership as criticism over its objectification of women rose.",
      "While the competition has made modest strides under Jakrajutatip\u2019s ownership, such as allowing married women and mothers to compete, complaints of sexual harassment and rigging have continued across almost every iteration."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Japan has been feeling the sting of China\u2019s economic retaliation as their diplomatic spat over Taiwan worsens, with travel agencies canceling group tours and fears over an outright ban on Japanese seafood and movies mounting.",
      "China hinted that it might halt seafood imports from Japan on Wednesday after it warned its citizens to avoid traveling there and postponed the releases in China of at least two Japanese movies.",
      "The two largest economies in Asia have been locked in a war of words that began when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi told lawmakers Nov. 7 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a military response from Tokyo. It was the first time such a comment had been made by a sitting prime minister of Japan, a U.S. ally that has a mutual defense pact with Washington.",
      "China, which claims self-ruling Taiwan as a breakaway province to be seized by force if necessary, has repeatedly demanded that Takaichi retract her \u201cegregious\u201d remarks, saying it will take \u201csevere\u201d countermeasures if she refuses.",
      "Though unspecified, Beijing\u2019s threats have fueled concerns for Japan\u2019s already fragile economy, which is heavily dependent on China, especially as Tokyo grapples with the effects of U.S. tariffs.",
      "On Wednesday, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry suggested that China might reimpose its ban on imports of Japanese seafood because Japan has \u201cso far failed\u201d to provide documents proving the quality and safety of its aquatic products.",
      "China resumed importing seafood from all but 10 Japanese prefectures this month after having suspended imports two years ago over the release of treated radioactive wastewater from Japan\u2019s wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.",
      "Takaichi\u2019s comments about Taiwan have triggered \u201cstrong public outrage in China,\u201d ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u201cUnder the current circumstances, even if Japanese aquatic products were exported to China, they would have no market.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s newest sign of economic retaliation came days after authorities advised Chinese citizens not to travel to Japan, saying Takaichi\u2019s \u201cblatantly provocative\u201d Taiwan remarks posed a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to the safety of Chinese people in the country.",
      "Japan, which says it continues to prefer a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue, has also advised its citizens to take extra safety precautions in China.",
      "\u201cThe government will continue to closely monitor the situation, including the impact of the series of measures by China, and take appropriate action,\u201d Minoru Kihara, the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Following the government\u2019s instructions, several major Chinese airlines have started offering free refunds or itinerary changes for eligible tickets for flights to and from Japan.",
      "The number of canceled flights was not immediately clear. Some travel businesses have reported disruption and losses amid the China-Japan tensions.",
      "East Japan International Travel Agency, a Tokyo-based tour operator offering tailored services to Chinese tourists, said tat about 70% of its group tours had been canceled, marking a \u201csignificant surge,\u201d and that new inquiries had also decreased about 90%.",
      "\u201cNormally, the period from late December to the Lunar New Year is peak season for corporate incentive travel,\u201d Yu Jixin, the agency\u2019s vice president, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBut this year, almost none of these groups are expected to visit Japan.\u201d",
      "Beijing Huatu International Travel Agency said it had suspended bookings for Japan-related tours until further orders from Chinese authorities.",
      "\u201cWe are all Chinese people of flesh and blood,\u201d it said Monday in a statement on RedNote, China\u2019s Instagram-like platform. \u201cWe will never waver when it comes to the fundamentals of right and wrong.\u201d",
      "The releases of at least two Japanese movies \u2014 \u201cCrayon Shin-chan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers\u201d and \u201cCells at Work!\u201d \u2014 will be postponed in mainland China, state-backed media China Film News said Monday.",

      "The delays were announced as the Japanese anime sensation \u201cDemon Slayer: Infinity Castle\u201d has raked in more than $60 million since its Chinese premiere Friday, accounting for 50% of the country\u2019s daily box office through Wednesday, according to data from the Chinese box office tracker Beacon.",
      "The pausing of film premieres by China, even though it is a \u201cfairly normal practice,\u201d sends a \u201cclear signal\u201d to Japan, said Hong Zeng, professor of cultural studies at Hong Kong Baptist University.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump this week approved a 28-point plan for peace between Russia and Ukraine that top administration officials have quietly developed over the last several weeks in consultation with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and Ukrainian officials, a senior administration official told NBC News.",
      "Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner were involved in formulating the plan, the official said.",
      "\u201cThe plan focuses on giving both sides security guarantees to secure a lasting peace,\u201d the senior official told NBC News. \u201cIt includes things Ukraine wants and needs to have a durable peace.\u201d",
      "The official would not outline details of a plan that the official believes is still up for some degree of negotiation with the key parties involved. Axios first reported the existence of the plan.",
      "Three U.S. officials told NBC News that the framework for the peace deal still needed to be presented to the Ukrainians and that the timing of finalizing a draft of the plan coincided with the visit of an Army delegation to Ukraine.",
      "\"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas. And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions,\" Rubio posted on X on Wednesday. \"That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.\"",
      "The American delegation arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday morning with two missions for its meetings with Ukrainian officials: to discuss military strategy and technology and to help revive the peace process, according to two U.S. officials, a European official and a source close to the Ukrainian government.",
      "Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was joined by the Army chief of staff, Gen. Randy George, and other top Army officials, Col. Dave Butler, an Army spokesperson, said in a statement, hours after Ukrainian police said at least 25 people were killed in heavy overnight Russian missile and drone attacks.",
      "A U.S. official described the trip as a White House plan intended to \u201crestart peace negotiations.\u201d",
      "American efforts to revive peace negotiations appear to be gaining momentum, although the Kremlin has shown no sign of changing its terms for ending the war and it played down a media report that the United States was working on a 28-point peace plan.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said at a news briefing that there were \u201cno such plans\u201d for Russia to meet Driscoll after his talks in Kyiv, indicating there had been little change since talks in Alaska in August.",
      "A defense official said that Driscoll has been briefed on the 28-point plan but that is not the main focus of his meetings in Kyiv.",
      "Ukraine did not take part in shaping the proposed peace plan, according to a source close to the Ukrainian government and a European official with knowledge of the matter. Ukraine was informed of the broad contours of the plan but was not briefed in detail and was not asked to provide input, the two sources said.",
      "Ukrainian officials view the timing of the proposal, coinciding with a damaging corruption scandal facing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government, as no coincidence, the source close to the Ukrainian government said, and the officials see it as most likely an attempt by the Kremlin to take advantage of a potentially weakened Ukrainian leadership.",
      "A Trump ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has led on legislation to punish Russia for its actions in Ukraine, told NBC News he was not previously aware of the plan.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d said Graham, who spoke to Trump on Tuesday evening. \u201cBut I will say this: I hope there\u2019s no plan out there \u2014 no plan will work unless [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes that we\u2019re serious about continuing to provide higher end military aid to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The U.S. delegation in Kyiv is discussing military matters, including air defense efforts against Russian drone and missile attacks on the country\u2019s energy infrastructure, and mapping the front line to help a possible peace process, said the source close to the Ukrainian government and a European official with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Previous diplomatic efforts led by Witkoff also excluded Ukraine and collapsed, as Kyiv and NATO allies viewed the proposals as lopsided in Moscow\u2019s favor with little realistic prospect of resolving the conflict.",
      "Russia has consistently demanded severe restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, prohibiting the country from joining the NATO alliance and barring the presence of Western troops to secure any peace.",
      "\u201cThe president has been clear that it is time to stop the killing and make a deal to end the war. President Trump believes that there is a chance to end this senseless war if flexibility is shown,\u201d a White House official said.",
      "Driscoll and his delegation arrived in the Ukrainian capital after an overnight Russian missile and drone attack on several Ukrainian cities.",
      "After an apartment building was hit in the western city of Ternopil, the National Police of Ukraine said on Telegram that 25 people, including three children, were killed.",
      "Sixty-six more people were wounded in the strikes, which targeted energy and transportation infrastructure, forcing emergency power cuts in a number of regions, said officials, who added that Russia launched more than 470 drones and 48 missiles.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that it \u201ccarried out a massive strike with long-range, high-precision air- and sea-launched weapons\u201d in response \u201cto Ukraine\u2019s terrorist attacks on civilian facilities.\u201d It added that it had targeted \u201cmilitary-industrial facilities and energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The Kremlin has repeatedly said its only targets are linked to Kyiv\u2019s war effort, but it has been pummeling Ukraine with near-daily drone and missile strikes that have killed and wounded civilians.",
      "It has also targeted Ukraine\u2019s energy sector in a bid to plunge the country into the cold and dark ahead of winter.",
      "Energy infrastructure had been struck in seven Ukrainian regions, officials said Wednesday. Explosions were also reported in the western city of Lviv.",
      "The full extent of the damage was not immediately clear, but restrictions were placed on power usage for consumers across the country, according to Reuters.",
      "In Ternopil on Wednesday, the upper floors of the residential building were torn away in the attack. Black smoke poured upward, while an orange glow burned though the haze from a fire in the tower block.",
      "Zelenskyy confirmed that multistory residential buildings had been hit in the city, and said others may be trapped under the rubble.",
      "He also urged allies to increase pressure on Russia to end its nearly four-year war in Ukraine, including by providing Kyiv with more air defense missiles.",
      "\u201cEvery brazen attack against ordinary life shows that the pressure on Russia is insufficient. Effective sanctions and assistance to Ukraine can change this,\u201d he said on X.",
      "Elsewhere, Poland scrambled Polish and allied aircraft and temporarily closed airports in the southeastern cities of Rzesz\u00f3w and Lublin as a precaution to safeguard the airspace over the NATO member state, which borders western Ukraine."

      "If the library system in the Canadian city of Hamilton, Ontario, handed out fines for overdue books, the one for a recently returned tome titled \u201cThe Excellent Woman\u201d would be a whopper.",
      "The Victorian-era guidebook for ambitious Christian women by a British writer named Anne Pratt appears to have been checked out about 135 years ago from the Hamilton Public Library, a spokesperson for the library said.",
      "And the suspected scofflaw, a \"Miss Charlotte Morgan\" of Central School in Hamilton, incriminated herself by writing her name on a back page.",
      "\u201cWe know she was a teacher at the school in the 1890s, and we know she died in 1942,\u201d Robert Moore, a history teacher who found the book in his late father\u2019s house and returned it to the library last week, told NBC News. \u201cThe mystery now is when exactly in the 1890s she checked the book out and how it wound up behind the grate at the school where my father found it 50 years ago.\u201d",
      "As for the book, it appears to be one of the first volumes that appeared on the shelves when the library opened its doors in September 1890, Moore said. \u201cInside it is listed as book No. 54, written by hand in ink,\u201d he said.",
      "Shelley McKay, a spokesperson for the library, said, \u201cThis might be one of the original books from the original Hamilton library.\u201d",
      "McKay said this edition was published in 1852 in Boston, five years after it made its debut in England.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in good shape,\u201d she said. \u201cI should look so good at its age.\u201d",
      "Moore said his father, Tom, was a \u201cstationary engineer\u201d at what was then called the Central Public School. He said his dad was doing some renovations on the heating system when he stumbled across the book and brought it home.",
      "\u201cI remember him showing it to us, and I remember reading it,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt had all these beautiful illustrations and very flowery Victorian language. \u201c",
      "Moore said that it sat on a bookshelf until his father died this year and that he came across it when he was cleaning out the house.",
      "\u201cI said to myself, \u2018This has got to go back to the library,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "It was welcomed back with open arms, McKay said.",
      "\u201cHe brought it to our Sherwood branch, and we were more than a little surprised and taken aback by the discovery,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked whether she had had a chance to peruse the book, McKay said she had.",
      "\u201cI would say it\u2019s of its time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really a beautiful book. The illustrations are gorgeous.\u201d",
      "While Pratt wrote the book, her name does not appear on the title page on this edition. Instead, the name of the author of the introduction, a Protestant clergyman named William B. Sprague, is prominently displayed.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s because Sprague was well-known at the time,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe had his sermons published. And there was still a stigma against books by women writers.\u201d",
      "Pratt\u2019s book is essentially a commentary on the Bible\u2019s Book of Proverbs, which discusses \u2014 and offers tips on \u2014 how women should behave.",
      "Moore said the book, for its time, was \u201cvery empowering for women,\u201d although it might not go over well with \u201chard-core feminists\" today.",
      "\u201cAnne Pratt was very critical of vapid women in England who just aimed to marry well and go to parties,\u201d Moore said. \u201cShe was encouraging women to do more with their lives, to be in a partnership with their husbands and not just submit to their husbands.\u201d",
      "McKay said that the recovery of Pratt\u2019s book has generated great excitement in Hamilton and that she has gotten numerous calls from people who want to see it.",
      "\u201cWe hope this will encourage people to look under their beds in their closets and return those old library materials,\u201d McKay said.",
      "But there are no plans to put Pratt's book back out into circulation.",
      "\u201cThis is heading to the archives,\u201d she said."

      "LONDON \u2014 A former United Nations investigator who wrote the authoritative report on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi told NBC News on Wednesday that she was \u201cshocked and angry\u201d at President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of intelligence saying Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the killing.",
      "Agn\u00e8s Callamard, the secretary general of the watchdog Amnesty International, said there was \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi\u2019s grisly bone-saw killing inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018. American intelligence said that the crown prince personally approved the operation to kill or kidnap the Washington Post columnist, something the de facto Saudi leader has denied despite apologizing for the murder by his officials.",
      "As the Saudi leader visited the White House on Tuesday, Trump disavowed the findings by his own intelligence agencies, saying the crown prince \u201cknew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,\u201d even chiding the enquiring reporter for trying to \u201cembarrass our guests by asking a question like that.\u201d",
      "Trump called Khashoggi \u201cextremely controversial\u201d and claimed that \u201ca lot of people didn\u2019t like that gentleman that you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He added, \u201cWhether you like him or didn\u2019t like him, things happen.\u201d",
      "The remarks surprised Callamard, who while serving as the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary killings investigated Khashoggi\u2019s murder and in 2019 wrote arguably the most detailed and authoritative report about what happened.",
      "\u201cI was astonished, shocked and angry,\u201d Callamard said of Trump's comments. \u201cWhat\u2019s controversial is flying 15 operatives from Saudi Arabia to a foreign country to commit a murder.\u201d",
      "There is \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that Crown Prince Mohammed ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, she maintained. \u201cAnd frankly, there is no doubt in the mind of anyone who knows Saudi Arabia.\u201d",
      "Trump's remarks have provoked widespread outrage.",
      "Khashoggi\u2019s widow, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, told Reuters that she wished Trump could meet \u201cthe real Jamal,\u201d and that nothing can \u201cjustify just a horrible crime.\u201d.",
      "The Washington Post called \u201cTrump\u2019s performance at the White House \u2026 weak, crass and of no strategic benefit to America.\u201d And the National Press Club warned the remarks would have \u201creal-world consequences,\u201d including emboldening authoritarian states that \u201cwish to silence reporters.\"",
      "NBC News has contacted the White House and the Saudi Embassy in London for a response to the criticisms contained in this story.",
      "Some Middle East analysts say that despite the global outrage, Trump\u2019s comments reflect his desire to build on the deep economic ties between Washington and Riyadh.",
      "During the Saudi leader\u2019s visit this week, Trump announced he would sell the crown prince F-35 fighter jets, treating his guest to a flyover of the high-tech planes, as well as a gunfire salute.",
      "Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s largest buyer of American weapons. In May, the U.S. announced it was selling the Gulf state almost $142 billion of \u201cstate-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services,\u201d part of a wider $600 billion investment package.",
      "Despite the lavish welcome, Trump did not appear to make headway on his wish for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, a group of Arab nations that have recognized the state of Israel. The crown prince told the Oval Office he did not want to sign anything \u201cuntil we secure a clear path of two-state solution\u201d for Palestinians.",
      "Trump has \u201calways been pretty clear that the relationship with Saudi Arabia is important to him and that he gets on with Mohammed bin Salman,\u201d said Michael Stephens, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank based in London. \u201cI suspect Trump did not want the trip to be derailed.\u201d",
      "Noting past controversial statements from Trump \u2014 including calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator,\u201d before retracting it \u2014 Stephens said such remarks should be taken with a \u201cpinch of salt.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I view this as is relationship management, making sure that Saudi Arabia and [bin Salman] feel personally supported by Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "The crown prince himself called Khashoggi\u2019s killing \u201cpainful\u201d and a \u201chuge mistake\u201d Tuesday, while offering little encouragement other than a polite smile to Trump\u2019s overtures.",
      "He said his kingdom had taken \u201call the right steps of investigation\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ve improved our system to be sure that nothing\u201d similar happens again.",
      "Indeed, the crown prince has been attempting to transform the kingdom from a conservative, oil-rich theocracy into a major economic power built on business, tourism, entertainment and sports.",
      "There have been some reforms, including removing the requirement for women to wear headscarves in public, allowing them to drive and to attend soccer matches.",
      "Saudi authorities have worked hard to wash away the anger over human rights abuses and the killing of Khashoggi, who was lured into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to obtain a document, before being killed and dismembered by the 15-member Saudi team waiting there. His remains have never been recovered.",
      "A 2021 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence cited \"the direct involvement of a key adviser and members of Muhammad bin Salman's protective detail in the operation\" and concluded it was \"highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out an operation of this nature without the Crown Prince's authorization.\"",
      "The kingdom still has an \u201cabysmal human rights record,\u201d according to Human Rights Watch, crushing political dissent and executing at least 300 people this year.",
      "Presenting Crown Prince Mohammed as \"a beacon or an icon of modernity for his country is a joke,\" Callamard said, calling the kingdom's reforms \"very superficial.\"",
      "She noted that Trump was merely \"the latest in a succession of global leaders who have normalized and legitimized Mohammed bin Salman within the international community and the international context.\"",
      "While he was a presidential candidate, Joe Biden called the kingdom a \u201cpariah,\u201d only to receive widespread criticism in 2022 for traveling to Saudi Arabia and fist-bumping the crown prince, an incident derided by Trump on Tuesday.",
      "\"Saudi Arabia is being acknowledged because of its geostrategic interest, because of its oil resources, because of the fact that it is key to any attempt of bringing peace to the Middle East,\" she said. \"I don't see that as a recognition of [Crown Prince Mohammed] as anything other than a killer.\""

      "The mystery surrounding a plane that arrived in South Africa carrying more than 150 Palestinians deepened Wednesday after the company at the center of the saga responded to media coverage.",
      "Inconsistencies involving the public profile of Al-Majd Europe, a company that some on the flight said organized their travel, have only added to the uncertainty over how the passengers were able to leave the Middle East and who was ultimately behind their voyage.",
      "In a lengthy statement late Tuesday, Al-Majd did not directly acknowledge organizing the flight, which South Africa labeled \u201ca clearly orchestrated operation,\u201d after it landed in Johannesburg last week to the surprise of authorities.",
      "Al-Majd said that its \u201conly interaction with the Israeli authorities is for the purpose of coordinating exits from Gaza.\u201d",
      "South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told reporters Monday that the flight was part of \u201ca clear agenda to cleanse the Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank.\u201d",
      "He did not say who was behind this alleged effort, but his comments were widely seen as being directed at Israel as the fragile ceasefire in Gaza intensifies questions about the fate of the 2 million Palestinians living in the devastated enclave.",
      "South Africa, a staunch Israel critic and supporter of the Palestinian cause, filed a case at the United Nations' International Court of Justice in late 2023 accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, which Israel has vehemently rejected. The case remains ongoing.",
      "\u201cWe are suspicious as the South African government about the circumstances surrounding the arrival of the plane and the passengers that were in the plane,\u201d Lamola said, adding that his country was investigating further and did not want more such flights heading its way.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military\u2019s liaison with the Palestinians, said the Palestinians left Gaza after it had received approval from a third country to receive them. COGAT did not name the third country.",
      "An Israeli government spokesperson said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201chas made it clear\u201d that Gazans should be allowed to leave Gaza and come back as they please.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s peace plan stipulates that no one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return.",
      "But fears of ethnic cleansing have persisted among Palestinians and their supporters. Israel's government instructed its military in February to prepare a plan for Palestinians to voluntarily leave the enclave, after it embraced a Trump proposal for Gaza to be emptied of its residents and taken over by the United States.",
      "'Flushed out' of Gaza",
      "The chartered plane arrived at Johannesburg\u2019s O. R. Tambo International Airport on Thursday, appearing to blindside the South African government.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa told reporters Friday the Palestinians were from Gaza and were \u201cmysteriously\u201d put on a plane. They did not have the necessary documents to enter, he  said, but wouldn\u2019t be turned back because they come \u201cfrom a strife-torn, a war-torn country.\u201d",
      "He said South Africa would take them in \u201cout of compassion\u201d but added \u201cit does seem like they were being, you know, flushed out.\u201d",
      "South Africa\u2019s Border Management Authority said that the passengers on board the plane did not indicate duration of stay or accommodation in South Africa, and did not have exit stamps in their passports.",
      "They were initially denied entry, but 130 passengers had since been processed into the care of a South African nongovernmental organization called Gift of the Givers, which helps with relief efforts in war zones and disaster areas.",
      "The other 23 continued to other destinations, the Border Management Authority said. Palestinians are eligible for 90-day visa-exempt travel to South Africa, it added.",
      "NBC News has reached out to the South African government for further comment.",
      "It was not immediately clear how the Palestinians on board would have been able to leave Israel without proper documents.",
      "Questions over who's behind the flight",
      "Reuters spoke with two Palestinians who said they paid $2,000 per seat to fly their families to South Africa on the plane, as part of a trip arranged by an organization called Al-Majd Europe. They said they were bused from Gaza, and taken through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing before being flown out of an Israeli airport last week.",
      "NBC News initially reached out to Al-Majd Europe on Tuesday via an email listed on its website but did not hear back. Its location is only listed as Sheikh Jarrah, Jerusalem, with an embedded map with a pin pointing to a building behind a hospital and the British Consulate.",
      "NBC News' analysis of its online presence revealed a number of inconsistencies.",
      "Al-Majd says it's a \u201chumanitarian organization, founded in 2010 in Germany\u201d but NBC News found no evidence that its website existed before February this year. Its Facebook and X accounts were also created this year. NBC News also could not find the organization in the register of the German tax administration.",
      "NBC News determined that a photo accompanying the \u201cabout\u201d page shows a building with the Al-Majd sign and Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock in the background was AI-generated. The website has multiple blog posts with case study-style summaries of its claimed work as a charity during the war in Syria and the earthquake in Turkey. While the website was created this year, the blog posts are dated from 2023.",
      "One of the case studies listed shows a photo of a woman it calls Mona Farouk, who it says left Syria for neighboring Lebanon in 2013, and then needed Al-Majd's help in 2014 to flee the fighting again. A reverse image search led NBC News to a Middle East Eye article last year with the same photo, which the news organization credits to its own journalist. The article names the woman in the photo as Abeer Khayat, and says she left Syria in 2012.",
      "The website has a terms and conditions page that states that \u201cthe organizing entity\u201d for the \u201cVoluntary Migration Program\u201d to leave the Gaza strip is Talent Globus.",
      "NBC News found that it is a company registered in Estonia in 2024 by a person named Tomer Janar Lind. NBC News has reached out to an account with the same name on LinkedIn. The United Kingdom's business registry shows Lind as a director in two dissolved companies and one active company with overdue accounts. None of them appear to be linked to Talent Globus.",
      "The Talent Globus website lists four employees, three of whom are shown with stock images that are available online. The company's \u201cabout\u201d section says it\u2019s been around for a decade, yet the company records say it was founded in 2024. The phone number listed doesn\u2019t work when called.",
      "The company released a statement on X late Tuesday in order to \"directly address the false accusations and disinformation circulated by parties with clear political interests\" that it said were meant \u201cto strip the people of Gaza of their freedom of choice.\u201d",
      "It said it had no connection to Israel\u2019s Mossad or any other intelligence services, and claimed that it \"was founded by refugees who escaped dictatorial regimes, including refugees from Hamas rule in Gaza.\"",
      "The statement did not directly mention the Palestinians who arrived in South Africa last week or the inconsistencies on its website.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Al-Majd for further clarification.",
      "The Palestinian Embassy in South Africa told NBC News that it was closely monitoring the situation and liaising with South African authorities to ensure the protection and well-being of all Palestinian nationals involved, but that \u201cdue to the sensitivity of the matter,\u201d the embassy was not able to provide further details at this time.",
      "The Palestinian Foreign Ministry expressed \u201cdeep thanks for the principled positions of the leadership, government and people of South Africa that support the Palestinian people and their cause\u201d in a statement sent to NBC News on Friday. It warned that any companies that \u201clure\u201d Palestinians and \u201cincite them to deportation\u201d will bear legal consequences while cautioning Palestinians not to fall prey to \u201chuman trafficking.\u201d"

      "In his first visit to the White House since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Mohammed bin Salman received a warm welcome from President Donald Trump, who contradicted U.S. intelligence and said the Saudi crown prince \u201cknew nothing\u201d about the killing.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\u201d Trump said Tuesday in response to questions from a journalist about Khashoggi. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t like that gentleman that you\u2019re talking about. Whether you like him or didn\u2019t like him, things happen, but [the crown prince] knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.\u201d",
      "Trump began his remarks by saying that he was proud of the crown prince in \u201cterms of human rights and everything else.\u201d",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed, 40, became an international pariah after the 2018 murder of Khashoggi, a fierce critic of his government. At the time, Trump defended the Saudi government even after the CIA concluded that the crown prince himself ordered the killing.",
      "Trump lashed out at a reporter from ABC News who asked the crown prince about Khashoggi's death and about criticism from the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, many of whom have long pushed for answers on the Saudi government's potential ties to the attackers.",
      "\"ABC, fake news, one of the worst, one of the worst in the business,\" he said.",
      "The crown prince dismissed the criticisms against the Saudi government as part of a campaign to drive a wedge between Washington and Riyadh.",
      "\"I feel painful about, you know, families of 9/11 in America,\" he said. \"But you know, we have to focus on reality.\"",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed also defended the kingdom\u2019s probe into Khashoggi's murder, which he said included internal reforms. A Saudi court sentenced five people to death for their involvement in the killing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said, promising that \u201cwe are doing our best that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",
      "Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, the journalist's widow, responded to Trump on X, writing, \"There is no justification to murder my husband. While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press. The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.\"",
      "The crown prince said in 2019 that he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the Khashoggi killing since it happened on his watch but denied having ordered it.",
      "Khashoggi's death has highlighted the risks journalists face around the world, particularly in areas where there is conflict. A report from the Committee to Protect Journalists released in February said that at least 124 journalists and media workers were killed in 2024, mainly Palestinian journalists killed as a result of Israel's military offensive in Gaza.",
      "The crown prince's trip Tuesday will be seen more broadly as a move toward acceptance back into the diplomatic fold.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a different kind of figure now. Obviously, the questions about the manner of his rule and internal repression, those things haven\u2019t gone away. But he\u2019s a changed figure; it\u2019s a changed moment. And, I think, important symbolically in that sense,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a global nonprofit organization based in Brussels that works to prevent conflicts.",
      "He added: \u201cHe\u2019s central to what this administration wants to do in the region.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s welcome of the crown prince was an elaborate display of pomp and circumstance. After arriving at the White House, the crown prince was greeted by a military flyover of stealth fighter jets, officers on horseback and a tour of the Rose Garden from Trump. Later, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president praised the reception that he received when he visited the kingdom this year. \u201cI love the country and people,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump and the crown prince joked about investing $1 trillion \u2014 a sum roughly equal to Saudi Arabia's entire wealth fund \u2014 into the United States, up from a $600 billion pledge.",
      "The two leaders are also expected to sign economic and defense agreements, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "Even before the crown prince had set foot in the United States, Trump confirmed at an Oval Office event Monday that he would be willing to sign off on the sale of F-35 stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, a contentious move that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East, where Israel has been the primary recipient of America\u2019s cutting-edge military technology. Trump repeated the pledge Tuesday and promised a deal.",
      "Trump\u2019s announcement of the sale may not actually lead to Saudi Arabia receiving the F-35s anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe devil will kind of be in the details there,\u201d said Andrew Leber, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has done extensive research on Saudi Arabia, noting that a similar deal announced with the United Arab Emirates fell through.",
      "He added, \u201cThat deal ultimately ran aground on a combination of U.S. concerns with maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge and concerns about the extent to which U.S. security technology might leak to China.\u201d",
      "Trump designated Saudi Arabia a \u201cMajor Non-NATO Ally\" on Tuesday, noting that the classification would take the country\u2019s military cooperation with the United States \u201cto even greater heights.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou always had a little cloud over your head, and sometimes that cloud was very big. That cloud is not there anymore, and we want to keep it that way,\u201d Trump said before he announced the designation at a dinner honoring Crown Prince Mohammed.",
      "Major Non-NATO Ally status is a designation that \u201cprovides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security cooperation,\u201d according to the State Department. It does not, however, require U.S. security commitments to such countries.",
      "The possibility of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel is a key part of the talks. \u201cI already brought it up,\" Trump said when asked about the prospect of Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords, the 2020 U.S.-brokered agreement that led a number of regional countries to establish formal diplomatic ties with Israel. \"I don\u2019t want to use the word 'commitment,' but we had a good talk,\" he said.",
      "Analysts have been skeptical about a breakthrough.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no near-term horizon for normalization at the moment,\u201d Hanna said.",
      "\"The risks for Mohammed bin Salman are extremely high if he joins the Abraham Accords,\" agreed Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. He noted that Saudi Arabia had made clear it would need some form of Israeli commitment to a path to a Palestinian state \u2014 something Israel has publicly dismissed.",
      "The crown prince's strategy was generally \"to minimize the risks to his rule,\" Gerges said.",
      "Even if the crown prince does not announce the establishment of diplomatic ties with Israel, he has won favor with Trump as one of the regional leaders who helped pull together the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Trump has long touted his deal-making abilities and, according to a senior administration official, a number of deals are expected to be announced Tuesday, including a multibillion-dollar Saudi investment in America\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge via dozens of targeted investments.",
      "Critics have raised questions about Trump\u2019s affinity for mixing personal business and diplomacy. His properties have for years hosted tournaments for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. And The New York Times reported this weekend that the Trump Organization is looking at a huge real estate deal with Saudi Arabia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some massive ethical questions in here,\u201d Leber of the Carnegie Endowment said. \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that all of the Gulf states have realized that the way you get to Trump is to find some way to enrich his family members, enrich his friends, promise to enrich them down the line.\u201d",
      "Trump, asked about his family\u2019s business ties to Saudi Arabia, said they \u201cdo business all over,\u201d and that he's no longer involved in the activities.",
      "Governments dealing with Saudi Arabia, human rights groups have long said, should also push the country\u2019s leaders on its dismal human rights record. In August, a report from Human Rights Watch noted an \u201cunprecedented surge\u201d in executions in 2025, with 241 people put to death as of Aug. 5.",
      "Still, the restrictions on women, another regular criticism leveled at the kingdom, have been eased, and the crown prince has tried to open up the society to Western exports, like Ultimate Fighting Championship matches and comedy shows, though the comedians who recently appeared at a comedy festival in Riyadh, including Louis C.K. and Bill Burr, were blasted for performing there.",
      "\u201cThis hasn\u2019t been political reform in the sense of creating space for real politics, but he\u2019s absolutely, fundamentally reoriented Saudi society and changed the role of the religious authorities,\u201d Hanna of the ICG said. \u201cThere\u2019s incredible social change that has happened partly because he\u2019s operating without any real constraints.\""
